Because if I know anything about you, the thought of waking up tomorrow and turning off your phone, muting your email, and tucking your laptop away in your desk makes you feel anxious and frazzled.\\xa0 But I want to help you take a day off without those feelings.

Ready? The word is CEO. What do you think of? I used to think of an old white man sitting in a boardroom leading a meeting. Let me tell ya, that vision has changed big time. It looks like a strong woman, a woman with vision, creating a business that serves others and creates a life she has always dreamed of living. I see her when I look in the mirror.\\xa0 Claiming that CEO title and seeing yourself when you think of those three letters isn’t easy. You might still think of yourself as a hobbyist, a side-hustler, a small business owner… But CEO? That title is harder to claim when imposter syndrome starts creeping in. In this episode, Mahisha Dellinger opens up about the start of her business, why she prayed to be laid off from her corporate job, and the mindset hacks she uses to own her title to do big things for her business and the women she mentors.\\xa0 GOAL DIGGER FB COMMUNITY: https://www.facebook.com/groups/goaldiggerpodcast/ GOAL DIGGER INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/goaldiggerpodcast/ GOAL DIGGER SHOWNOTES:\\xa0https://jennakutcherblog.com/mahisha/\\xa0 | Would you believe me if I told you that you can make money selling stuff that you didn’t even create, test, or fund? It’s true! That\\'s the name of the game with affiliate marketing, and spoiler alert, you don\\'t need a Kylie Jenner level following to be successful at it. Think about this… How often do you recommend your hairstylist, your favorite hotel, that skincare product that changed your life, or another product or service that you adore to your friends or following online? We all do it to some extent, and affiliate marketing done really, really well can be a monetarily rewarding version of you sharing your very favorite things.\\xa0 It requires strategy, but it doesn\\'t require a whole lot of blood, sweat, and tears that can often come when we launch our own products in our own businesses.\\xa0 This episode is your guide to tangible strategies to affiliate the right way AKA not feeling phony or slimy.

Katrina Scott is the co-founder of Tone It Up -- If you’re into fitness and have ever been on the internet, you’ve undoubtedly heard of Tone It Up.\\xa0 She’s a new mom just like me, and we’re both learning to navigate life and business with little babes on our hips.

It could be a time thing (who has the TIME to hire and train someone?) or it could be a trust thing… Like who could actually do the thing just as good as you? I get it because I\\'ve felt ALL of these emotions. I was gripping onto my business with white knuckles to the point where I just felt straight up fatigued, but at least I was handling it all myself, right? …Wrong.\\xa0 This episode will help you identify if you’re ready to outsource and walk you through how to start outsourcing in a way that doesn’t scare you.

And then I threw my credit card at the course after sitting in on a webinar and I committed myself fully to the program. Now, I’m really proud of the fact that I’m one of the success stories... my business flourished because of this mentor’s teachings, and we’re now we’re great pals to boot.\\xa0 In today’s episode, I’ll walk you through how one course changed things for me and how I approach taking online courses so I get results every single time.

You will learn how to escape the 9-5 through hearing the stories of other successful investors, and discovering strategies that Joe has implemented in their businesses to obtain the freedom many only dream of.'\n",
      " 'Thinking about getting into real estate investing, but are worried there is too much competition? Don’t be. Do not believe for one second that it’s too late and there’d be too much competition. And don’t think a market downturn is a bad time to start. Actually, it can be a really great time to get started; but you need to take action. | My new book is finally here: REI Secrets–Daily Nuggets of Real Estate Investing Wisdom. The book is a compilation of short pieces from Joe’s podcasts that are meant to be inspirational and educational. Joe is charging only shipping and handling and selling it only via his website. He wants the book to go to his friends that are his listeners… people like you. | The Transaction Engineer, Eddie Raymond, is my guest today. Listen and find out why he has that name. Eddie lives in Atlanta and has been working in real estate since 2005.He took a chance and quit his job before he made his first deal. Eddie had to decide whether to attend 5 days of real estate training or keep a job driving forklifts. Quitting was the right thing to do. He’s never looked back.Eddie lost big in the last recession. Afterward, he began pursuing the abundant short sales that were available. Now he’s working virtually exclusively on wholesale lease options.He can’t believe how much money people have to put down on a house even though they cannot qualify for a bank loan. Eddie uses that angle in his marketing with the phrase, ‘no bank needed.’Eddie generally gets $10,000 to $15,000 for down payment. For tenant buyers who have less to put down, he may set the monthly rent a little higher. Home values are between $180,000 and $400,000.Homeowners are usually glad to hear from Eddie because they aren’t even aware that a lease option is possible. He skiptraces people advertising FSBOs and rentals and gets in touch using ringless text.Eddie always makes 3 types of offers on a property. He writes up a cash offer, lease option, and owner financing. That way the seller continues to feel in control of the sales process.With lease options, the tenant-buyer is in charge of maintenance and repairs. They have 7 days to get an inspection or otherwise assess the house’s condition. Once 7 days passes, it’s theirs to manage. | I teach people interested in pre-foreclosures to go in and offer cash. Frans Calderon answered a call I put out on social media to find people doing lease options who might want to appear on my show.When I learned what Frans does in the pre-foreclosure space, I jumped at the opportunity to interview him. His approach is so totally contrary to my thinking that I had to have him explain.Frans is originally from Colombia, and now lives in Charleston, SC, which he loves. He was a police officer in his home country… a dangerous job. In 2003, he read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and got the message that it was time to make a change.The message was financial freedom. At one point, the book suggested making a list of assets. Frans made a list of his and realized he had no financial assets, only his belongings like clothes and furniture.He purchased his first property in 2009. The process was a bit strange, but you’ll hear how the strangeness benefited Frans. He rented the house out for 2 years; then moved into it himself.He got a HELOC on that house and used the proceeds to buy more. He also continued learning about real estate and started practicing new strategies like subject to, lease options and wholesaling.Frans spent 10 years working at Boeing in Charleston area while he continued to buy properties to rehab and rent. Two years ago, when his passive income equaled his salary, he quit his job.He estimates his strategy is 60% flips, some holds and some lease options. Frans has found that networking pays off… so much so that he is now president of a new Charleston REIA.Frans recently met a seller who was very near foreclosure. She was a single mother and sick; a woman that had hit a real rough patch. Frans wanted to keep her from ruining her credit.It took $20,000 to reinstate her loan. Frans had a retail buyer who wanted to buy from him, but had a credit issue because he was a self-employed house painter. This is the model tenant buyer for a sandwich lease option.That buyer met Frans to see the house. He wanted to buy the house before Frans put it on the market. Even though he had no credit, the buyer was able to put $40,000 down on the house.Since the buyer knows people in construction, the home has been remodeled and looks great. He and his family are very happy there. Frans made a good profit while doing good for the seller and the buyer. | Chris Kleewein has been a real estate investor for a long time. His first buy was a duplex in which he lived in one side and rented out the other. Chris lives in St. Louis and once shared an office with me.Chris worked for a while in the corporate world, but always knew he wanted to be in real estate. He remembers watching Carlton Sheets in an infomercial when he was in high school.Chris is a big believer in partnering with other investors and mentoring people who are starting out. He works with a few students at a time in St. Louis, and regularly partners with his students on deals... | I met Ryan Enk a couple of years ago at an internet conference. He’s been doing lease options and that’s what we’ll talk about today. He lives in New Orleans on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.Ryan was a teacher there when Hurricane Katrina came through. He knew he needed to do something else to make more money for his growing family that now includes 5 boys... | This will be a short episode… think of an ‘In My Car’ podcast. I’m actually in my car anyway. But really, this is a brief intro for a Q&A video on YouTube about Z-Code, my new course.Z-Code teaches students how to find leads on Zillow, which means finding truly motivated leads. Why would anyone list property there if they weren’t ready to sell?.. | I’m happy to be introducing my new course, Z-Code. This is the 2 nd podcast about it and we will address another question we’ve received from students who’ve already taken this exciting marketing class.Z-Code teaches how to find leads on Zillow. It’s easy to get leads and Zillow leads are free. You’ll have a steady supply of leads to market to and follow up with, so you’d better be closing some deals... | I worked with a few friends to develop a simple marketing course called the Z-Code. The Z-Code teaches students how to find leads on Zillow, and Zillow leads are free leads, right? Some students have already taken the course and are very enthusiastic about what they learned.Z-Code questions… what are they? They’re questions that have been asked by students who’ve taken the course. You’ll hear some of the questions over the next few podcast episodes... | Today’s podcast is my attempt to help you get prepared for the market changes that are coming. I went to Los Angeles last night to speak about lease options and am driving home from the airport now.The reason this is coming up now is I had time to talk some of the investors at the Los Angeles event. Things are already changing there. Houses take longer to sell and values aren’t going up...'\n",

      " \"Build your vocabulary with Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day!  Each day a Merriam-Webster editor offers insight into a fascinating new word -- explaining its meaning, current use, and little-known details about its origin.\"\n",
      " 'Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for October 4, 2019 is:futhark • \\\\FOO-thahrk\\\\\\xa0 • noun: the runic alphabet : any of several alphabets used by the Germanic peoples from about the 3rd to the 13th centuriesExamples:\"The oldest inscriptions in the\\xa0futhark\\xa0were found in Denmark and northern Germany, dating from the first century AD; at that time the\\xa0inventory consisted of twenty-four signs. Later, by the eighth century, the range used in Denmark was reduced to sixteen….\" — George L. Campbell & Christopher Moseley, The Routledge Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets, 2012\"Conveniently, one of the Americans … is an anthropology student studying Scandinavian rituals. His in-depth questions provide context for viewers not steeped in Nordic lore, but it\\'s still not always clear what he\\'s talking about. For instance, looking over a rune carving …, he guesses \\'Younger Futhark?\\' only to be told no, \\'Elder.\\'\" — Danielle Burgos, Bustle, 3 July 2019Did you know?The word futhark refers to a writing system used by Germanic peoples, and especially by the Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons, from about the third to the 13th centuries. Its origin is unclear, but a likely theory is that it was developed by the Goths from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy, with perhaps some aspects being influenced by the Latin alphabet of the first and second centuries. The word futhark itself comes from the sounds of the first six letters used in the earliest of the main runic script varieties: f, u, th, a, r, k. While eventually fully displaced by the Latin alphabet, futhark was still used occasionally for charms and memorial inscriptions in Scandinavia into the 16th and 17th centuries. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for October 3, 2019 is:pursy • \\\\PER-see\\\\\\xa0 • adjective1 : having a puckered appearance2 : proud because of one\\'s wealth especially in the absence of other distinctions : purse-proudExamples:\"There was a picture of a pale gent with a narrow face and a woman with dark eyes and a pursy mouth.\" — Stephen King, Misery, 1987\"Some guys get all pursy around the mouth when you suggest this, but figure skating is infinitely harder than ice hockey. Every four years at the Winter Olympics, figure skating fans have to listen to a lot of nonsense about how their sport lacks legitimacy.\" — Sally Jenkins, The Washington Post, 13 Feb. 2014Did you know?There are two adjectives spelled pursy, each with its own etymology. The one describing a puckered appearance goes back to the mid-16th century and has its source in the noun purse (\"a receptacle for carrying money and other small objects\"); a drawstring purse\\'s puckered appearance is the inspiration. The other pursy (pronounced PUH-see or PER-see) dates from the 15th century and can mean \"short-winded especially because of corpulence\" or simply \"fat.\" This pursy comes from the Old French word pousser, meaning \"to exert pressure\" or \"to breathe heavily\"—the same word, etymologists believe, behind the word push. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for October 2, 2019 is:sawbones • \\\\SAW-bohnz\\\\\\xa0 • nounslang : physician, surgeonExamples:\"After abandoning his destitute family in 1913, Brinkley bought a medical degree from a \\'diploma mill\\' in St. Louis. An itinerant preacher assured him that he did not have to be a bona fide sawbones to cure the ills of the world.\" — Bartee Haile, The Courier (Montgomery County, Texas), 19 Jan. 2018\"Anyway, his relatives … reminded him that it\\'s hard to shine shoes without a heartbeat. So he went back to his sawbones\\xa0to talk about the pacemaker.\" — Phil Luciano, The Journal Star (Peoria, Illinois), 28 Oct. 2017Did you know?Sawbones cut its first literary tooth in Charles Dickens\\'s 1837 novel The Pickwick Papers, when Sam Weller says to Mr. Pickwick, \"Don\\'t you know what a sawbones is, sir? … I thought everybody know\\'d as a sawbones was a surgeon.\" An evocative term that calls to mind the saws that 19th-century surgeons used to perform amputations, sawbones quickly became an established member of the English language, employed by such authors as H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Mercifully, medical technology has improved dramatically since then (the surgical saws used in procedures today are a far cry from the primitive tools of yesteryear), but the word sawbones is still used, often in a humorous context. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for October 1, 2019 is:mitigate • \\\\MIT-uh-gayt\\\\\\xa0 • verb1 : to cause to become less harsh or hostile : mollify2 a : to make less severe or painful : alleviateb : to lessen the seriousness of : extenuateExamples:\"Although Apple Hill receives the bulk of their visitors in October, most of its ranches and wineries are open from mid-August through December.… Last year, October traffic was mitigated by a grant-funded pilot program that brought a shuttle to Apple Hill.\" — Dylan Svoboda, The Mountain Democrat (Placerville, California), 14 Aug. 2019\"More important than treating migraines once they come on is avoiding episodes to begin with, says Diamond. That means taking steps to adjust your work routine and office environment as much as possible in order to mitigate the specific factors that prompt episodes.\" — Alejandro de la Garza, Time, 27 June 2019Did you know?The meaning of mitigate is straightforward enough: it is most often used to talk about making something, such as a problem, symptom, or punishment, less harsh or severe. Sometimes, however, it appears where the similar-looking militate is expected. That word, which is often followed by against, means \"to have weight or effect,\" as in \"your unexcused absences might militate against your getting a promotion.\" The two words are not closely related etymologically (mitigate descends from the Latin verb mitigare, meaning \"to soften,\" whereas militate traces to militare, another Latin verb that means \"to engage in warfare\"), but the confusion between the two has existed for long enough that some usage commentators have accepted \"mitigate against\" as an idiomatic alternative to militate. If you want to avoid criticism, you should keep mitigate and militate distinct. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for September 30, 2019 is:buttress • \\\\BUTT-russ\\\\\\xa0 • noun1 architecture : a projecting structure of masonry or wood for supporting or giving stability to a wall or building2 : something that resembles a buttress: such asa : a projecting part of a mountain or hillb biology : a horny protuberance on a horse\\'s hoof at the heelc botany : the broadened base of a tree trunk or a thickened vertical part of it3 : something that supports or strengthensExamples:\"The root system of one of the cedars has been hollowed out into a den, in which Neasloss finds black bear hair. One of the tree\\'s buttresses has been chopped long ago by what he recognizes was a nephrite ax, the green jade axes that the coastal people used until 1846, when they adopted steel axes.\" — Alex Shoumatoff, Smithsonian, September 2015\"The modifications to Isabella [Dam] include raising the profile of the main and auxiliary dams 16 feet, adding buttresses and other safety features, and excavating 100 feet deep to build the huge spillway.\" — Steven Mayer, The Bakersfield Californian, 28 July 2019Did you know?In architecture, a buttress is an exterior support that projects from a wall to resist the sideways force, called thrust, created by the load on an arch or roof. The word buttress was first adopted into English as butres in the 14th century. It came to us from the Anglo-French (arche) boteraz, meaning \"thrusting (arch),\" and ultimately derives from the verb buter, \"to thrust.\" Buter is also the source of our verb butt, meaning \"to thrust, push, or strike with the head or horns.\" Buttress developed figurative use relatively soon after its adoption, being applied to anything that supports or strengthens something else. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for September 29, 2019 is:Elysian • \\\\ih-LIZH-un\\\\\\xa0 • adjective1 : of or relating to Elysium2 : blissful, delightfulExamples:\"On such a balmy summer day, on this Elysian isle, anything seemed possible.\" — Dorothy West, The Wedding, 1995\"No matter what one\\'s childhood is, a seeming Elysian remembrance or a parental vendetta, the understanding of the afflatus of a poet lies elsewhere.\" — Edward Dahlberg, \"Hart Crane\" (1966), reprinted in The Company They Kept (2006)Did you know?In classical mythology, Elysium, also known as the Elysian Fields, was the paradise reserved for the heroes immortalized by the gods. Ancient Greek poets imagined it as the abode of the blessed after death, but in English the concept has more often been applied figuratively. In his history play Henry V, William Shakespeare used the place-name as a word for a peaceful state of sleep enjoyed by a mere mortal, and 18th-century English lexicographer and author Samuel Johnson wrote in The Rambler that in reading pastoral poetry we allow ourselves \"to be transported to elysian regions, where we are met with nothing but joy, and plenty, and contentment…\" In Walden a century later Henry David Thoreau wrote that \"The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life.\" | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for September 28, 2019 is:hegemony • \\\\hih-JEM-uh-nee\\\\\\xa0 • noun1 : preponderant influence or authority over others : domination2 : the social, cultural, ideological, or economic influence exerted by a dominant groupExamples:\"According to Chinese analysts\\' telling of World War II, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of China proper in 1937 were part of the U.S. strategy to pit the two Asian nations against each other in an endless war that would prevent either from rising to threaten American hegemony in the western Pacific.\" — Michael Pillsbury, The Hundred-Year Marathon, 2015\"The sweeping restrictions come as New York and other cities fundamentally rethink the role of cars in the face of unrelenting traffic that is choking their streets, poisoning the environment and crippling public transit systems by trapping buses and light rail systems in gridlock. It is becoming a moment of reckoning—and, cars, which once had absolute hegemony over the streets, are losing.\" – Winnie Hu, The New York Times, 8 Aug. 2019Did you know?Hegemony comes to English from the Greek hēgemonia, a noun formed from the verb hēgeisthai (\"to lead\"), which also gave us the word exegesis (meaning \"exposition\" or \"explanation\"). Hegemony was first used in English in the mid-16th century in reference to the control once wielded by the ancient Greek states, and it was reapplied in later centuries as other nations subsequently rose to power. By the 19th century, it had acquired a second sense referring to the social or cultural influence wielded by a dominant member over others of its kind, such as the domination within an industry by a business conglomerate over smaller businesses. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for September 27, 2019 is:cleave • \\\\KLEEV\\\\\\xa0 • verb1 : to divide (something) by or as if by a cutting blow : split2 : to separate (something) into distinct parts and especially into groups having divergent views3 : to subject to chemical cleavage4 : to split especially along the grain5 : to penetrate or pass through something by or as if by cuttingExamples:\"The surface you\\'re cutting against will have a greater impact on your knife\\'s edge than the food you\\'re chopping up, assuming you aren\\'t regularly cleaving through massive bones.\" — Paul Stephen, The San Antonio Express News, 10 July 2019\"Of course, single-item restaurants are nothing new.... But they don\\'t usually serve something so divisive as polenta. You see, the slow-cooked dish of maize\\xa0cleaves\\xa0opinion like a Justin Bieber concert. You either love it or loathe it—and ever has it been so.\" — Samuel Muston, The Independent (London), 30 Jan. 2014Did you know?Cleave has two homographs, each with a distinct origin. There is cleave meaning \"to adhere firmly and closely or loyally and unwaveringly,\" as in \"a family that cleaves to tradition\"; that one is from Old English clifian, meaning \"to adhere.\" And there is the cleave with meanings relating to splitting and dividing, which derives from Old English clēofan, meaning \"to split.\" The two have slightly different inflections. The \"split\" cleave usually has cleaved as its past tense form, but cleft and clove are both in use as well; as its past participle form (the form that often occurs with have), cleaved is most common, but cleft and cloven are also used. The \"adhere\" cleave commonly has cleaved or clove (and occasionally clave) as its past tense and cleaved as its past participle. | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for September 26, 2019 is:frowsy • \\\\FROW-zee\\\\\\xa0 • adjective1 : musty, stale2 : having a slovenly or uncared-for appearanceExamples:The lamp, discovered in a frowsy Midwestern antique store, turned out to be quite valuable.\"On good days, I could also manage super boring reality TV shows, like \\'Escape to the Country,\\' in which retired British couples go on slow searches for frowsy new homes in sleepy towns, and nobody gets excited about anything.\" — Yvonne Abraham, The Boston Globe, 24 Nov. 2018Did you know?The exact origins of frowsy are perhaps lost in an old, frowsy book somewhere, but some etymologists have speculated that frowsy (also spelled frowzy) shares a common ancestor with the younger, chiefly British, word frowsty, a synonym of frowsy in both its senses. That ancestor could be the Old French word frouste, meaning \"ruinous\" or \"decayed,\" or the now-obsolete English word frough or frow, meaning \"brittle\" or \"fragile.\" An early print example of frowsy can be found in Thomas Otway\\'s 1681 comedy The Souldier\\'s Fortune, wherein the character Beau refers to another character as \"a frouzy Fellmonger.\" | Merriam-Webster\\'s Word of the Day for September 25, 2019 is:lèse-majesté • \\\\layz-MAJ-uh-stee\\\\\\xa0 • noun1 a : a crime (such as treason) committed against a sovereign powerb : an offense violating the dignity of a ruler as the representative of a sovereign power2 : a detraction from or affront to dignity or importanceExamples:\"David\\'s grandfather, President Eisenhower, had left David all his clothes in his will, and David felt obliged to wear them…. Naturally, it would be something along the lines of lèse-majesté for him to remove the presidential jacket and vest and sit\\xa0in his shirtsleeves, so he gamely continued to sweat in the sweltering heat, out of respect for Ike.\" — Michael Korda, Another Life, 2000\"Thai law makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten \\'the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent.\\' … Though other countries still have similar laws—both Spain and the Netherlands have lèse-majesté laws on the books—Thailand\\'s enforcement of its laws may make them the strictest in the world.\" — Adam Taylor, The Washington Post, 8 Feb. 2019Did you know?Lèse-majesté (or lese majesty, as it is also styled in English publications) comes into English by way of Middle French, from the Latin laesa majestas, which literally means \"injured majesty.\" The English term can conceivably cover any offense against a sovereign power or its ruler, from treason to a simple breach of etiquette. Lèse-majesté has also acquired a more lighthearted or ironic meaning, referring to an insult or impudence to a particularly pompous or self-important person or organization. As such, it may be applied to a relatively inoffensive act that has been exaggeratedly treated as if it were a great affront.'\n",

Neglected by the world and beaten down everywhere he turns, Fleck does what any discouraged clown would do: he becomes a menace. | The Netflix series Unbelievable brings together a group of actresses including Kaitlyn Dever, Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, Dale Dickey and Danielle MacDonald. It's based on a true story about a young woman named Marie who was sexually assaulted and pressured by the police into recanting her story. Based on reporting from ProPublica and the Marshall Project, the series follows Marie, but also the two detectives who, much later, gave her case a chance to be solved. | In our fall movie preview, we will cover the ones we're excited about, the ones you'll be hearing more about, and the ones that might be picking up awards in a few months. Whether you like comedies or dramas, and whether you like to see your films in a theater or in the comfort of your own home, we're here to give you the scoop. | It was a huge night for Fleabag and a coronation for Game Of Thrones, and there were a few surprises and big moments along the way. The awards got spread out quite a bit this year, including a historic acting win for Billy Porter, several awards for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Ozark. | If you thought the end of the series Downton Abbey would be the end of the Crawley family's adventures, a new film has arrived to prove you wrong. The movie continues the story of this very wealthy group and their loyal staff. The large cast is reunited, from sharp-tongued dowagers to scheming butlers. And this time, the King and Queen are coming for a visit. | Anyone who's surprised at the big weekend the new film Hustlers had at the box office probably shouldn't be. Not only does it star popular women like Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu, with drop-ins from Cardi B and Lizzo, but it got very good reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival. What's not to like? Hustlers is based on the true story of a group of women who danced at a strip club together and later drugged and scammed some of their wealthy Wall Street customers. Directed by Lorene Scafaria, the film is already generating awards buzz for Jennifer Lopez. | Donna Tartt's 2013 book The Goldfinch won a Pulitzer Prize for its story of a boy whose mother dies in a bombing. It's an epic tale of grief, abandonment, friendship, drugs, and a stolen painting of a goldfinch. Now, The Goldfinch has been adapted into a movie starring Ansel Elgort, Oakes Fegley, Nicole Kidman, Luke Wilson, Jeffrey Wright, Finn Wolfhard and Sarah Paulsen. | The animated show Steven Universe has told the story of a human-alien hybrid boy and the race of alien women called Gems who've helped raise him on Earth. The show has told lighthearted stories of life in the fictional Beach City — and headed to space for a more epic saga about a group of intergalactic leaders, a past rebellion, and a plot to destroy the world. Creator Rebecca Sugar has said that there will be more episodes, but for now, Steven Universe: The Movie has just premiered on the Cartoon Network. | The 2017 movie It was a massive blockbuster, and became the highest-grossing R-rated horror film of all time. Adapting the Stephen King novel of the same name, it tells the story of seven misfit kids in the late 1980s, and a supernatural being that preys on children in a small town in Maine. The sequel revisits the kids 27 years later — they're now played by the likes of Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader. | Just about every week, we talk about what we're watching or reading or listening to right now. Today, we're doing something different. We're going back 20 years to talk about some of the movies of 1999, including Drop Dead Gorgeous, Office Space, and The Talented Mr. Ripley.
