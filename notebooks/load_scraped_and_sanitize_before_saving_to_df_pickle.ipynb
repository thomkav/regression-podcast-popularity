Peterson. Jamil is the author of, Why Young Men.About Jamil's Book:Jamil Jivani recounts his experiences working as a youth activist throughout North America and the Middle East, drawing striking parallels between ISIS recruits, gangbangers, and Neo-Nazis in the West.Having narrowly escaped a descent into crime and gang violence in his native Toronto, Jivani has devoted his life to helping other at-risk youths avoid this fate in cities across North America. After the Paris terrorist attacks of 2016, he traveled to Europe and the Middle East to assist Muslim community outreach groups focused on deterring ISIS recruitment.Why Young Men is the story of Jivani’s education as an activist on the front lines of one of today’s most dangerous and intractable problems: the explosion of violence among angry young men throughout the world. Jivani relates his personal story and describes his entrance into the community outreach movement, his work with disenfranchised people of color in North America and at-risk youth in the Middle East and Africa, and his experiences with the white working class. The reader learns along with him as he profiles a diverse array of young men and interviews those who are trying to help them, drawing parallels between these groups, refuting the popular belief that they are radically different from each other, and offering concrete steps toward countering this global trend.Get the book here: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250199898Thanks to our sponsors:Try Basis: https://www.elysiumhealth.com/en-us/jordan?utm_source=jbp&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;coupon=JORDAN&amp;exp=21dhttps://www.trybasis.com/jordanLight Stream: https://www.lightstream.come Toro is now in the USA: https://www.etoro.com/peterson | Jordan B.

       "      <td>Last week on The Tony Robbins Podcast, you heard from Bill Gross, one of the most successful founders in HISTORY. In part 2 of the episode, you’ll hear Tony interview Bill about his top strategies for success as an entrepreneur – including how to raise capital, the best ways to incentivize employees for performance, and what has made his tech incubator, Idealab, so effective. If you’re a business owner or an investor looking for future trends, you’re going to want to pay close attention, because Bill weighs in on his vision for the future, and tells us about the three technology applications that he believes will unlock human potential and opportunity for economic growth. | In this episode of the Tony Robbins podcast, you'll hear from Bill Gross – an entrepreneur who has personally started and exited from 7 COMPANIES valued at more than $1 BILLION each — that’s more than double tech investor Elon Musk. He is truly one of the greatest unicorn founders of all time. Bill looks for opportunities that are BIG and broken and then brainstorms technology solutions to fix them. Twenty-three years ago, he started Idealab, a company that Tony Robbins is involved with today. In part one of this podcast episode, you’re going to hear Bill’s top lessons of all-time as a serial entrepreneur, and then later in part 2, you’ll hear Tony's interview with him – where he shares his advice on raising capital, how to pitch investors, and his vision for the future – and how that affects your business and your career. | Jenny Fleiss created Rent the Runway, a company now valued at $1 billion, in the wake of the most severe economic recession the United States has seen since the Great Depression. When everyone else was panicking in 2008 and 2009, Jenny and co founder Jennifer Hyman saw an opportunity. The problem they were trying to solve was simple enough: Looking into your closet and realizing you don’t have anything to wear to an important event, like a wedding, but don’t have the budget to buy something new. So they innovated, and created an entirely NEW way to shop by allowing women to rent designer clothing, online, for a fraction of what it actually costs.  Today, the rental, or sharing economy is booming – companies like WeWork, REI, and Zipcar make it possible for us to experience something, without the cost of ownership. But to put this in perspective, nothing like this existed at the time.  Jenny shares how she and her co founder got Rent the Runway up and running – and how they grew the business to where it is today. You’ll also hear Jenny’s philosophy on how she approaches hiring talent at JetBlack, a personal shopping service she co founded after leaving Rent the Runway, which is not only critical when you’re starting a business, but also when scaling it.  The interviewer for this episode is Scott Harris, a coach, mentor and a speaker at many of Tony’s events, including his business event, Business Mastery.  | As founder and CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group and Shake Shack, Danny Meyer has grown his empire to include some of New York’s most beloved and acclaimed restaurants and cafes. Together, Danny’s restaurants and team have won an unprecedented 28 James Beard Awards – the food industry’s highest honor. But it’s not just great food that sets Danny’s restaurants apart from the rest. It’s what people experience and feel when they’re eating there. In fact, Danny Meyer’s story is a remarkable testament to the sheer power of hospitality.  In this episode, we explore the unique and celebrated culture of hospitality that Danny has created. He shares with Tony how he’s managed to scale that culture across Union Square Hospitality Group, as well as Shake Shack, the fast-casual restaurant Danny founded back in 2001. With Danny at the helm, what started as a single hot dog cart in Madison Square Garden is now a publicly traded company with over 250 locations and 6,000 employees.  Listen closely, because Danny also shares the six qualities he looks for when hiring employees – from dishwashers to executive chefs – and what he thinks it takes for entrepreneurs across all industries to succeed in business. | Next up on the Tony Robbins Podcast is the Masters of Business series, where we’re bringing you a collection of interviews and stories from today’s most respected entrepreneurs in hospitality, technology, retail, and marketing. You’ll also get an inside look into the strategy and mindset that Tony has used to grow his own businesses – which together, have combined sales of more than 5 billion dollars a year.  Stay tuned in for the first episode of the series, where Tony talks to Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, which is the parent company of Shake Shack and many well-known New York City restaurants. | We all experience fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear that we’re just not enough – fear is a common current that runs through all of our lives. For so many of us, fear rules everything and prevents us from reaching our true potential. In this episode, we’re diving into fear – how it shows up, how we handle it in different ways, and how we can use it to serve a valuable purpose and achieve the lives we truly desire. You’ll hear from Tony, as she shares his strategies on how he’s conditioned his own mind to overcome fear and become a successful entrepreneur that impacts the lives of millions. You’ll also hear from Siri Lindley, a world-champion triathlete and coach – who shares how she  overcame her fear and OCD, and went on to become the best triathlete in the world while finding love and respect for herself along the way.  And, if you’ve seen the Oscar-winning documentary, ‘Free Solo,’ you might remember Sanni McCandless, whose boyfriend, Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan – the 3,000 foot granite face looming over Yosemite Valley, without any ropes or safety harnesses. Sanni is a skilled life coach, and here she explains how she helps her coaching clients work through their everyday fears. Listen as she shares how she felt on the day of Alex’s free solo climb, and she overcame her own fear of losing him on that fateful day. | Mike Tyson is a household name – you might know him as the youngest heavyweight boxing champion in the world, or maybe by his cameo in the movie The Hangover. One thing persists above these anecdotes, though: Mike Tyson is a fighter in life – and he’s a fighter for love.  Having experienced extreme highs and lows over the course of a long and storied career, Mike has learned to take responsibility for his lows, and use them to learn, grow, and pivot to something new. His attitude toward growth and his deeply felt gratitude for all the gifts of his life have led him to THRIVE in the face of unthinkable adversity (and, at times, in the aftermath of his own disastrous decision-making).  But how? How does the once self-proclaimed “baddest man on the planet” transform into the Mike Tyson of today – someone focused on creating balance, mindfulness and a strong spirit? How does “Iron Mike Tyson” become the man who sees every adversity as a beautiful gift? Get to know the real Mike Tyson on this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast. | Conor McGregor will go down in history as one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. In this interview with Tony Robbins, he shares the bulletproof mindset that took him from being a plumber’s apprentice in Dublin to worldwide fame as the most “Notorious” fighter on the planet and the biggest name in the UFC. You’ll also get an inside look at two of the most anticipated fights in combat sports: Conor’s landmark boxing match with 11-time world champion Floyd Mayweather Junior – and his lightweight MMA title fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov. Conor also explains how he’s driven his new whiskey company, Proper 12, to become an overnight success, and he opens up about his passion for helping others and the philanthropic projects he supports. | Comedian. Actor. Writer. Author. Producer. Network owner. Those are just a few titles that Kevin Hart has on his resume, but his aspirations don’t stop there. By the time he’s 45, Kevin plans to add business mogul to his growing list of accomplishments, joining other entertainers like Oprah Winfrey and Lebron James.  Perhaps what sets Kevin apart from other comedians and actors is that he is more than just an entertainer for hire. He’s gone from being a cog in the Hollywood machine – to being the machine, by strategically building a media empire, inking production deals with major TV networks and film companies.  In this episode, Kevin shares his story of how he went from being a shoe salesman in Philadelphia, to breaking through the competitive world of show business and becoming one of the highest paid entertainers in the world. He also opens up about his own human flaws, and how he’s leveraged them to become a better man. | Abby Wambach is a legend – the illustrious and internationally renowned G.O.A.T. of American soccer. The iconic striker and play-maker hailing from Rochester, NY is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, FIFA World Cup champion, and the long-time captain of the U.S. National Team. Leading the charge for the Red, White, and Blue for some 15 years – alongside Mia Hamm, Alex Morgan and everyone in between – Wambach led the USWNT to victory in the 2015 World Cup just before announcing her retirement from the sport of soccer. She is STILL the highest all-time international goal-scorer, with more goals than any other player in the game, male or female. Abby became an icon not only for her talents but also for her leadership and resilience. In this episode, she discusses her new book, WOLFPACK: How to Come Together, Unleash Our Power, and Change the Game, in which she outlines the eight new rules of leadership. Abby is interviewed by Tony’s right arm, creative partner, and former ESPN writer, Mary Buckheit, who has covered Abby’s career through the decades.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We’re hot on the heels of the September LSAT and accounts of the test are flooding in from students and law-school hopefuls. Many folks are describing sheer pandemonium, with last-minute cancellations, madness-inducing test proctoring, and ultra-challenging logic games. Nathan and Ben take a look at some of the tales of woe and tales of pride coming out of the September 2019 LSAT. Plus, the guys get a PSA from a listener, they offer some advice about GPA addendums for splitters, they consider intermediary conclusions vs. “regular” conclusions, and they take a look at a surprisingly great personal statement.

And Nathan and Ben blaze through a bunch of listener questions in this jam-packed episode. The guys talk about LR flaw questions, they try to help a confused listener out of an LG fog, shedding some clarity on conditional-ordering games. They also talk conjunctions on personal statements, online degrees, and whether you should waive the right to review your letters of rec. Plus, the guys hear from a listener with a writing-sample horror story and more.

You send a ball down the lane, you knock some pins down, you refine your technique, you try again. Eventually, you get a strike and a few spares under your belt and before you know it, you’re the head of your local bowling league, scheduling games and enforcing the league rules. Ben and Nathan each recount some special experiences, some new and some old, about life in the bowling lane. Then the Thinking LSAT duo gets down to business. The guys read through an announcement from LSAC about the October LSAT, they weigh in on a test strategy from a listener, they help a correspondent decide whether to apply early or wait for a better score, and they slice and dice a law-school hopeful’s personal statement. Plus, learn about the upcoming Thinking LSAT live class in NYC, and hear a happy tale of Thinking LSAT friendship straight out of Harvard law.

Nathan’s been writing his ass off, responding to folks who have smashed that “Ask” button in the LSAT Demon. If you’re studying for the LSAT and you’re not asking questions…you’re not studying. Ben’s also had goggles down and dashboard up, slicing through bug requests like a demonic LSAT ninja. If you’re a Demon user and you notice something amiss with the platform, fire away. Ben’s ready for ya. But at the end of the day, they’re never too busy to stop and answer your LSAT quandaries. The guys get a follow-up about a recent writing sample fail. They consider whether you need to warm-up like an athlete before approaching a section. They take a look at an LG question type. And they burn through another LR question from prep test 71. Plus, Ben and Nathan consider some law-school advice from law school, they get a missive from ex-producer of the podcast, Sarah, and they talk more about Ben’s current read: Non-Violent Communication.

The guys take a look at a few law-school emails to see how these universities are pitching prospective students. Plus, the Nathan and Ben review a personal statement, and look at some questionable advice about timing yourself during LG sections. But before they dive in, the guys have a lil’ chat about the books they’re reading. Read more on our website!--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thinking-lsat/message | So you sat for the bleeps, bloops, swipes and taps of the digital LSAT in July. Now you’re staring at a score that’s made yer heart sink. What to do!? Do you cancel that sub-standard score? Do you keep it and trudge on? Should you race to sign up for the October and November tests? The guys answer all your burning questions re: cancelling your scores. They cover the (few) benefits of cancelling, share why you should keep your score in most instances, and discuss why you don’t need to hang the veritable hat of your self worth on this one data point.--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thinking-lsat/message | The guys are enjoying a brief reprieve from the blazing summer heat, and the cooler weather is giving them some extra room to breathe and think about the LSAT. You know, things like why the eff is the registration deadline so freakin’ far out from the actual test date? The guys discuss reports of LSAT testing center shortages and how LSAC may be dealing with the challenges “going digital,” like suddenly needing to manage thousands of devices. Plus, they answer your burning questions about writing samples, testing timing, and they share a love story from someone who decided to opt-out of going to law school. Read more on our website!--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thinking-lsat/message | We’re in the heart of summer, and things are heating up for Nathan and Ben. Ben’s been hard at work adding features to the LSAT Demon and improving user experience, and Nathan’s been working hard to improve his golf game. The guys take a break to dive into some LSAT updates for you, dear listeners. The guys give some digital LSAT updates, take a look at some pretty wild claims from PowerScore (about their own book series), they read a diversity statement from a listener, and unravel another LR question. Happy listening, and stay cool under the sun, y’all. Read more on our website!--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thinking-lsat/message | It’s the dead of summer and the guys are cutting all over the place on this adventure and that adventure in the wake of the July LSAT. Ben’s been biking through the countryside, enjoying vistas of abandoned steel mills from the days of yore. Nathan’s getting ready to go on a family vacay where he’ll challenge his nieces and nephews to board games among the giant sequoias. And the two hunker down for an episode of serious logical reasoning. Nathan and Ben tackle two new LR questions from the December 2013 LSAT and take you on every step of their thought process as they do so. Plus, a listener writes in with a perhaps pearl of wisdom about exercising before the LSAT, and the guys shred a personal statement. Read more on our website!--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thinking-lsat/message</td>\n",

She shares with us her biggest pet peeve; her experience with others typing her; and ways to have meaningful, connected conversations with people you're just sure you know their type.

Peterson. Jamil is the author of, Why Young Men.About Jamil's Book:Jamil Jivani recounts his experiences working as a youth activist throughout North America and the Middle East, drawing striking parallels between ISIS recruits, gangbangers, and Neo-Nazis in the West.Having narrowly escaped a descent into crime and gang violence in his native Toronto, Jivani has devoted his life to helping other at-risk youths avoid this fate in cities across North America. After the Paris terrorist attacks of 2016, he traveled to Europe and the Middle East to assist Muslim community outreach groups focused on deterring ISIS recruitment.Why Young Men is the story of Jivani’s education as an activist on the front lines of one of today’s most dangerous and intractable problems: the explosion of violence among angry young men throughout the world. Jivani relates his personal story and describes his entrance into the community outreach movement, his work with disenfranchised people of color in North America and at-risk youth in the Middle East and Africa, and his experiences with the white working class. The reader learns along with him as he profiles a diverse array of young men and interviews those who are trying to help them, drawing parallels between these groups, refuting the popular belief that they are radically different from each other, and offering concrete steps toward countering this global trend.Get the book here: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250199898Thanks to our sponsors:Try Basis: https://www.elysiumhealth.com/en-us/jordan?utm_source=jbp&utm_medium=podcast&coupon=JORDAN&exp=21dhttps://www.trybasis.com/jordanLight Stream: https://www.lightstream.come Toro is now in the USA: https://www.etoro.com/peterson | Jordan B.

       "2    Last week on The Tony Robbins Podcast, you heard from Bill Gross, one of the most successful founders in HISTORY. In part 2 of the episode, you’ll hear Tony interview Bill about his top strategies for success as an entrepreneur – including how to raise capital, the best ways to incentivize employees for performance, and what has made his tech incubator, Idealab, so effective. If you’re a business owner or an investor looking for future trends, you’re going to want to pay close attention, because Bill weighs in on his vision for the future, and tells us about the three technology applications that he believes will unlock human potential and opportunity for economic growth. | In this episode of the Tony Robbins podcast, you'll hear from Bill Gross – an entrepreneur who has personally started and exited from 7 COMPANIES valued at more than $1 BILLION each — that’s more than double tech investor Elon Musk. He is truly one of the greatest unicorn founders of all time. Bill looks for opportunities that are BIG and broken and then brainstorms technology solutions to fix them. Twenty-three years ago, he started Idealab, a company that Tony Robbins is involved with today. In part one of this podcast episode, you’re going to hear Bill’s top lessons of all-time as a serial entrepreneur, and then later in part 2, you’ll hear Tony's interview with him – where he shares his advice on raising capital, how to pitch investors, and his vision for the future – and how that affects your business and your career. | Jenny Fleiss created Rent the Runway, a company now valued at $1 billion, in the wake of the most severe economic recession the United States has seen since the Great Depression. When everyone else was panicking in 2008 and 2009, Jenny and co founder Jennifer Hyman saw an opportunity. The problem they were trying to solve was simple enough: Looking into your closet and realizing you don’t have anything to wear to an important event, like a wedding, but don’t have the budget to buy something new. So they innovated, and created an entirely NEW way to shop by allowing women to rent designer clothing, online, for a fraction of what it actually costs.  Today, the rental, or sharing economy is booming – companies like WeWork, REI, and Zipcar make it possible for us to experience something, without the cost of ownership. But to put this in perspective, nothing like this existed at the time.  Jenny shares how she and her co founder got Rent the Runway up and running – and how they grew the business to where it is today. You’ll also hear Jenny’s philosophy on how she approaches hiring talent at JetBlack, a personal shopping service she co founded after leaving Rent the Runway, which is not only critical when you’re starting a business, but also when scaling it.  The interviewer for this episode is Scott Harris, a coach, mentor and a speaker at many of Tony’s events, including his business event, Business Mastery.  | As founder and CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group and Shake Shack, Danny Meyer has grown his empire to include some of New York’s most beloved and acclaimed restaurants and cafes. Together, Danny’s restaurants and team have won an unprecedented 28 James Beard Awards – the food industry’s highest honor. But it’s not just great food that sets Danny’s restaurants apart from the rest. It’s what people experience and feel when they’re eating there. In fact, Danny Meyer’s story is a remarkable testament to the sheer power of hospitality.  In this episode, we explore the unique and celebrated culture of hospitality that Danny has created. He shares with Tony how he’s managed to scale that culture across Union Square Hospitality Group, as well as Shake Shack, the fast-casual restaurant Danny founded back in 2001. With Danny at the helm, what started as a single hot dog cart in Madison Square Garden is now a publicly traded company with over 250 locations and 6,000 employees.  Listen closely, because Danny also shares the six qualities he looks for when hiring employees – from dishwashers to executive chefs – and what he thinks it takes for entrepreneurs across all industries to succeed in business. | Next up on the Tony Robbins Podcast is the Masters of Business series, where we’re bringing you a collection of interviews and stories from today’s most respected entrepreneurs in hospitality, technology, retail, and marketing. You’ll also get an inside look into the strategy and mindset that Tony has used to grow his own businesses – which together, have combined sales of more than 5 billion dollars a year.  Stay tuned in for the first episode of the series, where Tony talks to Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, which is the parent company of Shake Shack and many well-known New York City restaurants. | We all experience fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear that we’re just not enough – fear is a common current that runs through all of our lives. For so many of us, fear rules everything and prevents us from reaching our true potential. In this episode, we’re diving into fear – how it shows up, how we handle it in different ways, and how we can use it to serve a valuable purpose and achieve the lives we truly desire. You’ll hear from Tony, as she shares his strategies on how he’s conditioned his own mind to overcome fear and become a successful entrepreneur that impacts the lives of millions. You’ll also hear from Siri Lindley, a world-champion triathlete and coach – who shares how she  overcame her fear and OCD, and went on to become the best triathlete in the world while finding love and respect for herself along the way.  And, if you’ve seen the Oscar-winning documentary, ‘Free Solo,’ you might remember Sanni McCandless, whose boyfriend, Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan – the 3,000 foot granite face looming over Yosemite Valley, without any ropes or safety harnesses. Sanni is a skilled life coach, and here she explains how she helps her coaching clients work through their everyday fears. Listen as she shares how she felt on the day of Alex’s free solo climb, and she overcame her own fear of losing him on that fateful day. | Mike Tyson is a household name – you might know him as the youngest heavyweight boxing champion in the world, or maybe by his cameo in the movie The Hangover. One thing persists above these anecdotes, though: Mike Tyson is a fighter in life – and he’s a fighter for love.  Having experienced extreme highs and lows over the course of a long and storied career, Mike has learned to take responsibility for his lows, and use them to learn, grow, and pivot to something new. His attitude toward growth and his deeply felt gratitude for all the gifts of his life have led him to THRIVE in the face of unthinkable adversity (and, at times, in the aftermath of his own disastrous decision-making).  But how? How does the once self-proclaimed “baddest man on the planet” transform into the Mike Tyson of today – someone focused on creating balance, mindfulness and a strong spirit? How does “Iron Mike Tyson” become the man who sees every adversity as a beautiful gift? Get to know the real Mike Tyson on this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast. | Conor McGregor will go down in history as one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. In this interview with Tony Robbins, he shares the bulletproof mindset that took him from being a plumber’s apprentice in Dublin to worldwide fame as the most “Notorious” fighter on the planet and the biggest name in the UFC. You’ll also get an inside look at two of the most anticipated fights in combat sports: Conor’s landmark boxing match with 11-time world champion Floyd Mayweather Junior – and his lightweight MMA title fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov. Conor also explains how he’s driven his new whiskey company, Proper 12, to become an overnight success, and he opens up about his passion for helping others and the philanthropic projects he supports. | Comedian. Actor. Writer. Author. Producer. Network owner. Those are just a few titles that Kevin Hart has on his resume, but his aspirations don’t stop there. By the time he’s 45, Kevin plans to add business mogul to his growing list of accomplishments, joining other entertainers like Oprah Winfrey and Lebron James.  Perhaps what sets Kevin apart from other comedians and actors is that he is more than just an entertainer for hire. He’s gone from being a cog in the Hollywood machine – to being the machine, by strategically building a media empire, inking production deals with major TV networks and film companies.  In this episode, Kevin shares his story of how he went from being a shoe salesman in Philadelphia, to breaking through the competitive world of show business and becoming one of the highest paid entertainers in the world. He also opens up about his own human flaws, and how he’s leveraged them to become a better man. | Abby Wambach is a legend – the illustrious and internationally renowned G.O.A.T. of American soccer. The iconic striker and play-maker hailing from Rochester, NY is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, FIFA World Cup champion, and the long-time captain of the U.S. National Team. Leading the charge for the Red, White, and Blue for some 15 years – alongside Mia Hamm, Alex Morgan and everyone in between – Wambach led the USWNT to victory in the 2015 World Cup just before announcing her retirement from the sport of soccer. She is STILL the highest all-time international goal-scorer, with more goals than any other player in the game, male or female. Abby became an icon not only for her talents but also for her leadership and resilience. In this episode, she discusses her new book, WOLFPACK: How to Come Together, Unleash Our Power, and Change the Game, in which she outlines the eight new rules of leadership. Abby is interviewed by Tony’s right arm, creative partner, and former ESPN writer, Mary Buckheit, who has covered Abby’s career through the decades.   \n",

       "199  Have an awesome weekend! Do something special for someone else! | In the face of fear and creating a new normal, it is essential you use your purpose to silence all of the doubt.  | You are unique and offer something no on else can! | Sexuality is an important part of life, and needs to be comfortably accessed in order to allow for complete expression. | IT IS OKAY TO FEEL EMOTIONAL. Give yourself the time and space necessary to process what you are feeling. | You're about to eat because you're \"hungry\". Is that your mind or your body talking? | Rest, recharge, and do what you enjoy this weekend :) | It's easy enough to focus on the bad things... what are the things you like about yourself? | Breaking down another positivity quote, think about moments when you failed to try! | Pain is the body's way of telling you that something is wrong. Listen and respond to these important messages.
