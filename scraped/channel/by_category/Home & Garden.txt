Water intrusion – stop the water from getting in – check the roof, cracks in brick, leaks around windows and doors, and seepage at the foundation and basement Stabilize the foundation – cracks that will let water in can be caused by foundation movement Mechanical – air conditioning units, look for condensation, mold, make sure HVAC units are working properly Plumbing – look for cast iron pipes that could be broken, rusted, or blocked by mineral build up inside the pipes Electrical – old wiring can be a risk for fire Interior finishes – only after the home is dry, stable, and safe from flood and fire should you invest in restoring the fine finishes on the interior of the homeHand carved door surround\xa0Cracking brick mortar in basement foundation walls\xa0Dining Room at the Alexander Mansion, original mahogany panelingresources and links The Dallas Woman’s Forum Belo Mansion Siplast Roofing 2018 Dallas Woman\'s Forum Events at the Alexander Mansion Girls Night Out – October 19 Craft Fair at the Alexander – October 20 Halloween Costume Ball – October 26 Trunk or Treat Halloween Family Festival – October 30 The Dallas Woman’s Forum Holiday Home Tour – November 30 – December 2 European Holiday Tea Room December 5-9 & 12-16\xa0\xa0about your hostshpd architecture + interiors\xa0principals\xa0Laura Davis and Holly Hall\xa0are both registered architects and interior designers in Dallas, Texas specializing in residential design.

According to our guest, they are! Platycerium ferns are known for their coarsely branched fronds that resemble antlers more than the delicate, airy foliage of other ferns. They have certain cultural requirements for success, but these are fantastic as houseplants and one of the best ferns for indoor success. The Plant Daddies bring a friend on the show to teach him how to mount (“with ruthless efficiency”) and care for these botanical oddities. | Not all cacti are from the desert! Some live in tropical forests, adapted for far less light and far more moisture than their desert brethren. Orchid cactus, Christmas cactus, and many others are epiphytic tropical plants, offering indoor gardeners an interesting alternative to the hot and dry-loving cacti we all know and love… And offering Matthew a chance to talk about his current favorites, the zig zag and fern leaf cactus! OK?\xa0 | Succulents are tremendously popular, as much for their sculptural desert beauty as their reputation for being hardy and tough. But when “succulent” is used to describe plants, what does it actually mean? The Plant Daddies attempt to clarify that, talk about how they grow their own favorite succulents, and share some advice for the plants most often being described when someone says, “I love succulents!” | Matthew reveals *his* favorite indestructible house plants.

Will this become a permanent fixture in houseplant collections? Tune in to hear their prediction! |  Mike and Kyle from the Gayish Podcast join the Plant Daddies to explore tangents upon tangents and maybe a few rabbit holes (well, a parrot hole). Seattle queer podcasts unite! A certain weed may have been involved... | We\'ve all seen those top 5 best or easiest plant lists. Matthew and Stephen attempt to wade through this clickbait morass, attempting to clarify (and unloading a bit on) some of the vague buzzwords and "guidance." Tune in to see how those lists fared! | Our first drunk episode! One of Matthew’s friends recommends a documentary about Judi Dench and her trees. Emma joins to watch and then discuss it with the Plant Daddies, but they drink ALL of the rosé and indulge in an unvarnished critique of this work, Judi’s garden coat, and their adoration for this peerless British National Treasure. Hilarity ensues. Judi Dench, trees, and Plant Daddy Podcast, what more could you want?\xa0 | Carnivorous plants are some of the most intriguing and unusual plants you can grow, and conveniently, many are very easy to grow. Stephen and Matthew talk about the basic care and cultural requirements of some of the varieties best suited for indoor or balcony growing.\xa0 | One of the most intriguing and exotic groups of plants are those that eat meat: the carnivorous plants! Stephen got into growing plants seriously when he got his first pitcher plant, and his collection has ballooned to include most of the common ones as well as some unique ones less frequently encountered.

Even saying that sentence out loud, it doesn’t make sense.Instead, we say, “Who made this incredible painting? I bet she worked so hard to create it. It’s beautiful!.” Then we look at it. We soak it up. We let that piece of art sink in, and we start to feel all the emotions that come flooding to the front of our minds. Emotions, memories, thoughts-- all inspired by a beautiful piece of art thoughtfully and intentionally made.That need to create and experience creation in all forms is a trait we get from our Father: paintings that evoke emotion, a photograph that takes our breath away, a song that inspires us, a meal that brings us joy and comfort, a home that creates a safe space for our bodies and hearts to grow. Art is important, and crediting the artist is far more important than simply experiencing a work of art and moving on."ENROLL IN GET PLANTY: http://getplantycourse.comShow notes (and transcript): http://dustyhegge.com/podcast/040 | How to grow a Chinese money plant in your home and all about their history.This conversation with Mackenna Rowely from Piep Co. is PACKED with planty goodness!We talk about:How to grow a Chinese money plant (Pilea peperomioides) in your homeThe history of this quirky plantHow to get rid of "plant shame"What it\'s like owning a plant shop with two little kidsHow we can glorify God through the gift of natureThe value in getting growing your communityFollow Piep Co.Visit their website: http://www.piep.coInstagram: http://instagram.com/piep.coEnrollment for Get Planty Course is open NOW!Enroll here: http://getplantycourse.com | Ready to learn how to keep your houseplants alive?

For some gardeners, this is new news. Yet, we\'ve known about the wonderful contributions of leaves in the garden for a long time. \xa0 As proof, here\'s a little post from the\xa0The York Daily\xa0 out of York Pennsylvania on October 23, 1879: \xa0 "Fallen leaves make excellent compost for the garden." \xa0 And, theSunday News\xa0out of Lancaster, Pennsylvania from November 16, 1952, wrote this: \xa0 "Many city gardeners and suburban farmers... now realize the value of leaves as fertilizer and mulching material and are glad to take the leaves off the Street Departments hands...\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 This helps solve the problem of what to do with the fallen leaves, but it doesn\'t help the raking aches." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Brevities  #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the English watercolorist and founding advocate of the picturesque landscape, William Gilpin, who was born on this day in 1762.  As an early headmaster and vicar of the Cheam School, Gilpin taught vegetable, as well as ornamental, gardening to the students.  In 1777, Gilpin became the parson at the Boldre church of St. John the Baptist in the New Forest district of Hampshire. The church dates back to the 11th century.  Gilpin was a fount of knowledge about the area surrounding Boldre Church and its flora and fauna. Gilpin served as the Boldre church parson until his death in 1804 at the age of 80.  Gilpin is buried, alongside his wife, in the church cemetery beside an old maple tree. His inscription reads:  "It will be a new joy to meet several of their good neighbors who now lie scattered in these sacred precincts around them." \xa0 Gilpin would travel around the English countryside, creating beautiful watercolors of the landscape and keeping journals where he refined his thoughts on the picturesque landscape . Gilpin filled his sketchbooks with drawings and observations on landscapes and how to paint them.  Gilpin wrote,  "In order to color chastely and harmoniously, use only 3 tints: red, yellow, and blue..." \xa0 Gilpin\'s accounts of his travels were published in guidebooks and created popular interest in natural beauty and the picturesque landscape.\xa0\xa0Gilpin\'s bestselling book,\xa0"Observations on the River Wye: And Several Parts of South Wales, Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty: Made in the Summer of the year 1770"\xa0 (often referred to as the\xa0River Wye guidebook),\xa0 brought scads of tourists to the area during the 18th century.  Gilpin wrote:  "Every distant horizon promises something new;\xa0and with this pleasing expectation we follow nature through all her walks." \xa0 During his time, Gilpin was an arbiter of artistic taste, and he thought that artists should try to find the most "picturesque" view of a landscape. Gilpin didn\'t enjoy artificial creations and lines in the garden. He was a fan of more natural-looking landscapes that were often\xa0 savage and less domesticated. To Gilpin, the best landscapes offered ruins and mountains along with trees. Gilpin\'s watercolors were created on site and he wasn\'t opposed to using a little artistic license to make the scene more compelling; adding a little bridge or tree or making a ruin ever more ruinous.  In 1786, Gilpin wrote,  "A ruin is a sacred thing. Rooted for ages in the soil; assimilated to it; and become, as it were, a part of it ..."\xa0 \xa0  A simple way to remember the picturesque style, is to remember that Gilpin was a painter and he was seeing the landscape with “a painter’s eye”. The picturesque was a view that was worthy of being painted and Gilpin said it was\xa0"that kind of beauty which is agreeable in a picture."\xa0The bottom line is that the\xa0images were designed to get your attention.\xa0  Gilpin wrote:  "Our eyes are only glass windows; we see with our imagination." \xa0 Gilpin was the first president of The Royal Watercolor Society and he is remembered for his books including one of his most popular called "Forest Scenery" which included 45 watercolors and descriptions of trees and shrubs;\xa0 and instructions for how to capture a picturesque effect through the clumping of trees.  Gilpin adored trees. He wrote:  \xa0"It is no exaggerated praise to call a tree the grandest and most beautiful of all productions on earth!" \xa0 For instance, the "roan-tree" was noted for having "glowing berries". Rowan was the common name for the Mountain Ash, also known as "the witch" or "quickening-tree". The origin of the word rowan comes from a german word meaning "to redden" and it refers to the little,\xa0 red berries.  On the other hand, Gilpin was not a fan of the Hawthorn, writing that it had ,  "little claim to picturesque beauty... It is but a poor appendage. Its shape is bad. It does not taper and point like the Holly, but is rather a matted, round, heavy bush. Its fragrance indeed is great ; but its bloom, which is the source of that fragrance, is spread over it in too much profusion."\xa0  In 1832, Gilpin published\xa0Practical Hints upon Landscape Gardening: with some remarks on Domestic Architecture, as connected with scenery,which ran to a second edition in 1835. He wrote it because he said he felt there was little\xa0"practical information" in the books available at the time. One of my favorite parts of the book is where he discusses how to get a client to support ideas for their Landscape.\xa0\xa0  "It has ever appeared to me, that a very essential part of an improver\'s duty is to explain to the proprietor the principles upon which he suggests any plan of improvement. This, during the progress of the work, not only enhances the pleasure of the proprietor, and assists his general taste, but it also ensures his future care, through the periodical prunings and thinnings which must of necessity take place." \xa0 Gilpin encouraged landscapers, (he referred to them as improvers), to educate their clients, to overcome objections and prejudices. To Gilpin\'s view, educating customers was sufficient; once they understood the general design, they would surely come around.  \xa0More quotes from Gilpin: \xa0 "The picturesque eye, in quest of beauty, finds it in almost every incident." "The pleasures of the chase are universal. A hare started before dogs is enough to set the whole country in an uproar." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  #OTD\xa0 On this day in 1777, Caspar Wistar treated the wounded during the battle of Germantown and decided he would pursue\xa0 medical training.  Wistar ("Wiss-Star")is the names\xa0 \xa0 \xa0of The Wistar Institute; the nation\'s first independent biomedical research center. Today, they focus on cancer, infectious disease & vaccine research to benefit human health.  The botanist Thomas Nuttall gave the name Wisteria to the genus in honor of Caspar Wistar. Some people pronounce it "Wis-star-ia" to reflect the proper spelling of Casper Wistar\'s last name. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the Master Collector of Botanists, John Hendley Barnhart who was born on this day in 1871.  Barnhart was an American botanist who specialized in the biographies of other botanists. Like many botanists, Barnhart came to botany through medicine. After training to be a doctor, he never practiced medicine and instead turned his full-time attention to botany.  Barnhart is remembered for his work at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) where he served as the Bibliographer of the Garden from 1913 to 1942. An amateur genealogist, his famous biographical index of botanists included over 20,000 cards.  Barnhart\'s strength was Input; he collected vast amounts of information, stored it, and retrieved it for experts when called upon. His obituary stated that scientists all over the world leveraged Barnhart for their research.  An article featured in\xa0The Nebraska State Journal\xa0from December 12, 1919 had a fascinating headline, "Famous Botanists Who Never Breathed".  "Dr. Barnhart declares that the subjects of eleven biographical sketches of botanists in Appleton\'s Cyclopaedia of American biography are figments; that their births, their names, their voyages, their scientific adventures and their numerous books, so solemnly given by title and number of volumes, existed only in the mind of some falsifier of the human record.  For instance, an Alexander Daniel Koehler, who, inspired by Humboldt, came to America, lived for seven years at Santa Fe, explored South America and wrote, among many other works, "Flora Brasiliensis," published in four volumes in Berlin in 1821-23."\xa0  Barnhart believed that the eleven fake botanist biographies were the work of one person... but we don\'t know who or why they did it. \xa0 The was another fun newspaper account of Barnhart. This one was from\xa0The Brooklyn Daily Eagle\xa0 \xa0from April 27, 1934. It gave an account of a lecture by Barnhart on the wild flowers of North America. He said,  "... buttercups and bright red columbines that once covered the countryside are in increasing danger of extinction as a result of the depredations of motorists. The only flowers free from danger are those which, like water lilies and marigolds, are naturally difficult of access.  The purplish-white blossoms of mountain laurel are generally conceded to be the loveliest of North American wild flowers.  Drosera, (commonly known as the\xa0sundews) the only carnivorous Northern flower, that trips and devours tiny insects by means of sticky, porous leaves, is a demure, deceptive yellow blossom.  The coy trillium and the strange, bloated pitcher flower are among the curiosities of this part of the world, while the airy white flower genially named Dutchmen\'s breeches looks the most nonchalant.  Certain flower names, like those of the rose and the lily, have come down to us almost unchanged since ancient times, and are practically similar in all European languages." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Unearthed Words \xa0 "Come said the wind to\xa0 the leaves one day,\xa0 Come o\'re the meadows\xa0 and we will play.\xa0 Put on your dresses\xa0 scarlet and gold,\xa0 For summer is gone\xa0 and the days grow cold." - A Children\'s Song of the 1880\'s \xa0 \xa0 "Trees enrich our lives throughout the year. They reassure us with the rustle of their leaves, give us shade to soothe our overheated bodies and they bring delight to us when we watch birds nest in their boughs.

First, they get a little time to acclimate to the temperature inside before they get their turn at the sink. Then I wash the leaves with sharp streams water and a little dawn dish soap. And don\'t forget about the bottom and sides of the pot; no need to track in extra dirt or insects. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Something Sweet\xa0 Reviving the little botanic spark in your heart \xa0 Today\'s show started with a little Monologue about leaves, and I thought I\'d share this adorable little advertisement from\xa0WC Landon and Companyin the Rutland Daily Herald\xa0out of Vermont From September 27, 1927: \xa0 Whether You Save Your Leaves for excellent cover for garden and lawn or whether you burn them you need a good rake to get them together. Here are four different kinds, all good The Japanese Sweep Rake, light and handy, but not for heavy work.......$1.00 The Wood Lawn Rake with 24 teeth, for heavy work .......$1.00 The Hoover Wire Lawn Rake is much favored at ....... 75c The Brume Rake with flat steel teeth, shaped like the Japanese Sweep, priced at .......$1.00 \xa0 So, there you go. That\'s a sweet, little summary of Rake options in Vermont in 1927. \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | I always write down little things the kids say that strike me as funny or\xa0 sweet.  Here\'s a little blast from my past on this day in 2010:  At bedtime tonight, PJ told me he wanted to bring cold lunch to school. \xa0I told him no because we have paid for hot lunch. \xa0(Apparently many kids in his class bring cold lunch.) \xa0I told him that they probably bring cold lunch because they have allergies and their mommies don\'t want them to get sick. So, then PJ told me he had allergies too... he said "I\'m allergic to pumpkins". \xa0  I said "really." \xa0 He said yes. \xa0  I said "Well then you won\'t have fun on Halloween because there are pumpkins all over that night". \xa0  LONG PAUSE while his jaw drops. \xa0Heavy sigh.  "You caught me mom. \xa0I was just trying to trick you."  Pumpkin allergies... at the time I thought that was a made-up thing.  While this story is super sweet, there are folks who are actually allergic to pumpkin. Typically, they are allergic to the seeds.  That said, other parts of the pumpkin can negatively effect the body. People with allergies who touch the pulp or the seeds can get dermatitis or even hives.  If they smell pumpkin cooking, sensitive people can have an allergic response from the vapors.  And, kids with pumpkin allergy can feel sick just from carving a pumpkin. Uninformed parents can easily dismiss coughing and wheezing during pumpkin carving time as signs of a cold.  Thanks to Starbucks and other retailers, our society goes a little crazy for all things Pumpkin Spice this time of year - the Pumpkin Spice Latte actually has a little pumpkin puree in it. But just know, there is such a thing as pumpkin allergy and be sensitive to folks have it. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Brevities \xa0 #OTD\xa0 Today is the anniversary of the death of the botanist Luis Nee who died on this day in 1807.  Luis Née was a Frenchman living in Spain. He worked at the Madrid botanic garden and he botanized in the mountain ranges of Spain.  Nee went on an expedition to South America in 1789. When he collected in Chile, he discovered the Lapageria rosea which is now the national flower of Chile. Lapageria rosea plants, are also known as Chilean bellflowers. They are named after the Empress Josephine Lapagerie, wife of Napoleon Bonaparte. \xa0 \xa0  #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the German botanist, Frederick Lueders, who was born on this day in 1813.  On November 13, 1843 Lueders was botanizing along the Columbia river in Oregon. He\'d been collecting specimens for three years. He had just encountered the explorer John Freemont, when all of his work, which was secured in a canoe nearby, was drawn into the rapids. Lueders plunged into the river and managed to retrieve only a copy of the Flora by Torrey and Gray.  The devastating loss was recorded in Freemont\'s journal who wrote:  "In the natural concern I felt for his misfortune, I gave to the little cove the name of Lueders\' Bay."  For Lueders part, the loss of his specimens was devastating. However the loss of his instruments and his correspondence with Asa Gray and Dr. Englemann was almost too great. Lueders\xa0 determined his best course of action was to return home. He traveled south around the tip of Chile and then onto England. It took him a year to return to Hamburg a year after his mishap on the Columbia.  Lueders didn\'t stay in Germany long. In fact,\xa0 he returned to America within the next year. By 1851, he had made his way to Wisconsin; he spent the rest of his life in Sauk City and he dabbled in astronomy.\xa0 A biographical sketch said that in his old age, Lueders was devoted largely to his flowers. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 #OTD\xa0 On this day in 1807, the botanist Frederick Pursch visited\xa0David Hosack.  Hosack was happy to have Pursch collect specimens from all around the United States for him. He wrote, "I shall\xa0have a very industrious and skillful botanist [begin] to\xa0collect from different parts of the Union." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 #OTD\xa0 On this day in 1856 John Torrey\'s Office at the Mint was described in the NY Daily Times.  When Torrey was 57, he made the decision to leave Princeton after 24 years of teaching botany and he went to work for the Mint; it would be the last step in his long career.  The description of the room where the bullion was measured is quite fascinating. It said:  "During the process of ... gold and silver are... weighed on ... scales. Floors are covered with iron gratings which are removed at stated periods, flooring beneath carefully swept and particles of precious metal separated from the dust."  Torrey \'s quality of life improved while he worked at the Mint; he could leave work by 3pm and be home in time to work in his herbarium a couple of hours before dinner. \xa0   \xa0 #OTD On this day in 1883, Charles Sprague Sargent\xa0 wrote to Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker with an update on the Arnold Arboretum:  “The Arboretum is getting on at last. ..Roads, belts, grades, etc. are making grand progress & I really begin to see daylight ahead. We have in the nurseries an immense stock of plants &certainly the largest number of living species ever collected togetheron this side of the ocean.” ’\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Unearthed Words \xa0 From the Poetical Birthday Book for October 3rd, from 1887:  "Her lips like foxgloves, pink and pale, Went sighing like an autumn gale; Yet, When the sunlight passed by, They opened out with half a sigh. Her smile, the last faint vesper light As swoons the eve to sleep away, Remaining through the summer night A lamp of love by which to pray.  ~ Meta Orred, English Author & Poet   All will pass like smoke of white apple trees Seized by the gold of autumn.

Put your cactus through a mandatory dry spell for the next 30 days for better bud set. So, don\'t water it until the first week in November. Here\'s a few other tips to help you with your\xa0 Christmas Cactus:   They will blossom longer if they are exposed to only cooler temperatures. For best results, keep your Christmas cactus in a cool place - not by the fireplace and not by a drafty door. They like to be on a sunny windowsill. They need sleep. Like poinsettia, they benefit from 14 hours of darkness each night. They don\'t like to be watered very often - but they do like a little mist every day. Ok then.  \xa0 \xa0  Something Sweet\xa0 Reviving the little botanic spark in your heart \xa0 #OTD Today is the anniversary of the death of George Dexter Butler who died on this day in 1910.  Butler was born in 1850 in Grundy County,\xa0 Illinois. He grew up in Iowa. Like many, he ended\xa0 up going West California.\xa0  In 1896, he was admitted\xa0the bar in California and then he began the practice of law. And, then, here\'s the part from the Madrono Vol. 1, No. 13 from November, 1928, that got my attention:  "George Butler\'s passion for botany had always been such that he did not dare trust it. Therefore, on coming to California he determined to let the science of botany entirely alone. If he gave himself to it at all he feared that his proper profession as a lawyer would\xa0be largely or too much neglected and that his first obligation, the\xa0support and education of his family, would suffer.  [When his old friend, Dr. Engelmann wrote him]\xa0\xa0he was much puzzled\xa0in mind as to what he should do...\xa0The letter, therefore, he deliberately ignored. In 1906 he chanced to be in\xa0a bookshop in Oakland where\xa0his eye caught sight of a second-hand copy of Jepson\'s Flora."  The time for botany had come. He quickly made up for lost time and he went collecting in every direction. He built a herbarium on his property, he started buying floras, and he worked like crazy on building his collections. What he was really hoping to do was to build a\xa0county herbarium.  But, sadly, on this day in 1910, Butler had a stroke and passed away.  After Butler died, his herbarium was given as a gift to the University of California. At the time, it was regarded as the most complete flora of Siskiyou County.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0   Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | Today is National Pumpkin Seed Day.  Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are native to the Americas. They were discovered by archaeologists in Mexico in caves that date back to 7,000 B.C.  Today, China produces more pumpkins and pumpkin seeds than any other country.\xa0  Pumpkin seeds are loaded with protein; a single cup provides 8-10 grams of protein. They are packed with nutrients and they are overall very good for your health.\xa0  Next time you are whipping up a batch of protein bites; don\'t forget pumpkin seeds.  Just mix up dates, whole nuts, chia seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, pistachios, almonds, pumpkin seeds, 1tsp cacao bio powder, 1tsp peanut butter, a handful of raisins and dried cranberries. Then press the mixture into a pan and slice into bars. Couldn\'t be simpler. \xa0   \xa0 Brevities  #OTD \xa0Today is the birthday of the German botanist known as the Father of Plant Physiology, Julius von Sachs, who was born on this day in 1832.\xa0\xa0  In the 1860\'s, Sachs tested adding a variety of nutrients to plants growing in water. He was trying to determine what plants need to live. It was early, early efforts on modern day hydroponics.  In 1864, Sachs determined that blue light is the most important color for inducing phototropism in plants. Plants are generally blind to other colors; which is why you don\'t see plants bending toward the lamps inside your house; unless you are using grow-lights! \xa0 In 1868, Sachs became Head of the botanical institute at Würzburg University.\xa0 Sachs was a good friend of Frank Darwin. When Darwin needed a lab to conduct his experiments plants of growing toward light, he naturally used the world-class lab of his friend, Julius von Sachs, at Würzburg U. \xa0 Sachs himself was studying how plants process light. He correctly identified that starch was a product of the sunlight process known as photosynthesis. He proved that chlorophyll in chloroplast is involved in photosynthesis. Sachs is responsible for identifying structures like the organelle and chloroplasts.\xa0 \xa0 Sachs used some ingenuity helped him come up with things like planter boxes with one glass side so that he could better understand the formation of roots. Using a magnifying glass, he could discern the development of root hairs and cellular protrusions. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0  #OTD\xa0 On this day in 1836, the HMS Beagle returned to England after a five year voyage around the world.\xa0  It was a revelatory trip for ship’s naturalist, Charles Darwin, who found the building blocks to his evolutionary theory in the many fossils and diverse species he discovered on his excursions. It would be another 23 years before he published the Origin of Species. Often, Darwin is depicted on the Beagle as an old man; but he was just 22 when he sailed away and still a young 27 when he returned with boxes full of specimens and a brain swirling with new ideas. \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 #OTD \xa0Today is the 165th birthday of the Father of Town Planning and a botanist, Patrick Geddes, who was born on this day in 1854.  Geddes accomplished much during his lifetime, despite being notoriously disorganized and easily distracted. In addition to his work in planning, Geddes was an ardent botanist and an environmentalist.  People often forget that Geddes was trained most in the subjects of biology and botany; it was through that living scientific lens that he was first inclined to view the world. Geddes always conceded an undeniable truth in his work; nature is ever-changing and humans need to be in nature. Geddes had a profound appreciation and reverence for life. Like any gardener; he saw value in beauty.  Geddes wrote:  "No one who studies animate nature can get past the fact of beauty. It is as real in its own way as the force of gravity."  When it came to planning towns, Geddes dismissed modernist plans for creating what he called "soulless suburbs and concrete slums". Instead, the ever-practical Geddes bought land in Edinburgh and created communities interwoven into the landscape. Bare spots on plans were turned into spaces for gardens.  In 1918, Geddes delivered a farewell lecture to his students at Dundee. Here\'s is a little excerpt from this powerful speech:  "How many people think twice about a leaf? Yet the leaf is the chief product and phenomenon of life. This is a green world.... and all dependent upon the leaves... The world is mainly a vast leaf-colony, growing on and forming a leafy soil, ... and we live not by the jingling of our coins, but by the fullness of our harvests. \xa0 ...Growth seems slow... and people are all out for immediate results...\xa0 A garden takes years and years to grow – ideas also take time to grow, and while a sower knows when his corn will ripen, the sowing of ideas is, as yet, a far less certain affair. \xa0 Star-wonder, stone and spark wonder, life-wonder, folk-wonder, .... To appreciate sunset and sunrise, moon and stars, the wonders of the winds, clouds and rain, the beauty of woods and fields – here are the beginnings of natural sciences. \xa0 ...[And] we must cease to think merely in terms of separated departments and faculties... So - with art inspiring industry, .... the Tree of Life thus comes into view. \xa0 \xa0  \xa0  #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of Martha Brookes Hutcheson who was born on this day in 1871.  When she was born, Landscape Architecture was a babe as well; being a newly established professional field. \xa0 Two decades later, in 1902, when Martha Brooks Hutcheson joined the ranks of the profession after graduating from MIT, she became one of America’s first professional female landscape architects. \xa0 Hutcheson wrote a book called "The Spirit of the Garden"\xa0(a complete copy is available online for free here).  In the book, Hutcheson poured all of her cultivated expertise; it became an instant garden classic. Hutcheson wanted Landscape Architecture concepts to be available to everyone; not just the wealthy. And, she wanted plants and trees to grace every living space; in rural areas, cities, and especially the areas surrounding schools.\xa0 \xa0 For half a century - until 1959, Hutcheson and her husband, William, lived at Merchiston farm. There are many native plants and water is a vital landscape element.\xa0 \xa0 It was Martha Brookes Hutcheson, who said: \xa0 “An insight into ecology enables us to recognize plants as living things - with laws governing their needs in their associations. Without this, we recognize plants only as a florist might who fills his windows with lavish displays.” \xa0 Hutcheson\'s personal interest in ecological systems, led her to dam a small stream on her farm in order to create a cow pond which later became a round swimming pond in the center of her garden. She and her visitors swam in the pond and shared it with wildlife. \xa0 Despite her struggles to break down barriers for her profession and for women, Hutcheson found comfort, "tranquility and intense personal calm" in her gardens. She wrote: \xa0 "So, let us all have gardens, for we shall be but following in the footsteps of those past ages, and expressing the love of gardens that has been in our hearts for generations." \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 Unearthed Words  Today is the birthday of the American poet, Wallace Stevens, who was born on this day on this day in 1879.\xa0  Stevens grew up to be an insurance agent in Hartford, Connecticut and he lived across the street from Elizabeth Park which contains one of the three largest rose gardens in the country on 102 acres of incredible beauty.  You can tell from much of his poetry that Stevens was a lover of nature and gardens.  Thus, an insurance man by day and a poet by night, Wallace Stevens wrote all of the following:  “Perhaps the truth depends on a walk around the lake.” “Death is the mother of beauty. Only the perishable can be beautiful, which is why we are unmoved by artificial flowers.” "Moisture and heat have swollen the garden into a slum of bloom." “I certainly do not exist from nine to six, when I am at the office.” \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0   Today\'s book recommendation: Heirloom Vegetable Gardening by William Woys Weaver  This is an updated edition of the classic has been improved throughout with growing zones, advice, and new plant entries. Now, instead of line art, there is lush, full-color photography.\xa0 At the heart of this book are the heirlooms; the living history of gardens and kitchens of our past. For many people, heirlooms are stories. They are gifts; something special to pass down through the generations.  For instance, one of the heirlooms I have fallen head over heels for, is the Nanticoke Winter Pumpkin. Imagine a pumpkin almost the color of a robin\'s egg with crêpey looking blisters over the skin and you have something extra special from your garden for Autumn. And, that\'s only a taste of the marvelous plants and produce featured in this wonder new edition. It\'s an heirloom encyclopedia and it\'s a keeper. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 Today\'s Garden Chore  Check your rhubarb to see if you want to make a quick last-minute division.  I just did this after another visit to the cabin. I decided it would be lovely to walk out back by the lake in the early morning and cut some stalks for strawberry rhubarb muffins for a weekend brunch or for some rhubarb bars to enjoy with a cup of coffee. The point is, rhubarb can handle a division even though it\'s early October. Welcome to lake life rhubarb! \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 Something Sweet\xa0 Reviving the little botanic spark in your heart  I ran across two old gems for you today.  The first one is a saying that was published on this day in 1940 in\xa0The Phoenix Star\xa0 \xa0at the beginning of a little bedtime story called "What the Old Naturalist Told". I thought it was so lovely and I couldn\'t find it anywhere on line - so here it is (short and sweet):\xa0  A story\'s writ on every stone, In every stick and leaf and bone. ~ Old Mother Nature\xa0  The second one is from the Chicago Tribune on this day in 1875. It was a little article, fittingly called "Sparks of Science."  "Plants are tender as little children, and suffer quickly from any irregularity of diet and habit. Above all, they must not be kept awake late at night by bright gaslights burning around them. They, like human beings, need rest and sleep, and, when Nature puts out her great light with the dotting of the sun, it is time for them close their eyes and fold their leaves; or, if they do not all actually do this, they must, at least, enjoy the opportunity darkness affords ...  How often the question is asked of the lady who has flourishing plants in her window: "How do you manage to make them look so well ?" "I don\'t know.’’ is the reply; "I only do what others do,” and yet she is inwardly conscious that it is the love animating her care of them that inspires their thrifty growth." \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | Today is International Coffee Day.  There is a legend that tells of coffee\'s discovery:  In Ethiopia, there was a goat herd who observed his goats didn\'t want to go to sleep at night after eating berries from a certain tree. After he reported this to the Abbot of a local monastery, the Abbott gathered the berries himself and then made a drink with them. The Abbott\'s discovered the drink kept him awake and alert for the long hours of evening prayers. The rest is history.   The coffee plant is actually a shrub. It\'s an evergreen that has a light gray bark and shiny, dark leaves that are five inches long. If the coffee plant wasn\'t pruned back, it could grow up to thirty feet tall in the wild.  It takes the coffee plant five years to be able to produce fruit. Coffee plants have an interesting life cycle; they can live to be 100 years old but their producing years are between the ages of 7 and 20.\xa0 And, the next time you think about the equator, reframe it as "The Bean Belt". Coffee plants grow best along the equator. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Brevities  #OTD\xa0 Today is the anniversary of the death of the “Dean of Landscape Architects”, Jens Jensen, who died on this day in 1860. Jens Jensen was featured in The Living Green Documentary; he was an early pioneer in the conservation movement and used art as activism. He was ahead of his time.  Jensen and Frank Lloyd Wright were contemporaries.  Jensen made over 600 Landscapes and was known as the "Poet of the Prairie." The prairie was the theme of his work and Jensen likened the prairie to the sea. He felt there was a spiritualism that rose out of the long grass and that every person on earth needed the living green. He valued the natural lands and he recognized that nature had restorative powers.  Jensen was a maker of public parks and spaces.\xa0  Later in life, Jensen moved his family into a remote part of Wisconsin called Ellison Bay; located in northern door county. Even in 2010, the population was just 165.  It was Jens Jensen who said, "Where there is forest, there is peace." and “Trees are much like human beings and enjoy each other\'s company. Only a few love to be alone.” \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of California plant collector, LeRoy Abrams, who was born on this day in 1874.\xa0  Abrams was born in Sheffield Iowa. He moved west with his parents as a small boy. As a graduate student, Abrams performed yeoman\'s work botanizing the area around Los Angeles. A biographical sketch of Abrams said,  "[Abrams] criss-crossed southern California in a wagon, on the back of a mule or burrow, and on foot to make field observations... and collect specimens from Santa Barbara to Yuma, from Needles to San Diego, and from the Salton Sink prior to its flooding to the summits of Old Baldy" In 1902, Abrams published a flora of Los Angeles and Vicinity. (The vicinity included a fifty mile radius around LA).  In 1909, Abrams married a fellow student at Stanford. Her name was Letitia Patterson; they shared everything together - especially the joys of their mountain cabin they had built with their own hands on the west side of Fallen Leaf Lake. When their only daughter died a few short years after her college graduation, they shouldered their grief together.  Abrams served as the director of the Natural History museum at Stanford where he taught botany for thirty-four years. He did not live to see the completion of his dream; a four volume work called\xa0An Illustrated Flora of the Pacific States(Stanford, Stanford University Press, 1923–1960, 4 vols.). However, it was Abrams dream to carry out; he had been inspired by the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) and their three-volume work,\xa0An Illustrated Flora of the Northern United States, Canada and the British Possessions,by Britton and Brown.\xa0  Abrams was a loving teacher. His students called him "Father." \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 #OTD On this day in 1887, the botanists John and Harvey Ruth made a trip to Wyker\'s Island to collect fall flora.  Wyker\'s Island is now known as Lynn Island, in the Delaware River, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The Ruth\'s rowed their own boat to the island on this day in 1887, where they discovered the island was covered with asters and butterfly weed. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  #OTD On this day in 1891, the newspapers carried the obituary of the self-taught botanist and poet, Cyrus M. Tracy who had died on September 29th.  Tracy was the Chair of Botany for the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. He is remembered for his work in creating the noble forest park known as Lynn Woods. Three times the size of Central Park, Lynn Woods is a massive green space located outside of Boston. A hidden gem, Lynn Woods enjoys less public awareness because it is not part of our National State Park system. It features a rose garden, three reservoirs and a 48-foot-tall stone tower.  In 1850, Tracy was working to secure protection for Lynn Woods and he formed a group called the "Exploring Circle" with four other residents; the went botanizing in the woods and then shared their discoveries with others. When Tracy wrote his Studies of the Essex Flora - a flora of the area around Boston - he recognized the immeasurable value of Lynn Woods, saying "that a district so near the metropolis" was worth protecting.  In 1891, when Lynn Woods was threatened by development, a Commission report noted Tracy\'s role in protecting the park:  "His call, his inner inspiration was to teach the people of Lynn that they had in the Woods "an\xa0asylum of inexhaustible pleasures." ... He led\xa0parties of enthusiastic naturalists to scenes of\xa0beauty and grandeur hitherto unseen, save by his\xa0eyes. He dedicated hilltops and glens with mystic\xa0rites." \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0#OTD On this day in 1916, it was State Flower anniversary day in California.  There was a program at the Native Sons Building at the University of California; featuring speakers and festivities. One hundred years earlier, the California poppy, the Eschscholzia californica had been named by Adelbert von Chamisso in honor of his friend,\xa0Johanns Friedrich Von Eschscholz. It was both a courtesy and a quid pro quo. In turn, Eschscholz named plants for Chamisso. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Unearthed Words\xa0  "All things on earth point home in old October: sailors to sea, travelers to walls and fences, hunters to\xa0 field and hollow and the long voice of the hounds, the lover to the love he has forsaken." - Thomas Wolfe, Novelist \xa0 “Trying to plan for the future without knowing the past is like trying to plant cut flowers” - Daniel Boorstin, Historian, born #OTD in 1914 \xa0 "Few things are riskier than "fine writing," but Miss Welty has never been afraid to risk it. She spoke once in conversation of plant explorers who go to Nepal and Sikkim, risking their lives to introduce Alpine flowers to gardens. "Now that\'s something - discovering new primroses - that\'s worth taking trouble with, worth risking something for," she said. She seemed to set the plant explorers, bringing garden treasures from the Himalayas, over against the ordinary world we all live in everyday." - From an interview with American Short Story Writer and Novelist, Eudora Welty, in The Washington Post, 1972\xa0 \xa0   \xa0  Today\'s book recommendation: The Naturalist by Thom Conroy.  Conroy\'s book is about the real life of Dr Ernst Dieffenbach who died on this day in 1855. Dieffenbach was a scientist, explorer, a loner, a revolutionary, and an outcast. Gardeners will recognize the name Dieffenbach because the dumb cane, or Dieffenbachia, is named in honor of Dieffenbach.\xa0  Dieffenbach was part of the New Zealand Company’s 1839 colonial expedition. Once in New Zealand, Dieffenbach predicted how colonization would impact the country.\xa0  The cover of this book, The Naturalist, is one of my personal favorites. It looks marvelous on a table beside the couch or on a bedside table; plus the story of Dieffenbach will stay with you; it\'s both beautiful and sad. \xa0 \xa0   Today\'s Garden Chore  #OTD Today is October 1st, the day all Poinsettia owners are to confine their plants to complete darkness for 14 hours a day.  Place plants in a darkened closet or room (with no lights at any time) from about 5pm to 7am, daily, for 8 to 10 weeks. But, be sure to give your plant\xa0 10 hours of natural light daily. This change in the light will set the buds and cause bracts to color. The plant will come into full bloom November or December.  Don\'t forget that the main attraction with poinsettias is not its flowers, but its leaves. In case you\'re wondering; the flowers are those little yellow clustered buds in the center. \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 Something Sweet\xa0 Reviving the little botanic spark in your heart  #OTD On this day in 1945, The Morning Call out of New Jersey shared the story of Nurseryman William Hallicy.  During WWII, Hallicy had served for twenty-two months with the Seabees, the Navy\'s construction force.  While he was relieved to go home to Clifton, New Jersey, he faced a grim scene. Right after joining he Seabees, Hallicy\'s nursery had been decimated by a brush fire. There wasn\'t much left to come home to; just weeds and charred trees.  After he returned home and took stock of his situation, Hallicy estimated it would take him almost a decade to grow salable stock from new seedlings. He planned to raise poultry until his nursery could produce again.  But a few days later, Hallicy and his wife were awakened early in the morning by the sound of truck motors on the front yard. Members of the North Jersey Nurseryman\'s Association had worked together to honor Hallicy\'s service with the Seabees. The newspaper said:  "Unannounced, they appeared at the Hallicy home with $2,500 worth of small trees in 15 trucks. With tractor, plow and spades, they cleared the 4-acre plot and set out the trees. In a few hours, the Hallicy Nursery was right smack back in business. Neighbor Hallicy started and gulped. He finally managed to pull himself together and serve beer. But nothing could wash down v the lump in his throat... We\'re getting one of our own just thinking: about his neighbors. Makes us want to go right out and buy a big block of stock in human nature, common and preferred."  This incident was so unusual that newspapers all over the country picked up the story. It even made The Reader\'s Digest. \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | I was reading in Facebook yesterday, a friend had planted all of these autumn crocus, colchicums, in her garden.  Like any bulb, it takes lots of dedication to get them planted and then you have all of the anticipation - waiting to see if they come up and if they meet your expectations.  Anyway, she\'d invited some friends over to come and check them out. Instead of being amazed by the beautiful autumn crocus, her friends were completely taken her gorgeous hydrangea.  Isn\'t that the way it goes?  We toil in our gardens and then we invite people over to come and see it. Yet, the plants we expect others to be amazed by, the plants that have stolen our hearts, are not always the plants that are the most popular with our visitors.\xa0  So, my piece of advice, if you have an affinity for autumn crocus, is don\'t plant hydrangea.  If you do have hydrangea, only invite other gardeners over.\xa0 Only gardeners will appreciate the dedication that it takes to plant colchicum. Only gardeners are sensitive to the fact that\xa0if they\'ve been invited over to "see the colchicum", they will ooh and aah only for the autumn crocus, and offer merely a passing nod to the show-stealing hydrangea. \xa0\xa0   \xa0 Brevities  #OTD \xa0Today is the birthday of the botanist Sarah Hynes who was born on this day in 1859,\xa0  Hynes was born in Danzig, Prussia and she immigrated to Australia in the mid 1800\'s. After graduating from the University of Sydney, she and Georgina King brought in fresh flowers for a botanical display at the Sydney Technological Museum. This is how Haynes came to know the director of the Museum, Joseph Henry Maiden. Maiden hired Haynes as a botanical assistant and when he was promoted to be the director of the Sydney Botanic Garden, he hired Hynes to be in\xa0charge of the herbarium.  Once Hynes arrived at the botanic garden, she ran into difficulties with her male bosses. She was pointing out disparities between herself and her male counterparts; she had requested better pay. In 1905, Hynes was suspended and cited for 39 counts of insubordination including the use of "unladylike" phrase "lowdown, dirty larrikin trick."  Hynes stood her ground and denied the charges, which were ultimately dismissed. But, five years later, it happened again. After this suspension, Haynes had had enough; she\xa0transferred to the Department of Public Instruction.  After this position, Haynes spent the rest of her professional life teaching science to high schoolers.\xa0\xa0  William Fitzgerald named the\xa0(Acacia hynesiana) for her, in recognition of her work with Joseph Henry Maiden on his book\xa0Forest Flora. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0   #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the botanical artist Faith Fyles who was born on this day in 1875.  Fyles was trained as a botanist, but her natural artistic talent became apparent early in her career.  She was the first female hired by the Canadian Department of Agriculture. In 1920, she transferred to the horticulture division where she began producing colored illustrations of plant specimens; especially\xa0 \xa0fruits and ornamentals.\xa0\xa0  Fyles is remembered for her work on the 1920 bulletin, Principal Poison Plants of Canada. The bulletin was prepared for farmers so that they could discern the problematic plants on their properties and avoid pasturing animals\xa0 with poisonous plants. The book was offered free through the Ottawa Department of Agriculture.  Over her career, Fyles had the opportunity to study art with Stanhope Forbes in England and with Rene Menard and Lucien Simon in Paris. \xa0 \xa0    #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the Mexican botanist Helia Bravo Hollis who was born on this day in 1901.  Bravo Hollis was the\xa0first woman to graduate with the title of Biologist in Mexico. By the age of 29, she was named curator of the University\'s herbarium where she was assigned the job of studying the cactus.  In 1937,\xa0Bravo\xa0 \xa0Hollispublished "Las cactáceas de México", making her a leader of global cactus research.\xa0  Bravo Hollis focused on cactus in and in 1951, she cofounded the Mexican Cactus Society.\xa0Six cacti species are named in her honor. In 2001, the Cactus\xa0 Society had planned to celebrate her 100th birthday, but she died four days shy of the century mark.  Bravo Hollis also helped found the Botanical Gardens at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. She served as the director of the Gardens throughout the 1960s. When a strike occurred, Bravo-Hollis offset the pay owed her workers with money out of her own pocket.  Last year, Google commemorated the 117th birthday of Bravo Hollis with a Doodle.  If you search for her online, you\'ll see a memorable image of Bravo Hollis, in a skirt and blazer with a knife in her hand, standing next to an Echinocactus platyacanthus, also known as the giant barrel cactus, that appears to be over 5 ft tall and just as wide; a very impressive specimen. This species is the largest barrel cacti. In Mexico, where the cactus is a native, the hairs are harvested for weaving and a traditional candy is made from boiling the pith.  Today, the\xa0Helia Bravo HollisBotanical Garden, with more than 80 species of cactaceae, is found at the Biosphere Reserve of Tehuacán.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 Unearthed Words  \xa0Today is the birthday of the American poet WS Merwin, who always went by William, and who was born on this day in 1927.  In 2010, Merwin and his wife, Paula, co-founded the Merwin Conservancy at his home in Haiku, Maui. Merwin used the 19 protected acres surrounding his home to cultivate 400 different species of tropical trees; and many of the world\'s rarest palm trees. Merwin bought the property in 1977, and every day, he planted one tree.   Merwin\'s story is outlined in an excellent opinion piece about Merwin that was featured in the New York Times earlier this year. \xa0  “come back believer in shade believer in silence and elegance believer in ferns believer in patience believer in the rain”   “Obviously a garden is not the wilderness but an assembly of shapes, most of them living, that owes some share of its composition, it’s appearance, to human design and effort, human conventions and convenience, and the human pursuit of that elusive, indefinable harmony that we call beauty. It has a life of its own, an intricate, willful, secret life, as any gardener knows. It is only the humans in it who think of it as a garden. But a garden is a relationship, which is one of the countless reasons why it is never finished.”\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 “On the last day of the world I would want to plant a tree.”\xa0 \xa0 \xa0   Today\'s book recommendation: Planting in a Post-Wild World by Thomas Rainer and Claudia West\xa0  This book came out in 2015 and the subtitle is Designing Plant Communities for Resilient Landscapes. Right from the start, one can tell that this book has a different philosophical underpinning than other books on landscape design. And, I love that they incorporate the use of the word community; Rainer and West are trying to get us to think about our gardens as communities.  \xa0If we could begin to see our gardens and the plants in them in the way that Rainer and West do, we would be much more sensitive to concepts like density and diversity in our plantings. But, don\'t let those terms throw you; Rainer and West are all about extracting design principals that help gardeners focus on wise selections and year-round interest; all through the lens of community. If we could all do a better job of understanding the way plants behave in the wild, our gardens would benefit greatly.\xa0  I love what they write in the beginning of their book because I think it sets the tone for what they are trying to accomplish:  "The way plants grow in the wild and the way they grow in our gardens is starkly different. In nature, plants thrive even in inhospitable environments; in our gardens, plants often lack the vigor of their wild counterparts, even when we lavish them with rich soils and frequent water. In nature, plants richly cover the ground; in too many of our gardens, plants are placed far apart and mulched heavily to keep out weeds. In nature, plants have an order individual harmony resulting from their adaptation to a site; our gardens are often arbitrary assortments from various habitats, related only by our personal preferences.... \xa0 In fact, the very activities that define gardening – weeding, watering, fertilizing, and mulching – all imply a dependency of plants on the gardener for survival. Gardeners are often frustrated when some plants spread beyond their predetermined location and surprised\xa0 \xa0 \xa0while others struggle to get established.... \xa0 Further complication is the availability of plants from every corner of the globe... \xa0 So how do we\xa0 shift the paradigm, making desirable plantings that look and function sympathetically with how they evolve in nature? By observing and embracing the wisdom of natural plant communities." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Today\'s Garden Chore  Add some color to your garden with chrysanthemums.\xa0  On this day in 2000, Stuart Robinson offered this advice about mums in his weekly column in the Montreal Gazette:  "Before shutting things down for the winter, there are a few ways to make the fall garden look a bit nicer. Brighten up your fall flower beds with some colorful chrysanthemums. If you didn\'t plant any in the spring, so what. Markets and garden supply stores usually have lots of them on special at this time of the year. Buy a few of the larger pots, dig holes in the flower bed (removing a few poor-performing annuals if you have to) and just drop them in and water them well. If you do it when nobody\'s looking, your neighbors will never know." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Something Sweet\xa0 Reviving the little botanic spark in your heart  As I was researching the poet William Merwin, I came across an interview with him done by Joel Whitney back in 2010.  During the interview, Merwin revealed that his mother used to read him poetry and one of his early favorites was Robert Louis Stevenson\'s\xa0A Child\'s Garden of Verses.  \xa0When asked about Stevenson, Merwin recalled that Stevenson had spent a great deal of time in Hawaii:  "and played cards with King Kalakaua... Kalakaua cheated at cards... They obviously got along very well together, Stevenson and Kalakaua. They were playing cards one day, and Stevenson said, \'I’ll beat him this time: four aces.\'  And Kalakaua said, \'Five kings beats it all.\'" \xa0 \xa0   Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | What are you doing with all of your tomatoes?  A few years ago, I stumbled on Ina Garten\'s Recipe for Roasted Tomato Soup - it\'s the best roasted tomato basil soup recipe out there if you ask me!  Ina\'s recipe calls for fresh tomatoes and herbs and she doesn\'t use cream or milk. Best of all, Ina\'s soup is rich and full of flavor.  Ingredients  3 lbs. ripe plum tomatoes,\xa0cut in half lengthwise 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp. olive oil 2 cups chopped yellow onions 6 garlic cloves,\xa0minced 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes 1 (28 oz) can whole plum tomatoes,\xa0with juice 4 cups fresh basil leaves,\xa0packed 1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves\xa0(or 1/2 tsp. dried) 4 cups chicken stock\xa0(homemadeor store bought) Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper     Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Gently toss the tomatoes from your garden with 1/4 cup olive oil and layer on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Roast for 45 minutes. In a large dutch-oven, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt. Sauté until onions are translucent and start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes, basil, thyme, roasted tomatoes, including the juices, and chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring the soup back to a simmer and cook for 40 minutes, uncovered. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve with drizzle of cream or dollop of sour cream, fresh parmesan, and side of grilled cheese.    So that\'s what I do with any extra tomatoes this time of year.  I\'ll share the recipe in today\'s Show Notes. \xa0    Brevities  #OTD On this day in 1843, the New England Farmer ran an ad about Chrysanthemums for nurseryman Joseph Breck:  "The subscribers offer for sale twenty varieties of new Chrysanthemums of the most superb and rare sorts, at 50 cents per pot." \xa0 \xa0   #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of Joy Morton who was born on this day in 1855.  Morton\'s father was J. Sterling Morton, the founder of\xa0Arbor Dayand\xa0 a former secretary of agriculture under President Cleveland. Not surprisingly, Joy\'s love of trees was instilled in him at a young age.  Raised on a farm in Nebraska, Joy Morton became a powerful businessman in Chicago with his company Morton Salt.  In December 1922, Joy established The Morton Arboretum - a tract of land dedicated to ongoing study of trees, shrubs, and grasses.  In 1923, Morton donated his family\'s Ancestral home, Arbor Lodge, to Nebraska and the property became a state park and a memorial to his father.  An article from the Chicago Tribune in 1926, offered a glimpse of the passion Morton felt about trees. Speaking at the Arboretum, Morton said,  "I want to appeal to the gambling instinct of the American people. I want a man to come in here and say, \'What can I get out of tree planting?\' I want to arouse his venturesomeness. A man old enough to think for himself comes in here and sees a group like that [pointing] group of walnuts over there which is doing so well, and then he says to himself,  \'Well, how about it? What can I do now on my land that will mean something to my grandchildren thirty years hence? And, then I want him to keep looking at the walnuts, or what he likes best, until he says, I believe I\'ll go and do likewise.\'"    \xa0 #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of James Drummond Dole who was born on this day in 1877.  Dole had gone to Harvard and then after graduation at the age of 22, he made his way to Hawaii in 1899. After living there two years, he honed in on growing pineapple as a business. The Smooth Cayenne strain of pineapple wasn\'t native to Hawaii. It was a Florida variety. Dole began growing 200 pineapple plants on 60 acres. The rest is history.   Here are a few fun pineapple facts:  Pineapples have Bromelain; a chemical that prevents gelatin from setting. But, once pineapple is canned, the Bromelain is destroyed, which is why you can add canned pineapple to jello.  Christopher Columbus brought pineapples back to Spain from the Caribbean Island of Guadalupe in 1493.\xa0 The Spanish introduced pineapples to Hawaii.  Today, thanks to Dole, more than one-third of the world\'s commercial supply of pineapples comes from Hawaii. \xa0   \xa0 Unearthed Words  How beautiful leaves grow old.

In the middle ages in England, farmers used Michaelmas as a way to mark the change of seasons; It was time to wrap up the reaping and start getting ready for winter.  And, according to folklore, bounty-thorn (the English folk-name for blackberries) need to be picked by Michaelmas because that was the day that Lucifer was expelled from Heaven. Now according to folklore, once he was cast out, Lucifer promptly fell straight into a blackberry bush. A blackberry bush would not make for a soft landing. Lucifer wasn\'t thrilled with it either. He supposedly cursed the blackberry fruit, making them unfit for consumption. So unless, you want to eat tainted blackberries, get them picked before Sunday. And don\'t forget, blackberries make a lovely pie or crumble. \xa0 \xa0    \xa0 Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | Right now is the perfect time to bring some nature indoors.\xa0  Why buy something manufactured to look like nature, when some of the most impactful pieces can be found right in your own garden?  I love to bring in some of the bird\'s nests from my garden. I place them on top of a stack of books, in a crystal bowl or on a bookshelf. They add wonderful, texture and interest to help ground your interior for winter.  Adding leaves and berries to ledges and to your arrangements accomplishes the same thing.

Grew was an English botanist and was the first person to illustrate the inner structures and functions of plants in all their wondrous intricacy.\xa0 \xa0 If you\'ve ever seen a Nehemiah Grew drawing, you\'ll never forget it; you\'re probably able to spot them a mile away.  But, if you\'ve\xa0never seen a Nehemiah Grew drawing, imagine an etch-a-sketch drawing on steroids. The lines are impossibly thin. The level of detail is staggering. For instance, Grew\'s drawings of tree parts cut transversely look like elaborate Japanese fans. This is because Grew was one of the first naturalists to incorporate the microscope in the study of plant morphology. \xa0 It was his use of the microscope that allowed Grew to give the first known microscopic description of pollen. Along those same lines, Grew was also the first person to analyze the ridges, furrows, grooves, and pores on human hands and feet. He published his incredibly accurate drawings of finger ridge patterns in\xa0 1684. Palm readers owe Grew a debt of gratitude. (Just kidding.... or am I?) \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of John Chapman who was born on this day in 1774.  You may never have heard of John Chapman, but you\'ve probably heard of his nickname; Johnny Appleseed.  Chapman was born in Massachusetts and the street where he was born is now\xa0 called Johnny Appleseed Lane.  As a young man, Chapman became an apprentice to an orchardist named Crawford. The image most of us have of Chapman, traipsing through the country planting one apple tree at a time is off base. Chapman actually traipsed through the country planting entire apple orchards, then he protected the orchard by building a fence around it, and then arranging a deal with a neighboring farmer to sell trees from the orchard in exchange for shares. It was a genius setup.  During his life, Chapman had a special regard for and relationship with Native\xa0 Americans who regarded him as a medicine man.\xa0 At the same time, Chapman wanted early American settlers to succeed; he often acted as a one-man welcome wagon; showing up at door with a gift of herbs as a gesture of support.  For his part, Chapman was an expert in more plants than just apple trees; he was one of our country\'s first naturalists and herbalists. Chapman used many herbs for healing like catnip, hoarhound, pennyroyal, rattlesnake weed, and dog-fennel. In fact, dog fennel (Eupatorium) was also called "Johnny weed" because Chapman planted it believing it was antimalarial. Whenever you hear Eupatorium, you can deduce that the plant is closely related to joe pye weed. Unfortunately, dog fennel was not a good thing to spread around; it\'s a noxious weed.  The Johnny Appleseed Center on the campus of Urbana University in Urbana, Ohio holds the largest collection of memorabilia and information on Chapmen. In 1999, seedlings from the last-known surviving Johnny Appleseed tree were transplanted into the courtyard around the museum. \xa0  \xa0 #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the botanist Oakes Ames who was born on this day in 1874.  What a great name for a botanist, huh?\xa0  Ames was trained as an economic botanist, but his specialty was orchids. He had his own orchid collection as a kid, and you know what they say about orchid lovers; once you\'re hooked, you\'re hooked. The author, Norman MacDonald, wrote in his 1939 book The Orchid Hunters:  "For when a man falls in love with orchids, he\'ll do anything to possess the one he wants. It\'s like chasing a green-eyed woman [being consumed by desire] or taking cocaine. A sort of madness..."  Ames was a Harvard man; he spent his entire career there. His work on the Orchidaceae\xa0 was foundational to the study of orchids. His effort culminated in a seven-volume work on the Orchid Family.  For his dedication, in 1924, Ames won the gold medal of the American Orchid Society.\xa0  Today, Ames is recognized for his biggest contribution to the world of orchids; the Ames Orchid Herbarium (now part of the Harvard Herbaria) featuring 3,000 flowers in glycerine, 4,000 specimens that are pickled, along with 131,000 standard specimens, in addition to a magnificent library.\xa0 \xa0   \xa0 Unearthed Words  \xa0\'I grow old, I grow old,\' the garden says.

They were part of San Francisco\'s high society, entertaining guests like the poet Carl Sandburg and Lincoln Steffens the muckraking journalist. Cora grew hundreds of pink roses in her garden which is how she became known as "The Pink Lady."  During World War II, in August of 1942, the journalist Elsie Robinson wrote about Cora Older and the challenge faced by women dealing with the harvest alone in her column called "Listen World". I thought you would enjoy learning a little bit about Cora through this tremendous story.  "Keeping the home fires burning is a cinch compared with keeping the home crops plucked these days, as those of us who have ranches and farms can testify.  Where, oh where, are the hordes of jobless lads who used to come ambling around when the peach was on the bough and the berry on the thorn? I can tell you exactly where they are - Uncle Sam has gobbled them up, to the last calloused palm and freckle.  So what do we do for "hired hands?"  Mrs. Fremont Older knows the answer. Cora Older, widow of America\'s great and beloved newspaper publisher, and plenty of a writer herself, is lean, lithe and possesses enough spunk to run a dozen unions.  Take this summer for instance, maybe you\'ve been getting your suntan at the nearest beach. Not so Cora.  During sizzling July and August weeks she has been climbing the hundreds of apricot and prune trees which spread across her big ranch at Cupertino, picking the fruit herself with the occasional and temperamental aid of a 64-year-old handy man.  And It you don\'t think picking \'cots on a July afternoon is some job, you\'ve a lot to learn, stranger.  To Cora, however, there was no alternative. There was the fruit, such a harvest as the west has not seen in many a year. Golden floods of apricots, purple piles of prunes, but nary a man to pick them i n or deliver them to the dryer.  So what?  So if a man could climb a tree, she could. And did.  Let the typewriter rest for a while, let the roses go ungathered - Cora Older was going to tackle her Victory harvest.  It\'s an epic, that battle with heat and weariness, human cussedness and old Mother Nature. I hope she puts it into a book. \xa0 \xa0  Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | If you\'re feeling a little glum about the end of the gardening season, here are a few activities that can help you rebalance:  First, support your local farmers by shopping at a local farm stand. Often the growers will have insights on plants and practices that are applicable to your own garden. Get inspired by seeing some of the different varieties of apples, gourds, zucchinis, pumpkins, and other vegetables.\xa0  Second, refresh your mulch supply. Top dressing before winter feels as good now as it does in the Spring. Your beds will benefit from the extra layer of protection and you will feel a boost from the beauty of cleaned beds. \xa0  \xa0  Brevities  #OTD Today is the anniversary of the death of the German botanist Valerius Cordus who died on this day in 1544.  Cordus was the author of one of the most influential herbals in history. In fact, centuries later, the botanist Thomas ArchibaldSprague re-published "The Herbal of Valerius Cordus" with his older sister who he considered to be the best botanist in the family. After the book was published, Sprague gifted her with a personal and gorgeous bound copy. He had the book dedicated to her in latin: "M. S. Sprague praeceptrici olim hodie collaboratrici d.d. T. A. Sprague" - basically saying that she had taught him and collaborated with him.  Cordus died young, at the age of 29, likely from malaria. He had botanized in Italy over the summer of 1544 with two French naturalists. At some point, he had waded into marshes in search of new plants. When he became sick a short time later, his friends brought him to Rome and then,\xa0 \xa0they continued on to Naples. When they returned for him, they found Cordus had died.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the Swiss botanist Konrad Gesner who had the sense to collect Cordus\' prolific writings and preserve and publish them. One expert once said, "There was Theophrastus; there was nothing for 1,800 years; then there was Cordus."  The genus Cordia is named in honor of Valerius Cordus. \xa0   \xa0 #OTD\xa0 \xa0Today is the birthday of the Landscape Gardener Edward Kemp who was born on this day in 1817.  Edward Kemp was the landscape gardener and architect at Birkenhead under Joseph Paxton. He placed an ad in the Liverpool Mercury after the opening of Birkenhead, he was out of work and was offering his services,  “[Edward Kemp] begs to offer his services to the Noblemen and Gentlemen in the vicinity of Birkenhead and Liverpool…The fluttering testimonials which he has\xa0received from numberless visitors to the Birkenhead park, induce him to believe that a simple reference to the past and present condition of the park\xa0…. will be sufficient to ensure for him a large and liberal patronage.”  Don\'t worry about Edward Kemp. He went on to be a leading Victorian Landscape Gardener and a successful one, at that. \xa0 \xa0   #OTD\xa0 On this day in 1890, the Sequoia National Park was established to protect the giant Sequoia trees, among the oldest living things on earth.\xa0  In 1847, Stephan Ladislaus Endlicher, a German\xa0botanist, came up with the genus name "Sequoia" after a Cherokee Chief named Sequoyah (1770-1843) who was the son of a British merchant and a Cherokee woman. Sequoyah developed an alphabet to enable his tribe’s dialect to be written.\xa0 In 1872, Asa Gray wrote about the sequoia and presented his work in Dubuque Iowa at the 21st annual session of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. During his presentation, Gray speculated on the origin of the trees. He offered three hypotheses:   Either they are just coming into existence, and are destined, if unmolested by man, to spread over the world; They have long lived; on the Pacific Slope, and have never spread elsewhere, because no other climate is fit for them;\xa0 They are the survivors of a race that once crowded the hills and valleys of the world.  Gray felt the last hypothesis was the one with the most merit. He expanded on this point by saying,  "Research has found the fossil sequoia gigantea throughout ... Northern Europe, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and the Rocky Mountains. All of these fossil specimens are almost exactly the same as the “ Big Trees” of today. The very slight difference can be readily explained by the modifying force of different conditions.  This crucial test shows that, before man sprang from the dust of the Garden of Eden, according to Genesis, or was evolved from the ape of Northern Africa, according to Darwin, the sequoia gigantea belted Northern America, Asia, and Europe, and the islands of the Northern seas. The “ Big Trees” of California are but the outlying sentinels of an army that has vanished." \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 #OTD On this day in 1942, the newspaper in Spokane Washington had a headline that said: Noted Botanist Crosses Jungle (Takes Long Mule Route Through Tibet to Get a Few Flowers.)  The article was about the botanist Francis Kingdon-Ward who had just arrived in New Delhi after a 500 hundred mile walk over mountains and through jungles to avoid the Japanese invaders of Burma.  The article said this:  "A thin, wiry little man in his 50s, Captain Kingdon-Ward...decided that the Japanese were getting too close for comfort so he loaded two 60-pound bags of rice on two mules... But instead of taking the short road through the Chaukan pass, [he] decided to travel the 500 mile mule trail through Tibet... He thought he might find some useful military information during his trip [and] \'besides, there is always a chance of finding some rare wild flowers on this route.\'  [Kingdon-Ward tramped] knee-deep in snow [and] crossed the Himalayas at the 14,500 foot pass....  [He said] "It was a pleasant walk and I collected some nice flowers....Your reward is in the finding of dazzling flowers never seen before. You know they may always blush unseen unless you manage , to take them back and make them grow where others can admire them. They are a little bit of the enchantment of Asia transplanted into England or America. It is satisfaction enough if you can feel in an industrial age like the present that you have brought home a little beauty for others to enjoy." \xa0 \xa0   \xa0 Unearthed Words  #OTD \xa0Today is the birthday of the English poet Felicia Hemans who was born on this day in 1793.\xa0  She wrote this charming garden poem to honor one of her five sons on his autumnal birthday: \xa0 Where sucks the bee now?

The subtitle is\xa0Plants, Potting and DIY Projects - Botanical Styling with Fiddle-Leaf Figs, Monsteras, Air Plants, Succulents, Ferns, and More of Your Favorite Houseplants.  Botanical styling is all the rage - even Pottery Barn is offering permanent pots and stems to help lead this trend.  The blogger Kendal Morgan Hall, wrote in her review of this book:  "[Living Decor] is filled with gorgeous pictures...The colour scheme in this book is vibrant. It shows how plants can warm up a minimalistic decorated living space."  \xa0Kendall\'s review is spot on.  I wanted to read a little excerpt to help you get to know the author a little better. Her name is Maria Colletti and she spent 13 years working at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) retail shop. Here\'s what she wrote in one of the first sections of her book called "Where I Found My Green Life":  "In 2003 I continued my schooling it in YBG, chiseling my green skills as shop manager of the shop in the garden. I learned so much working as a garden retailer in a place that educates daily and what it means to love plants.  We bought, sold, displayed, and cared for our plant inventory. We watched the garden evolve throughout the seasons, which was, on many days, just breathtaking: The white Korean dogwood trees at the entrance of the rose garden, or the perennial garden outside the Enid A. Haupt to Conservatory in summer.  How lucky am I? I intended never to waste this privilege but instead utilize it to the best of my abilities. This is how I discovered my garden lifestyle and brought all the elements together." \xa0   \xa0 Today\'s Garden Chore  It\'s time to think selectively about where and what to cut back in the garden.  Long ago, I learned not to leave grasses up near the house; the base of grasses draw mice and in the Spring when you cut them down, you\'ll have little mice running all about.  I like to get the garden in front of my porch completely clean. We pile snow there from sweeping the porch and clearing off the walks. Plus, this garden is wet in the spring - so I\'d rather cut back perennials now and just let everyone do their thing in the spring, without me having to traipse through it. On the other hand, it\'s nice to strategically allow some perennials to remain; providing habitat for insects, food for birds, and winter interest. In addition to trees and shrubs, plants like Coneflower, sedum, Russian sage, Lovage, Aster, Sunflowers, Hydrangea, and Joe Pye weed remain intact in my garden\xa0 until spring.\xa0 \xa0  \xa0 Something Sweet\xa0 Reviving the little botanic spark in your heart  On this day in 1915 the newspaper out of Burlington Vermont shared a little article about September flowers; focusing mainly on the golden rod and the aster and their numerous varieties.\xa0  But then it ended with these marvelous run-on sentences. Check it out:  Most conspicuous among the flowers of the roadside and pasture, these last days of September, are the goldenrod and aster. [...]  One need not be a botanist to find and identify either plant, for we see them on every hand, making a successful struggle for life under most adverse conditions, and giving a splendor of beauty to the dull, gray days of the fall.\xa0  Its closing days show a wealth of floral loveliness that may not soon be duplicated. And this is true of the goldenrod and aster\'s rich relatives of the garden.\xa0The cultivated asters are a blaze of glory in countless gardens, and cannas and hardy chrysanthemums and other things aplenty show no sign of old age.\xa0  Thus, latest autumn Is connected with earliest spring, for the floral succession has been unbroken, from the time when the snowdrop blossomed amid ice and snow, through a long line of flowers of every hue and shape, to this 25th of September, when the black-eyed Susans are closing their long campaign, chicory is losing its last pale blue, and the aster and goldenrod are left not exactly blooming alone but the kings of the floral world. \xa0 \xa0 Thanks for listening to the daily gardener, and remember: "For a happy, healthy life, garden every day." | One of my favorite shoulder season plants is my magnolia.  The beautiful white blossoms in the spring and the glorious yellow leaves in the fall bookend a summer of hardy greenery.

If you\'re looking for something that provides something new in every season, add magnolia to your list. \xa0   \xa0 Brevities  #OTD \xa0Today is the birthday of the botanist William Herbst who was born on this day in 1833.  As a child, William would accompany his father on horseback as he visited his patients across Bucks County in Pennsylvania. While his dad met with the sick in their homes, William stayed outside and passed the time collecting flora and fauna for study. When he grew older, he spent time formally studying botany,\xa0in addition to attending Medical School in Philadelphia. \xa0 Although he became a doctor like his father Frederick, William Herbst was truly a botanist at heart. He developed a passion for fungi and he wrote a Fungal Flora of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania in 1899. Once, after sending a specimen to his botanist friend, a Professor CH Peck, Herbst received a kind acknowledgement letter, which read in part:\xa0 "That was a splendid fungus you sent me. It is an undescribed species of Sparassis. I propose to name it, with your consent, Sparassis Herbstii." \xa0 In 1906, doctors were still making house-calls. Herbst died after visiting a sick patient. His obituary in\xa0The Morning Call\xa0 in Allentown, PA said, \xa0 "[Herbst] suffered from a fall. Leaving a sick-room to go to the bath room, he opened a stairway door by accident and plunged to the bottom in the darkness... [Then] he sank into a coma from which he did not awake.\xa0 \xa0 The doctor was one of the most lovable of men. He was firm and honest in his convictions ... [and] His beautiful nature was exemplified in the poem, "Welcome Spring Flowers," which "he wrote many years ago...\xa0 \xa0 \xa0Many a time he was asked why he did not settle in some city where his [botanical] talents would receive prompt recognition, but his answer invariably was that he could study nature better in his old home." \xa0 When Herbst died, his widow donated his collection of 5,000 fungi to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.\xa0    \xa0 #OTD\xa0 On this day in 1886, the botanist Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf began his journey by train to Cambridge, Massachusetts to go work for Harvard\'s top botanist, Asa Gray.\xa0 \xa0 Now I know what you\'re thinking. This must be another story about a budding young botanist who makes his way to Harvard and then writes his ticket to success and fame. But that is not the story of Wilhelm Suksdorf. \xa0 Suksdorf was born in Germany, but his family soon immigrated to Iowa. \xa0 The Suksdorf\'s had nine children, but after their two little girls died, the Suksdorfs were a family of seven boys; often referred to as the seven Suksdorfs. (Wilhelm was number six). \xa0 Wilhelm was a sickly little boy; maybe that’s why he ended up being such a homebody. When his older brothers went to Ames Iowa for college, botany was part of the curriculum. (Imagine that?!) It was through his older brothers that Wilhelm learned of Asa Gray\'s botany manual. After he heard about it, he wanted one for himself. So, when he was twenty years old, he bought himself a copy and he used it to learn about the plants around the family\'s Davenport Iowa farm.\xa0 \xa0 After his older brothers went West to find their fortunes, it wasn’t long before the entire Suksdorf family followed suit. They ended up buying land along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest and they settled in an area they named Bingen. \xa0 Wilhelm attempted to study botany at Berkeley. But, after two years, decided to quit. Suksdorf was 26 when he left Berkeley and returned to the family farm to help his brothers with their dairy operation. \xa0 Back in Iowa, the Suksdorfs had been part of a large German immigrant population. They were able continue to speak German at home on the farm and with a fair number of other German settlers in the county. But, when the Suksdorf family moved west, the dense concentration of German families did not exist. Wilhelm\'s lack of formal schooling and his isolation on the farm, made him uncomfortable communicating in English. As a result, much of his botanical work was written and documented in German. \xa0 As fate would have it, Asa Gray\'s manual was not helpful with the flora in the Northwest. Botanically speaking, Suksdorf was in uncharted territory. The lack of information spurred Wilhelm to reach out to none other than Asa Gray. Gray wrote him back. Corresponding with Gray gave Suksdorf something to do outside of the farm, yet it allowed him to at stay home (where he preferred to be). \xa0 Suksdorf would collect specimens and send the ones he wasn’t sure of to Gray and then wait for a response as to the identification. In the beginning, Suksdorf may not have appreciated how this relationship was actually a true quid pro quo. See, Suksdorf\'s work was an answer to prayer for Gray who was working on a flora of North America. There was nothing Gray needed more desperately than specimens from the Northwest. In recognition for his work, Grey named a violet for Suksdorf. This was an immense honor, on Suksdorf did not expect, and it turned Suksdorf into a true Gray disciple. \xa0 Things carried on this way for the next seven years until 1885 - which proved to be a dreadful year for Suksdorf. At this point, Suksdorf was a 35-year-old bachelor, living at home with his parents, working on the farm with his brothers, and botanizing when he had inclination, time, and energy.\xa0 But in October of that year, both of his parents succumbed to sickness; it was something like the flu. But, they didn\'t bounce back. They grew sicker and sicker until on October 22, they both died. \xa0 Suksdorf moved in with his younger brother, Theodore, and his wife. We don\'t know for sure how that went, but we do know that Suksdorf\'s sister-in-law attempted to get him out of his shell, out of his grief, and into the real world. \xa0 By spring, she had written a letter to Dr. Asa Gray at Harvard. One can almost see her rifling through Wilhelm\'s correspondence to find Dr. Gray\'s address. She told Gray about Wilhelm\'s isolation, but also how kind and conscientious he was; and she wondered if there might be a museum or a botanical garden that could use some help.\xa0 \xa0 Asa Gray must have been moved by something; whether it was all of those specimens and letters that Suksdorf had sent over the years or the somewhat desperate plea sent by his sister-in-law, we don\'t know for sure. What we do know is that, in a little over two weeks, Gray had put together an offer for Suksdorf:\xa0Come to Harvard. Be my assistant. Earn $500 the first year, $600 the second year, and so on, all the way up to $1000 a year. And,\xa0 Gray also offered a career path and mentorship. What was not to love? \xa0 True to form, Suksdorf went and declined the offer; saying something about not wanting a life indoors doing office work \xa0 You can imagine the reaction of his family. His brothers took him to task for rejecting the incredible offer. Their disappointment and frustration was made clear. In turn, Suksdorf handled it in the only way he knew how: escaping to nature... for three weeks. If nothing else, the hiatus gave Wilhelm time to think. \xa0 Incredibly, when Suksdorf returned home Gray had written again, and asked him to reconsider. \xa0 Whether it was Gray\'s persistence, his families badgering, or his self-reflection, by the end of July Suksdorf relented. And so, it was on this day, in 1886, that Suksdorf found himself boarding a train headed to Massachusetts to work with his mentor, Asa Gray. \xa0 It truly was the opportunity of a lifetime. For a little over a year, Suksdorf enjoyed working directly with Gray. He had finally found a place of acceptance outside of his immediate family. But it was short-lived. \xa0 Four days after Thanksgiving in 1887, Gray was at home and coming down the stairs for breakfast, when he suddenly lost control of his arm and hand. Three days later, he lost control over his speech. He languished in bed in complete silence for two months and died at the end of January on the 30th in 1888. \xa0 Suksdorf had his lost his mentor and grief consumed him\xa0 to the point that Gray\'s wife, Jane, had to send him to an institution in order to recover. \xa0 When he was discharged, Suksdorf discovered that Gray’s position had been filled by a man named Sereno Watson. Watson was a colder personality than Gray; he didn’t see the point in coddling Suksdorf and\xa0 Suksdorf could see the writing on the wall; he wasn’t a fit with Watson. For a homebody like Suksdorf, the easy decision was made; he was going home.\xa0 \xa0 Towards the end of his botanical career, Suksdorf was a special fellow at the herbarium of Washington State University. He collected 150,000 specimens, including 70 new species, over the course of his lifetime. Many plants have been named in his honor. Today, there is a Suksdorfia chapter of the\xa0Washington Native Plant Society and it is made up ofa great group of native plant enthusiasts in the Gorge. They sponsor a number of great hikes and educational events throughout the year.\xa0 \xa0 Suksdorf died as the result of a tragic train accident. On Oct. 3, 1932, Suksdorf arrived at the depot in his hometown to take the train to Portland. He stepped onto the track to flag the train, but it did not stop, and Suksdorf was thrown against the wall of the depot. He was 82 years old. \xa0   \xa0 Unearthed Words  "Youth is like spring, an over praised season more remarkable for biting winds than genial breezes.

Kubla Khan\'s Summer Garden at Xanadu is the subject of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\'s 1797 poem\xa0Kubla Khan.  In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea.  So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round; And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. \xa0\xa0 Coleridge\'s\xa0Kubla Kahn is regarded as one of his most important works. Coleridge said that he composed the entire poem while in a dreamlike state, drowsy from opium he had as medication. When he woke up, he remembered the entire poem and immediately set about writing it down. But then, he was interrupted by a knock at his door and he received a visitor. Sadly, when the visitor left, his perfect recollection of the poem failed him and he was only able to finish the poem in fragments.  The poem begins by describing Kahn\'s palace and the garden contrasted with the setting of the ancient Mongolian forest.  Although Coleridge wrote this poem in 1797, he didn\'t share it with the world until urged to do so by his friend Lord Byron.  Together, Coleridge\'s poem and the adventurer, Marco Polo, brought world-wide attention to Kubla Kahn and his achievements.     \xa0 #OTD\xa0 Today in 1806, Lewis and Clark returned to St. Louis after spending over two years exploring the headwaters of the Missouri River in an effort to find a route to the Pacific.\xa0  They returned with their journals and with plant specimens.

Alistair is a Chartered Landscape Architect and designer of The Family Monsters Garden at RHS Chelsea 2019.\xa0Alistair studied at Writtle College achieving a 1st Class Honours degree in Landscape and Garden Design in 2004; later completing his post graduate diploma at the University of Greenwich in 2006; becoming a Chartered Member of the Landscape Institute in 2008.\xa0His professional career started at Liz Lake Associates in 2004, progressing on to a Project Management role at Lee Valley Regional Park Authority in 2009 overseeing a number of Olympic related projects within Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the Olympic Fringe.\xa0Alistair joined idverde in 2012 as Park Manager for Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park responsible for the mobilisation of the 10 year maintenance contract achieving a prestigious BALI Principal Award in 2015.His current role sees him leading professional services and landscape construction throughout London and the South East, specialising in park improvement and public realm projects winning nine BALI Awards in the past six years.Alistair is a current Director of The Parks Alliance, the voice of UK Parks, acting as Vice Chair from 2016-2018.The Family Monsters Garden celebrates 150 years of Family Action supporting families across the country and idverde's 100 years of creating and maintaining landscapes for the benefit of local communities.The garden shows the pressures faced by every family and the journey families take to face these challenges. From financial problems to health and wellbeing issues, and from lack of time together to problems with communication and resolving disputes, the garden represents the range of pressures faced by families in Britain today. The journey to bringing these hidden issues out of the dark and into the open, so that they don’t become overwhelming, can be one of secrecy, shame and isolation, with pressures and progress obscured and hard to resolve.Ultimately their journey in this garden leads to a family space, where all come together to reflect, get their pressures out in the open and gather strength to face them together. The pool of clear water offers reflection and perspective.Through exhibiting this garden Alistair has discussed his own monster, how it impacted him and his young family, and how through sharing his troubles he found ways to overcome them and deal with them.Idverde is Europe’s largest provider of grounds maintenance services and landscape construction projects, with staff operating throughout the UK and France. We offer a holistic range of services to support the creation, maintenance and management of landscapes throughout the UK, working with both public and private sector clients to deliver bespoke solutions for each project’s unique challenges.Family Action is a national charity marking its 150th anniversary in 2019 and is committed to building stronger families by delivering innovative and effective services and support that reaches out to many of the UK’s most vulnerable people.

They had recently connected on social media so they weren't complete strangers, but they had never met her in person. Fonta greeted Mandy with the most generous hug and genuine enthusiasm for this show (even though it was still in its infancy). Their paths crossed again in person when they both presented at the Feminine Legacy in Beekeeping conference last May and they happened to be staying at the same B&B. It was a totally bonding experience for them and they have been very close ever since. Though they are separated by a 4 hour drive and don’t get to hang out very often, when they do it is a total bee girl party. This summer Mandy got to go visit Fonta at her biodynamic farm in Cottage Grove, which is lovingly named Wild Everlasting. It is a place that is dedicated to the health of pollinators, and has been recognized as an Oregon Bee Project Flagship Farm. Mandy is so excited to introduce you to her friend and bee goddess, Fonta Molyneaux!\xa0For notes from today's show visit Mandy's blog at\xa0waggleworkspdx.comBecome a patron!

Mandy got to spend time with her while she was in Portland promoting her new book, Queenspotting. She attended her book reading and signing at Powell’s bookstore and afterwards they visited over cocktails and delicious popcorn. Mandy was really happy to spend time getting to know the person behind the fame prior to recording this episode, which was planned for the following day. They had originally planned to have the interview at the international rose test garden, but traffic that afternoon was really gnarly and when Mandy went to pick her up she saw how close she was staying to an even better interview spot. So Mandy made a quick phone call to a friend to see if they could use his space for the afternoon, and the rest was history… Meet Hilary Kearney of Girl Next Door Honey!\xa0For notes from today's show visit Mandy's blog at\xa0waggleworkspdx.comBecome a patron!

He touches on aspects of our lives with bees that are too frequently overlooked by the industry: heart & soul, birth-rights, ethical and moral standards that place the needs of bees above the commodity of honey. Because of his efforts, there is now a movement to reintroduce honeybees into wild nest cavities, a rehabilitation to bring bees back to nature. Through this gesture in honoring the identity of apis mellifera, he hopes to refocus how the global community looks at our lives with honey bees. In this episode, we are taken on a journey that Mandy hopes will bring you as much joy as it has brought her, and a new lens to look through.

Today\'s guest, Ron and his wife, who he affectionately refers to as "upper management," bought a 4000 square foot Gothic Victorian instead. Nine years into their long-term restoration, Ron is full of humor and insight. \xa0 \xa0 | This week, Devyn and Stacy both had to take an unexpected leave of absence. So, today\'s episode is a repeat of a fan favorite--the one that started it all, Ash Dump Archeology with special guest, Donn Grenda. The original air date was September 9, 2018. In this episode, Stacy explains how she and Andy ended up buying Blake Hill House. Also, archaeologist Donn Grenda discovers 60 year\'s worth of artifacts from the clogged fireplaces in his craftsman style home. Donn\'s discovery sparked his interest\xa0in researching the history and folklore of the times. That led to some bizarre findings and a couple of nearly famous people.\xa0 | In this episode, Stacy first recaps her traveling adventures and observations about beautiful Japan.\xa0 During segment two, Devyn and Stacy welcome Catherine Brooks from Eco-Strip--the sole distributor of Speedheater™ infrared paint strippers and tools. Catherine\'s passion for infrared technology and lead-safety education makes her the superhero we need in the old house community.\xa0 \xa0 | In today\'s mini-episode, Devyn and Stacy discuss restoration and renovation conundrums--Q&A style. Find out the answers to these burning questions:\xa0 What would compel Devyn to paint woodwork? How does Stacy feel about vintage toilets?\xa0 Will Devyn ever commit to installing the recessed lighting in his parlor? Can vegans even use shellac?\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | \xa0 At the beginning of this episode, Devyn and Stacy discuss their summer vacations and Stacy\'s weird hobby. No matter where they go, old houses and old buildings make their way onto the travel agenda.\xa0 \xa0 During segment two, Devyn and Stacy welcome Gunther and Anastasiia, a Husband and Wife duo living in a converted Gothic Revival Episcopal church. This charming duo is known as All Saints House on Instagram. They share the ups and downs of going to church every single day, lost in translation Russian-to-English, and the DIY projects that make them feel proud.\xa0 \xa0 | Season Two Begins!\xa0 In this episode, Stacy and Devyn welcome Elizabeth Finkelstein, a preservationist, writer, and owner of\xa0Cheap Old Houses and Circa Houses, both wildly successful Instagram accounts. Elizabeth also writes the monthly real estate column for\xa0Country Living\xa0magazine.\xa0 Through her work, Elizabeth tirelessly champions the preservation of old houses, and she has connected countless people with the fixer-upper of their dreams.\xa0\xa0 | In this episode, Stacy\'s long-time dream of talking to someone who has moved an old house comes true. Larissa and Kris Munsch moved a bungalow, affectionately titled, "The Governor" from Ness City Kansas to their farm 71 miles away. The process was just as exciting and nervewracking as you can imagine.\xa0 Thousands of people became acquainted with the Governor\'s journey first via Larissa\'s wildly popular Instagram account, Old House Love. With over 100k followers, Larissa never set out to be Insta-famous, but the old house loving community had other plans. Now, via hashtags and weekly photo features, Old House Love spreads the word about irreplaceable craftsmanship, preservation, and saving old houses all over the world.\xa0 Today\'s episode is part 2 of 2.\xa0\xa0 | In this episode, Stacy\'s long-time dream of talking to someone who has moved an old house comes true.

What does it all mean? In this episode, Devyn gives a history of the light bulb starting with the incandescent and ending up with his beloved LEDs. (It\'s true!) Memory lane is real, and we go there.\xa0 Later in the episode, Devyn completely demystifies the overwhelming light bulb aisle for Stacy and anyone else who can\'t figure out which bulb to buy for their antique fixtures.\xa0 | In this Episode, Devyn and Stacy have a blast interviewing Scott Sidler from Austin Historical and The Craftsman Blog. Learn about Scott\'s unique path into historic preservation, his favorite kind of restoration work, and what in the world is a house sandwich?\xa0 Tangents include Disney World, NPR, and the pole in the middle of the stripping room at Scott\'s workshop.

Can I seal the off gassing of my countertop or should I just get something new? \xa0Do I remodel my entire home or just start from scratch.\xa0There are definitely pros and cons to both side of this topic, so lots of great information in this episode.\xa0 | I know we spend an exorbitant amount of time discussing things you shouldn\'t use in your home, so we decided to start talking about the things we do like. \xa0First off, Jay and I talk out flooring options for your home. \xa0We break down the "green" attributes of various floors like cork, bamboo and wood, we discuss colors and trends, then we top it off with a quick guide to pricing so you can know what to expect as you start your research. \xa0So if you\'re designing a new home or remodeling your existing space, this is definitely an episode you don\'t want to miss! | Water is essential for life, yet can cause so much destruction. \xa0Building a healthy home requires the use of many materials, very few as important as what we\'ll be discussing today. \xa0Etienne Gubler of Siga North America joins us today to discuss how his company\'s tapes, wraps and membranes can eliminate the destructive element of water intrusion, and allow our well-built homes to last far beyond the typical service life we get here in North America. \xa0Plus, we take a few questions from the mailbag. \xa0 Siga -\xa0https://www.siga.swiss/us_en\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Jay and I today take a deep dive into the extremely important topic of chemical offgassing. \xa0What is it?

Over the years she evolved that passion into a cut flower business, and Gabriel’s Garden was soon formed.

As an artisan florist and grower of fine flowers, Gabriel now sows, grows and delivers seasonal flowers fresh from her Norfolk gardens.

Like the true plantspeople they are, they spent most of the time in the floral marquee, marvelling at how many retro plants seem to be back on trend. From previously disdained Heathers to mumsy Chrysanthemums, the tide has changed. New breeding, new innovation, and new attitudes mean that lots of plants are being re-invigorated for new and old gardeners alike. We speak to Andy’s Airplants, Chrysanthemums Direct, Ottershaw Cacti, The Hebe Society, Calamazag Nursery and Forest Edge Nursery. Plus, we also had a chat with Hayley‘s Lottie Haven (a gardening Instagram luvvie!) who is much younger than Ellen and Michael, and gives an interesting viewpoint. She has largely been gardening without judgment, although she did raise a few eyebrows on the allotment.. Lastly, we find out what happens to all of those plants when the flower show closes.

Here is more about Jaren, in his own words:"I was born and raised in a small agricultural community, but I didn\'t become passionate about agriculture until I had moved to the city and lived there for many years. Shortly after starting my new farmsteading adventure I began teaching how to raise quail on my YouTube channel, "The Urban Aviary". I was later forced to get rid of some of my animals by the city, and so I decided to move my family back to my home town and upscale my farmsteading operations on a 2 acre property. But after the move I still couldn\'t stop thinking of my YouTube channel following, which are mainly urbanites like I recently was. I felt I was leaving them all behind somehow, so I decided that instead of doing livestock like chickens and sheep, I\'d expand my quail operations and do lots of other small scale projects including microgreens, small scale food forestry, aquaculture and aquaponics, Muscovy ducks, vermicomposting and anything else I can do in a small space. It\'s a lot more work, but I hope to give ideas and inspiration to others that can\'t or don\'t want to move to the country but still want to be more self sufficient, self reliant and healthy by growing their own food and raising their own animals"\xa0Resources & Links MentionedUrban Aviary InstagramUrban Aviary Facebook PageUrban Aviary Facebook ForumUrban Aviary EmailUrban Aviary YouTubeUrban Aviary WebsiteTemp StickEmail us!

The Bee Watch App is useful for beekeepers, but also for the general public who may locate swarms and are not sure who to call. It\'s also a great way to track pesticide use in your local area, plus register any spraying that you yourself may be carrying out. The idea behind Bee Watch is the more data we can log and the more beekeepers, those spraying and the general public can exchange information, the more chance we have of ensuring healthy bee colonies and mapping any problems as they occur.

He also includes many edible plants in his schemes in order to create beautiful and useful spaces that engage the community.\xa0 Maintenance and management is a key focus, and is vital to the success and longevity of his projects. We also talk about the need to revise traditional maintenance practices in order to reduce costs, save time and preserve wildlife.\xa0 \xa0 About John Little “John’s life with green roofs started when he self built his own home in Essex. The green roof on John’s new house consisted of the standard green roof structure, onto which he literally dumped soil from the foundations. That was 17 years ago and the roof is still growing strong. A few years ago a colony of Bee Orchids appeared from nowhere!! He has since designed and built small green roofs buildings throughout South Essex and London over the last 20 years. often combining the living roofs with habitat walls made designed to support solitary bees.

Alex is the gardening columnist for the Evening Standard and author of five books on gardening, including her latest ‘Crops in Tight Spots’.\xa0 I speak to Alex about growing edibles when space in tight and she has some brilliant tips and tricks about how to grow, what to grow and what not to bother with. Alex’s book is based on years of experience and I respect her approach of trialling, experimenting (including catching pupae in jars and observing them as they hatch!) and just giving things a go. As a result of this hands-on experimentation, she’s developed some nifty time, money and space-saving methods and she shares some of those with us in the episode. For the rest, you’ll just have to buy the book! \xa0 About Alex Mitchell \xa0 “Alex Mitchell is a gardening writer who has been obsessed with growing things she can eat for about 20 years.

However, his interest in flowers was truly ignited when he first discovered a magazine called Gardens Illustrated, tucked away in the school library. After being encouraged by his teacher, he decided to pursue his new found passion.Despite continually discovering new found inspiration his dream, broadly speaking, remained the same as when he first started breeding roses as an amateur, all those years ago: to create the perfect garden worthy rose that combines beauty, fragrance, repeat-flowering ability and good disease resistance with great charm – the quality his English Roses are most renowned for. As he said in his book, The English Roses, he had one goal that was more important than any other, “… that we should strive to develop the rose’s beauty in flower, growth and leaf.” Of fragrance he wrote, “[It] may be said to be the other half of the beauty of a rose”.A beautiful display at the recent Chelsea Flower Show had these beautiful words about him, "A Life Lived in Full Bloom." And, his life truly was lived that way.\xa0Our friend and writer, Lynn Hunt, had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Austin and has shared her story with us. Listen in...Voices From The Garden is a series of broadcasts by gardeners who share with us an intrinsic mix of life lessons, faith stories, and glorious gardening adventures, exclusively on the Rose Chat Podcast.

They might think it’s a movement and friends it is! This is the World Organic News for the week ending the 9th of September 2019. Jon Moore reporting! Decarbonise the air, recarbonise the soil! Well folks, we are one week away from the RegenEarth Online Conference 2019: Living Soils - Backyard Regen. A little background should be helpful. After years of publishing this podcast, I had great hopes during our last federal election for some movement on the Climate situation. The vaguely left side was and still is stuck in the renewables are the answer paradigm. Not bad but only half the story, as we all know. The more right of centre parties pretty much ignored the climate policy area. The right won the election. The upshot of this was a couple of weeks of, not quite depression but more disappointment and confusion. Clearly something has to be done. The UN and the major NGOs all point to the need for a political solution. This never sat well with me despite my hope against reality that a political party might come up with something other than a carbon tax.\xa0 My problem with a carbon tax is that it places the costs on the poorest and allows the equity traders who must take some responsibility for our current situation to continue to profit from “fixing” the situation. Combine this with the obvious solution of renewables and pumped hydro to carbonise the energy system and this solution is being driven by price signals. Most houses in Australia have solar PV and pumped hydro systems linked to wind and solar are being approved. Carbon tax unnecessary, a need to suck carbon out of the air still exists even if we stopped putting any more into the air today. The other issue I have with the large lobby groups is that they scream we all have to change how we live to save the planet as they jet off to yet another self congratulatory talk fest. Yes we need to do something but suggesting we live like medieval serfs is not a great sales pitch. Forecasting doom and gloom doesn’t work with humans either. Experience is a great instructor. We have all either lived through or seen the wildfires, the floods, the hurricanes/cyclones increasing in intensity, we know something is up. We just need simple techniques that both make a difference but which first make our lives better. Solar PV is not an inconsiderable investment but the returns make life better, lower power bills and the climate benefits too. After much thought, backyard regen seemed to fit this pattern. Something which brought a return to the individual and made the climate better, little steps at a time. Less dollar investment than solar PV, yet a great way to improve our lives with, as you will see at the conference, far less work than is usually considered part of gardening.\xa0 A change with tangible benefits! Regenerative techniques, as I have banged on about for years on this podcast, are our best hope but no one in the political classes seems to be championing them. A\xa0 bit like a frustrated parent, the thought, “I’ll just do it myself.” popped into my head. Following a production meeting with Rich for another podcast, Permaculture Plus, we bounced a few thoughts around. Out of these came the idea of a regen month. This reduced to a regen week and finally a three night conference. We have plans to keep the story and the movement going after the conference but the three session conference became our focus. People we invited agreed and then had to drop out just as new people arrived to fill the gap and help shape the event. In parallel to this, I was offered a position with a disability support NGO to set up a Horticulture Program. No-dig on a grander scale but using the backyard techniques, just expanded. So months of fun and hard work, have us a week away from the event on the 16th to the 18th of September. 19:00 to 21:00 each night. That’s UTC +10 hours for those not on Eastern Australian Time. For those who sign up, a full recording will be available in case life happens and you can’t get there or the time zone thing means a two in the morning start. Now to the conference: Rich and I are really pleased with the way it’s all come together. The flow is great. Night one sets the stage: “Why Regen Matters” with Liz Bastion followed by Catherine Lockley explaining the importance of local food beyond the usual “food pyramid” thinking and we conclude our first night with Stephen Alton: Soil Evangelist. What this man has forgotten about soil is more than most of us have ever learned. Night two begins with my presentation on a no-dig garden followed by Be Ryan on ways to create a backyard biodynamic garden. A different approach and one worth thinking about. Then we finish off night two with Dan Hatfield on building a compost pile. This presentation is one of the best I’ve ever seen on the art and science of this soil creation process. Night Three kicks off with Kate Willoughby on the gentle art of integrating chickens into a backyard garden. Meg McGowan follows, covering the principles of setting up a backyard permaculture garden. Night three and the conference concludes with Rich and I bringing it all together, answering any questions that have come in over the previous nights, and where to next. I’m sure you’d find the event of great value and enormous fun too. This is our chance to start turning suburbia into a giant carbon sink and you get carrots too. Or strawberries or nuts or eggs or whatever your favourite thing to eat fresh is. And all this is available for $67 AUD.

För ett tag sedan så konsulterade Trädgårdssnacks Annika Sjölin en tjej som heter Karin från Stockholm om planering av en ny trädgård. Karin hade massor av idéer som hon ville bolla. Därför ägnar vi detta avsnitt till nybyggare eller dom som skall göra en ny del i trädgården. | Detta är vårt 13:e avsnitt denna fredag den 13 september så därför går veckans avsnitt av Sveriges nya trädgårdspodd i nattsvart.... Vet inte om detta avsnittet kan passa gothare men vi tror att det finns många i likhet med oss som fascineras av svarta växter. Anna Rolff från Flyinge Plantshop hjälper till i veckans avsnitt med svarta växter och hur man lyfter dem till himmelens höjder genom att dem gott sällskap... | Veckans avsnitt handlar om en grön 50-års jubilar som minns barrväxtfrossa på 70-talet, byasten på 80-talet och alla blåa klot på 90-talet, välstädade stenträdgårdar på början av 2000-talet och de senaste årens vurm för egenodlade grönsaker, bi, humlor och tillbaka till naturen. Den här veckan tittar vi bakåt på trädgårdstänk applicerbart i en grön framtid! | I våras gjorde vi ett avsnitt för er som behövde fylla på med tidigblommande perenner. Veckans avsnitt är för Er som inte redan har för mycket utan får plats med ögonfröjd under sensommaren. Annika Sjölin och Anna Rolff från Flyinge Plantshop bjuder på buskar och växter som gör humlor och fjärilar glada. Det blir också snack om vårlökar (hög tid att sätta dessa redan nu om man vill ha dem i rabatten till vårkanten). | I veckans avsnitt av Trädgårdssnack har Annika ett mission att få in fler barrväxter i framtidens trädgårdar. Detta mest för att det är svårt och därför en intressant utmaning. Svårigheten med barrväxter i 2000-talets trädgårdar att många har förutfattade meningar om barr: dystra, oregerliga, stickiga och omoderna.... | Dags att ta hand om trädgärden nu när sommaren kommit en bit på väg. I veckans avsnitt av Trädgårdssnack plockar vi fram sågar, sekatörer och grensaxar och drar igång JAS d.v.s.  beskärningssäsongen som varar juli, augusti och september. Du får tips på verktyg och vilka som trivs bästa att beskäras mer eller mindre eller inte alls.  Hasse Strandberg från retro FM och Annika Sjölin från Flyinge Plantshop är dina trädgårdskompisar även denna vecka. | Snacka om att nå oanade höjder. I veckans avsnitt sätter vi någon att bo på ca en kvadratmeter som kan täcka ett helt hus eller i alla fall nästan... . VI väljer klätterväxter till huset med avseende på både jord, ljus, vind och stöd. Det blir diskussioner om växten skall fästa eller inte fästa på fasaden och det blir också tips på klätterväxter som garanterat blir kvarterets snackis. | När det kanske bär iväg för en vecka eller två med intressanta trädgårdsresemål i England, Italien eller i Sverige behöver trädgården där hemma lite extra kärlek och omsorg. I veckans avsnitt förbereder vi trädgården för att kunna tas om hand av hjälpsam granne eller släkting utan för mycket besvär för trädgårdsvakten. | Även i tidigare säsonger har vi pratat om väldoft i trädgården, t.ex. avsnitt sex förra året då vi hade näsan i vädret . Många vill ha en växt som blommar vackert hela sommaren och doftar gott, är vackert vinter grön, som inte får löss och är lagom stor. Den växten får du leta efter för den finns inte (om du inte köper en plastblomma och sprejar den med favoritparfymen). I veckans avsnitt gör vi dock ett försök att hitta en växt som kommer i närheten av denna utopi.... | Den som känner sig desperat och vill göra något så snabbt det bara går kan säkert få en hög med tips i veckans program. Vi stimulerar gästernas sinnen med ljud, doft och färg. Emma Berg från Flyinge Plantshop är med som idéförstärkning och hjälper Annika och Hasse att trolla med växtmaterial. Vi får tips på hur man skapar en storslagen entré till festlokalen eller partytältet med hjälp av staplade pallkragar. Detta avsnittet är för sommarens festfixare!

They prefer to run away to avoid danger, but are capable of flying short distances. Bit like the brush turkey.Usually they hang around in pairs\xa0The common name of the family is derived from the presence of prominent\xa0rictal bristles\xa0- three stiff, hair-like feathers curving downwards on either side of the gape.As with fantails and flycatchers, their bristles assist in catching insects.Bristlebirds have previously been seen in south-western Western Australia and south-eastern South Australia, but unfortunately frequent burning has led to their extinction in W.A.Have you seen a Rufous Bristlebird?If you have any questions for me or for Holly, why not write in to\xa0Realworldgardener@gmail.com\xa0or write in to 2rrr, PO Box 644 Gladesville NSW 1675. | Henley\xa0 Green Community Garden UpdateThere are many reasons to join a community garden: learn a new skill, teach your kids where food comes from, save money, help the environment, have a reason to get outside regularly and share with others.Chickens at Henley Green Community gardenThese reasons — and many more keep the people who grow food at a community garden.Let’s catch up with what’s happening in the local community garden at Henley.I\'m speaking with Nicole Miranda from the Happy Hens Community garden in Henley.If you are interested in joining the community garden at Henley you need to first register your interest by filling in a form from their website\xa0www.happyhens.org.auIf you have any questions for me or for Nicole, please write in to\xa0realworldgardener@gmail.com | PLANT OF THE WEEKPlectranthus argentatus: Silver ShieldThis week we have a native plant that has velvety leaves, sage green foliage and blue flowers.It’s in the mint family, so it’s got square stems.I’m not sure why some people think that only exotics come from the mint family.Australia has quite a few members that fit into this category.Let’s find out what’s good about this one.I\'m speaking with new contributor, Adrian O’Malley, horticulturist and native plant expert.“Plectranthus” is a combination of 2 Greek words that mean “spur” (plectron) and “flower” (anthos).Argentatus is Latin for silver.Plectranthus argentatus or Silver Shield prefers partial shade but will grow in full sun as long as the soil’s not too poor.\xa0Can also grow in full shade and tolerate light frosts, that’s down to -2 C.Excellent in dry shade.The best spot for it though is in well drained soil near trees, also a great plant for containers.If you have any questions for me or for Adrian or would like some seeds of the Snow Wood tree, please write in to\xa0realworldgardener@gmail.com | SPICE IT UPSaltIs salt a spice a seasoning or something else?Is there more than one type of salt?Why should we use it rather than leave it out?Did you know that culinary salts come in two basic categories - sea salt and mined salt?All this and more about salt. I\'m talking with Ian Hemphill from\xa0www.herbies.com.auLet’s find outSalt is actually a mineral, not a spice which means it doesn’t lose its flavour over time like spices and herbs do.Salt is used as a seasoning, and is just NaCl or sodium chloride.Most dishes that would be spiced will contain salt.There are many types of salts on the market but they fall into two categories.1) salts with impurities, that give a different flavour.2) salts with different textures.An example the first is\xa0Murray River pink salt. The colour is pink because of the minerals that the aquifer has flown through.Rock salt is mined salt.Murray River Pink SaltIndian Black salt\xa0is also mined salt. Initially\xa0 the big chunks that are mined are deep purple to almost black in colour. However, when it is crushed, it becomes a pale pink in colour. Exudes a pungent odour.this salt is a key ingredient in\xa0 \'chat masala\' which also contains cumin, coriander seed and asefetida.\xa0if requestingd the salted version of the drink lassi , it will contain chat masala.All salt originates in sea water, but sea salt is evaporated from liquid ocean water, while mined salt is taken from ancient deposits left by long-dry seas.Ian\'s Secret Tip: salt is cheap and heavy and added to some spice blends to make them cheaper so watch out and just buy the best.If you have any questions either for me or for Ian, you can email us\xa0Realworldgardener@gmail.com\xa0or write in to 2rrr, PO Box 644 Gladesville NSW 1675. | PLANT OF THE WEEKParachidendron pruinosum: Snow Wood Tree.There are some plants, be it trees, shrubs, perennials or annuals, which don’t make it into the mainstream of plant shops, not even online.Whether it’s because people aren’t aware of its existence or because it’s hard to propagate in large number, the fact remains, it’s just not out there.But there are plenty of good reasons why you should grow a Snow Wood.Snow Wood fruits after opening.Let’s find out I\'m talking with new contributor, to "plant of the week" segment,\xa0 Adrian O’Malley, horticulturist and native plant expert.The fragrant flowers are pom-pom like heads, greenish-white or golden yellow and darkening with age.Flowering time is\xa0October to January. The fruit pod matures from February to June .Fruit pods are very attractive, twisting when they split open to reveal black shiny large seeds and look a bit like acacia fruit pods.\xa0Seeds are black, shiny and mostly flat, oval in shape.\xa0Germination tip:Scarification of the seeds helps germination, which is slow but fairly reliable.Seen in RBG Sydney near the Moor building.\xa0Pararchidendron pruinosum\xa0is an Australian rainforest tree naturally occuring from the Shoalhaven River in New South Wales to Herberton in north Queensland.\xa0Also found in New Guinea and Indonesia.If you have any questions for me or for Adrian or would like some seeds of this tree, please write in to\xa0realworldgardener@gmail.com | PLANT DOCTORMulches,Mulches, MulchesHere we are again, talking about mulches when you probably want to hear about something more interesting right? There’s a reason why gardeners keep talking about mulches, and that is, it’s an important part of gardening whether we like it r not.\xa0\xa0And, there’s a right way and a wrong way to spread the mulch.I\'m talking with Steve Falcioni from\xa0www.ecoorganicgarden.com.au.\xa0Mulches are important, especially in areas that are drought affected or are experiencing water restrictions.The mulch locks in soil moisture and keeps soil cool in warm weather.Applying mulch can be a bit of a chore, but it\'s worth it in the long run.The reverse is true in cold weather, where the mulch acts a sort of blanket and helps retain heat in the soil layer.Mulch also acts as a barrier to weed seeds and helps with wind erosion.Over the years the advice as to how much mulch to apply has changed.Fine mulch shouldn’t be more than 1cm thick, but chunky mulches, can be around 5cm thick.Remember of course, that organic mulches bring microbial life to your soil, whereas the inorganic, mostly chunky mulches are just a layer of protection.TIP: Leave some space around the trunk of trees, as it may encourage fungal growth or collar rot if right up against the main trunk.If you have any questions either for me or for Steve, you can email us\xa0Realworldgardener@gmail.com\xa0or write in to 2rrr, PO Box 644 Gladesville NSW 1675.', 'chan_desc': 'Extracts from Real World Gardener radio program on 2RRR 88.5fm in Sydney, Australia.

De findes i stort set alle danske haver og varierer i form, farve og funktion. Vi tager temperaturen på danskernes hække og buske anno 2019 og giver tips til, hvordan du kan tænke ud af boksen, når du skal vælge nyt, hvordan du plejer det eksisterende, og hvordan du kan bruge hække og buske til mere end bare at omkranse din have. | En naturlig have fyldt med farverige blomster, nyttige dyr og masser af skønne dufte - det er drømmen for mange haveejere. Vi forsøger at bringe dig ét skridt tættere på drømmen i dette afsnit, der handler om at få mere natur i haven, på terrassen eller altanen. | En have skal rumme hele familien - og indbyde til hygge og samvær. Vi sætter i dette afsnit fokus på, hvordan du med simple metoder kan få mere leg og samvær i haven til gavn for hele familien. | Bæredygtighed, genbrug og økologi er i fokus i denne episode. Andreas og Jesper besøger Slottet i Smørmosen - en 100% økologisk kolonihave.Økologi og bæredygtighed bliver mere og mere aktuelt for haveejerne. Det ændrer vores tilgang til haven; vi smider mindre affald ud, genbruger mere og tænker i kompost og biodiversitet. Nogle af de effektive steder, vi som haveejere kan sætte ind, er nemlig blandt andet genbrug af jorden og brug af kompost.Lyt med og få flere gode tips til at få mere genbrug, økologi og biodiversitet i din have! | Planteglæde! Andreas er kommet på besøg hos Jesper og hans nogen-og-tusinde planter, der står i hans have. Du får en guide til hvilke planter du skal gå afsted med derhjemme. Og det er uanset om du er barn, øvet eller en rigtig plantenørd. Så lyt med og bliv klogere på hvilken have der passer til lige netop dig. | Sukkulenter, kaktusser, grønne stueplanter. De seneste år har vi set en kæmpe grøn bølge suse ind i de danske hjem. Men hvad bliver det nye spændende, som vi skal indrette med i vores stuer, på altaner og i haven? Haveekspert Jesper Corfitzen er sammen med sin medvært Andreas Saxild taget til gartneriet Lammehave i Ringe på Fyn for at få et bud på, hvad der bliver dette års helt store sællert. Så lyt med og kom på forkant, så det er dine planter, som naboen skuer efter. | Dette afsnit af ‘Mig og min have’ handler om sten. Sandsten for at være mere præcis. Derfor er Jesper og Andreas taget til Sandstone lige udenfor Sorø, som laver sandstensløsninger til haven, terrassen og indkørslen. Der kan være mange gode grunde til at vælge en sandsten i stedet for beton. Ikke mindst fordi det er en mere bæredygtig løsning, hvis man vil have sten i haven. Lyt med og lær alt om, hvordan du selv kommer igang med at lægge sten i haven. | Så er det blevet forår, og det er tid til at komme i gang i haven igen. Det er nemlig nu, du skal planlægge årets projekter, og derfor er vi taget hjem til Lars og Marthe i Odense, der virkelig har fået det bedste ud af deres rækkehushave. Vi giver dig tips til, hvad du selv skal gå i gang med i din have, og hvordan du virkelig får sat fut i oplevelserne og sanserne, der kan imponere selv den mest garvede haveentusiast. | I dette afsnit af ‘Mig og min have’ skal det handle om træer. Træer er en af de discipliner, som vi kan beskæftige os med helt indtil, at jorden bliver bundfrossen, og vi ikke længere kan grave i jorden. Vi tager dig en tur med ud til Arboretet i Hørsholm, hvor du skal møde Arboretmesteren Ole, som giver en tur rundt i Arboretet, som er en samling af løv- og vedplanter. Bagefter er vi taget ud i Jespers have og byder julen indenfor, når vi julehygger, og kigger tilbage på året der gik. | Jesper har en skummel plan om at sende Andreas på insektekspedition og smage på insekter. Bugging Denmark har en fårekyllingefarm og arbejder med thailandske metoder. Fårekyllingerne kravler rundt i æggebakker i varme, tørre og rene forhold.
