Protesters in Iraq clash with police and denounce Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi. Former acting students are suing actor James Franco for sexually exploiting and defrauding them. | The battle over impeachment heats up between Congress and the White House. Will the Trump administration comply with Congress' subpoenas? Kurt Volker will be the first official deposed in the inquiry. Who is he and why is he central to Congress' investigation? And in Dallas, former police officer Amber Guyger is sentenced to 10 years in prison for murdering Botham Jean. | The Trump administration is defying the demands of House Democrats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is accusing the impeachment investigators of bullying. Could this resistance prevent key State Department officials from testifying? In a landmark affirmative action case, a judge ruled that Harvard did not intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants. What are the chances this will end up in the Supreme Court? And it's been one month since Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas. Relief workers are focusing on clearing the vast amounts of debris. As residents still flee, is there any hope life will return to normal? | The impeachment inquiry accelerates as Rudy Giuliani is subpoenaed. And President Trump reportedly asked Australia's prime minister to help with a Department of Justice investigation. What did he ask for, exactly? China's Communist Party marked seventy years in power with pageantry. Tanks, drones, and missiles rolled through Beijing. In Hong Kong, people view the same anniversary differently. What is China's president saying to them as they stage demonstrations again? But there are some worries that Beijing might step in and shut it down. | House Republicans push the Trump administration's message. How's an impeachment inquiry impacting his reelection campaign strategy? Joe Biden may not be the only rival on the minds of the Trump administration. The Washington Post reports the State Department is still investigating Hillary Clinton's emails. Why do some targets of the probe think it's politically motivated? And Hong Kong witnesses one of its most violent weekends of protests. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons. What makes this week especially sensitive? | The whistleblower complaint that started an impeachment inquiry is now public. It alleges that the president's allies tried to conceal details of that phone call with the Ukrainian president. Who were those officials? According to the complaint, the records from that call were put into an electronic system used for highly sensitive classified information. What do we know about that computer system and how often is it used? And in Egypt, rare protests against the government. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is tightening his grip with 2,000 people reportedly arrested. Will that be enough to deter protesters from taking to the streets again today?", 'chan_desc': "NPR's Up First is the news you need to start your day.
