Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US.

In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line.

"Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds.

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\xa0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law. We call it Trump Con Law for short.After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on Apple Podcasts and RadioPublic | Everything in Bethel, Alaska comes in by cargo plane or barge, and even when something stops working, it’s often too expensive and too inconvenient to get it out again.

And it turns out that design can completely change whether a five minute wait feels reasonable or completely unbearable. Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing.

She reveals surprising insights about the way our brains subconsciously experience food -- and shows how this data could help us eat healthier without sacrificing taste. | The US health care system assumes many things about patients: that they can take off from work in the middle of the day, speak English, have a working telephone and a steady supply of food. Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US. In this eye-opening talk, he shares stories of the challenges low-income patients face -- and how we can build a better system for all. | Conservationist and TED Fellow Moreangels Mbizah studied the famous Cecil the lion until he was shot by a trophy hunter in 2015. She wonders how things could\'ve gone differently, asking: "What if the community that lived next to Cecil was involved in protecting him?" In a quick talk, Mbizah shares the state of conservation in her home of Zimbabwe -- and why she thinks that communities living with wildlife are the ones best positioned to help them. | The average farmer in America makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store. They feed our communities, but farmers often cannot afford the very foods they grow. In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line. "We\'re not the goal of evolution," Chakrabarty says. "Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds. Learn how Dr. King has ignited a worldwide movement to create tobacco-free investments and how each of us can play a role in ending this epidemic. | "Building a 30-foot-high concrete structure from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security," says Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican from Texas whose district encompasses two times zones and shares an 820-mile border with Mexico. Speaking from Washington, DC in a video interview with former state attorney general Anne Milgram, Hurd discusses the US government\'s border policy and its controversial detention and child separation practices -- and lays out steps toward a better future at the border. (Recorded at the TED World Theater in New York on September 10, 2019) | Computational geneticist Yaniv Erlich helped build the world\'s largest family tree -- comprising 13 million people and going back more than 500 years. He shares fascinating patterns that emerged from the work -- about our love lives, our health, even decades-old criminal cases -- and shows how crowdsourced genealogy databases can shed light not only on the past but also on the future. | As a sex educator, Emily Nagoski is often asked: How do couples sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term? In this funny, insightful talk, she shares her answer -- drawing on (somewhat surprising) research to reveal why some couples stop having sex while others keep up a connection for a lifetime. | It\'s time for planetary-scale interventions to combat climate change -- and environmentalist Tim Flannery thinks seaweed can help. In a bold talk, he shares the epic carbon-capturing potential of seaweed, explaining how oceangoing seaweed farms created on a massive scale could trap all the carbon we emit into the atmosphere. Learn more about this potentially planet-saving solution -- and the work that\'s still needed to get there.', 'chan_desc': "Want TED Talks on the go?

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets.

So junk accumulates. Diane McEachern has been a resident of Bethel for about 20 years, and she’s made it her personal mission to count every single dead car in the city.

And it turns out that design can completely change whether a five minute wait feels reasonable or completely unbearable. Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing. They cut across communities like monuments to the conflict, etched into the physical landscape. Taking them down isn’t going to be easy.Peace Lines | During the depths of the Depression in the late 1930s, 300 craftspeople came together for two years to build an enormous scale model of the City of San Francisco. This Works Progress Administration (WPA) project was conceived as a way of putting artists to work while also creating a planning tool for the city to imagine its future.The massive work was meant to remain on public view for all to see, but World War II broke out and the 6,000 piece, hand-carved and painted wooden model was put into storage for almost 80 years.Model CityThis episode was produced by The Kitchen Sisters, Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson with Nathan Dalton and Brandi Howell.

Today, bees have become more livestock than wild creatures, little winged cows, that depend on humans for food and shelter.On Beeing | When confronted with trash piling up on a median in front of their home in Oakland, Dan and Lu Stevenson decided to try something unusual: they would install a statue of the Buddha to watch over the place.

Inside the dome, there was a man-made savannah. A rainforest. A farm. An ocean with tropical coral reef. And all of these habitats would be populated with life. Things did not go according to plan. But was it a failure? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | In 1938, Hitler’s chief architect Albert Speer started redesigning Berlin for a New Order, elements of which exist today. The Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin features designs that specifically evoke the Third Reich. Following the end of World War II, the airport became a crucial access point for the US and British to bring food through the Berlin Blockade. It was closed in 2008, and then became a park, and emergency refugee housing. But the buildings remain. What do we do with the everyday reminders of a dark history? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | The Oneida Community was founded in upstate New York in 1848 by John Humphrey Noyes, a former theological student who believed that paradise could be found on Earth through nontraditional sexual and familial structures, including complex marriages and communal childraising. Hundreds of people followed him, and for many years their community succeeded. But the center could not hold, and the community pivoted — into a thriving business that became one of the world’s most prominent makers of flatware. \xa0 | Suburban developments built in the 1950s were idyllic communities and gave many people their first opportunity at home ownership, but typically excluded African Americans. While William Levitt used explicit racial covenants and other tactics to keep his famed Levittown developments white, one builder used racial quotas to create an integrated community — and succeeded, for a while. Can the suburbs be a utopia for all? | Following the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru commissioned famed architect Le Corbusier to design the city of Chandigarh, to signal India’s rise on the world stage. But the city’s architecture and design has become known more for its Western modernist roots, and less as a symbol of Indian nationalism, and furniture that had been intended for the masses are now being auctioned off as high art pieces that wind up in Kourtney Kardashian’s dining room. | Most people today know the story of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in America, from the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, and especially from the 1995 Disney animated film. A gripping recounting of the true story of how the settlement failed and recovered, and the toll it took on the English and Native Americans, shows how failure can be a transformative experience, and also how the stories we tell ourselves about the failures inform the way we live today.

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\xa0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law. We call it Trump Con Law for short.After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on Apple Podcasts and RadioPublic | Everything in Bethel, Alaska comes in by cargo plane or barge, and even when something stops working, it’s often too expensive and too inconvenient to get it out again.

Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing.

She gives us brilliant tips for looking and feeling instantly more energized (her two-tone blush trick is life-changing), how to look and feel as vibrant as she does at sixty-two, and why she looks in the mirror rarely, sprinkles salt in her drinking water, and eschews foundation. (We also hear about building a billion-dollar brand, authoring eight books, raising happy kids, and maintaining a happy marriage—the woman is more than miraculous.) We found ourselves scrambling to take notes, and you will, too. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Skin-care guru, CEO, Vermont farmer, single mom, Latina, clean crusader…it’s hard to put Tata Harper in a box.\xa0 Famous for her gorgeous, fast-acting, high-tech serums, oils, masks, and essences—and for creating all-natural luxury skin care before anyone else had mastered melding the two—Harper knows her stuff about skin and about clean beauty. She’s also one of the most glamorous people we know. She talked to us about her path from girl growing up in Colombia to self-possessed founder of an enormously successful company. Her strategies—for keeping your skin in beautiful shape no matter what your age, for scheduling asa powerful form of self-care (the woman never procrastinates, believe it or not), and for balancing work and life so they always make you happy—are life-changing. You’ll also find out what goes into a superserum that costs $450, why Harper believes all-natural is the way to go, and why (if you needed more reasons) you should make the shift to clean beauty.\xa0 (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | As perfumer Douglas Little creates sexy, moody, wildly original, stunningly gorgeous scents, he’s changing the toxic fragrance industry. In this episode, he talks about the sexiness inherent in natural materials, what it’s like to make perfume with GP for goop, why his line of perfumes is called Heretic, why the link between sexuality and scent is so powerful, the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of using botanicals instead of synthetic chemicals, and what Flower Porn is all about. From his childhood fascination with the dirt and (sometimes poisonous) plants in the garden and his career in the wild world of luxury perfumes to some shocking things about fragrance—like why it’s one of the most toxic categories in the entire beauty industry and what it is about conventional scents that gives people headaches—Little’s story is absolutely fascinating. He’s so smart and has such a beautiful imagination—who knew that clean perfume could be as sexy and cool as he’s managed to make it? (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Even if you’d never wear bright-red lipstick, bestselling author Rachel Felder’s take on it is brilliant, funny, original, and wildly entertaining. She shares a ton of incredible tips and answers questions we didn’t know we even had: What to do about lipstick when a hookup gets super-steamy? What’s the perfect shade for your skin? What’s the psychology involved in wearing—or even just seeing—red lipstick? Matte or glossy? Do people respond differently to women wearing lipstick? What’s the ultimate way to apply it? Felder is charming, a master storyteller, and full of quirky personal anecdotes that will stick with you long after you’re done listening to our conversation. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | What’s the difference between Botox and fillers? Can cutting out dairy actually help with acne? Which lasers work best for darker skin types? Is there a fix for dark circles? When you just want to look a little fresher, less broken-out, a little less tired, but above all, like yourself, you go to top NYC dermatologist Robert Anolik. He makes you look better, not done. We could have asked Dr. Anolik questions all day—and he could’ve kept answering them, as he seems to know everything on earth about skin. There are so many ways to treat both the face and the body now, and he takes us through which treatments and procedures really work, how to look your best as you age, strategies to cope with acne, and what can be done for everything from undereye bags or a pooch-y stomach to sun damage and wrinkles. He’s smart, he’s funny, and this episode will arm you with precisely what you need to know before you step into the dermatologist’s office (and help you figure out whether you should go in the first place). (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Before Rosemarie Swift was a famous makeup artist for supermodels like Gisele, and before she founded one of the most successful and luxurious clean beauty brands ever, RMS Beauty, she got terribly sick. Her body, overloaded with heavy metals from the conventional makeup she worked with every day, was in serious trouble. Uncovering why and how the toxins in beauty products were affecting her health changed her whole life—diet, lifestyle, and eventually, her career. Swift translated rage into action, creating one the most beautiful natural makeup lines on the planet. Her story is inspiring for sure, but also , shocking, and funny: Swift tells it like it is, no matter what she’s talking about, whether it’s getting her start in a Vancouver strip club, or how she thinks the coconut-oil industry is like the cocaine industry (every one of her gorgeous products is made with the purest coconut oil). The bonus: Her easy but brilliant makeup tips. You’ll learn everything about how to do the prettiest, most natural-looking no-makeup makeup for glowy, healthy-looking skin. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Can a thread lift really replace a face-lift? Are there little tweaks that can refresh your appearance without looking overdone? How and why do different skin tones age differently? What is it we’re registering when someone looks “off”—and what has that come to signify in our culture? We had endless questions for world-famous plastic surgeon Julius Few, and he blew us away with his knowledge, candor, and truly surprising ideas and techniques. In this episode, he talks about the fourth dimension (in terms of beauty), how he stacks less-invasive treatments in place of full-on surgery, and why too much filler can actually make someone look older—plus, he gives incredible tips on how to keep your face and body looking their best long-term. No matter how you feel about plastic surgery, this is a wildly fascinating conversation.(For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | From her first job as an assistant at a hair salon in Australia to her current role as CEO of KORA Organics (a goop favorite), female founder and former supermodel Miranda Kerr talks about all that her amazing career has taught her. Her path to founding one of the most successful skin-care companies in the clean beauty space involved a lot of surprises. After burning out as a world-famous Victoria’s Secret Angel, she woke up to the facts about the toxic ingredients in conventional beauty products—and went to work on the problem as an entrepreneur. And her roles as wife, mother, and daughter bring up issues we can all relate to and, we found, get super inspired by. We love her brilliant ideas on work-life balance, why she prioritizes date nights with her husband, and her (really good) makeup and skin tips that she’s learned on shoots all over the world. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.)hub.) | Nneka Leiba, the vice president of healthy living science at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), talks about clean, nontoxic beauty and the shocking truth behind the largely unregulated beauty and personal-care industry. Leiba and her team assess the health effects of chemical exposure from day-to-day products—and what she tells us is both grim and galvanizing. A few of the topics we go into: why black girls go through puberty much earlier than girls of other races, the most important beauty product to go clean with, why spray sunscreen is a real problem, and much more. If you’ve ever remotely considered going clean with your beauty routine, if you’ve ever wondered why companies would use known toxic ingredients in their products, or if you just want to understand the facts around this issue, this episode is really going to make you think. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | In the premiere episode of goop’s new podcast, The Beauty Closet, hosts Jean Godfrey-June and Megan O’Neill sit down with their boss, goop founder and CEO Gwyneth Paltrow, and really talk. In between discussions about being, in GP’s words, “f*ckable,” nontoxic beauty, the role diversity plays at goop HQ, crow’s-feet, the weird workings of fame on the sense of self, and the upgrade we all get around age forty, GP gives up her best skin, hair, and makeup tips, including what she did to get her wedding-day glow. (French fries and whisky played a role, as did some beautiful no-makeup makeup.) The no-holds-barred conversation is as fun, serious, and hilarious as GP herself.

That didn’t happen. Here’s what did...Featuring crazy coincidences, heartwarming reunions, sister moms, turkey baster twins, and a stadium full of siblings. | Rebecca Traister checks her phone first thing in the morning: It\'s always full of bad news, but that bad news is her job, and she wants to know what she\'s getting into right away.

That’s what we found out this summer when we stayed at our beach house to manage the duplex rentals - AND IT WAS THE BEST SUMMER OF OUR LIVES. The smaller home and smaller town lessons that we learned really stuck with us when we returned home - and they have already inspired us to make 4 changes to our life and habits back in Richmond. So even if you aren\'t planning to move or downsize, there are some things you could experiment with too. We’re also sharing why we’re fiiiiiinally starting a long-awaited renovation in our house, and one way we\'re kicking a bad habit to the curb and saving over $500 a year (and creating less waste).

But our first rental season wasn’t without hiccups, high anxiety moments, and surprisingly frequent learning opportunities. So this week we’re taking you behind the scenes of a jam-packed few months of learning the hospitality ropes while juggling guests and (more literally) a very full jug of laundry detergent. Sherry also celebrates the end of a very long “personal renovation” and we share how something simple led us to rethink our approach to cooking dinner.\xa0  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-146 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | This week we’re diving into a survey that reveals the top homebuyer regrets - as in what features their homes have that they ended up not loving (and the results may surprise you!). \xa0A new study also concluded some shocking-to-us things about millennial dads versus their baby boomer counterparts - and we have some big feelings about one aspect of the results.

We also got a refreshing reminder that it’s liberating to acknowledge that you don’t have to be good at everything - especially in a social media world where everyone else seems to have it all figured out.

But unlike most of our episodes with multiple guests, they aren’t looking to find titles they’ll enjoy together. Mia & Micah already read the same books frequently, so we’re looking to individualize their reading lives with totally separate recommendations.\xa0Mia is looking to introduce a little romance to her bookshelves… without leaving her comfort zone of action and adventure behind. Meanwhile Micah battles a classic middle-sibling problem... all her books end up being hand-me-downs, so she’s looking for a good mystery novel (or better yet, a series) that’s exactly suited to HER taste first and foremost.\xa0Click over to the podcast website for a list of books mentioned in this episode:\xa0http://whatshouldireadnextpodcast.com/202Get another double feature of What Should I Read Next by becoming a supporter on Patreon at patreon.com/whatshouldireadnext!

Brian is the kind of reader who wants to chew on big ideas, follow characters from childhood to old age to see what makes people tick, and who loves big juicy family sagas. But he also has a taste for the unusual, so Anne recommends 3 titles that hopefully hit more than one target.Click over to the podcast website for a list of books mentioned in this episode:\xa0http://whatshouldireadnextpodcast.com/201You can follow Brian on Twitter @beichen22, and check out his podcast Story Guys at wearethestoryguys.com/podcast or anywhere you listen to podcasts.

Simple. But long-time listeners know this show was originally supposed to be a tight 20 minutes… and today, each episode is easily twice that long. It turns out, a person’s reading taste reveals a lot about who they are as individuals, and digging into those discussions is worth much more to the WSIRN team than hitting a timestamp.Today’s guest is no stranger to seemingly-mundane belongings that hold deep meaning - Tara Anderson hosts the NPR show 5 Things, where she gets to know people by discussing five items that matter to them. A guest\'s treasured items might be books, but they might also be a houseplant, a special coat, heirloom knitting needles, even something as practical as a rice cooker. There are no home appliances in this episode, but Anne is investigating what Tara’s 3 favorite titles say about what she wants out of life, and what new books will take her there.\xa0Click over to the podcast website for a list of books mentioned in this episode:\xa0http://whatshouldireadnextpodcast.com/199Follow Tara on Instagram and Twitter, and make sure to go check out her newest project at musicboxpod.org\xa0Thanks to today\'s sponsor:Brooklinen sells luxury sheets, towels and bedding without the luxury markup—which helped make them the winner of the “Best of Online Bedding” category by Good Housekeeping.

As a result of this experience, the books she craves are different now, and every book purchase feels weighty.Anne is connecting Amelia with three books that will hopefully take some of that heaviness off her shoulders and let her choose a different world to escape into, just for a few hours.\xa0CONTENT WARNING: Amelia tells her story of surviving an enormous natural disaster in heartbreaking detail, and it might be too much for anxious or sensitive listeners.

He’s an imaginative reader who appreciates the escapist quality of a good novel, but has struggled lately to find books that call out for him to live between their pages.\xa0Fantastic escapist reading can be found in any genre, so today Anne recommends three books to Anudeep that you’d find on completely different bookstore shelves.

Every year, we gather every Captain (Manager) from every Trader Joe’s across the country together, in one place, to let them know where we’re going, say thanks for all the great things that have happened over the last year, and to give them some useful information to bring back to their stores. We’ll hear about some delicious new products (even for pets!) coming soon to a Trader Joe’s near you, and we’ll have a little fun with our Captains along the way. \xa0   Episode 17 Transcript (PDF) | In this episode, we’re digging deep into the world of Produce. Chances are, you don’t spend so much time thinking about your greens, your berries, your stone fruits, your avocados… (well, you probably do think about avocados quite a bit). The thing is, we spend loads of time thinking about all of it, so all you have to think about is what looks good when you walk into your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. We find out what it takes to ensure every one of our 488 stores gets the best produce we can find, from all around the world; we talk packaging, and steps we’re taking to reduce our produce packaging; and we’ll answer the burning question… what’s more popular, fruit or veggies?  Episode 16 Transcript (PDF) | In this episode, we’re tackling the questions YOU (our listeners) asked. From the pretty straightforward “How do you decide what to sell?” and “How do you know what your customers want?” to the more philosophical “Why don’t you have WiFi?” and “Why not sell your products online?” We collected your questions and gathered some super knowledgeable Crew Members to help us answer them. Tune in to find out, once and for all, why we don’t carry diapers, and why we do plan to keep introducing limited availability products. \xa0  Episode 15 Transcript (PDF) | We get a lot of questions here at Trader Joe\'s; perhaps surprisingly, by far the most common question has nothing to do with the things we sell or the locations of our stores. The question we get the most is, without a doubt, "Why is everyone so nice?" In this episode we take you inside Trader Joe\'s to find out the answer. Come with us to a Trader Joe\'s store in Chicago, and to a session of Trader Joe\'s University (yep, that\'s a thing). Join in on our chat with some of the people responsible for finding the great Crew Members you encounter in our stores. Discover some of our Crew\'s favorite TJ\'s products. It\'ll be nice. We promise. \xa0  Episode 14 Transcript (PDF) \xa0 | It\'s the episode where we talk about the abundant flowers and plants you\'ll find at your neighborhood Trader Joe\'s. We travel the world in search of the most beauteous blooms and festive flowers, and we bring them to you at prices that really define value. How on earth do we do it? Have a listen. Got a question you\'d really like to ask the folks who make things happen here at TJ\'s? Send it to us at podcastquestions@traderjoes.com. We\'ll use as many questions as we can in an upcoming episode of Inside Trader Joe\'s.  Episode 13 Transcript (PDF) | Come with us on a delicious journey through the freezer case at Trader Joe\'s. Hear how frozen foods can be fresher than the "fresh" foods; come along as we sample some of our Customers\' favorite frozen finds at a neighborhood Trader Joe\'s; find out about some new treats coming soon to a Trader Joe\'s near you. Along the way, we\'ll share some info about how long frozen food keeps in your freezer (a good long time, it turns out), and the very best way to prepare our much-loved Cauliflower Gnocchi. If you\'re a frozen foods fanatic, or even if you\'re more fickle about freezer fare, this episode of Inside Trader Joe\'s will leave you hungry for more. (Figuratively and literally, we hope) \xa0  Episode 12 Transcript (PDF) | Our approach to sustainability is simple. We all want to leave the planet a better place than we found it. At Trader Joe\'s, we\'re working hard to do just that, in part by reimagining how we approach packaging in our stores. We\'ve eliminated certain types of packaging, we\'re reducing other types of packaging, and we\'re taking steps to remove more than a million pounds of plastic over the next year alone! We\'re going to the store, to a recycling plant, and to a next-generation manufacturing facility dedicated to making a positive impact, one plastic bottle at a time. \xa0  Episode 11 Transcript (PDF) | At Trader Joe\'s, we are focused on growing, every day – with every product, in every store. We\'re opening new stores, hiring new Crew Members, meeting new Customers, and developing new products. Whew! In this episode, we talk about finding new store locations, we chat with customers at one of our original East Coast stores, and we look forward to some delicious new products coming to your neighborhood Trader Joe\'s in the year ahead. \xa0  Episode 10 Transcript (PDF) | When we say we travel the world in search of great products for our customers, we really mean it! In this episode, come along with us as we circumnavigate the globe, finding the WOW in locations around the world, from South Korea to Southern California, with stops in places like New Zealand, Thailand, the Republic of Georgia, Puerto Rico, and so many more! \xa0  Episode 9 Transcript (PDF) | It\'s beginning to look a lot like the holidays at Trader Joe\'s! How do we come up with all the great holiday products you\'ll find at Trader Joe\'s every year? How long does it take to make all that delicious stuff come to life? What\'s new this holiday season? And did you know Dog Advent Calendars are a thing? Come Inside Trader Joe\'s and we\'ll help you get into the holiday spirit. Ho Ho Ho ! \xa0  Episode 8 Transcript (PDF)', 'chan_desc': "From our humble beginnings as a small chain of eclectic Southern California convenience stores, Trader Joe’s has grown to become a national chain of 490 (and counting) neighborhood grocery stores, employing more than 43,000 Crew Members.

Bolstered by a new generation of growers in California and New York, plus a thirsty generation of millennials, it is the fastest growing among all alcoholic beverage categories. In this episode we meet the makers and protagonists of this emergent movement. | When we think about food origins, often we talk about the movement of people, plants, animals and ideas. But the study of humans would be an incomplete one without the study of the clay and ceramic vessels, one of humankind’s earliest innovations. If pottery is a conversation with the past, archeologists are our interpreters.Today we’re talking to a whisperer of ancient history, culinary archeologist Jerolyn Morrison. Jerolyn has a Ph.D in archeology specializing in the cooking vessels of ancient Crete.We also talk to Naoko Takei Moore about the miracle of donabe, the ceramic pot that is one of the oldest Japan.

So they followed those prophecies, and though it took a few hundred years, they made their way down the Saint Lawrence River and then into the Great Lakes region where they found wild rice. See more. | When we talk about terroir, it’s usually in the context of wine, and the human and environmental conditions that influence the characteristics. But on a recent visit to California, writer and cook Jasmine Lee began to ask questions about this framing, inspired by an heirloom variety of rice with a beautiful name called, Kokuho Rose. Jasmine, who comes from a lineage of rice merchants in Hong Kong, wondered\xa0 whether it was possible to think about expressions of the land; ie, terroir, without thinking of about the history and politics of land use in the United States. If this heirloom rice is an expression of the land it was grown on, it is also an expression of the trauma and perseverance with the family who worked that land.\xa0Next, Chef BJ Dennis tells us about his move to St. Thomas in 2004, where he encountered black folks from around the West Indies. Upon learning he was from the lowcountry, they preceded to share stories and insight about the Gullah Geechee, a distinctive culture of the\xa0 descendants of West Africa’s rice coast. The experience changed the trajectory of BJ’s career, catalyzing his calling as a chef and scholar of the culture.\xa0 | All fruit come from flowers, but not all flowers become fruit. Once you start to see the two as the same, the world of both grow more interesting. Dates, honey and saffron: we’re gettin sweet and spicy with stories from Egypt to Iran.\xa0In episode 3, we meet Leila Elamine of The Recipe Hunters, Gordon Hull of Heidrun Meadery, and spice expert Ethan Frisch of Burlap and Barrel. | In episode two of Point of Origin, we continue on our theme of preservation, and bring you on a trip to Iceland where we meet a chef turned geothermal salt maker, and a farmer there who’s making an extremely regionally specific dairy product.Thanks to our friends in Iceland, Gisli Grimmson, Bjorn Jonsson of Saltverk, and to Thorgumir Gubratsson of Erpstadir Skyr.

Later, by the eighth century, the range used in Denmark was reduced to sixteen…." — George L. Campbell & Christopher Moseley, The Routledge Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets, 2012"Conveniently, one of the Americans … is an anthropology student studying Scandinavian rituals. His in-depth questions provide context for viewers not steeped in Nordic lore, but it\'s still not always clear what he\'s talking about. For instance, looking over a rune carving …, he guesses \'Younger Futhark?\' only to be told no, \'Elder.\'" — Danielle Burgos, Bustle, 3 July 2019Did you know?The word futhark refers to a writing system used by Germanic peoples, and especially by the Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons, from about the third to the 13th centuries. Its origin is unclear, but a likely theory is that it was developed by the Goths from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy, with perhaps some aspects being influenced by the Latin alphabet of the first and second centuries. The word futhark itself comes from the sounds of the first six letters used in the earliest of the main runic script varieties: f, u, th, a, r, k. While eventually fully displaced by the Latin alphabet, futhark was still used occasionally for charms and memorial inscriptions in Scandinavia into the 16th and 17th centuries. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 3, 2019 is:pursy • \\PER-see\\\xa0 • adjective1 : having a puckered appearance2 : proud because of one\'s wealth especially in the absence of other distinctions : purse-proudExamples:"There was a picture of a pale gent with a narrow face and a woman with dark eyes and a pursy mouth." — Stephen King, Misery, 1987"Some guys get all pursy around the mouth when you suggest this, but figure skating is infinitely harder than ice hockey. Every four years at the Winter Olympics, figure skating fans have to listen to a lot of nonsense about how their sport lacks legitimacy." — Sally Jenkins, The Washington Post, 13 Feb. 2014Did you know?There are two adjectives spelled pursy, each with its own etymology. The one describing a puckered appearance goes back to the mid-16th century and has its source in the noun purse ("a receptacle for carrying money and other small objects"); a drawstring purse\'s puckered appearance is the inspiration. The other pursy (pronounced PUH-see or PER-see) dates from the 15th century and can mean "short-winded especially because of corpulence" or simply "fat." This pursy comes from the Old French word pousser, meaning "to exert pressure" or "to breathe heavily"—the same word, etymologists believe, behind the word push. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 2, 2019 is:sawbones • \\SAW-bohnz\\\xa0 • nounslang : physician, surgeonExamples:"After abandoning his destitute family in 1913, Brinkley bought a medical degree from a \'diploma mill\' in St. Louis. An itinerant preacher assured him that he did not have to be a bona fide sawbones to cure the ills of the world." — Bartee Haile, The Courier (Montgomery County, Texas), 19 Jan. 2018"Anyway, his relatives … reminded him that it\'s hard to shine shoes without a heartbeat. So he went back to his sawbones\xa0to talk about the pacemaker." — Phil Luciano, The Journal Star (Peoria, Illinois), 28 Oct. 2017Did you know?Sawbones cut its first literary tooth in Charles Dickens\'s 1837 novel The Pickwick Papers, when Sam Weller says to Mr. Pickwick, "Don\'t you know what a sawbones is, sir? … I thought everybody know\'d as a sawbones was a surgeon." An evocative term that calls to mind the saws that 19th-century surgeons used to perform amputations, sawbones quickly became an established member of the English language, employed by such authors as H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Mercifully, medical technology has improved dramatically since then (the surgical saws used in procedures today are a far cry from the primitive tools of yesteryear), but the word sawbones is still used, often in a humorous context. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 1, 2019 is:mitigate • \\MIT-uh-gayt\\\xa0 • verb1 : to cause to become less harsh or hostile : mollify2 a : to make less severe or painful : alleviateb : to lessen the seriousness of : extenuateExamples:"Although Apple Hill receives the bulk of their visitors in October, most of its ranches and wineries are open from mid-August through December.… Last year, October traffic was mitigated by a grant-funded pilot program that brought a shuttle to Apple Hill." — Dylan Svoboda, The Mountain Democrat (Placerville, California), 14 Aug. 2019"More important than treating migraines once they come on is avoiding episodes to begin with, says Diamond. That means taking steps to adjust your work routine and office environment as much as possible in order to mitigate the specific factors that prompt episodes." — Alejandro de la Garza, Time, 27 June 2019Did you know?The meaning of mitigate is straightforward enough: it is most often used to talk about making something, such as a problem, symptom, or punishment, less harsh or severe. Sometimes, however, it appears where the similar-looking militate is expected. That word, which is often followed by against, means "to have weight or effect," as in "your unexcused absences might militate against your getting a promotion." The two words are not closely related etymologically (mitigate descends from the Latin verb mitigare, meaning "to soften," whereas militate traces to militare, another Latin verb that means "to engage in warfare"), but the confusion between the two has existed for long enough that some usage commentators have accepted "mitigate against" as an idiomatic alternative to militate. If you want to avoid criticism, you should keep mitigate and militate distinct. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 30, 2019 is:buttress • \\BUTT-russ\\\xa0 • noun1 architecture : a projecting structure of masonry or wood for supporting or giving stability to a wall or building2 : something that resembles a buttress: such asa : a projecting part of a mountain or hillb biology : a horny protuberance on a horse\'s hoof at the heelc botany : the broadened base of a tree trunk or a thickened vertical part of it3 : something that supports or strengthensExamples:"The root system of one of the cedars has been hollowed out into a den, in which Neasloss finds black bear hair. One of the tree\'s buttresses has been chopped long ago by what he recognizes was a nephrite ax, the green jade axes that the coastal people used until 1846, when they adopted steel axes." — Alex Shoumatoff, Smithsonian, September 2015"The modifications to Isabella [Dam] include raising the profile of the main and auxiliary dams 16 feet, adding buttresses and other safety features, and excavating 100 feet deep to build the huge spillway." — Steven Mayer, The Bakersfield Californian, 28 July 2019Did you know?In architecture, a buttress is an exterior support that projects from a wall to resist the sideways force, called thrust, created by the load on an arch or roof. The word buttress was first adopted into English as butres in the 14th century. It came to us from the Anglo-French (arche) boteraz, meaning "thrusting (arch)," and ultimately derives from the verb buter, "to thrust." Buter is also the source of our verb butt, meaning "to thrust, push, or strike with the head or horns." Buttress developed figurative use relatively soon after its adoption, being applied to anything that supports or strengthens something else. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 29, 2019 is:Elysian • \\ih-LIZH-un\\\xa0 • adjective1 : of or relating to Elysium2 : blissful, delightfulExamples:"On such a balmy summer day, on this Elysian isle, anything seemed possible." — Dorothy West, The Wedding, 1995"No matter what one\'s childhood is, a seeming Elysian remembrance or a parental vendetta, the understanding of the afflatus of a poet lies elsewhere." — Edward Dahlberg, "Hart Crane" (1966), reprinted in The Company They Kept (2006)Did you know?In classical mythology, Elysium, also known as the Elysian Fields, was the paradise reserved for the heroes immortalized by the gods. Ancient Greek poets imagined it as the abode of the blessed after death, but in English the concept has more often been applied figuratively. In his history play Henry V, William Shakespeare used the place-name as a word for a peaceful state of sleep enjoyed by a mere mortal, and 18th-century English lexicographer and author Samuel Johnson wrote in The Rambler that in reading pastoral poetry we allow ourselves "to be transported to elysian regions, where we are met with nothing but joy, and plenty, and contentment…" In Walden a century later Henry David Thoreau wrote that "The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life." | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 28, 2019 is:hegemony • \\hih-JEM-uh-nee\\\xa0 • noun1 : preponderant influence or authority over others : domination2 : the social, cultural, ideological, or economic influence exerted by a dominant groupExamples:"According to Chinese analysts\' telling of World War II, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of China proper in 1937 were part of the U.S. strategy to pit the two Asian nations against each other in an endless war that would prevent either from rising to threaten American hegemony in the western Pacific." — Michael Pillsbury, The Hundred-Year Marathon, 2015"The sweeping restrictions come as New York and other cities fundamentally rethink the role of cars in the face of unrelenting traffic that is choking their streets, poisoning the environment and crippling public transit systems by trapping buses and light rail systems in gridlock. It is becoming a moment of reckoning—and, cars, which once had absolute hegemony over the streets, are losing." – Winnie Hu, The New York Times, 8 Aug. 2019Did you know?Hegemony comes to English from the Greek hēgemonia, a noun formed from the verb hēgeisthai ("to lead"), which also gave us the word exegesis (meaning "exposition" or "explanation"). Hegemony was first used in English in the mid-16th century in reference to the control once wielded by the ancient Greek states, and it was reapplied in later centuries as other nations subsequently rose to power. By the 19th century, it had acquired a second sense referring to the social or cultural influence wielded by a dominant member over others of its kind, such as the domination within an industry by a business conglomerate over smaller businesses. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 27, 2019 is:cleave • \\KLEEV\\\xa0 • verb1 : to divide (something) by or as if by a cutting blow : split2 : to separate (something) into distinct parts and especially into groups having divergent views3 : to subject to chemical cleavage4 : to split especially along the grain5 : to penetrate or pass through something by or as if by cuttingExamples:"The surface you\'re cutting against will have a greater impact on your knife\'s edge than the food you\'re chopping up, assuming you aren\'t regularly cleaving through massive bones." — Paul Stephen, The San Antonio Express News, 10 July 2019"Of course, single-item restaurants are nothing new.... But they don\'t usually serve something so divisive as polenta. You see, the slow-cooked dish of maize\xa0cleaves\xa0opinion like a Justin Bieber concert. You either love it or loathe it—and ever has it been so." — Samuel Muston, The Independent (London), 30 Jan. 2014Did you know?Cleave has two homographs, each with a distinct origin. There is cleave meaning "to adhere firmly and closely or loyally and unwaveringly," as in "a family that cleaves to tradition"; that one is from Old English clifian, meaning "to adhere." And there is the cleave with meanings relating to splitting and dividing, which derives from Old English clēofan, meaning "to split." The two have slightly different inflections. The "split" cleave usually has cleaved as its past tense form, but cleft and clove are both in use as well; as its past participle form (the form that often occurs with have), cleaved is most common, but cleft and cloven are also used. The "adhere" cleave commonly has cleaved or clove (and occasionally clave) as its past tense and cleaved as its past participle. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 26, 2019 is:frowsy • \\FROW-zee\\\xa0 • adjective1 : musty, stale2 : having a slovenly or uncared-for appearanceExamples:The lamp, discovered in a frowsy Midwestern antique store, turned out to be quite valuable."On good days, I could also manage super boring reality TV shows, like \'Escape to the Country,\' in which retired British couples go on slow searches for frowsy new homes in sleepy towns, and nobody gets excited about anything." — Yvonne Abraham, The Boston Globe, 24 Nov. 2018Did you know?The exact origins of frowsy are perhaps lost in an old, frowsy book somewhere, but some etymologists have speculated that frowsy (also spelled frowzy) shares a common ancestor with the younger, chiefly British, word frowsty, a synonym of frowsy in both its senses. That ancestor could be the Old French word frouste, meaning "ruinous" or "decayed," or the now-obsolete English word frough or frow, meaning "brittle" or "fragile." An early print example of frowsy can be found in Thomas Otway\'s 1681 comedy The Souldier\'s Fortune, wherein the character Beau refers to another character as "a frouzy Fellmonger." | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 25, 2019 is:lèse-majesté • \\layz-MAJ-uh-stee\\\xa0 • noun1 a : a crime (such as treason) committed against a sovereign powerb : an offense violating the dignity of a ruler as the representative of a sovereign power2 : a detraction from or affront to dignity or importanceExamples:"David\'s grandfather, President Eisenhower, had left David all his clothes in his will, and David felt obliged to wear them…. Naturally, it would be something along the lines of lèse-majesté for him to remove the presidential jacket and vest and sit\xa0in his shirtsleeves, so he gamely continued to sweat in the sweltering heat, out of respect for Ike." — Michael Korda, Another Life, 2000"Thai law makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten \'the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent.\' … Though other countries still have similar laws—both Spain and the Netherlands have lèse-majesté laws on the books—Thailand\'s enforcement of its laws may make them the strictest in the world." — Adam Taylor, The Washington Post, 8 Feb. 2019Did you know?Lèse-majesté (or lese majesty, as it is also styled in English publications) comes into English by way of Middle French, from the Latin laesa majestas, which literally means "injured majesty." The English term can conceivably cover any offense against a sovereign power or its ruler, from treason to a simple breach of etiquette. Lèse-majesté has also acquired a more lighthearted or ironic meaning, referring to an insult or impudence to a particularly pompous or self-important person or organization. As such, it may be applied to a relatively inoffensive act that has been exaggeratedly treated as if it were a great affront.', 'chan_desc': "Build your vocabulary with Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day!

You\'re always an actor. I sleep as an actor. I wake up as an actor.... I always think about art and creativity, and that\'s all I want to do.” -Omid Memar This week’s guest is Omid Memar. He’s a fantastic actor who I recently was able to work with for an upcoming movie called 7500 (we actually recorded this episode at the movie’s premiere in Switzerland). Omid’s acting is incredibly honest and real and heartbreaking and human. He also comes from a very culturally-rich background— he’s from an Iranian family, grew up in Austria, moved to Munich, and graduated from a French school. He’s a young guy that’s really just getting started in his career, so I thought he would be perfect to answer this week’s question from Megan Colbert in Springfield, New York.\xa0 Megan asked, “How do you balance the inner need to create with the practical need to bring in a paycheck?” Omid and I talk about what it’s like to be up-and-coming in the industry, and how the artistry and creativity in acting is often overshadowed by the idea of ‘celebrity’. We also talk about the influence of cultural identity when selecting roles, the creative impact that music has had on each of us, and we top it all off with a touching conversation about our grandmothers.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.  ------ \xa0ABOUT THE GUESTS: Omid Memar is a twenty-year old Iranian actor, who grew up in Vienna before moving to Munich with his family in 2008 where Omid graduated in a French school with a dual-degree in German and French. Omid landed his first acting role at 14 in the German film The Famous Five 4, based on the book series by Enid Blyton. Omid also starred in the Austrian TV Mini-Series M - A City Hunts a Murderer, and the short film Invention of Trust where he was honored with Gold in the Student Academy Awards in 2016.

Liv is one of the most successful professional poker players of all time (she is the only woman in history to win both the World Series of Poker and European Poker Tour Championships). On top of all that, she also just happens to have a degree in astrophysics. She’s an all around fantastic person to have a conversation with, and was particularly great at answering this week’s question from Kent Wilson from Nashville, Tennessee. Kent asked, “When does data-backed decision making begin to have a negative impact on the creative process?” Liv and I get into a great discussion on what constitutes analytical thinking, what the difference is between science and art, and how to listen to your intuition and balance that with data, and logic with reason. So much of creativity nowadays is further and further integrated with data and analytics, and Liv has some great insight on when data is valuable and when you should just go with your gut.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

Before poker she studied Astrophysics, she now focuses her time as a TV host and YouTuber specialising in science, futurism and rationality. She also gives seminars on decision strategy and recently spoke at the annual TED conference about the application of poker thinking to everyday life. In 2014 she co-founded Raising for Effective Giving (REG), a non-profit that promotes a scientific, evidence-based approach to philanthropy known as effective altruism. To date, REG has raised over $11,000,000 for a handful of the most globally impactful and cost-effective charities.\xa0------ SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Liv:- Twitter: @Liv_Boeree- Instagram: @Liv_Boeree- YouTube Channel - LivBoeree.com- Raise for Effective GivingTheories Mentioned:- Game Theory- Scientific Method- Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs- Nash EquilibriumMovies Mentioned:- A Beautiful Mind (2001) People Mentioned:- Donald Hoffman (Psychologist / Author) - Shepard Fairey (Artist / Propagandist) - John Nash (Mathematician) Other Mentions: - Effective Altruism\xa0- Brexit- Burning Man- World Series of Poker- European Poker Tour Champions | “There’s times before my mom and I are about to go onstage to play together, and maybe we just argued right before going on. But there’s something about that moment... where I give her a kiss on the cheek and say, ‘Hey, this started with you and me. Let’s go out there and do this.’” -Madisen Ward My guests this week are Madisen and Ruth Ward, who together are known as the mother-and-son folk band Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear. They’ve appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, NPR’s Tiny Desk Series, and recently released a brand new album called Started With A Family (if you haven’t heard their music yet, I highly suggest you take a listen).\xa0 For this episode, Madisen, Ruth and I tackled a question from Paige Elson from Stockton, California. Paige asked, “What are the benefits and setbacks of working creatively with family?” I’ve always been curious to know how family fits into creativity. Where does creativity come from? Do you get it from your parent’s genes or from the upbringing they provided? Madisen and Ruth brought such an interesting perspective to this question. We talked about how Ruth’s career transformed after she became a mom, how writing and performing music is different when collaborating with family members, what role music played in the Ward household, and we topped it all off with a question about a crab’s perspective.

New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019. ------ABOUT THE GUESTS: Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear consists of Madisen Ward and Ruth Ward. They are a modern soulful/folk music duo from Independence, Mo. The band\'s debut album Skeleton Crew, produced by Jim Abbiss, known for his award-winning work with Arctic Monkeys and Adele, captures Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear in their most natural setting. The two tracked most of the tracks live, sitting across from one another in the recording studio. They didn\'t use a click track. With help from a handful of session musicians, the two Wards captured the sound they\'d been making since those coffeeshop days.\xa0 ------\xa0 SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Madisen and Ruth:-Twitter: @MadisenWardMB-Instagram: @MadisenWardMB-Facebook: Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear-YouTube Channel (One For the Record Series)-MadisenWardandtheMamaBear.comMadisen Ward and the Mama Bear Music Mentioned:-Started With A Family (2019)-Skeleton Crew (2015)-"Dead Daffodils"-"Undertaker and Juniper"MadisenMusic Music Mentioned: -“Skip and the Turtle”-“Weep for the King”-“Big Bad Wolfblood” Other Music Mentioned:-Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards by Tom Waits-“Old Man” by Neil Young-“Clown’s Lament”by @Metaphorest on HITRECORD-Pink Moon by Nick DrakePeople Mentioned:-Isiah Whitlock Jr. (Actor and Ruth’s Brother)-Tom Waits (Singer-Songwriter)-Tracy Chapman (Singer-Songwriter)-Mark Knopfler (Singer-Songwriter)-Bob Dylan (Singer-Songwriter)-The Osmonds (Family Music Group)-Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Composer)-The White Stripes (Musical Group)-Wu-Tang Clan (Hip Hop Group) TV Shows Mentioned:-The Wire (2002-2008)-MacGyver (1985-1992) | For this episode, I’m going to do something a little different. I recently did a TED Talk, and there was something really distinct and special about it. I’m pretty used to performing on stage in front of people as a character or for a show, but it felt different to be on stage delivering in-depth thoughts of my own about an idea that’s important to me.I’m putting this TED Talk on my podcast because it’s about how the creative process can be affected by the attention-driven model of big tech companies, and how you can feel a difference when you try to pay attention vs. get attention.We’ll be back next week with more episodes of CREATIVE PROCESSING. I hope you enjoy. For more TED Talks, subscribe to the podcast TED Talks Daily, where they post a new idea every day. It’s available anywhere you listen to podcasts. Thanks! | “At the end of the day, I’d rather make stuff period than make stuff how I want to make stuff. And specific to us, I’d rather make stuff together even than stuff alone.” -Evan GoldbergMy guests this week are the comedy duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. You\'ve probably heard of their movies Pineapple Express, This Is The End, Neighbors, Superbad, Sausage Party, and most recently Good Boys. They’ve also ventured into the entrepreneurial space with their own cannabis brand, Houseplant. I’ve known these guys are a while, and have had the pleasure of working with them on 50/50 and The Night Before. Seth and Evan are unique in that they do a vast majority of their creative work as a duo. Because of this, I thought they would make the perfect pair for this week’s question.For this episode, Seth, Evan and I discussed a question from Pretince Martin Southwell from Springfield Illinois. Pretince asked, “Have you had people you didn’t get along with personally turn out to be good to work with professionally, or vice versa?” We talked about the origin story of how Seth and Evan’s working relationship began, how their dynamic changes when they work with or involve other people, how they navigate disagreements, and we even debated the existence of extraterrestrial life.If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

It\'s about a pipe between me and others...I have all these thoughts and I want to express them all, but people are not always ready to receive them. Then when you get together and express something...sometimes I can find a pipe where we can connect.” -Yuka HondaMy guest this week is Yuka Honda- a musician, composer, producer and all around fantastic artist. She’s one half of the duo Cibo Matto, and has worked with a range of musicians: from well-known artists such as the Beastie Boys, Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon, to lesser-known but no-less-incredible artists such as Petra Haden, Mike Watt, and Medeski Martin & Wood. Her latest work is a multi-media operatic theatre piece called No Revenge Necessary. She’s done so many great things over the years, and is a dear friend whom I was excited to sit down and have a conversation with.\xa0 For this episode, Yuka and I explored a question from Melissa Hui from San Francisco, CA. Melissa asked, “How much of creative expression is for ourselves vs. others?” We talked about how ideas, images, and feelings take the shape of clouds inside of our heads. When collaborating, Yuka looks to create a pipe connecting her ideas (or the clouds in her head) to the clouds in other people’s heads. And to wrap off our incredibly uplifting/poetic conversation, we answered a question about what we would do in the face of death.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

It’s just whether you try to hide that fact or whether you’re honest about it.”-Shepard FaireyMy guest this week is Shepard Fairey- he is an artist and a self-titled propagandist who is perhaps most known for his HOPE Obama Poster or for his Andre the Giant Has A Posse OBEY Campaign. If you’ve lived near any American metropolis, you’ve probably seen his work stenciled onto the sides of various buildings or as a sticker slapped on the back of a fire hydrant. Recently, his series We The People featured Latinas, Native Americans, Muslims and African Americans, and could be seen at nearly every protest and rally in the country. Shepard’s also quite the philanthropist - he and his wife Amanda started a campaign called Make America Smart Again, which called for Americans be more informed, involved, and engage in healthy dialogues with one another.For this episode, we analyzed a question from Shishuraj Karmalkar from Mumbai, India. Shishuraj asked, “How do you wrestle with the statement that artists are \'selfish\' since they\'re off worrying about their art, and not devoting more energy to political rebellion in troubled times?” Shepard and I discussed how art can transform from something selfish to selfless, the intended (and unintended) message art can convey, and if you can ever truly divorce art from politics. He also answered an off-topic question about God with a reference to the movie Dodgeball, so that was pretty cool.If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.ABOUT THE GUEST:In 1989, while at Rhode Island School of Design studying for his Bachelor of Fine Art in Illustration (which he earned in 1992), Shepard Fairey created the “Andre the Giant has a Posse” sticker that later evolved into the OBEY GIANT art campaign. In 2008, his portrait of then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama became an internationally recognized emblem of hope. Since then, Fairey has painted nearly 100 public murals, become one of the most sought-after and provocative artists in the world, and changed the way people converse about art and view the urban landscape.SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE:Connect with Shepard Fairey:Twitter: @ObeyGiantInstagram: @ObeyGiantObeyGiant.comObeyClothing.comShepard FaireyArt Mentioned:Barack Obama ‘Hope’ Poster‘Andre the Giant Has a Posse’ CampaignWe the People’ SeriesBowery MuralGod Saves and Satan InvestsMovies/TV Shows Mentioned:Triumph of the Will (1935) *WARNING - literally Nazi Propaganda*They Live (1988)The Loudest Voice (TV Series, Showtime)Dodgeball (2004)People Mentioned:Bob Marley (Singer-Songwriter)Bob Dylan\xa0 (Singer-Songwriter)Joe Strummer (Musician)Dead Kennedys (Band)The Rolling Stones (Band)Chuck D (Rapper)Barack Obama (Politician)George W.

My guest is THE Rian Johnson- he is a writer, director, filmmaker extraordinaire. I was in his very first movie, Brick. He then went on to make The Brothers Bloom, Looper, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He’s an extraordinary thinker, conversationalist, artist, and human being. For this episode, we took a deep dive into a question from Alexandra Kolmanofsky from Louisville, Kentucky. She asked, “How do you get inspired by other people’s creations and create something unique that is completely your own without taking too much from the inspiration?” Rian offered some incredible insight on what distinguishes inspiration from imitation, what are the limitations and advantages of dealing with genre, and if any piece of art can ever be considered “original.” We also seriously pondered whether cereal is, in fact, soup (or not).\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, share it on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) using the hashtag #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

I know, I know, we don't like change, but sometimes IT'S GOOD FOR US. It's especially good for us when it comes in the form of Alain de Botton, one of the most intelligent, eloquent and thoughtful people on the planet.And because it's Alain de Botton, modern philosopher, founder of The School of Life and bestselling authors of life-changing books such as Essays In Love, I decided to allow him a little leeway. Instead of choosing personal failures, Alain wanted to talk about three philosophical 'failure concepts' and I'm so glad he did, because it led to one of the most fascinating and enlightening discussions I've ever had on the topic.We discuss the idea that we can be good people and yet fail, and the concept (which I'm forever banging on about) that failure is the norm, and that we should find contentment in the average rather than constantly expecting the exceptional. He also has brilliant insights into why romantic break-ups are not, in and of themselves, tragic, because each relationship teaches you something you need to know, and when the time is right, it is ok to move on. Along the way, I also ask him about X Factor, so fear not, I'm there to pepper his brilliance with my usual lowbrow content, as per.It was such a delight to meet Alain.

Did you miss us? Go on...say you did. I'm really very, very needy.It's such a treat for me to be opening season six with a truly fantastic guest: Camilla Thurlow. Camilla was always one of the most genuine and impressive contestants on ITV2's hit reality show, Love Island. A former bomb disposal expert who worked in life and death situations in Cambodia and Afghanistan, she came second in the 2017 series. Instead of launching a clothing line or advertising detox tummy teas, Camilla went on to use her new-found public platform to talk about issues close to her heart: namely, the immigration crisis and mental health. Her first trip after Love Island was to a refugee camp with the contestant she coupled up with, Jamie Jewitt (oh, and by the way, they are still together).Set aside any preconceptions you might have about reality TV and listen to the wisdom this extraordinary woman imparts about love, loss and human connection. We talk about her periods of extreme anxiety and panic as she was forced to confront who she really was rather than the Camilla she was trying to be. We talk about the challenges of public expectation and the fear of not living up to other people's idea of her. We talk about social media, turning 30 and her ingrained fear of making a fool of herself. We also talk about a near-fatal car accident and the unexpected lessons it taught her.I am so grateful to Camilla for opening up to me and for showing that strength comes through an acknowledgement of - and respect for - vulnerability. I know that you will find so much to relate to in what she says.Thank you for listening.

The end of another season. Where does the time go?I saved this guest for the finale because she's bloody spectacular. Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, a campaigner on women's rights, an outspoken critic of Brexit, anti-semitism and the politics of the hard-left, and the author of an acclaimed book, Everywoman: One Woman's Truth About Speaking The Truth.She joins me to talk about coping with failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends. She talks about the failure in contraception (!) that resulted in her eldest son, her failure to get on the Home Office Fast Track scheme and, in an extremely moving admission, her self-perceived failure to fix her brother's drug addiction.This makes it sound pretty heavy, but Jess is so naturally funny and such a self-deprecating force of nature, that I promise you this interview will leave you feeling energised and quite possibly punching the air.That's it for season five (apart from one bonus live record COMING SOON. Make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss out). I'll be back in the autumn with eight brilliant new guests.*A THANK YOU FROM ME:Thank you so much for subscribing and rating and reviewing and for all your lovely messages over this season and all the others. It really does mean the world to me. Truly. And if you don't like me / this podcast / actually took time out of your day to leave a one-star review / worry that my guests all went to Oxbridge (they didn't) / are too middle-class (they aren't) / think I'm too gushing (well...ok, maybe you have a point there, but I genuinely mean it when I say someone's amazing...) then please know that however angry or sad or lonely or un-heard you feel, I send you nothing but love in return. Bet that winds you up, doesn't it?To the rest of you: I feel so blessed for your companionship on this crazy, beautiful journey. You have helped me make sense of things. You have met me in a place of vulnerability and made me feel so much stronger. You have shown me that love, compassion and kindness is strength. You have taught me what I always suspected: that failure does not have to be an end point, but can instead be a stepping stone on a journey towards greater understanding.

Meera first\xa0came to prominence when she co-wrote and starred in the award-winning BBC comedy series Goodness Gracious Me and was Bafta-nominated for her later role in The Kumars at Number 42. She, along with her husband Sanjeev Bhaskar, almost single-handedly reinvented British-Asian comedy, taking it from the stereotypical and lazy racist tropes of old and bringing it brilliantly into the mainstream (I mean, who can forget the hilarious 'Going for an English' sketch? If you haven't seen it, YouTube it now).Meera joins me to talk about failing at maths (and having a bigoted teacher), failing to live up to her parents' expectations of her, failing at auditions (and hating them), failing to raise her second child how she wanted and instead getting obsessed with a rigid regime rather than following her own maternal instincts. Along the way, we discuss ageing, race, school, womanhood, ice-cream vans and embarrassing smear tests.

With her four-part Netflix show, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat where she travels the world eating freshly baked focaccia and Japanese seaweed? Or with the award-winning, bestselling cookbook of the same name, that revolutionised the way we thought about food?I don't know where to start. So let me just tell you that she is one of the bubbliest, most open and generous interviewees I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She joins me to talks about growing up in San Diego, the child of Iranian parents, who was 'the only brown kid' in her school, and what this sense of outsidership taught her. She talks about overnight fame, and the weirdness that comes with that, as well as failing to write, what happens when your business fails and the one memorable time she burned the sauce for a dinner she was cooking for Hillary Clinton.

And not just any Olympic athlete, but double-gold medal winner, Kelly Holmes, who also just so happens to be my first DAME on How To Fail too.Dame Kelly joins me to talk about how her single mother was pressurised to give Kelly up for adoption as a baby and how she refused to do so, teaching her daughter about what it is to be truly strong. We also discuss Kelly's 'failure' at school and how she joined the army at 16 but then failed her first Physical Training Instructor selection (I mean, who would fail Kelly Holmes? Come on, now. Have you seen the size of her biceps?) She also talks openly about coming second in the 1995 World Championships because of her spiralling anxiety and discusses her ongoing mental health issues, including her diagnosis with clinical depression, her grief over her mother's death and [TW] her experiences of self-harm.For me, Dame Kelly epitomises the kind of empowerment that comes from being open about your own vulnerabilities. Her strength is forged through her resilience. As she puts it: 'You train for the outcome.' I know I use the word a lot in the context of this podcast, but Dame Kelly truly is inspiring in the most profound ways.[Trigger warning: this episode contains descriptions of self-harm]*\xa0I am thrilled to be taking How To Fail on tour around the UK in October, sharing my failure manifesto with the help of some very special guests.

Her first failure is, in Segal's own words, her failure 'to stay pregnant' and the feeling of shame that came from not having managed to provide the requisite 40-week gestation period. 'I felt I had failed at my first ever task of motherhood,' she explains. 'That my body could not be a safe space for them felt a spectacular failure.'She and her husband, Gabriel, were pitched into a nightmarish situation where they did not know whether their baby girls would survive. When they were born they weighed only 2lbs each. The girls could not do anything on their own and they suffered harrowing, life-threatening infections. Segal joins me to discuss what happened next.Even if you are not one of the 100,000 women in the UK who, every year, give birth to premature babies and even if, like me, you are not a parent at all, I promise that you will find Segal's insightful eloquence both enlightening and moving.We also talk about her failure to be a rebellious teenager, her conflicted attitude to social media and how, as a writer, she deals with the eternal nagging of her fractious internal critic.

Emeli has sold over 19 million singles, won four Brit Awards and is about to return after a three-year break with her hotly anticipated third album, Real Life. Her rise to fame was rapid and overwhelming. Celebrity, she says, took some time to get used to.She joins me to talk about her body image and the long journey to self-acceptance in an industry that frequently made her feel like she was never 'enough'. She talks about letting go of the need to be perfect, and embracing failure. Plus we discuss her visit to\xa0Zambia to reconnect with her family there, and what impact that had on her. Emeli also opens up for the first time about the breakdown of her marriage, to a man she had been with from the age of 17, and the feeling of shame she had about admitting she was getting divorced before being forced to confront herself as she really was.Emeli speaks as powerfully as she sings: like an old soul channeling all sorts of wisdom.

That's right. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is back.One year on from her debut appearance on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, my first ever guest returns to talk about the craziness of her last 12 months, during which she has written and starred in Fleabag 2 (described as a televisual masterpiece by...well...almost everyone), made Killing Eve (described as a televisual masterpiece by...well...almost everyone) and been brought in by the James Bond producers to work her magic on the franchise.It's a year that, from the outside, has seemed to many of us to be the epitome of success. But what failures lie underneath the surface? What about those private moments of vulnerability and self-doubt we are so rarely privy to?Phoebe joins me to talk about three failures from the past year, including her failure to connect with her family, her failure to speak up for herself and her failure to Marie Kondo her bedroom. Along the way, we discuss what makes the perfect water bottle, filming THAT final scene in Fleabag (apparently the foxes were total divas), sexuality, exhaustion and why female creators are often unfairly assumed to be writing autobiography. And yes, the Meryl Streep apple crumble anecdote makes an appearance.Thank you, Phoebe, for coming back onto the podcast and being such a generous and wonderful friend.If you haven't already listened to her first episode, you can do so here\xa0***SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT KLAXON***I am thrilled to be taking How To Fail on tour around the UK in October, sharing my failure manifesto with the help of some very special guests.

So he made it. Over a decade\xa0later that remains one of his motivations. Sometimes ideas demand\xa0expression, putting characters – all shades of the writer, in the\xa0final analysis – into challenges and perils, or perpetrating the acts of\xa0monsters, human or otherwise.Moore believes that writing – and reading – frees us of the\xa0constraints of the civilized, moralized world. Our imaginations are\xa0unfettered. He can reach through this screen and take you, dear reader,\xa0right now. Don’t think he’s not thinking about it. Right now. There’s\xa0nothing you can do about it except close the page – or open your eyes\xa0and surrender. \xa0And if you’re still reading, knowing the utterly\xa0obscene and awful things he’s thinking of doing to you this very moment,\xa0well, that’ll be your secret, won’t it?Raziel can be found at\xa0https://eroticwriter.wordpress.com/monocles-stories/Also~Today\'s show features a poem that asks the big question... what do you like? and a very sexy story about two people coming\xa0together in such an honest and very intimate way, because they understand just how precious life really is.What Do You like is Written and performed by Fox Smoulder and is but a taste from their album, “Incorrigible & Intimate”Fox can be found at\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0YouTube.For more Sexy Stories from Rose Caraway go to\xa0http://j.mp/carawayaudiobooksContact RosePhone- (202) 810-5477Web-\xa0thekissmequicks.comEmail-\xa0thekissmequicks@gmail.comFacecbook-\xa0https://www.facebook.com/rose.caraway.7Twitter-\xa0@RoseCaraway\xa0For More Aural Pleasure\xa0Go To- \xa0http://j.mp/carawayaudiobooks', 'chan_desc': 'Sexy Stories with Rose Caraway and her friends will arouse your senses and inflame your imagination with delicious tales of love, lust, loss, romance, suspense, erotic horror, and adventure!

Beth’s perfectionist nature and her professional approach to the craft resulted in a driving ambition that got her into UCLA’s acting program and eventually led to her first role on network television as the co-star of the CBS sitcom\xa02 Broke Girls.Success wasn\'t the answer to everything though, and it brought its own set of challenges, like navigating the gauntlet that is being an actress in Hollywood. As Beth says, “We’re told so many different things in the media about how we’re supposed to be and act. When\xa02 Broke Girls\xa0began, I went from having no money and working as a nanny to being on a hit television show. At some point, the schedule, the pressure, and the anxiety from all of that started to break down my body.” In order to be the best actress she could be, she had to learn how to manage stress and take care of herself.Beth soon discovered the therapeutic power of meditation, nature, and horses. She got back in touch with her inner “theater kid in pajama pants”—the person she used to be before the overwhelming social pressures of Hollywood, and with her newfound wisdom, Beth wrote a book about self-care called\xa0The Total Me-Tox. She’s the first to admit that she still has plenty of work to do, so now, in addition to acting, she’s found a new calling. “I want to empower people to be who they are and be okay with that.”Beth joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the C that derailed her acting degree, why she’s more comfortable in a character’s skin than her own, and\xa0the audition where she was told to “cry prettier." | Zach Galifianakis had his big moment of success a bit later than most. Zach was a stand-up comedian with a small but loyal following, but when the massive hit comedy\xa0The Hangover\xa0came out, his life drastically changed. At 40 years old, Zach was unaccustomed to throngs of fans and perplexed by the attention brought by fame. As he says, “No one wanted to hear me speak or ask my opinion until I got into the movies. That doesn’t make any sense.”Zach’s down to earth approach to life likely originated with his family—a naturally funny and supportive crowd who encouraged Zach to follow his dreams of performing at an early age. After school, he moved to New York City to find an acting coach who could take him under their wing and provide an entrance into the business. Success wasn’t imminent though. As Zach says, “I worked for an uncle who managed a restaurant called Tequila Willie’s, where I had to wear a sombrero and pick up my tips off the kitchen room floor. Have you ever been on the kitchen floor on your hands and knees picking up quarters with a sombrero on? It’s very uplifting. Especially, when you’re still a busboy at 28.” Zach never found his long sought after acting coach but instead discovered stand up in the back of a burger restaurant, and never looked back.Even with his roles in big budget films, Zach continues to take on interesting, outside the box projects—whether it’s being a fake talk show host in the Netflix movie adaptation of\xa0Between Two Ferns\xa0or doing impromptu stand-up at a steakhouse in Pasadena. Over the course of our conversation, you’ll realize Zach’s honesty and modesty is as endearing as it is hilarious, as awkward as it is intimate.Zach joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about his favorite\xa0Between Two Ferns\xa0moment, his mission to take the piss out of “celebrity,” and why you should dress up as a witch and go find him on the streets of Venice if you want to have a nice ten-minute conversation. | Writer, director, comedian and podcast host Scott Aukerman is a very busy man. He is perhaps best known for his hit podcast Comedy Bang! Bang!\xa0which has been introducing audiences to the most talented comedians and improv artists for the last ten years. And that’s just Scott’s “side gig.” He’s written for movies and television shows, like\xa0Mr. Show, and more recently,\xa0Between Two Ferns, a wonderfully awkward talk show hosted by Zach Galifianakis which is now a full length Netflix movie. Even with all of his success, Scott still marvels at the fact that he gets to be silly and make other people laugh for a living. He wonders, “At what point will people figure out it’s all a scam?”He grew up with comedy in his bones and an affinity for David Letterman. In high school, he hosted a Letterman-inspired news show on his town’s public access channel. And in college he frequently turned serious, academic assignments into sketches, including a particularly memorable ballet performance which got him into trouble with his teachers. As Scott says, “I heard my whole life that I didn’t take things seriously enough, and I finally realized I should go into comedy.”Scott joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about Bob Odenkirk’s role in jump starting his career, his\xa0Between Two Ferns\xa0guest pitch/disclaimer, and how on the Between Two Ferns film, he was almost too afraid to talk to, let alone direct, David Letterman. | If you haven’t seen Andrea Savage’s comedy series\xa0I’m Sorry, you should…just be prepared to laugh your butt off. As the creator, writer, and star of the series, Andrea does it all—which makes sense since the show is based on her own experiences being a comedian, wife and mom. But it is also a show about us. Andrea has found the universal truths of being a parent while being a working artist, and her observational powers reveal the absurdity and pathos in our own lives.For years, Andrea was stuck in development hell. She had a stable acting career with roles in\xa0Step Brothers,\xa0Episodes, and\xa0Veep,\xa0but true to her improv and Groundlings background, Andrea wanted to write and create as well. She was pumping out pilot scripts and selling them, but they weren’t getting made. As she says, “It was heartbreak after heartbreak of putting your all into a project, getting good notes, and then nothing. It was always the bridesmaid, never the bride.” When Andrea turned 40, the self-described “successful failure” decided to change her approach with\xa0I’m Sorry. She put together a crew with some help from her talented friends Judy Greer and Jason Mantzoukas, and she filmed her own pilot presentation.Andrea figured out that she needed to show her vision, because her story was nuanced and personal, not full of big jokes that jumped off the page. The approach worked like gangbusters. Her presentation became the first episode of the show and established her as a creator, showrunner, director, and a force to be reckoned with. As she says, “I literally just willed it to happen.”Andrea joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about why her writer’s room is better than therapy, why her lack of darkness makes her question her comedy bonafides, and her dedication to being a “joke shepherd.” | Before she became a household name from her work in projects like\xa0Fresh Off the Boat\xa0and\xa0Crazy Rich Asians, Constance Wu was a full-time waitress in credit card debt who was trying to break into the TV and film industry.Despite her BFA in acting, Constance struggled to get steady acting work for nearly a decade. Her love of the craft never wavered—no matter how tough it was to deal with the rejection. But times got so tough she finally had to ask herself, “Are you okay if you’re still waiting tables at 50 in order to supplement your income so you can do one or two plays a year?” Wholeheartedly, her answer was, “Yes.”Finally, when the creditors were stalking her, she got her big break. In 2015, she was cast opposite Randall Park in the groundbreaking and popular ABC sitcom\xa0Fresh Off the Boat, a hilarious look at life as an Asian immigrant in America. Another historic role followed with the film\xa0Crazy Rich Asians, which featured an entirely Asian cast. Most recently, she’s acting opposite J-Lo in the film\xa0Hustlers, a true story about a group of strip club employees who drugged and robbed their rich Wall Street clientele.Constance joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about how privileged she feels to have a voice in the discussion about racial diversity in Hollywood, why she still loves going to acting class, and she also reveals the joys of sucking at guitar. | Wyatt Russell was born into the film business as the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, which can be a difficult way to grow up. But despite their massive success, Wyatt’s parents were a grounding presence who emphasized\xa0hard work. “They did a really good job of making us understand that what you get is\xa0earned, not given, and that there’s reward in earning it,” Wyatt told me. In light of that lesson and after an eye-opening trip to a hockey rink, Wyatt decided to deviate from the family way and forge his own path—he was going to be a professional hockey player.As Wyatt grew up, his NHL dream seemed more and more like a distinct possibility. He was a talented goalie, and his parents moved to Vancouver so Wyatt could compete with Canada’s best. Unfortunately, being born into a famous family brings its own unique challenges. “People were like, ‘Here comes this circus act from California. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn’s kid wants to be a hockey player in British Columbia.’ I had to prove myself by putting my head down, not talking, and doing the work to become the best goalie in the league.” His promising hockey career lasted into his early 20s, but a spate of injuries led to the end of his dream and the end of his identity as a hockey player. Sitting on a hospital bed after a particularly brutal hip injury, Wyatt asked himself: ““What do I do now? I have no idea what I am.”Wyatt reflected on his love of film, and despite the perilous nature of the business, he decided to pursue an acting career. But in typical headstrong fashion, he wasn’t going to ask his parents or siblings for advice. He was going to do it his own way. After getting work in a number of films such as\xa0Cowboys & Aliens,\xa0We Are What We Are,\xa0Folk Hero & Funny Guy, and more, Wyatt discovered that he not only has the chops for the business, but that he actually loves it. Wyatt’s recently made the transition to television. He’s the lead in AMC’s\xa0Lodge 49, a weird and whimsical show about an ex-surfer named Dud, who finds himself on a vision quest after the death of his father.Wyatt joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the uncomfortable reality of fame, the mentor who helped him discover his independence, and why the locker room is the best place to learn about male vulnerability. | Off Camera\xa0is back after a short summer break with all new episodes, and we’re kicking off the new season with a game of musical chairs. Writer, actor, and\xa0Saturday Night Live\xa0alum Jason Sudeikis takes over as host, and I take the hot seat for a change.The idea came to Jason while he was running on the treadmill a couple of months ago. Mid-exercise, he texted me to see if I was interested in celebrating 200 episodes of\xa0Off Camera\xa0by allowing him to interview me. I was incredibly flattered by the offer, but I’ve always gone off the assumption, “Who wants to hear about me?” As a director and photographer, I’ve spent most of my career behind the camera, trying to peel back the layers of the creative person in front of the lens. But as I thought about it, one thing occurred to me—I could for once see what it feels like in the other chair. And after seeing Jason make the rounds as guest host on talk shows like\xa0Ellen, it was clear I’m in good hands. Maybe too good, as it turned out. Jason surprised me with his thoughtfulness, deep research, and by connecting some dots in my own history that I had never thought about before. Dare I say I liked it?Jason and I sit down to talk about the similarities between multi-hyphenates and superheroes, how the smallest act of encouragement and praise can be the greatest gift for an aspiring artist, why we film\xa0Off Camera\xa0in a vast, white room, and more. | Good old Robert Downey Jr. is back for a second time, and his career has gone quite well since his last appearance, on episode 5 of Off Camera. It is now our 200th\xa0episode, and Robert is here to remind us that great conversations should be unconventional, surprising, and sometimes just downright weird. Check, check, and check.Since the last time he was here, Robert’s\xa0Iron Man\xa0legend has grown exponentially—thanks to the massive success of Marvel’s\xa0Avengers\xa0franchise and the recent release of the final installment,\xa0Avengers: Endgame.\xa0 But if we rewind the tape, Robert’s journey on the project, like director Jon Favreau’s, started at a low point. “We were two people who had a film we were passionate about come out on the same weekend and bomb. His was\xa0Zathura,\xa0and mine was\xa0Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.” Their mutual comeuppance led to a creative bond, a big brother relationship. As Robert explains, “If that kind of synergy happens when you’re doing a movie, it’s going to be great. End of story.”Finding people who encourage and legitimize his creativity has been a theme for Robert, who despite moments of personal turmoil, possesses a deep-seated work ethic. Growing up, he was “Bob Downey’s kid,” the son of a groundbreaking, counterculture filmmaker, whose view of the industry was the following: “Anybody can act. Few can direct, and nobody can write.” Talk about humble beginnings.Robert joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about quitting (not getting fired from)\xa0Saturday Night Live\xa0after a year, why he thought (and still thinks) he could write a better script than William Goldman, and the great life advice he got from Figueroa Slim in jail. | If Scoot McNairy hadn’t found acting, it’s possible he’d be mowing lawns for a living. Scoot grew up relishing the outdoors of his native Texas, and started his own landscaping company at age 13 to make some spending money. Towards the end of high school, he had some thinking to do about his future. Since he was dyslexic, college seemed out of the question, so one day, his father asked, “What is the one thing that you could do every single day, that would get you up and out of bed, that would make you want to go to work?” Scoot’s answer: being on a movie set.Aside from being outdoors, Scoot’s other great passion was watching movies. He was fascinated by the magic of it all. And as a kid who loved to take things apart, he wanted to know how everything worked. He decided to move to Los Angeles for film school but got relatively little out of it, and felt like he needed hands-on experience on a movie set. Scoot’s fastest way in was getting work as a background actor, also known as an extra.\xa0“I swear I learned more in two weeks as a background actor on\xa0The Practice\xa0than I did in the entire year I went to film school.”Background work turned to commercial work which eventually turned to acting in television and film—thanks to an acting teacher who politely kicked him out of class so he’d start\xa0auditioning\xa0for roles instead of compulsively going to class. Because of his unconventional education, he approaches his job from a unique angle, creating very real and emotional performances in projects like\xa0Halt and Catch Fire,\xa0True Detective, Narcos, and the upcoming Quentin Tarantino film\xa0Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Scoot joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the dark place he had to live in to embody his True Detective\xa0character, how growing up with a learning disability helped him embrace failure, and why the only time his heart beats at a normal rate is on a motorcycle. | As the child of first-generation Muslim immigrants, Ramy Youssef grew up with a sense of practicality about his future. He was drawn to comedy and performing, but he saw no one who looked like him on TV. Add to that the fact that acting isn’t exactly a pragmatic career path in the first place. “I had parents who gave up everything to move to America, and I’m supposed to call them and say, ‘Hey, can you pay a bunch of money for me to study the Meisner technique?’ I didn’t have the balls to ask that question.”While in college, Ramy developed his stand-up and sketch comedy skills at UCB in his free time while studying political science and economics. He auditioned for a small role in the Nick at Nite series\xa0See Dad Run, and got the part, and decided to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles. That gig lasted\xa0for three seasons, and then Ramy got stuck in acting purgatory. According to audition feedback, he wasn’t good looking enough to be the lead; he wasn’t nerdy enough to play the nerd; and he wasn’t “ethnic” enough to play the ethnic guy. That’s when Ramy realized, “You never know where people are going to put you. It’s nice when\xa0you\xa0get to put yourself where you want to be.”Ramy took charge of his own destiny. He had writing skills, plenty of personal experience, and a unique cultural point of view. What he came up with was\xa0Ramy,\xa0his Hulu series based on his experience growing up in New Jersey and coming to terms with his Muslim faith. It’s being hailed as the first American television show to feature a Muslim family, but more importantly, it throws away Muslim caricatures and depicts rich and complex human storylines about family, faith, and cultural differences.Ramy joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the moment his parents finally acknowledged he had “made it,” how puberty will be forever linked with global terrorism in his mind, and why stand up comedy makes everything else seem easy.', 'chan_desc': 'Off Camera is a podcast hosted by photographer/director Sam Jones, who created the show out of his passion for the long form conversational interview, and as a way to share his conversations with a myriad of artists, actors, musicians, directors, skateboarders, photographers, and writers that pique his interest.

My man Tim Ferriss is a master at deconstructing the work of others and de-stilling it into a working practice. In fact, he wrote his book Tools of Titans as a reference of some of the tactics, routines, and habits of billionaires.

But in reality the call that we’re meant to heed—the wake-up call—is always there for us, if we’re just willing to listen more carefully. Enjoy!     Today's episode is brought to you by CreativeLive.

And today, I have my long time friend Jason Harris in the hot seat to help us with just that. \xa0 Jason is the founder and CEO of the award winning creative agency Mekanism. He is one of Creativity Mag's most creative people in business, Top 100 People Who Make Advertising Great and about 52 other awards in the creative space. You've certainly seen his work if you've watched Superbowl commercials or heard of Peloton, Ben & Jerrys, HBO, and more. He also is one of the people that I look up to as a model of giving back. He donates a huge amount of his time to causes in which he believes and uses his marketing savvy for doing good in the world. \xa0 I'm super inspired by our conversation today for so many reasons, but here’s handful to whet your palette:  Of course we get into his new book The Soulful Art of Persuasion, in which Jason breaks down the art of sharing our ideas in an honest and authentic ways We talk about the ups and downs living life identifying as a professional creator, including the internal pressure many of us have to never be satisfied - and the fear we sometimes have around our work. File under funny: Jason's love for the band KISS. Not because they are masterful musicians but because they built their success as one of the most successful rock bands of all time on a battery of tools BEYOND just music such as storytelling, lore, and -yes- persuasion. and of course much more….

And just to be clear, that is all of the countries recognized on the planet. He is the first person to do it before the age of 35. More importantly, he has built online businesses, side hustles, and mastered the art of a non-conforming lifestyle since he was 19 years old. There's almost nobody better person equipped to talk about starting lots of businesses. He has a daily podcast called Side Hustle School where he's featured more than 850 different side hustle businesses + featured many in his new book called 100 Side Hustles. Chris also started half a dozen or more himself, started one of my favorite conferences, The World Domination Summit, and is a New York Times bestselling author of books like the $100 Start Up and The Art of Non-Conformity and many others. This guy is a beast and he's so savvy, so humble. In this episode:  We go into details about some of Chris' favorite side hustle businesses he's come across in his podcast & writing this book - what are some of the most common traits and failures. Chris shares his experience with depression, how he's faced it, and focused on some self-care. We talk about transitions, how to know when to quit something or to push through. and so much more...

I came across her music almost 10 years ago and love it so much I reached out to see if she would be interested on being on the show. Not only did she respond, she left us reeling from her incredible live performance and chat on art + entrepreneurship. Now she’s back on tour with her latest album Snowmelt. In this episode, we go deep into personal growth, dealing with incredible loss, balancing parenthood and career, and landscape for independent artists. Enjoy!

He’s the founder of a global photography movement, Help-Portrait, to give back to those in need. As well as many photography projects bridging empathy and creativity into awareness and action.

Today on the show, we get into his new book I’m Possible and his biggest project to date, building a hotel where every aspect serves someone in need. We get into facing fears, overcoming doubt, and how to turn the seemingly impossible to possible. In this episode:  The fear of having a dream that’s so big. Chasing a dream for a decade or lifetime. How do you take action and get paralyzed because it’s so big? How to chase curiosity despite your fear of starting something new? Whether you’re just starting out or you’re thinking about transitioning from something you love doing and are already good at....

You may remember a band called Presidents of the United States of America. They took the world by storm in 1995 with their self titled album, Presidents of the United States of America playing songs like Lump and Peaches. Yes, that’s right. My guest today is frontman Chris Ballew. Chris and I have been friends for years, including collaborating on a music video together and at least one live performance (gotta listen to find out ;). Of course we get into his musical journey, a meteoric rise to success, and then realizing something was missing. We take some deep dives into Chris’ creative process, including his method for capturing his small bits and later using those to write new works, including his new project Casper Babypants. \xa0 In this episode:  Consider what kind of artist you are and how you relate to other artists. For years Chris played in bands, but what he learned about himself is his work is actually solo. Don’t censor yourself while you’re creating. Get it out, no matter how crazy or ridiculous or unusual and then look back later. For years Chris didn’t allow himself to write on certain topics because it seemed silly. It wasn’t until he realized that was a false limitation that it help unlock a new level for him. How staying curious with a childlike imagination will give you fresh perspectives.  Enjoy!

The challenge was following it up—and Jackson and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, didn’t make it easy on themselves.In 1989, they produced an ambitious album with a portentous title: Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814. But what could have been Control, Part 2 instead was a visionary LP that reinvented the socially conscious album from the era of Marvin Gaye for the ’90s, and envisioned what pop would eventually sound like in the 21st century. Rhythm Nation was a smash, generating more hits—and bigger hits—than any album in history. In fact, if Jackson and her label hadn’t pulled their punches with one final radio single, she could have set an all-time Billboard chart record that would have overshadowed any of the Jackson family’s historic achievements.Podcast production by Chris Berube.HostChris MolanphyFollow @cmolanphy on Twitter / https://www.twitter.com/cmolanphy\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

In this video we’ll take a look at an external GPU or eGPU setup.I\'m using a Dell XPS 15 9570 laptop, but you can use any laptop that supports Thunderbolt 3 and has a minimum of 16GB of RAM and an i5 processor (i7 8th generation recommended) - this could be somethign like the Razer Blade 15, Razer Blade Stealth or HP Spectre 13. You can also run an eGPU with a Macbook but using NVIDIA cards is going to require a lot of workarounds.This is an excellent way to speed up the performance of applications such as Lightroom, Premiere Pro and After Effects by adding an external GPU card.Also worth noting - as I am posting this video, NVIDIA has just announced as I’m releasing this video, NVIDIA has announced their new RTX Studio laptops. These new Laptops are designed for creative work and are boasting some serious specs. The new Studio drivers have been tested extensively with applications by Adobe, Epic, Autodesk, Unity and Blackmagic Design specifically with creative workflows in mind. #NVIDIAStudioMusic is from Epidemic Sound https://goo.gl/v5wWKrAoP T-Shirts https://aop.threadless.com/Need a website? http://squarespace.com/aopOn my channel you will find videos about photography, cinematography, post processing tutorials for Capture One, Lightroom and Photoshop, photo assignments that YOU can participate in, the Artist Series and more.

In this video I\'ll use Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the concept and how it works. Of course this same idea can be applied to any software application that you are using for photography (Lightroom, Luminare, DX0, Capture One etc).• Understand how to sample colors and see toning in both shadow and highlight detail• find the midtones• match a color grade using a color balance adjustment layer• match a color grade using a curves adjustment layerCheck out my other videos:Lightroom Presets :: Get Incredible Looking Images https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO6s6oRPR1AThe Film Look With Levels Adjustments https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQiqOinqHV4The One Secred Lightroom Feature Every Photographer Should Be Using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7HBdMrR6ZoCanon EOS RP :: Why? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg4C7Uipt9IWhy You Should Be Using Lightroom Mobile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNoNlJKcSNUMusic is from Epidemic Sound https://goo.gl/v5wWKrAoP T-Shirts https://aop.threadless.com/Need a website? http://squarespace.com/aopOn my channel you will find videos about photography, cinematography, post processing tutorials for Capture One, Lightroom and Photoshop, photo assignments that YOU can participate in, the Artist Series and more.

It\'s the consummate cool weather growing region, where Riesling and aromatic whites reign supreme. Bruce Murray, the founder and creative force behind Boundary Breaks, tells us how he went from newspaper man, to working with Elon Musk, to running a winery so focused on terroir, they don\'t even have a dedicated winemaker. \xa0 Boundary Breaks was founded in 2007 by Bruce on the East side of Seneca Lake. It focuses on Riesling, which range in style from dry and complex to lightly sweet to a true Riesling Ice Wine. In addition to Riesling, small amounts of Gewurztraminer, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are grown on the estate. The wines are spectacular with a purity of flavor, and excellent terroir expression. Bruce\'s life is fascinating and Boundary Breaks, indeed, has broken some boundaries in what can be done in the wine world!\xa0 \xa0 Here are the topics we discuss:\xa0  Bruce tells us how his life unfolded to bring him back to the area in which he grew up. He tells me how the Donnhoff Riesling from Nahe, Germany in a Thai restaurant in Vegas changed the course of his life.\xa0  We talk about the Finger Lakes, how they were formed, why they are so unique and why the east side of Seneca Lake produces such excellent grapes. We get extra dorky, discussing Boundary Breaks\' unique drainage system and why "wet feet" are bad for grapes  \xa0  We discuss Riesling and how\xa0vineyard management is so pivotal to getting pure flavor. We detail each style Boundary Breaks makes -- dry, off-dry, ice wine plus aromatic whites like\xa0Gewurztraminer.  \xa0  We talk extensively about the challenges of growing reds in the climate of the Finger Lakes and how quality has been spotty over the years, but is improving by leaps and bounds.

Jerry Solomon was a real estate attorney in San Diego who longed for a small town life and wanted wine to be part of it. Trey Busch was a Walla Walla winemaker who had insane talent but needed a partner to make his dream winery a reality. The two created Sleight of Hand 12 years ago to create exceptional, terroir driven wines that reflect the unique land of Walla Walla and Columbia Valley. Jerry takes us on a journey of the winery, the land, and the beautiful wines they produce! \xa0 They will be at Underground Wine Event on November 9, 2019 – don’t miss it! www.undergroundwineevents.com/events \xa0 Here are the show notes:  Jerry tells us how he and his wife Sandy made the move from San Diego Real Estate attorney to Director of Winemaking at the coolest winery in Walla Walla He talks about the wonderful friendship and partnership between him and Trey Busch, an Atlantan who became a skilled Walla Walla winemaker after working for several excellent wineries We talk about the special role of music at Sleight of Hand and how the winery got its name from a Pearl Jam song   Jerry explains why the Columbia Valley, and Walla Walla, in particular, are so special for winemaking. We talk soil (loess, which the Walla Walla folks pronounce "luss" and basalt), sun exposure, latitude and why these wines are so different from those from California We talk about the variety of Sleight of Hand wines from\xa0Riesling, Chardonnay, Syrah, and red blends and what makes each so special  We discuss why Syrah, in particular, is such a standout in Walla Walla ad why Milton-Freewater Rocks District is so insanely good   I ask Jerry if he thinks\xa0Washington gets the respect it deserves on the world wine scene and why scores work against Washington wines   We discuss why Sleight of Hand wants to stay small We close with how Neil Patrick Harris wound up on the Conjurer label!  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Norm is known to have helped grow the Walla Walla industry from a few dozen acres in 1989 to 2800 today, around the idea of impeccable quality in the vineyard. The business is truly a family business. Norm is still involved but Eric is a partner. Eric worked for 11 years in Seattle in the telecom industry, earned an MBA and then returned to Walla Walla in 2003, where he is an active partner at Amavi Cellars and Pepper Bridge Winery. In 2004, he assumed the duty of General Manager at Amavi Cellars. He also taught me pretty much everything I know about Walla Walla and is one of the best advocates for the region there is! If you get a chance to try these wines, you should do it -- they are pure Walla Walla and purely excellent!\xa0 Here are the show notes: \xa0  Eric tells us about the Missoula Floods and why Walla Walla is such a unique growing region, unlike any other in the world. If you want to see a cool PBS documentary on the Missoula Floods, here it is.\xa0  \xa0  We learn about the early days of Walla Walla -- what was here, how grapes supplanted apples, and who the early players were and what they accomplished. We talk about Jean-Francois Pellet, winemaker and partner for both Pepper Bridge and Amavi, and why he was such a believer in this region when he came from Heitz in Napa for a job interview with Amavi and Pepper Bridge.\xa0  \xa0  We discuss the "bowl" valley that is Walla Walla, the soil types and and the styles that different parts of Walla Walla yield. We do a bit of compare and contrast on Napa v Walla Walla styles  \xa0  Because it\'s timely, Eric settles our fears about phylloxera that was recently reported on in the wine pubs  \xa0  Then we spend time dorking out about the flavors that you\'ll find in Walla Walla -- Syrahs that taste plush, some that taste like licking rocks. Cabernet that expresses terroir without being too full or rich. Semillon that has beautiful acidity. All of these things and how they are achieved.\xa0   \xa0  Finally we dip into the thorny question of why so many wineries are based in Walla Walla that don\'t make any wines from Walla Walla fruit only (they blend it with things from other part of Columbia Valley) and what that means for the AVA from a marketing and reputational standpoint.\xa0  \xa0 Amavi and Pepper Bridge will be at this year\'s Underground Wine Event in Washington DC.

Today, however, exciting producers have mastered their microclimates and are making some of the freshest, most nuanced, terroir-driven wines in the United States. \xa0 This week I sit down with Elizabeth Smith of one of the top wineries in this lovely state, Afton Mountain Vineyards. We discuss everything from Virginia history with grape growing, to terroir obsession, to the European flare of the region, and why the wines are so darn good. \xa0If you don\'t know much about VA or you\'re an obsessive this podcast will be equally fascinating!\xa0 \xa0 Elizabeth and Tony Smith both grew up in Charlottesville and had lifelong ties the Blue Ridge Mountains. After working and raising a family in coastal VA, and even trying their hands at grape growing there (not quite the right terroir!), they decided to move back to their hometown for their second act – winegrowing and making. They bought Afton Mountain Vineyards in 2009 and in this show, Elizabeth shares their story and how they came to make some of the best wine in Virginia. \xa0  Elizabeth shares her background and how she went from investment management to property management to winery management (and rocked them all!)  \xa0  Elizabeth gives us a true education on the Monticello appellation – what matters to quality wine, what is challenging in growing grapes here, and why she and Tony selected the most westerly site in the Monticello AVA to make their elegant wines  \xa0  We dork out on microclimates, what makes Virginia so unique, and why elevation, and extremely attentive (obsessive) vineyard management is the only way to make great wine in Virginia and why sustainable viticulture is better than organic in a dicey climate like that in the Monticello area.  \xa0  Elizabeth answers the question: Why does Damien Blanchon, their French winemaker, and so many other French winemakers find themselves in Virginia, and decide to stay (hint: challenge without restriction!)  \xa0  We talk about the varietals that do well for Afton Mountain (Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Albariño for the whites, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Tannat, and Sangiovese for the reds) and the flavors they yield from this land. We have an interesting side bar about how Petit Verdot can really suck if not handled well!  \xa0  We wrap with Elizabeth talking about how far Virginia wine has come in the last 10 years and a BIG teaser on a project Afton Mountain is starting this fall!  \xa0 Find out more about Elizabeth and her wines at www.aftonmountainvineyards.com\xa0and come to the Underground Wine Event on 11/9/19 in Washington D.C. to meet her and taste her beautiful wines! \xa0 Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Swartland (Dutch for \'black land\') is full of young, passionate winemakers making wines that respect the hot, dry land from which they derive and are able to create wines of such depth, flavor, and nuance that it’s hard to believe so few know about them. In this show, we tell you about the Syrah, Rhône and Mediterranean varietals, the Chenin Blanc and other stunning white blends coming from this area and why you need to seek it out ASAP! \xa0 Overview of the region…  Swartland was oncea rural backwater, better known for wheat fields than vineyards Vineyards traditionally grew where wheat couldn’t -- on the northern side of Paardeberge Mountains in the south, the plains of Piketberg in the north, and the smaller Ward of Riebeekberg and Kasteelberg Mountains in the east Lots of old vines on slopes where nothing else grows, hand harvested The climate ishot and dry with very low summer rainfall but with consistent afternoon and evening breezes off the Atlantic Ocean. Growers have less concern about fungus and other diseases. They use the ecosystem to keep the vineyards healthy with integrated pest management, bush training of vines, and dry farming  \xa0 We dork out on plate tectonics!  Swartland has ancient geology. The terroirresulted from a combination of tectonic collisions, ancient volcanic activity and continental separation The soils are the oldest in the world and are a mix of shale, arenite sandstone and granite, schist based terroirs. Malmesbury shale on Kasteelberg Mtn is the dominant soil.  vertical layering structure caused by tectonic shifts. Water drains away and vines dig deeper for liquid nourishment    \xa0 Grapes/Winemaking  We talk about the grapes and terroir driven wines of the region  Red grapes: Syrah/Shiraz, Mourvèdre, Grenache Noir, Carignan, Cinsaut, Tinta Barocca, Pinotage White grapes:Chenin blanc, Grenache blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne, Viognier, Clairette, Palomino, Sémillon, Muscat d’Alexandria, Muscat d’Frontignan, Colombard and Verdelho. Viticulture:A lot of natural, noninvasive methods of farming Winemaking:larger barrels that impart less flavor, less racking and stirring to keep earthy flavors, unfiltered, unfined wines – low input wines   The Ward of Riebeekbergnear the towns of Riebeek Kasteel and Riebeek West has vineyards on eastern slopes of the Kasteelberg Mountain make big reds of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chenin Blanc, and Chardonnay that are complex  \xa0\xa0 We talk about South African and Swartland Wine history  We discuss how South Africa lies somewhere between the Old World and New World styles. We discuss the early history in the 1660s, with the arrival of the French Huguenots who planted vineyards. We tell the story of how, in late 1990s, Charles Back of Goats do Roam fame went to Swartland to source grapes and wound up transforming the area by \xa0buying land and hiring Eben Sadie to run his “Spice Route” wines in 1998. We discuss the modern history of the region and why it takes a special person to make wine in conditions withlow rainfall, un-irrigated vines and paltry yields.  \xa0\xa0 Producers and the Swartland revolution  We discuss Swartland Independent Producers (SIP), an association that runs the Swartland Revolution celebration every November Their goal: Wines that are a true expression of their origin. Like old world AOPs -- distinctive wines but also making them so as to speak about a sense of place See the list of requirements and the producers here: \xa0https://swartlandindependent.co.za/members/  \xa0\xa0 Top producers  AA Badenhorst: AA Badenhorst Family White, \xa0AA Badenhorst Family Red are flagships; Secateurs produced from purchased fruit Lammershoek:Traditional producer Testalonga:“naked” style, funky wines Lammershoek:Libero No. 5 Mullineux: Syrahs and white blends; entry level Kloof Street Porseleinberg\xa0 Sadie Family: Columella – Syrah-based blend (famous), Palladius – rich style white; cheaper, co-owned Sequillo range  \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Theresa Breuer is a young woman who found herself (sadly, earlier  than she expected) at the helm of one of the most respected, highest quality Riesling producers in the Rheingau region of Germany. \xa0I had the pleasure of spending the day with her a few years back and she is brilliant, poised, kind and a genius vigneron and cellar master, but more than anything, at 30-something, she is one of the best fresh faces and ambassadors for what Rheingau wine is, was, and should be.\xa0 This show should give you a perspective on why Rheingau is so special and make you understand why a dork like me loves this place so much!\xa0 Here are the show notes:\xa0 HISTORY  Theresa shares\xa0Weingut Georg Breuer\'s nearly 140 years in wine -- from her great grandfather Peter\'s involvement in the business side of wine, to her grandfather after whom the Weingut is named, to her dad, Bernhard, and then to her. \xa0 We discuss Bernhard Breuer\'s obsession with quality, bringing the reputation of Rheingau back from a less than stellar period, and her involvement in the business.\xa0 Theresa shares her (beautiful) philosophies about wine and why it means so much to her.  Rheingau Education!  I have rarely found anyone who can educate on a region as well and succinctly as Theresa Breuer and we are lucky to have her explain stuff like:\xa0  Where is Rheingau and what makes it so unique for wine? The parallels with Burgundy in terms of Grand Cru, Premier Cru, Village, Regional sites and why it is so easy in Rheingau Why Riesling is so dominant in Rheingau and why it does so well here (hint: reflection from the river, slate/quartzite soils, slopes!) How climate change has affected the region, what a hot year like 2019 means for the wine, and what really matters to vintage How oak is used in Rheingau (and it is used, a LOT!)    Theresa gives us the deep dive into site specific info. It\'s fascinating:\xa0  Theresa shares detailed and excellent information about George Breuer\'s sites and the why and how behind the differences in the wines. We discuss their beautiful Grand Cru sites in Rüdesheim – Berg Schlossberg, Berg Roseneck and Berg Rottland and their wholly owned site, Nonnenberg in Rauenthal (in the eastern part of Rheingau Theresa talks about her commitment to organic viticulture and her vision for the wines -- to let the vineyard produce the best wines and to let the Riesling show its home in the glass!\xa0 We talk about what makes Theresa\'s wines elegant and age worthy. We discuss the generational shift in Rheingau and what it does and will mean for wine in the future.  Theresa unveils big news: Weingut Georg Breuer bought some land in the (very different, Mittelrhein-type) wine area of Lorch, to the west of their Grand Cru vineyards. They will be learning more about the sites, and making wine from them soon!\xa0 Check out the videos on my YouTube Channel -- you will love Theresa even more!\xa0 \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

M.C. Ice and I are not big fans, but we do our best to explain the phenomenon of these whites made with skin contact. \xa0 Here are the show notes: \xa0  You know it\'s time to cover a topic when, in Europe, the supermarket chain Aldi sells a bottle of skin-contact wine for less than $8 US!\xa0  \xa0  WHAT THE HECK IS ORANGE WINE??  First and most importantly, it\'s not from oranges but from grapes!\xa0 Made exactly like a red but with longer maceration (the time during winemakig when the grape skins and seeds stay in contact with the juice)\xa0 Reds with skin contact are red wines, reds with little contact are rosés; whites with skin contact are “orange”, without contact they are whites  Rosés usually undergo less than 12 hours macerating on their skins before the juice is pressed off\xa0 Orange wine is the opposite of Rosé   Can make skin-contact wine from any grape – length of time with the skins will matter to flavor and the longer the time the more likely the wine is to mask terroir Length of time varies, but maceration is LONG – days, weeks, months     Not all are orange so it’s better to call them “skin-contact wines.”  WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MACERATING WHITE JUICE WITH SKINS?  The wine takes on a darker colored/orange-ish white color, as well as phenols, pigment.\xa0 Aromas: Bolder and more intense same grapes vinified as traditional white – like rose v red  Flavors: Nutty, oxidized flavor, very sour with a cider note.\xa0Can be bold, nutty, like old apples, sourdough bread   Textures: Dry, tannic, intense (not very pleasurable sometimes)   \xa0 Different styles:  Lightest ones, are acidic, aromatic wines, with fresh apricot, herbs Medium ones – slight oxidation, some acetone notes, old apple Then full-bodied, boldly tannic, and often smoky, nutty, lots of VA, off notes  \xa0 Regions:\xa0  The Republic of Georgia: Qvervi—underground vessels sealed with beeswax or oil soaked clothes. The practice of skin contact whites likely originated here 6,000 or more years ago (the practice still goes on today, although the Greeks and Romans quickly realized the best wines were those from free-run juice/whites not macerated, which is our "traditional" style today).\xa0Rkatsiteli is the main grape Listen to the Georgia Podcast!  \xa0  Italy: Most prominent in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, often called\xa0\xa0ramato\xa0“copper-colored” wines from Pinot Grigio but Ribolla Gialla and Tocai Friulano are often used.\xa0  Fruili producers who re-started the orange wine movement:\xa0Radikon, Gravner Sicilian producers:\xa0Cos, I Vigneri\xa0    \xa0  Slovenia:\xa0Goriska Brda in Slovenia has a long history of skin contact wine Listen to the Slovenia show!  \xa0  United States  Long Island:\xa0Channing Daughters, Shinn Estate California: Some Sonoma    \xa0  Others:\xa0Australia – Sauvignon Blanc, Greece, South Africa, Croatia, France  \xa0 Food Pairing:\xa0Skin Contact wine is versatile with food pairing but it depends on the weight and the treatment of the wine (length of maceration, barrel v. stainless steel, etc).\xa0  Serving temps – 50 – 55˚ warmer side  \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Simone Madden-Grey returns to tell us about the stunning Pinot Noir, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling, up and coming Syrah, and other excellent Wellington wines that must be on your radar! \xa0 Here are the show notes: Wellington Wine Country Overview  In 2016 three wine regions of the Wairarapa Valley in the lower north island formally launched Wellington Wine Country: Masterton, Gladstone, and Martinborough The area is small -- just 3% of national plantings and 1% of national production, but represents 10% of producers  \xa0 Location  The southern part of New Zealand\'s North Island 35 miles (55km) north-east of Wellington (1 hr drive), New Zealand\'s capital city, in a wide river valley between Rimutaka mountain range and eastern Wairarapa hills  \xa0Climate/Terroir  Semi-maritime, dry climate – rain shadow of the Tararua Ranges with blustery winds Cool spring and autumn seasons, hot summer days with cool nights - long growing season Martinborough Terrace:\xa0a crescent shaped area on the edge of a river terrace formed by the Ruamahunga and Huangarua rivers with gravel soils that drain well and stress the vines (in a good way) Mountain ranges and hills  Remutaka and Tararua Ranges to the west protect from winds off Tasman Sea Aorangi Ranges, western mountain ranges protect area from cold southerly winds coming in off the Cook Strait and together with the western moutnain ranges, also funnel cool breezes up from the Cook Strait    Soil  River terraces in Martinborough with pockets of clay and quartz-threaded greywacke (type of coloured sedimentary sandstone formed by river deposits) and volcanic basalt.  Alluvial soils can be up to 15m deep in Martinborough    Climate  Semi-maritime climate with high sunshine hours, cool Springs and Autumns, warm Summers Warm, low rainfall, relatively long, dry growing season, low humidity and low disease pressure Diurnal variation:\xa0Summer temps during the day 30˚C (86˚F) to 10˚C (50˚F) at night Frost is an issue, very windy at times throughout the year, particularly in spring  \xa0 Sub Regions: North to south  Masterton:\xa0Largest town in Wairarapa,first area grapes were planted in the region.\xa0Known for\xa0Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir  \xa0  Gladstone:\xa0Just south of Masterton, free-draining river terraces - Shallower terraces than of Martinborough and nearby. Clay pockets – planted Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc with high aromatics.  \xa0  Martinborough – about 30 wineries:\xa0Colonial village is surrounded by small vineyards, family-owned producers – highly respected boutique wineries. Lowest rainfall of any area in the North Island and reliably cool climate for Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling and other aromatic whites.  \xa0  Te Muna:\xa0Southeast of the township with stonier alluvial gravel soils, windier growing conditions and a slightly cooler climate than Martinborough. Escarpment and Craggy Range are here.  Wine Style:\xa0Red, white, sparkling (usually Methode Traditionnelle), rosé and sweet wines are all produced in the region  Pinot Noir: Thicker skins and smaller yields contribute an aromatic, savory, dark fruited profile with good acidity and potential for age. Sauvignon Blanc: leading white grape variety, very important for export. More herbaceous and citrus driven, with mineral notes -- less of the big fruit style of Marlborough Pinot Gris: Trying to coax a spicier, more complex style with pear and white stone fruit characters\xa0 Chardonnay: For the last decade growers\xa0pick earlier to attain lower alcohol, more natural acidity -- lighter less tropical style. \xa0Varying degrees of new oak and use of MLF, lees contact and stirring, but the goal is elegance Riesling: Good acidity, very lemon-lime in flavor Grüner Veltliner, Gewürztraminer, Pinot Blanc, Syrah and some Bordeaux varieties  The producer list!  High-profile small producers: Ata Rangi,\xa0Margrain,\xa0Dry River, Escarpment,\xa0Te Kairanga,\xa0Martinborough Vineyard Paddy Borthwick in Gladstone Larger but still good producers: Palliser,\xa0Craggy Range Second labels:  Martinborough Vineyard’s "Te Tera" \xa0(UK, NZ, Oz only) Palliser "Pencarrow"\xa0(UK, NZ, Oz only) Escarpment "The Edge" (UK, NZ, Oz only)    \xa0 _________________________________________\xa0 Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Lin-Manuel Miranda on The Hamilcast:  https://www.thehamilcast.com/lin-manuel-miranda/ \xa0 | Miguel Cervantes (#HamiltonCHI’s Alexander Hamilton) was generous enough to find some time to record and we had such a great time. From the story of asking Gillian to be a stand in (seriously), to breaking down the role of Alexander Hamilton, to playing trivia with the listeners, we covered a lot of ground.

If you\'re interested, please feel free to read along with us; we\'ll be going chapter-by-chapter and provide detailed and reference-heavy outlines for each #Cherpter. But there\'s no pressure! There\'s plenty to talk about and this is not a super serious history class.When I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has built around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast for you and I absolutely love making it.If you have any great Ham stories or funny references you\'ve come across, let me know! I love hearing about things like that.

Dickens\' classic novel about a lovable urchin named Oliver Twist is equal parts social novel, mystery, and bildungsroman -- or so Charlie thought. We dive into what works and doesn\'t work about its depictions of London in the Industrial Revolution, Oliver\'s moral compass, and the titular twist. | Welcome back to HELLBOYS, a Divine Comedy podcast from the boys here at Overdue! We\'re continuing our journey through Robert and Jean Hollander\'s translation of Dante\'s Divine Comedy a few cantos at a time.Some Patreon supporters get these episodes monthly, but every two months we combine them for general consumption. This episode carries us through the back half of the Inferno, covering Cantos XVII-XXXIV. We travel through the Malebolge, meet a demon biker gang, and climb down the Devil himself!Find out more about how to get these episodes monthly at patreon.com/overduepod. | The God of Small Things is about family, and loss, and India, and the caste system, and all of its disparate plot lines and character arcs come together in the end like a Seinfeld episode but with more tragedy.  | "What if women ended the Peloponnesian War, am I right?" asks Aristophanes in his classic comedy Lysistrata. Famous for its depiction of a sex strike that brings the warring Greek states to their unsexed knees, the play has been remixed countless times as generations of artists adapt its core conceit to their own times. So we figured we\'d go back to the old Prince of Comedy himself to see what all the fuss is about.Talking points include comedies of bad manners, Ancient Greek props, and the "lioness on a cheese grater." | It\'s time to play some games! Craig\'s sister Jillian read Iain M. Banks\' The Player of Games, one of several entries in his Culture series that explores a hegemonic utopia influencing as much of outer space as it can. Banks\' ideas gameplay may be primarily analog, but he still manages to represent cultures and worlds with digital creativity.Andrew may be away, but we still find time to joke about names, make some Gatsby references, and chat about Starcraft. | Join us as we attempt to bring Pullman\'s epic god-fightin\' trilogy to a close! We start with a brief recap of the first two books, and then we dive into what does and doesn\'t work for Andrew in the final installment. Train your spyglass on the Fall of Man, cut through bear armor with your subtle knife, and follow your golden compass to the origin of Dust. Additional talking points include Andrew\'s new partyboy son, motorcycle elephants, and the debut of a new segment: Andrew\'s Dad Moment. | Friend of the show Christina Tucker (Unfriendly Black Hotties, PCHH, her new newsletter, etc.) joins us to chat about Jeff VanderMeer\'s novel Annihilation. It\'s the first of his Southern Reach trilogy, a Weird Science Fiction romp through a mysterious zone called Area X.We\'ve got our own Area X going, replete with chicken sandwiches, Edward James Olmos, and a fun-loving chat of supporters. | This week we welcome Renata and Kait from The Worst Bestsellers to talk about Becky Chambers\' first entry in the Wayfarer series: The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. It\'s a book that\'s equal parts cozy AND sexy, with plenty of aliens for you to meet and/or have...stirrings about.Our conversation takes the long way from Star Trek to the Secret, exploring what it\'s like for folks who usually read Bad books to actually read a Good one.Caveat lictor: sometimes you have to swear in space! | The titular Tarzan of the titular Apes is a lot more than "Me Tarzan. You Jane." And Edgar Rice Burroughs is here to tell you all about how and why it\'s because he\'s the sire of an English nobleman.Join us for a chat about the lost city of Tarzana, the Ernest filmography, and the invention of stabbing. | Andrew\'s Appointment Television co-hosts Kathryn VanArendonk and Margaret H. Willison join us for a chat about siblings, rivalry, and this classic of modern parenting lit from Adele Faber and Elain Mazlish.At the time of recording, Andrew\'s fatherhood was looming on the horizon, so Kathryn kindly shared with us how relevant the book felt to her own parenting experience. And don\'t worry, Craig and Margaret had plenty of wisdom to share as well.Caveat lictor: Margaret\'s here, so there\'s swearing.', 'chan_desc': "Overdue is a podcast about the books you've been meaning to read.

LeVeque helps us flip our inner narratives about food and let go of the shame that sometimes surrounds how we eat. She shares her life hacks, like how to make her Fab Four smoothie that supports balanced blood sugar, how to reset and satisfy hunger hormones, and how to not regret your takeout order. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.)\xa0 | “As a man, if you don’t express your fears fully and completely,” says Gabrielle Bernstein, “it’s going to be like a pressure cooker.” The New York Times–bestselling author of Super Attractor joins the guys to explain why she believes we’re capable of attracting what we want and why we block ourselves from this power in myriad ways. Bernstein shows us how to develop this skill, forgive our thoughts, redirect our energy—and use her tools of attraction. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | “Being strong for each other is just being real with each other,” says journalist Lauren Scruggs Kennedy, who lost her left arm and left eye after being hit by a plane propeller. Today, she talks with the goopfellas about fear and faith, finding peace as you move through grief, unexpected sources of gratitude, and how the accident redefined beauty for her. Getting your fear out in the open is paramount, says Scruggs Kennedy, because when left inside, it will only expand. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub and the Lauren Scruggs Kennedy Foundation, which provides funding for girls and women to get prosthetic limbs they otherwise might not be able to afford.) | “I remind myself I am enough, I have enough, and not everyone is going to love me,” says Antoni Porowski, Queer Eye’s food and wine connoisseur, author of Antoni in the Kitchen, and restaurateur. Today he’s sharing his experience with anxiety, self-doubt, and imposter syndrome. Porowski talks about taking in criticism, tackling compare-and-despair habits, building confidence and self-acceptance, and his unexpected homecoming. And of course, he talks to our cohosts about cooking and how food has shaped his life and the way he connects with others. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | \xa0“I never felt free in my life,” says Lewis Howes. “And I felt free for the first time when I started to share my shame and insecurities.” Howes—the bestselling author of The Mask of Masculinity, the host of the School of Greatness podcast, and a former pro athlete—joins the guys to talk about the different masks that he believes men hide behind. Howes talks about why, at the height of his success, he felt most lonely and unfulfilled. And then they get into the roots of anger and why so many boys are conditioned to misdirect and misunderstand the emotion. They talk about setting aside blame, rebuilding a culture where men have space to be vulnerable, accepting what’s enough, and breaking through whatever mask you’re wearing right now. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | “We tend to shy away from listening to our bodies and asking the right questions and seeking the right help in the moment,” says Michael Anthony, executive chef of the renowned Gramercy Tavern in New York City. Today, he’s catching up with the guys (Seamus Mullen is a longtime friend) to talk about a health scare that changed his outlook on life. Anthony had massive a heart attack that compelled him to rethink how he was living, to question the put-your-head-down-and-work chef mentality (that’s also familiar to many of us outside the kitchen), and to reconnect with the natural world, which he found a way to do through food.(For more, see thegoopfellas podcast hub.) | Dianne “V” Capaldi—aka PaleoBOSS lady—struggled for years with debilitating MS. At one point, she was given a bleak prognosis, and told to get her affairs in order. Her husband walked out. And she prevailed. Today, V joins the guys to share her wild story, the moment she decided she would never give up, and her “brick-to-forehead” moment when she says she realized what she needed to do: heal on a cellular level. She got conscious about owning her own life. And now, she’s paying it forward. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | “The main issue with conventional medicine is that it’s the wrong tool for the job that we face today,” says Chris Kresser, acupuncturist and functional medicine educator. Kresser, who wrote the books The Paleo Cure and Unconventional Medicine, believes we’re too often prescribed for our symptoms, and not often enough getting at the root causes of our illnesses. He shares his own story of chronic illness, trying every trick in the book, and finding the paleo diet and functional medicine approach that helped save him. Kresser talks to the guys about diet controversies, alternative therapies, shifting financial and self-care priorities—and the not easy, but simple things we can all do for our health. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | Here is Rob Lowe at his best: In this conversation with the guys, Lowe talks about his health obsessions new and old, from intermittent fasting to surfing, the Atkins diet, and the fitness instructors who bust his ass. He talks about the things he no longer feels compelled to do and how he’s learned to listen to his limits as he’s gotten older. Is he still competitive? Very—which he believes has helped him stay clean. And then there’s his family. Lowe talks about the big decisions he’s made as a father, how he thinks about raising good men, and what’s made his marriage work for nearly three decades. “If there’s any way to marry your best friend,” he says, “do it.” (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | On this special episode of goopfellas, cohosts Dr. Will Cole and Seamus Mullen break down the ketogenic diet. Should you switch to a high-fat, low-carb baseline? What would you eat in a typical day? When do our bodies go into ketosis, and what are the potential health benefits? What about intermittent fasting? Seamus shares his personal experience of changing his diet while healing from rheumatoid arthritis. And Will shares examples from his functional medicine practice, the kinds of diets he typically prescribes for patients with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and how he tweaks the conventional keto model to be cleaner and more vegetable-forward for anyone (he’s the author of Ketotarian, after all). (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.)', 'chan_desc': 'What drives people to change, to heal, to reinvent themselves? How do we reclaim our health, bounce back from heartbreak, flip the script? On goopfellas, two friends who have become familiar with unlikely personal transformations have raw conversations with people who have experienced profound shifts in perspective and well-being. Together, functional medicine practitioner Will Cole, DC, and chef Seamus Mullen get at the catalysts that bring people out of their dark night and into their purpose. Each of their goopfellas guests—from athletes to actors to authors—is different. As are the hosts: Mullen himself almost died from rheumatoid arthritis, and Cole’s day job is helping people uncover and overturn the roots of dis-ease. But you’ll likely see pieces of yourself in all their conversations, reflected in every one of their challenges. And we hope, from the lessons they learned along the way, you’ll find something you need to bring about a change, big or small, in your own life.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/21/d3/e2/21d3e242-9254-b371-5f80-16521e2c5fac/mza_6786331723623561505.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-10'}}

Listen now at www.wondery.fm/scarecast1 \xa0 \xa0 | In this episode of the Scarecast, we will be going over three cases: **************************************** Dolly\'s Dip & The Death of Regena Dolly Young (1:05) In 1984, The Los Angeles Times did a story about a horrible accident involving 48-year-old, Regena “Dolly” Young on Disneyland’s ‘Matterhorn.\xa0 One day, on the attraction, Regena fell off of her bobsled and was fatally trampled by an incoming bobsled.\xa0 An analysis of the incident revealed that an unbuckled seat belt was the main issue that could have brought about the accident.\xa0 It is still unclear whether the seatbelt trouble was caused by a ride malfunction or something that Regena intentionally did, which some reports claim could have been done to help out her child who was also on the ride.\xa0 What is clear is that while on the ride, Regena stood up as the bobsled sloped downward when there was another track overhead. This sudden drop flung Regena upward, causing her head to smash into the track up above, which threw her out of her sled onto the track it was riding on. When she landed, she was still alive but unconscious, but then about thirty seconds later another bobsled came speeding along and ran her over.\xa0 She was instantly killed and supposedly wound up lodged in the structure so tightly that the track had to be taken apart to get her out. This accident became so notorious, that the place where Regena died was coined “Dolly’s Dip”, based off of her nickname.\xa0 Ever since she died, it became evident that the ghost of “Dolly” started to haunt the Matterhorn.\xa0 Many people reported they frequently saw her ghost and heard its eerie wails throughout the attraction, specifically in a large cavernous area near the center of the ride. **************************************** Harold The Doll (5:54)\xa0 \xa0 Greg Mishka first posted his doll, Harold, on eBay back in 2004. Greg had been pursuing a career as a filmmaker at the time and was adamant to fully disclose the experiences he had with the doll to potential buyers. He explained that ever since he bought the doll from a flea market in Florida, his life had been turned upside down and flooded with bad luck. Greg’s cat mysteriously died, his girlfriend broke up with him, and he would constantly have migraines. After he was told by a priest to burn Harold, Greg attempted to set the doll alight, but it simply wouldn’t burn. Instead, the doll was put in a small wooden coffin and Greg decided to store it in his basement. Unfortunately, he started to hear the voices of children playing in his basement. The eBay listing quickly gained a lot of traction. Many websites published articles discussing Greg and Harold, forums would discuss them, and at one point the Coast to Coast radio show, hosted by Art Bell, spoke about the doll. Suspicions surrounding Harold started to grow, even more so when a video was uploaded to the internet. In this video, viewers can see the doll’s arm and mouth moving. Greg claims that the doll spoke and said the word “Harold”, which is why he decided to give it that name. At first, Greg had hoped to just make a little extra cash from selling the doll, but with all the attention it was receiving, more and more bids were being made. **************************************** The Ilkley Moor Alien (15:54) In 1987, a metropolitan policeman in London quit his job of four years in order to move closer to his wife’s family.\xa0 The man went by the fictitious name, Philip Spencer, and that year, he moved to the West Yorkshire area of Ilkley Moor with his wife and child.\xa0 Later that year, on the morning of December 1st, at around 7:15 am, Spencer went out on a walk to visit his in-law’s.\xa0 It was particularly dreary and overcast that morning, and Spencer would have to cross the Ilkley Moor to reach his destination.\xa0 Spencer had heard tales of mysterious lights that had been seen around Ilkley Moor, so he brought along his camera just in case.\xa0 He also took his compass with him, to help with navigating through the early day fog.\xa0 It had been a few months since Spencer started living there, so he prepared for any sudden mist or rain, which was characteristic of the area. \xa0\xa0\xa0 As he traveled through the moor, Spencer decided to take a shortcut, which led him up a steep slope and past a group of trees.\xa0 When he got close to the trees, he noticed a barely audible humming noise that he assumed came from an unseen aircraft above the fog.\xa0 Unexpectedly, something darted past Spencer’s field of vision and he turned to check it out.\xa0 At about 30 feet away, Spencer saw a small green creature that was around four feet tall.\xa0 The creature proceeded speedily through the trees, and the bewildered Spencer shouted “Hey” at it, expecting to figure out its identity.\xa0 In response, the little being turned toward him and waved.\xa0 It was then that Spencer remembered his camera, and he swiftly took it out and photographed the creature.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The creature then continued onward up a slope that led to a quarry at its summit.\xa0 Spencer on impulse followed the peculiar being, curious to find out more about it. As he neared the end of the path, he suddenly froze in astonishment at what appeared in front of him.\xa0 Spencer observed a large silver object that rose from the moor; it looked like two saucers conjoined at the edges with a domed top.\xa0 On top of the dome, there was a white cube with a pattern of holes carved into it.\xa0 Spencer then noticed the humming sound he heard earlier, was coming from the craft, and now blared loudly around him.\xa0 Regrettably, the shock of everything prevented him from capturing a photo before the object disappeared into the sky.

And Dan Aykroyd’s Men In Black Encounter **************************************** The Haunting of Sand Canyon Road (1:42) A night that was supposed to birth memories for four teenagers on their prom night, instead, birthed a haunting urban legend that has existed in the city of Canyon Country since the 1980s. These four teenagers, one girl, and three boys had just left their high school prom and had gone for a drive down one of the many long stretches of road in Canyon Country, CA, known as Sand Canyon drive. The teenagers were headed to an area known as Nike Missile Site LA-94, an area where local teens would often hang out and party. Little did the teenagers know, this would be the last drive they would take as the car would suddenly swerve uncontrollably and would crash into a tree on the corner of Sand Canyon Road and Warm Springs Drive. The only girl in the car was still alive, and would cry for help, but unfortunately, would see her end when no one would arrive. According to the urban legend, some locals claim that the spirit of the girl can be seen around the actual crash site around midnight to 3:00am. The girl would appear to run towards the person who spots her, and request help for her injured friends, her hair flying on all sides, and her face completely ruined. The girl is said to have entirely white eyes, and half her skull is visible around her nose and mouth. Sometimes she is said to even launch at the person as if she is trying to take the person with her. Luckily, in all cases, either the person has escaped in time, or the girl has disappeared into thin air.

However, even though they had followed the exact directions to where the hotel was located on the map, they struggled to find it. Pauline stated that, “This is without a doubt the road that it was on!”. Everyone agreed for the simple fact that they saw the old-fashioned circus posters, still plastered along walls. They followed the map, made several changes to their route, but still had no luck in finding the hotel. This arose the question, “Where could the hotel have gone?”, especially if they were so sure that it was where they were looking.

(14:28) Although Walt passed away in 1966, it is believed that his ghost made its way back to his old apartment in Disneyland to continue watching over the place he cherished the most... but in a much creepier way. SEE THIS STORY VISUALLY ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL: \xa0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7q4qg9rzUo **************************************** Dan Aykroyd\'s Men In Black Encounter (17:36) Just before the cancellation of his TV show Out There, Aykroyd claims that he stepped out of the studio to take a smoke, but ended up taking a call from Britney Spears, who he had starred beside as her father in the film Crossroads. Britney Spears had called him to ask him to appear on Aykroyd’s old show Saturday Night Live with her, and as he talked he says he noticed a mysterious black Ford Sudan pull up on a nearby street. He claimed that he tried to look at the license plate of the vehicle, but it appeared “fuzzy.” Out of the car purportedly stepped two guys, in which one “very tall,” pale man in a black suit had stepped out of the backseat. The tall guy stared right at Aykroyd with a “dirty look.” Aykrord claimed to have looked the other way after noticing this, but when he looked right back after a second later, the mysterious men and the vehicle was no longer there. Aykroyd claims that the car disappeared out of thin air. Two hours after this incident, the producers of the show were told to stop taping, and the show was immediately canceled. Had the show been released, it would have made public an interview with Dr. Steven Greer, of the Disclosure Project, who was about to spill tons of testimony of UFO witnesses and supposed insider information. Unfortunately, no reason was ever disclosed in regards to why the show was canceled.

(We think!) If there indeed is, drapes would cozy up the room and add warmth to the space. Bamboo blinds would work, if they are mounted up high behind the rod with an outside mount. The other option besides panels on either side of the fireplace is doing drapes on the long wall, and using custom Roman shades using the same fabric. If the space between the drapery and the fireplace is too close, you may have to do the Roman shades to match the style of the drapes. \xa0', 'chan_desc': "We want to teach you how to decorate!
