Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US.

In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line.

"Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds.

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\xa0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law. We call it Trump Con Law for short.After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on Apple Podcasts and RadioPublic | Everything in Bethel, Alaska comes in by cargo plane or barge, and even when something stops working, it’s often too expensive and too inconvenient to get it out again.

And it turns out that design can completely change whether a five minute wait feels reasonable or completely unbearable. Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing.

She reveals surprising insights about the way our brains subconsciously experience food -- and shows how this data could help us eat healthier without sacrificing taste. | The US health care system assumes many things about patients: that they can take off from work in the middle of the day, speak English, have a working telephone and a steady supply of food. Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US. In this eye-opening talk, he shares stories of the challenges low-income patients face -- and how we can build a better system for all. | Conservationist and TED Fellow Moreangels Mbizah studied the famous Cecil the lion until he was shot by a trophy hunter in 2015. She wonders how things could\'ve gone differently, asking: "What if the community that lived next to Cecil was involved in protecting him?" In a quick talk, Mbizah shares the state of conservation in her home of Zimbabwe -- and why she thinks that communities living with wildlife are the ones best positioned to help them. | The average farmer in America makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store. They feed our communities, but farmers often cannot afford the very foods they grow. In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line. "We\'re not the goal of evolution," Chakrabarty says. "Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds. Learn how Dr. King has ignited a worldwide movement to create tobacco-free investments and how each of us can play a role in ending this epidemic. | "Building a 30-foot-high concrete structure from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security," says Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican from Texas whose district encompasses two times zones and shares an 820-mile border with Mexico. Speaking from Washington, DC in a video interview with former state attorney general Anne Milgram, Hurd discusses the US government\'s border policy and its controversial detention and child separation practices -- and lays out steps toward a better future at the border. (Recorded at the TED World Theater in New York on September 10, 2019) | Computational geneticist Yaniv Erlich helped build the world\'s largest family tree -- comprising 13 million people and going back more than 500 years. He shares fascinating patterns that emerged from the work -- about our love lives, our health, even decades-old criminal cases -- and shows how crowdsourced genealogy databases can shed light not only on the past but also on the future. | As a sex educator, Emily Nagoski is often asked: How do couples sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term? In this funny, insightful talk, she shares her answer -- drawing on (somewhat surprising) research to reveal why some couples stop having sex while others keep up a connection for a lifetime. | It\'s time for planetary-scale interventions to combat climate change -- and environmentalist Tim Flannery thinks seaweed can help. In a bold talk, he shares the epic carbon-capturing potential of seaweed, explaining how oceangoing seaweed farms created on a massive scale could trap all the carbon we emit into the atmosphere. Learn more about this potentially planet-saving solution -- and the work that\'s still needed to get there.', 'chan_desc': "Want TED Talks on the go?

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets.

So junk accumulates. Diane McEachern has been a resident of Bethel for about 20 years, and she’s made it her personal mission to count every single dead car in the city.

And it turns out that design can completely change whether a five minute wait feels reasonable or completely unbearable. Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing. They cut across communities like monuments to the conflict, etched into the physical landscape. Taking them down isn’t going to be easy.Peace Lines | During the depths of the Depression in the late 1930s, 300 craftspeople came together for two years to build an enormous scale model of the City of San Francisco. This Works Progress Administration (WPA) project was conceived as a way of putting artists to work while also creating a planning tool for the city to imagine its future.The massive work was meant to remain on public view for all to see, but World War II broke out and the 6,000 piece, hand-carved and painted wooden model was put into storage for almost 80 years.Model CityThis episode was produced by The Kitchen Sisters, Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson with Nathan Dalton and Brandi Howell.

Today, bees have become more livestock than wild creatures, little winged cows, that depend on humans for food and shelter.On Beeing | When confronted with trash piling up on a median in front of their home in Oakland, Dan and Lu Stevenson decided to try something unusual: they would install a statue of the Buddha to watch over the place.

Inside the dome, there was a man-made savannah. A rainforest. A farm. An ocean with tropical coral reef. And all of these habitats would be populated with life. Things did not go according to plan. But was it a failure? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | In 1938, Hitler’s chief architect Albert Speer started redesigning Berlin for a New Order, elements of which exist today. The Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin features designs that specifically evoke the Third Reich. Following the end of World War II, the airport became a crucial access point for the US and British to bring food through the Berlin Blockade. It was closed in 2008, and then became a park, and emergency refugee housing. But the buildings remain. What do we do with the everyday reminders of a dark history? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | The Oneida Community was founded in upstate New York in 1848 by John Humphrey Noyes, a former theological student who believed that paradise could be found on Earth through nontraditional sexual and familial structures, including complex marriages and communal childraising. Hundreds of people followed him, and for many years their community succeeded. But the center could not hold, and the community pivoted — into a thriving business that became one of the world’s most prominent makers of flatware. \xa0 | Suburban developments built in the 1950s were idyllic communities and gave many people their first opportunity at home ownership, but typically excluded African Americans. While William Levitt used explicit racial covenants and other tactics to keep his famed Levittown developments white, one builder used racial quotas to create an integrated community — and succeeded, for a while. Can the suburbs be a utopia for all? | Following the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru commissioned famed architect Le Corbusier to design the city of Chandigarh, to signal India’s rise on the world stage. But the city’s architecture and design has become known more for its Western modernist roots, and less as a symbol of Indian nationalism, and furniture that had been intended for the masses are now being auctioned off as high art pieces that wind up in Kourtney Kardashian’s dining room. | Most people today know the story of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in America, from the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, and especially from the 1995 Disney animated film. A gripping recounting of the true story of how the settlement failed and recovered, and the toll it took on the English and Native Americans, shows how failure can be a transformative experience, and also how the stories we tell ourselves about the failures inform the way we live today.

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\xa0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law. We call it Trump Con Law for short.After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on Apple Podcasts and RadioPublic | Everything in Bethel, Alaska comes in by cargo plane or barge, and even when something stops working, it’s often too expensive and too inconvenient to get it out again.

Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing.

She gives us brilliant tips for looking and feeling instantly more energized (her two-tone blush trick is life-changing), how to look and feel as vibrant as she does at sixty-two, and why she looks in the mirror rarely, sprinkles salt in her drinking water, and eschews foundation. (We also hear about building a billion-dollar brand, authoring eight books, raising happy kids, and maintaining a happy marriage—the woman is more than miraculous.) We found ourselves scrambling to take notes, and you will, too. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Skin-care guru, CEO, Vermont farmer, single mom, Latina, clean crusader…it’s hard to put Tata Harper in a box.\xa0 Famous for her gorgeous, fast-acting, high-tech serums, oils, masks, and essences—and for creating all-natural luxury skin care before anyone else had mastered melding the two—Harper knows her stuff about skin and about clean beauty. She’s also one of the most glamorous people we know. She talked to us about her path from girl growing up in Colombia to self-possessed founder of an enormously successful company. Her strategies—for keeping your skin in beautiful shape no matter what your age, for scheduling asa powerful form of self-care (the woman never procrastinates, believe it or not), and for balancing work and life so they always make you happy—are life-changing. You’ll also find out what goes into a superserum that costs $450, why Harper believes all-natural is the way to go, and why (if you needed more reasons) you should make the shift to clean beauty.\xa0 (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | As perfumer Douglas Little creates sexy, moody, wildly original, stunningly gorgeous scents, he’s changing the toxic fragrance industry. In this episode, he talks about the sexiness inherent in natural materials, what it’s like to make perfume with GP for goop, why his line of perfumes is called Heretic, why the link between sexuality and scent is so powerful, the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of using botanicals instead of synthetic chemicals, and what Flower Porn is all about. From his childhood fascination with the dirt and (sometimes poisonous) plants in the garden and his career in the wild world of luxury perfumes to some shocking things about fragrance—like why it’s one of the most toxic categories in the entire beauty industry and what it is about conventional scents that gives people headaches—Little’s story is absolutely fascinating. He’s so smart and has such a beautiful imagination—who knew that clean perfume could be as sexy and cool as he’s managed to make it? (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Even if you’d never wear bright-red lipstick, bestselling author Rachel Felder’s take on it is brilliant, funny, original, and wildly entertaining. She shares a ton of incredible tips and answers questions we didn’t know we even had: What to do about lipstick when a hookup gets super-steamy? What’s the perfect shade for your skin? What’s the psychology involved in wearing—or even just seeing—red lipstick? Matte or glossy? Do people respond differently to women wearing lipstick? What’s the ultimate way to apply it? Felder is charming, a master storyteller, and full of quirky personal anecdotes that will stick with you long after you’re done listening to our conversation. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | What’s the difference between Botox and fillers? Can cutting out dairy actually help with acne? Which lasers work best for darker skin types? Is there a fix for dark circles? When you just want to look a little fresher, less broken-out, a little less tired, but above all, like yourself, you go to top NYC dermatologist Robert Anolik. He makes you look better, not done. We could have asked Dr. Anolik questions all day—and he could’ve kept answering them, as he seems to know everything on earth about skin. There are so many ways to treat both the face and the body now, and he takes us through which treatments and procedures really work, how to look your best as you age, strategies to cope with acne, and what can be done for everything from undereye bags or a pooch-y stomach to sun damage and wrinkles. He’s smart, he’s funny, and this episode will arm you with precisely what you need to know before you step into the dermatologist’s office (and help you figure out whether you should go in the first place). (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Before Rosemarie Swift was a famous makeup artist for supermodels like Gisele, and before she founded one of the most successful and luxurious clean beauty brands ever, RMS Beauty, she got terribly sick. Her body, overloaded with heavy metals from the conventional makeup she worked with every day, was in serious trouble. Uncovering why and how the toxins in beauty products were affecting her health changed her whole life—diet, lifestyle, and eventually, her career. Swift translated rage into action, creating one the most beautiful natural makeup lines on the planet. Her story is inspiring for sure, but also , shocking, and funny: Swift tells it like it is, no matter what she’s talking about, whether it’s getting her start in a Vancouver strip club, or how she thinks the coconut-oil industry is like the cocaine industry (every one of her gorgeous products is made with the purest coconut oil). The bonus: Her easy but brilliant makeup tips. You’ll learn everything about how to do the prettiest, most natural-looking no-makeup makeup for glowy, healthy-looking skin. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Can a thread lift really replace a face-lift? Are there little tweaks that can refresh your appearance without looking overdone? How and why do different skin tones age differently? What is it we’re registering when someone looks “off”—and what has that come to signify in our culture? We had endless questions for world-famous plastic surgeon Julius Few, and he blew us away with his knowledge, candor, and truly surprising ideas and techniques. In this episode, he talks about the fourth dimension (in terms of beauty), how he stacks less-invasive treatments in place of full-on surgery, and why too much filler can actually make someone look older—plus, he gives incredible tips on how to keep your face and body looking their best long-term. No matter how you feel about plastic surgery, this is a wildly fascinating conversation.(For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | From her first job as an assistant at a hair salon in Australia to her current role as CEO of KORA Organics (a goop favorite), female founder and former supermodel Miranda Kerr talks about all that her amazing career has taught her. Her path to founding one of the most successful skin-care companies in the clean beauty space involved a lot of surprises. After burning out as a world-famous Victoria’s Secret Angel, she woke up to the facts about the toxic ingredients in conventional beauty products—and went to work on the problem as an entrepreneur. And her roles as wife, mother, and daughter bring up issues we can all relate to and, we found, get super inspired by. We love her brilliant ideas on work-life balance, why she prioritizes date nights with her husband, and her (really good) makeup and skin tips that she’s learned on shoots all over the world. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.)hub.) | Nneka Leiba, the vice president of healthy living science at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), talks about clean, nontoxic beauty and the shocking truth behind the largely unregulated beauty and personal-care industry. Leiba and her team assess the health effects of chemical exposure from day-to-day products—and what she tells us is both grim and galvanizing. A few of the topics we go into: why black girls go through puberty much earlier than girls of other races, the most important beauty product to go clean with, why spray sunscreen is a real problem, and much more. If you’ve ever remotely considered going clean with your beauty routine, if you’ve ever wondered why companies would use known toxic ingredients in their products, or if you just want to understand the facts around this issue, this episode is really going to make you think. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | In the premiere episode of goop’s new podcast, The Beauty Closet, hosts Jean Godfrey-June and Megan O’Neill sit down with their boss, goop founder and CEO Gwyneth Paltrow, and really talk. In between discussions about being, in GP’s words, “f*ckable,” nontoxic beauty, the role diversity plays at goop HQ, crow’s-feet, the weird workings of fame on the sense of self, and the upgrade we all get around age forty, GP gives up her best skin, hair, and makeup tips, including what she did to get her wedding-day glow. (French fries and whisky played a role, as did some beautiful no-makeup makeup.) The no-holds-barred conversation is as fun, serious, and hilarious as GP herself.

That didn’t happen. Here’s what did...Featuring crazy coincidences, heartwarming reunions, sister moms, turkey baster twins, and a stadium full of siblings. | Rebecca Traister checks her phone first thing in the morning: It\'s always full of bad news, but that bad news is her job, and she wants to know what she\'s getting into right away.

That’s what we found out this summer when we stayed at our beach house to manage the duplex rentals - AND IT WAS THE BEST SUMMER OF OUR LIVES. The smaller home and smaller town lessons that we learned really stuck with us when we returned home - and they have already inspired us to make 4 changes to our life and habits back in Richmond. So even if you aren\'t planning to move or downsize, there are some things you could experiment with too. We’re also sharing why we’re fiiiiiinally starting a long-awaited renovation in our house, and one way we\'re kicking a bad habit to the curb and saving over $500 a year (and creating less waste).

But our first rental season wasn’t without hiccups, high anxiety moments, and surprisingly frequent learning opportunities. So this week we’re taking you behind the scenes of a jam-packed few months of learning the hospitality ropes while juggling guests and (more literally) a very full jug of laundry detergent. Sherry also celebrates the end of a very long “personal renovation” and we share how something simple led us to rethink our approach to cooking dinner.\xa0  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-146 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | This week we’re diving into a survey that reveals the top homebuyer regrets - as in what features their homes have that they ended up not loving (and the results may surprise you!). \xa0A new study also concluded some shocking-to-us things about millennial dads versus their baby boomer counterparts - and we have some big feelings about one aspect of the results.

We also got a refreshing reminder that it’s liberating to acknowledge that you don’t have to be good at everything - especially in a social media world where everyone else seems to have it all figured out.

But unlike most of our episodes with multiple guests, they aren’t looking to find titles they’ll enjoy together. Mia & Micah already read the same books frequently, so we’re looking to individualize their reading lives with totally separate recommendations.\xa0Mia is looking to introduce a little romance to her bookshelves… without leaving her comfort zone of action and adventure behind. Meanwhile Micah battles a classic middle-sibling problem... all her books end up being hand-me-downs, so she’s looking for a good mystery novel (or better yet, a series) that’s exactly suited to HER taste first and foremost.\xa0Click over to the podcast website for a list of books mentioned in this episode:\xa0http://whatshouldireadnextpodcast.com/202Get another double feature of What Should I Read Next by becoming a supporter on Patreon at patreon.com/whatshouldireadnext!

Brian is the kind of reader who wants to chew on big ideas, follow characters from childhood to old age to see what makes people tick, and who loves big juicy family sagas. But he also has a taste for the unusual, so Anne recommends 3 titles that hopefully hit more than one target.Click over to the podcast website for a list of books mentioned in this episode:\xa0http://whatshouldireadnextpodcast.com/201You can follow Brian on Twitter @beichen22, and check out his podcast Story Guys at wearethestoryguys.com/podcast or anywhere you listen to podcasts.

Simple. But long-time listeners know this show was originally supposed to be a tight 20 minutes… and today, each episode is easily twice that long. It turns out, a person’s reading taste reveals a lot about who they are as individuals, and digging into those discussions is worth much more to the WSIRN team than hitting a timestamp.Today’s guest is no stranger to seemingly-mundane belongings that hold deep meaning - Tara Anderson hosts the NPR show 5 Things, where she gets to know people by discussing five items that matter to them. A guest\'s treasured items might be books, but they might also be a houseplant, a special coat, heirloom knitting needles, even something as practical as a rice cooker. There are no home appliances in this episode, but Anne is investigating what Tara’s 3 favorite titles say about what she wants out of life, and what new books will take her there.\xa0Click over to the podcast website for a list of books mentioned in this episode:\xa0http://whatshouldireadnextpodcast.com/199Follow Tara on Instagram and Twitter, and make sure to go check out her newest project at musicboxpod.org\xa0Thanks to today\'s sponsor:Brooklinen sells luxury sheets, towels and bedding without the luxury markup—which helped make them the winner of the “Best of Online Bedding” category by Good Housekeeping.

As a result of this experience, the books she craves are different now, and every book purchase feels weighty.Anne is connecting Amelia with three books that will hopefully take some of that heaviness off her shoulders and let her choose a different world to escape into, just for a few hours.\xa0CONTENT WARNING: Amelia tells her story of surviving an enormous natural disaster in heartbreaking detail, and it might be too much for anxious or sensitive listeners.

He’s an imaginative reader who appreciates the escapist quality of a good novel, but has struggled lately to find books that call out for him to live between their pages.\xa0Fantastic escapist reading can be found in any genre, so today Anne recommends three books to Anudeep that you’d find on completely different bookstore shelves.

Every year, we gather every Captain (Manager) from every Trader Joe’s across the country together, in one place, to let them know where we’re going, say thanks for all the great things that have happened over the last year, and to give them some useful information to bring back to their stores. We’ll hear about some delicious new products (even for pets!) coming soon to a Trader Joe’s near you, and we’ll have a little fun with our Captains along the way. \xa0   Episode 17 Transcript (PDF) | In this episode, we’re digging deep into the world of Produce. Chances are, you don’t spend so much time thinking about your greens, your berries, your stone fruits, your avocados… (well, you probably do think about avocados quite a bit). The thing is, we spend loads of time thinking about all of it, so all you have to think about is what looks good when you walk into your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. We find out what it takes to ensure every one of our 488 stores gets the best produce we can find, from all around the world; we talk packaging, and steps we’re taking to reduce our produce packaging; and we’ll answer the burning question… what’s more popular, fruit or veggies?  Episode 16 Transcript (PDF) | In this episode, we’re tackling the questions YOU (our listeners) asked. From the pretty straightforward “How do you decide what to sell?” and “How do you know what your customers want?” to the more philosophical “Why don’t you have WiFi?” and “Why not sell your products online?” We collected your questions and gathered some super knowledgeable Crew Members to help us answer them. Tune in to find out, once and for all, why we don’t carry diapers, and why we do plan to keep introducing limited availability products. \xa0  Episode 15 Transcript (PDF) | We get a lot of questions here at Trader Joe\'s; perhaps surprisingly, by far the most common question has nothing to do with the things we sell or the locations of our stores. The question we get the most is, without a doubt, "Why is everyone so nice?" In this episode we take you inside Trader Joe\'s to find out the answer. Come with us to a Trader Joe\'s store in Chicago, and to a session of Trader Joe\'s University (yep, that\'s a thing). Join in on our chat with some of the people responsible for finding the great Crew Members you encounter in our stores. Discover some of our Crew\'s favorite TJ\'s products. It\'ll be nice. We promise. \xa0  Episode 14 Transcript (PDF) \xa0 | It\'s the episode where we talk about the abundant flowers and plants you\'ll find at your neighborhood Trader Joe\'s. We travel the world in search of the most beauteous blooms and festive flowers, and we bring them to you at prices that really define value. How on earth do we do it? Have a listen. Got a question you\'d really like to ask the folks who make things happen here at TJ\'s? Send it to us at podcastquestions@traderjoes.com. We\'ll use as many questions as we can in an upcoming episode of Inside Trader Joe\'s.  Episode 13 Transcript (PDF) | Come with us on a delicious journey through the freezer case at Trader Joe\'s. Hear how frozen foods can be fresher than the "fresh" foods; come along as we sample some of our Customers\' favorite frozen finds at a neighborhood Trader Joe\'s; find out about some new treats coming soon to a Trader Joe\'s near you. Along the way, we\'ll share some info about how long frozen food keeps in your freezer (a good long time, it turns out), and the very best way to prepare our much-loved Cauliflower Gnocchi. If you\'re a frozen foods fanatic, or even if you\'re more fickle about freezer fare, this episode of Inside Trader Joe\'s will leave you hungry for more. (Figuratively and literally, we hope) \xa0  Episode 12 Transcript (PDF) | Our approach to sustainability is simple. We all want to leave the planet a better place than we found it. At Trader Joe\'s, we\'re working hard to do just that, in part by reimagining how we approach packaging in our stores. We\'ve eliminated certain types of packaging, we\'re reducing other types of packaging, and we\'re taking steps to remove more than a million pounds of plastic over the next year alone! We\'re going to the store, to a recycling plant, and to a next-generation manufacturing facility dedicated to making a positive impact, one plastic bottle at a time. \xa0  Episode 11 Transcript (PDF) | At Trader Joe\'s, we are focused on growing, every day – with every product, in every store. We\'re opening new stores, hiring new Crew Members, meeting new Customers, and developing new products. Whew! In this episode, we talk about finding new store locations, we chat with customers at one of our original East Coast stores, and we look forward to some delicious new products coming to your neighborhood Trader Joe\'s in the year ahead. \xa0  Episode 10 Transcript (PDF) | When we say we travel the world in search of great products for our customers, we really mean it! In this episode, come along with us as we circumnavigate the globe, finding the WOW in locations around the world, from South Korea to Southern California, with stops in places like New Zealand, Thailand, the Republic of Georgia, Puerto Rico, and so many more! \xa0  Episode 9 Transcript (PDF) | It\'s beginning to look a lot like the holidays at Trader Joe\'s! How do we come up with all the great holiday products you\'ll find at Trader Joe\'s every year? How long does it take to make all that delicious stuff come to life? What\'s new this holiday season? And did you know Dog Advent Calendars are a thing? Come Inside Trader Joe\'s and we\'ll help you get into the holiday spirit. Ho Ho Ho ! \xa0  Episode 8 Transcript (PDF)', 'chan_desc': "From our humble beginnings as a small chain of eclectic Southern California convenience stores, Trader Joe’s has grown to become a national chain of 490 (and counting) neighborhood grocery stores, employing more than 43,000 Crew Members.

Bolstered by a new generation of growers in California and New York, plus a thirsty generation of millennials, it is the fastest growing among all alcoholic beverage categories. In this episode we meet the makers and protagonists of this emergent movement. | When we think about food origins, often we talk about the movement of people, plants, animals and ideas. But the study of humans would be an incomplete one without the study of the clay and ceramic vessels, one of humankind’s earliest innovations. If pottery is a conversation with the past, archeologists are our interpreters.Today we’re talking to a whisperer of ancient history, culinary archeologist Jerolyn Morrison. Jerolyn has a Ph.D in archeology specializing in the cooking vessels of ancient Crete.We also talk to Naoko Takei Moore about the miracle of donabe, the ceramic pot that is one of the oldest Japan.

So they followed those prophecies, and though it took a few hundred years, they made their way down the Saint Lawrence River and then into the Great Lakes region where they found wild rice. See more. | When we talk about terroir, it’s usually in the context of wine, and the human and environmental conditions that influence the characteristics. But on a recent visit to California, writer and cook Jasmine Lee began to ask questions about this framing, inspired by an heirloom variety of rice with a beautiful name called, Kokuho Rose. Jasmine, who comes from a lineage of rice merchants in Hong Kong, wondered\xa0 whether it was possible to think about expressions of the land; ie, terroir, without thinking of about the history and politics of land use in the United States. If this heirloom rice is an expression of the land it was grown on, it is also an expression of the trauma and perseverance with the family who worked that land.\xa0Next, Chef BJ Dennis tells us about his move to St. Thomas in 2004, where he encountered black folks from around the West Indies. Upon learning he was from the lowcountry, they preceded to share stories and insight about the Gullah Geechee, a distinctive culture of the\xa0 descendants of West Africa’s rice coast. The experience changed the trajectory of BJ’s career, catalyzing his calling as a chef and scholar of the culture.\xa0 | All fruit come from flowers, but not all flowers become fruit. Once you start to see the two as the same, the world of both grow more interesting. Dates, honey and saffron: we’re gettin sweet and spicy with stories from Egypt to Iran.\xa0In episode 3, we meet Leila Elamine of The Recipe Hunters, Gordon Hull of Heidrun Meadery, and spice expert Ethan Frisch of Burlap and Barrel. | In episode two of Point of Origin, we continue on our theme of preservation, and bring you on a trip to Iceland where we meet a chef turned geothermal salt maker, and a farmer there who’s making an extremely regionally specific dairy product.Thanks to our friends in Iceland, Gisli Grimmson, Bjorn Jonsson of Saltverk, and to Thorgumir Gubratsson of Erpstadir Skyr.

Later, by the eighth century, the range used in Denmark was reduced to sixteen…." — George L. Campbell & Christopher Moseley, The Routledge Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets, 2012"Conveniently, one of the Americans … is an anthropology student studying Scandinavian rituals. His in-depth questions provide context for viewers not steeped in Nordic lore, but it\'s still not always clear what he\'s talking about. For instance, looking over a rune carving …, he guesses \'Younger Futhark?\' only to be told no, \'Elder.\'" — Danielle Burgos, Bustle, 3 July 2019Did you know?The word futhark refers to a writing system used by Germanic peoples, and especially by the Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons, from about the third to the 13th centuries. Its origin is unclear, but a likely theory is that it was developed by the Goths from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy, with perhaps some aspects being influenced by the Latin alphabet of the first and second centuries. The word futhark itself comes from the sounds of the first six letters used in the earliest of the main runic script varieties: f, u, th, a, r, k. While eventually fully displaced by the Latin alphabet, futhark was still used occasionally for charms and memorial inscriptions in Scandinavia into the 16th and 17th centuries. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 3, 2019 is:pursy • \\PER-see\\\xa0 • adjective1 : having a puckered appearance2 : proud because of one\'s wealth especially in the absence of other distinctions : purse-proudExamples:"There was a picture of a pale gent with a narrow face and a woman with dark eyes and a pursy mouth." — Stephen King, Misery, 1987"Some guys get all pursy around the mouth when you suggest this, but figure skating is infinitely harder than ice hockey. Every four years at the Winter Olympics, figure skating fans have to listen to a lot of nonsense about how their sport lacks legitimacy." — Sally Jenkins, The Washington Post, 13 Feb. 2014Did you know?There are two adjectives spelled pursy, each with its own etymology. The one describing a puckered appearance goes back to the mid-16th century and has its source in the noun purse ("a receptacle for carrying money and other small objects"); a drawstring purse\'s puckered appearance is the inspiration. The other pursy (pronounced PUH-see or PER-see) dates from the 15th century and can mean "short-winded especially because of corpulence" or simply "fat." This pursy comes from the Old French word pousser, meaning "to exert pressure" or "to breathe heavily"—the same word, etymologists believe, behind the word push. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 2, 2019 is:sawbones • \\SAW-bohnz\\\xa0 • nounslang : physician, surgeonExamples:"After abandoning his destitute family in 1913, Brinkley bought a medical degree from a \'diploma mill\' in St. Louis. An itinerant preacher assured him that he did not have to be a bona fide sawbones to cure the ills of the world." — Bartee Haile, The Courier (Montgomery County, Texas), 19 Jan. 2018"Anyway, his relatives … reminded him that it\'s hard to shine shoes without a heartbeat. So he went back to his sawbones\xa0to talk about the pacemaker." — Phil Luciano, The Journal Star (Peoria, Illinois), 28 Oct. 2017Did you know?Sawbones cut its first literary tooth in Charles Dickens\'s 1837 novel The Pickwick Papers, when Sam Weller says to Mr. Pickwick, "Don\'t you know what a sawbones is, sir? … I thought everybody know\'d as a sawbones was a surgeon." An evocative term that calls to mind the saws that 19th-century surgeons used to perform amputations, sawbones quickly became an established member of the English language, employed by such authors as H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Mercifully, medical technology has improved dramatically since then (the surgical saws used in procedures today are a far cry from the primitive tools of yesteryear), but the word sawbones is still used, often in a humorous context. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 1, 2019 is:mitigate • \\MIT-uh-gayt\\\xa0 • verb1 : to cause to become less harsh or hostile : mollify2 a : to make less severe or painful : alleviateb : to lessen the seriousness of : extenuateExamples:"Although Apple Hill receives the bulk of their visitors in October, most of its ranches and wineries are open from mid-August through December.… Last year, October traffic was mitigated by a grant-funded pilot program that brought a shuttle to Apple Hill." — Dylan Svoboda, The Mountain Democrat (Placerville, California), 14 Aug. 2019"More important than treating migraines once they come on is avoiding episodes to begin with, says Diamond. That means taking steps to adjust your work routine and office environment as much as possible in order to mitigate the specific factors that prompt episodes." — Alejandro de la Garza, Time, 27 June 2019Did you know?The meaning of mitigate is straightforward enough: it is most often used to talk about making something, such as a problem, symptom, or punishment, less harsh or severe. Sometimes, however, it appears where the similar-looking militate is expected. That word, which is often followed by against, means "to have weight or effect," as in "your unexcused absences might militate against your getting a promotion." The two words are not closely related etymologically (mitigate descends from the Latin verb mitigare, meaning "to soften," whereas militate traces to militare, another Latin verb that means "to engage in warfare"), but the confusion between the two has existed for long enough that some usage commentators have accepted "mitigate against" as an idiomatic alternative to militate. If you want to avoid criticism, you should keep mitigate and militate distinct. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 30, 2019 is:buttress • \\BUTT-russ\\\xa0 • noun1 architecture : a projecting structure of masonry or wood for supporting or giving stability to a wall or building2 : something that resembles a buttress: such asa : a projecting part of a mountain or hillb biology : a horny protuberance on a horse\'s hoof at the heelc botany : the broadened base of a tree trunk or a thickened vertical part of it3 : something that supports or strengthensExamples:"The root system of one of the cedars has been hollowed out into a den, in which Neasloss finds black bear hair. One of the tree\'s buttresses has been chopped long ago by what he recognizes was a nephrite ax, the green jade axes that the coastal people used until 1846, when they adopted steel axes." — Alex Shoumatoff, Smithsonian, September 2015"The modifications to Isabella [Dam] include raising the profile of the main and auxiliary dams 16 feet, adding buttresses and other safety features, and excavating 100 feet deep to build the huge spillway." — Steven Mayer, The Bakersfield Californian, 28 July 2019Did you know?In architecture, a buttress is an exterior support that projects from a wall to resist the sideways force, called thrust, created by the load on an arch or roof. The word buttress was first adopted into English as butres in the 14th century. It came to us from the Anglo-French (arche) boteraz, meaning "thrusting (arch)," and ultimately derives from the verb buter, "to thrust." Buter is also the source of our verb butt, meaning "to thrust, push, or strike with the head or horns." Buttress developed figurative use relatively soon after its adoption, being applied to anything that supports or strengthens something else. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 29, 2019 is:Elysian • \\ih-LIZH-un\\\xa0 • adjective1 : of or relating to Elysium2 : blissful, delightfulExamples:"On such a balmy summer day, on this Elysian isle, anything seemed possible." — Dorothy West, The Wedding, 1995"No matter what one\'s childhood is, a seeming Elysian remembrance or a parental vendetta, the understanding of the afflatus of a poet lies elsewhere." — Edward Dahlberg, "Hart Crane" (1966), reprinted in The Company They Kept (2006)Did you know?In classical mythology, Elysium, also known as the Elysian Fields, was the paradise reserved for the heroes immortalized by the gods. Ancient Greek poets imagined it as the abode of the blessed after death, but in English the concept has more often been applied figuratively. In his history play Henry V, William Shakespeare used the place-name as a word for a peaceful state of sleep enjoyed by a mere mortal, and 18th-century English lexicographer and author Samuel Johnson wrote in The Rambler that in reading pastoral poetry we allow ourselves "to be transported to elysian regions, where we are met with nothing but joy, and plenty, and contentment…" In Walden a century later Henry David Thoreau wrote that "The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life." | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 28, 2019 is:hegemony • \\hih-JEM-uh-nee\\\xa0 • noun1 : preponderant influence or authority over others : domination2 : the social, cultural, ideological, or economic influence exerted by a dominant groupExamples:"According to Chinese analysts\' telling of World War II, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of China proper in 1937 were part of the U.S. strategy to pit the two Asian nations against each other in an endless war that would prevent either from rising to threaten American hegemony in the western Pacific." — Michael Pillsbury, The Hundred-Year Marathon, 2015"The sweeping restrictions come as New York and other cities fundamentally rethink the role of cars in the face of unrelenting traffic that is choking their streets, poisoning the environment and crippling public transit systems by trapping buses and light rail systems in gridlock. It is becoming a moment of reckoning—and, cars, which once had absolute hegemony over the streets, are losing." – Winnie Hu, The New York Times, 8 Aug. 2019Did you know?Hegemony comes to English from the Greek hēgemonia, a noun formed from the verb hēgeisthai ("to lead"), which also gave us the word exegesis (meaning "exposition" or "explanation"). Hegemony was first used in English in the mid-16th century in reference to the control once wielded by the ancient Greek states, and it was reapplied in later centuries as other nations subsequently rose to power. By the 19th century, it had acquired a second sense referring to the social or cultural influence wielded by a dominant member over others of its kind, such as the domination within an industry by a business conglomerate over smaller businesses. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 27, 2019 is:cleave • \\KLEEV\\\xa0 • verb1 : to divide (something) by or as if by a cutting blow : split2 : to separate (something) into distinct parts and especially into groups having divergent views3 : to subject to chemical cleavage4 : to split especially along the grain5 : to penetrate or pass through something by or as if by cuttingExamples:"The surface you\'re cutting against will have a greater impact on your knife\'s edge than the food you\'re chopping up, assuming you aren\'t regularly cleaving through massive bones." — Paul Stephen, The San Antonio Express News, 10 July 2019"Of course, single-item restaurants are nothing new.... But they don\'t usually serve something so divisive as polenta. You see, the slow-cooked dish of maize\xa0cleaves\xa0opinion like a Justin Bieber concert. You either love it or loathe it—and ever has it been so." — Samuel Muston, The Independent (London), 30 Jan. 2014Did you know?Cleave has two homographs, each with a distinct origin. There is cleave meaning "to adhere firmly and closely or loyally and unwaveringly," as in "a family that cleaves to tradition"; that one is from Old English clifian, meaning "to adhere." And there is the cleave with meanings relating to splitting and dividing, which derives from Old English clēofan, meaning "to split." The two have slightly different inflections. The "split" cleave usually has cleaved as its past tense form, but cleft and clove are both in use as well; as its past participle form (the form that often occurs with have), cleaved is most common, but cleft and cloven are also used. The "adhere" cleave commonly has cleaved or clove (and occasionally clave) as its past tense and cleaved as its past participle. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 26, 2019 is:frowsy • \\FROW-zee\\\xa0 • adjective1 : musty, stale2 : having a slovenly or uncared-for appearanceExamples:The lamp, discovered in a frowsy Midwestern antique store, turned out to be quite valuable."On good days, I could also manage super boring reality TV shows, like \'Escape to the Country,\' in which retired British couples go on slow searches for frowsy new homes in sleepy towns, and nobody gets excited about anything." — Yvonne Abraham, The Boston Globe, 24 Nov. 2018Did you know?The exact origins of frowsy are perhaps lost in an old, frowsy book somewhere, but some etymologists have speculated that frowsy (also spelled frowzy) shares a common ancestor with the younger, chiefly British, word frowsty, a synonym of frowsy in both its senses. That ancestor could be the Old French word frouste, meaning "ruinous" or "decayed," or the now-obsolete English word frough or frow, meaning "brittle" or "fragile." An early print example of frowsy can be found in Thomas Otway\'s 1681 comedy The Souldier\'s Fortune, wherein the character Beau refers to another character as "a frouzy Fellmonger." | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 25, 2019 is:lèse-majesté • \\layz-MAJ-uh-stee\\\xa0 • noun1 a : a crime (such as treason) committed against a sovereign powerb : an offense violating the dignity of a ruler as the representative of a sovereign power2 : a detraction from or affront to dignity or importanceExamples:"David\'s grandfather, President Eisenhower, had left David all his clothes in his will, and David felt obliged to wear them…. Naturally, it would be something along the lines of lèse-majesté for him to remove the presidential jacket and vest and sit\xa0in his shirtsleeves, so he gamely continued to sweat in the sweltering heat, out of respect for Ike." — Michael Korda, Another Life, 2000"Thai law makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten \'the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent.\' … Though other countries still have similar laws—both Spain and the Netherlands have lèse-majesté laws on the books—Thailand\'s enforcement of its laws may make them the strictest in the world." — Adam Taylor, The Washington Post, 8 Feb. 2019Did you know?Lèse-majesté (or lese majesty, as it is also styled in English publications) comes into English by way of Middle French, from the Latin laesa majestas, which literally means "injured majesty." The English term can conceivably cover any offense against a sovereign power or its ruler, from treason to a simple breach of etiquette. Lèse-majesté has also acquired a more lighthearted or ironic meaning, referring to an insult or impudence to a particularly pompous or self-important person or organization. As such, it may be applied to a relatively inoffensive act that has been exaggeratedly treated as if it were a great affront.', 'chan_desc': "Build your vocabulary with Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day!

You\'re always an actor. I sleep as an actor. I wake up as an actor.... I always think about art and creativity, and that\'s all I want to do.” -Omid Memar This week’s guest is Omid Memar. He’s a fantastic actor who I recently was able to work with for an upcoming movie called 7500 (we actually recorded this episode at the movie’s premiere in Switzerland). Omid’s acting is incredibly honest and real and heartbreaking and human. He also comes from a very culturally-rich background— he’s from an Iranian family, grew up in Austria, moved to Munich, and graduated from a French school. He’s a young guy that’s really just getting started in his career, so I thought he would be perfect to answer this week’s question from Megan Colbert in Springfield, New York.\xa0 Megan asked, “How do you balance the inner need to create with the practical need to bring in a paycheck?” Omid and I talk about what it’s like to be up-and-coming in the industry, and how the artistry and creativity in acting is often overshadowed by the idea of ‘celebrity’. We also talk about the influence of cultural identity when selecting roles, the creative impact that music has had on each of us, and we top it all off with a touching conversation about our grandmothers.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.  ------ \xa0ABOUT THE GUESTS: Omid Memar is a twenty-year old Iranian actor, who grew up in Vienna before moving to Munich with his family in 2008 where Omid graduated in a French school with a dual-degree in German and French. Omid landed his first acting role at 14 in the German film The Famous Five 4, based on the book series by Enid Blyton. Omid also starred in the Austrian TV Mini-Series M - A City Hunts a Murderer, and the short film Invention of Trust where he was honored with Gold in the Student Academy Awards in 2016.

Liv is one of the most successful professional poker players of all time (she is the only woman in history to win both the World Series of Poker and European Poker Tour Championships). On top of all that, she also just happens to have a degree in astrophysics. She’s an all around fantastic person to have a conversation with, and was particularly great at answering this week’s question from Kent Wilson from Nashville, Tennessee. Kent asked, “When does data-backed decision making begin to have a negative impact on the creative process?” Liv and I get into a great discussion on what constitutes analytical thinking, what the difference is between science and art, and how to listen to your intuition and balance that with data, and logic with reason. So much of creativity nowadays is further and further integrated with data and analytics, and Liv has some great insight on when data is valuable and when you should just go with your gut.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

Before poker she studied Astrophysics, she now focuses her time as a TV host and YouTuber specialising in science, futurism and rationality. She also gives seminars on decision strategy and recently spoke at the annual TED conference about the application of poker thinking to everyday life. In 2014 she co-founded Raising for Effective Giving (REG), a non-profit that promotes a scientific, evidence-based approach to philanthropy known as effective altruism. To date, REG has raised over $11,000,000 for a handful of the most globally impactful and cost-effective charities.\xa0------ SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Liv:- Twitter: @Liv_Boeree- Instagram: @Liv_Boeree- YouTube Channel - LivBoeree.com- Raise for Effective GivingTheories Mentioned:- Game Theory- Scientific Method- Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs- Nash EquilibriumMovies Mentioned:- A Beautiful Mind (2001) People Mentioned:- Donald Hoffman (Psychologist / Author) - Shepard Fairey (Artist / Propagandist) - John Nash (Mathematician) Other Mentions: - Effective Altruism\xa0- Brexit- Burning Man- World Series of Poker- European Poker Tour Champions | “There’s times before my mom and I are about to go onstage to play together, and maybe we just argued right before going on. But there’s something about that moment... where I give her a kiss on the cheek and say, ‘Hey, this started with you and me. Let’s go out there and do this.’” -Madisen Ward My guests this week are Madisen and Ruth Ward, who together are known as the mother-and-son folk band Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear. They’ve appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, NPR’s Tiny Desk Series, and recently released a brand new album called Started With A Family (if you haven’t heard their music yet, I highly suggest you take a listen).\xa0 For this episode, Madisen, Ruth and I tackled a question from Paige Elson from Stockton, California. Paige asked, “What are the benefits and setbacks of working creatively with family?” I’ve always been curious to know how family fits into creativity. Where does creativity come from? Do you get it from your parent’s genes or from the upbringing they provided? Madisen and Ruth brought such an interesting perspective to this question. We talked about how Ruth’s career transformed after she became a mom, how writing and performing music is different when collaborating with family members, what role music played in the Ward household, and we topped it all off with a question about a crab’s perspective.

New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019. ------ABOUT THE GUESTS: Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear consists of Madisen Ward and Ruth Ward. They are a modern soulful/folk music duo from Independence, Mo. The band\'s debut album Skeleton Crew, produced by Jim Abbiss, known for his award-winning work with Arctic Monkeys and Adele, captures Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear in their most natural setting. The two tracked most of the tracks live, sitting across from one another in the recording studio. They didn\'t use a click track. With help from a handful of session musicians, the two Wards captured the sound they\'d been making since those coffeeshop days.\xa0 ------\xa0 SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Madisen and Ruth:-Twitter: @MadisenWardMB-Instagram: @MadisenWardMB-Facebook: Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear-YouTube Channel (One For the Record Series)-MadisenWardandtheMamaBear.comMadisen Ward and the Mama Bear Music Mentioned:-Started With A Family (2019)-Skeleton Crew (2015)-"Dead Daffodils"-"Undertaker and Juniper"MadisenMusic Music Mentioned: -“Skip and the Turtle”-“Weep for the King”-“Big Bad Wolfblood” Other Music Mentioned:-Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards by Tom Waits-“Old Man” by Neil Young-“Clown’s Lament”by @Metaphorest on HITRECORD-Pink Moon by Nick DrakePeople Mentioned:-Isiah Whitlock Jr. (Actor and Ruth’s Brother)-Tom Waits (Singer-Songwriter)-Tracy Chapman (Singer-Songwriter)-Mark Knopfler (Singer-Songwriter)-Bob Dylan (Singer-Songwriter)-The Osmonds (Family Music Group)-Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Composer)-The White Stripes (Musical Group)-Wu-Tang Clan (Hip Hop Group) TV Shows Mentioned:-The Wire (2002-2008)-MacGyver (1985-1992) | For this episode, I’m going to do something a little different. I recently did a TED Talk, and there was something really distinct and special about it. I’m pretty used to performing on stage in front of people as a character or for a show, but it felt different to be on stage delivering in-depth thoughts of my own about an idea that’s important to me.I’m putting this TED Talk on my podcast because it’s about how the creative process can be affected by the attention-driven model of big tech companies, and how you can feel a difference when you try to pay attention vs. get attention.We’ll be back next week with more episodes of CREATIVE PROCESSING. I hope you enjoy. For more TED Talks, subscribe to the podcast TED Talks Daily, where they post a new idea every day. It’s available anywhere you listen to podcasts. Thanks! | “At the end of the day, I’d rather make stuff period than make stuff how I want to make stuff. And specific to us, I’d rather make stuff together even than stuff alone.” -Evan GoldbergMy guests this week are the comedy duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. You\'ve probably heard of their movies Pineapple Express, This Is The End, Neighbors, Superbad, Sausage Party, and most recently Good Boys. They’ve also ventured into the entrepreneurial space with their own cannabis brand, Houseplant. I’ve known these guys are a while, and have had the pleasure of working with them on 50/50 and The Night Before. Seth and Evan are unique in that they do a vast majority of their creative work as a duo. Because of this, I thought they would make the perfect pair for this week’s question.For this episode, Seth, Evan and I discussed a question from Pretince Martin Southwell from Springfield Illinois. Pretince asked, “Have you had people you didn’t get along with personally turn out to be good to work with professionally, or vice versa?” We talked about the origin story of how Seth and Evan’s working relationship began, how their dynamic changes when they work with or involve other people, how they navigate disagreements, and we even debated the existence of extraterrestrial life.If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

It\'s about a pipe between me and others...I have all these thoughts and I want to express them all, but people are not always ready to receive them. Then when you get together and express something...sometimes I can find a pipe where we can connect.” -Yuka HondaMy guest this week is Yuka Honda- a musician, composer, producer and all around fantastic artist. She’s one half of the duo Cibo Matto, and has worked with a range of musicians: from well-known artists such as the Beastie Boys, Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon, to lesser-known but no-less-incredible artists such as Petra Haden, Mike Watt, and Medeski Martin & Wood. Her latest work is a multi-media operatic theatre piece called No Revenge Necessary. She’s done so many great things over the years, and is a dear friend whom I was excited to sit down and have a conversation with.\xa0 For this episode, Yuka and I explored a question from Melissa Hui from San Francisco, CA. Melissa asked, “How much of creative expression is for ourselves vs. others?” We talked about how ideas, images, and feelings take the shape of clouds inside of our heads. When collaborating, Yuka looks to create a pipe connecting her ideas (or the clouds in her head) to the clouds in other people’s heads. And to wrap off our incredibly uplifting/poetic conversation, we answered a question about what we would do in the face of death.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

It’s just whether you try to hide that fact or whether you’re honest about it.”-Shepard FaireyMy guest this week is Shepard Fairey- he is an artist and a self-titled propagandist who is perhaps most known for his HOPE Obama Poster or for his Andre the Giant Has A Posse OBEY Campaign. If you’ve lived near any American metropolis, you’ve probably seen his work stenciled onto the sides of various buildings or as a sticker slapped on the back of a fire hydrant. Recently, his series We The People featured Latinas, Native Americans, Muslims and African Americans, and could be seen at nearly every protest and rally in the country. Shepard’s also quite the philanthropist - he and his wife Amanda started a campaign called Make America Smart Again, which called for Americans be more informed, involved, and engage in healthy dialogues with one another.For this episode, we analyzed a question from Shishuraj Karmalkar from Mumbai, India. Shishuraj asked, “How do you wrestle with the statement that artists are \'selfish\' since they\'re off worrying about their art, and not devoting more energy to political rebellion in troubled times?” Shepard and I discussed how art can transform from something selfish to selfless, the intended (and unintended) message art can convey, and if you can ever truly divorce art from politics. He also answered an off-topic question about God with a reference to the movie Dodgeball, so that was pretty cool.If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.ABOUT THE GUEST:In 1989, while at Rhode Island School of Design studying for his Bachelor of Fine Art in Illustration (which he earned in 1992), Shepard Fairey created the “Andre the Giant has a Posse” sticker that later evolved into the OBEY GIANT art campaign. In 2008, his portrait of then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama became an internationally recognized emblem of hope. Since then, Fairey has painted nearly 100 public murals, become one of the most sought-after and provocative artists in the world, and changed the way people converse about art and view the urban landscape.SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE:Connect with Shepard Fairey:Twitter: @ObeyGiantInstagram: @ObeyGiantObeyGiant.comObeyClothing.comShepard FaireyArt Mentioned:Barack Obama ‘Hope’ Poster‘Andre the Giant Has a Posse’ CampaignWe the People’ SeriesBowery MuralGod Saves and Satan InvestsMovies/TV Shows Mentioned:Triumph of the Will (1935) *WARNING - literally Nazi Propaganda*They Live (1988)The Loudest Voice (TV Series, Showtime)Dodgeball (2004)People Mentioned:Bob Marley (Singer-Songwriter)Bob Dylan\xa0 (Singer-Songwriter)Joe Strummer (Musician)Dead Kennedys (Band)The Rolling Stones (Band)Chuck D (Rapper)Barack Obama (Politician)George W.

My guest is THE Rian Johnson- he is a writer, director, filmmaker extraordinaire. I was in his very first movie, Brick. He then went on to make The Brothers Bloom, Looper, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He’s an extraordinary thinker, conversationalist, artist, and human being. For this episode, we took a deep dive into a question from Alexandra Kolmanofsky from Louisville, Kentucky. She asked, “How do you get inspired by other people’s creations and create something unique that is completely your own without taking too much from the inspiration?” Rian offered some incredible insight on what distinguishes inspiration from imitation, what are the limitations and advantages of dealing with genre, and if any piece of art can ever be considered “original.” We also seriously pondered whether cereal is, in fact, soup (or not).\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, share it on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) using the hashtag #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org.

I know, I know, we don't like change, but sometimes IT'S GOOD FOR US. It's especially good for us when it comes in the form of Alain de Botton, one of the most intelligent, eloquent and thoughtful people on the planet.And because it's Alain de Botton, modern philosopher, founder of The School of Life and bestselling authors of life-changing books such as Essays In Love, I decided to allow him a little leeway. Instead of choosing personal failures, Alain wanted to talk about three philosophical 'failure concepts' and I'm so glad he did, because it led to one of the most fascinating and enlightening discussions I've ever had on the topic.We discuss the idea that we can be good people and yet fail, and the concept (which I'm forever banging on about) that failure is the norm, and that we should find contentment in the average rather than constantly expecting the exceptional. He also has brilliant insights into why romantic break-ups are not, in and of themselves, tragic, because each relationship teaches you something you need to know, and when the time is right, it is ok to move on. Along the way, I also ask him about X Factor, so fear not, I'm there to pepper his brilliance with my usual lowbrow content, as per.It was such a delight to meet Alain.

Did you miss us? Go on...say you did. I'm really very, very needy.It's such a treat for me to be opening season six with a truly fantastic guest: Camilla Thurlow. Camilla was always one of the most genuine and impressive contestants on ITV2's hit reality show, Love Island. A former bomb disposal expert who worked in life and death situations in Cambodia and Afghanistan, she came second in the 2017 series. Instead of launching a clothing line or advertising detox tummy teas, Camilla went on to use her new-found public platform to talk about issues close to her heart: namely, the immigration crisis and mental health. Her first trip after Love Island was to a refugee camp with the contestant she coupled up with, Jamie Jewitt (oh, and by the way, they are still together).Set aside any preconceptions you might have about reality TV and listen to the wisdom this extraordinary woman imparts about love, loss and human connection. We talk about her periods of extreme anxiety and panic as she was forced to confront who she really was rather than the Camilla she was trying to be. We talk about the challenges of public expectation and the fear of not living up to other people's idea of her. We talk about social media, turning 30 and her ingrained fear of making a fool of herself. We also talk about a near-fatal car accident and the unexpected lessons it taught her.I am so grateful to Camilla for opening up to me and for showing that strength comes through an acknowledgement of - and respect for - vulnerability. I know that you will find so much to relate to in what she says.Thank you for listening.

The end of another season. Where does the time go?I saved this guest for the finale because she's bloody spectacular. Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, a campaigner on women's rights, an outspoken critic of Brexit, anti-semitism and the politics of the hard-left, and the author of an acclaimed book, Everywoman: One Woman's Truth About Speaking The Truth.She joins me to talk about coping with failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends. She talks about the failure in contraception (!) that resulted in her eldest son, her failure to get on the Home Office Fast Track scheme and, in an extremely moving admission, her self-perceived failure to fix her brother's drug addiction.This makes it sound pretty heavy, but Jess is so naturally funny and such a self-deprecating force of nature, that I promise you this interview will leave you feeling energised and quite possibly punching the air.That's it for season five (apart from one bonus live record COMING SOON. Make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss out). I'll be back in the autumn with eight brilliant new guests.*A THANK YOU FROM ME:Thank you so much for subscribing and rating and reviewing and for all your lovely messages over this season and all the others. It really does mean the world to me. Truly. And if you don't like me / this podcast / actually took time out of your day to leave a one-star review / worry that my guests all went to Oxbridge (they didn't) / are too middle-class (they aren't) / think I'm too gushing (well...ok, maybe you have a point there, but I genuinely mean it when I say someone's amazing...) then please know that however angry or sad or lonely or un-heard you feel, I send you nothing but love in return. Bet that winds you up, doesn't it?To the rest of you: I feel so blessed for your companionship on this crazy, beautiful journey. You have helped me make sense of things. You have met me in a place of vulnerability and made me feel so much stronger. You have shown me that love, compassion and kindness is strength. You have taught me what I always suspected: that failure does not have to be an end point, but can instead be a stepping stone on a journey towards greater understanding.

Meera first\xa0came to prominence when she co-wrote and starred in the award-winning BBC comedy series Goodness Gracious Me and was Bafta-nominated for her later role in The Kumars at Number 42. She, along with her husband Sanjeev Bhaskar, almost single-handedly reinvented British-Asian comedy, taking it from the stereotypical and lazy racist tropes of old and bringing it brilliantly into the mainstream (I mean, who can forget the hilarious 'Going for an English' sketch? If you haven't seen it, YouTube it now).Meera joins me to talk about failing at maths (and having a bigoted teacher), failing to live up to her parents' expectations of her, failing at auditions (and hating them), failing to raise her second child how she wanted and instead getting obsessed with a rigid regime rather than following her own maternal instincts. Along the way, we discuss ageing, race, school, womanhood, ice-cream vans and embarrassing smear tests.

With her four-part Netflix show, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat where she travels the world eating freshly baked focaccia and Japanese seaweed? Or with the award-winning, bestselling cookbook of the same name, that revolutionised the way we thought about food?I don't know where to start. So let me just tell you that she is one of the bubbliest, most open and generous interviewees I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She joins me to talks about growing up in San Diego, the child of Iranian parents, who was 'the only brown kid' in her school, and what this sense of outsidership taught her. She talks about overnight fame, and the weirdness that comes with that, as well as failing to write, what happens when your business fails and the one memorable time she burned the sauce for a dinner she was cooking for Hillary Clinton.

And not just any Olympic athlete, but double-gold medal winner, Kelly Holmes, who also just so happens to be my first DAME on How To Fail too.Dame Kelly joins me to talk about how her single mother was pressurised to give Kelly up for adoption as a baby and how she refused to do so, teaching her daughter about what it is to be truly strong. We also discuss Kelly's 'failure' at school and how she joined the army at 16 but then failed her first Physical Training Instructor selection (I mean, who would fail Kelly Holmes? Come on, now. Have you seen the size of her biceps?) She also talks openly about coming second in the 1995 World Championships because of her spiralling anxiety and discusses her ongoing mental health issues, including her diagnosis with clinical depression, her grief over her mother's death and [TW] her experiences of self-harm.For me, Dame Kelly epitomises the kind of empowerment that comes from being open about your own vulnerabilities. Her strength is forged through her resilience. As she puts it: 'You train for the outcome.' I know I use the word a lot in the context of this podcast, but Dame Kelly truly is inspiring in the most profound ways.[Trigger warning: this episode contains descriptions of self-harm]*\xa0I am thrilled to be taking How To Fail on tour around the UK in October, sharing my failure manifesto with the help of some very special guests.

Her first failure is, in Segal's own words, her failure 'to stay pregnant' and the feeling of shame that came from not having managed to provide the requisite 40-week gestation period. 'I felt I had failed at my first ever task of motherhood,' she explains. 'That my body could not be a safe space for them felt a spectacular failure.'She and her husband, Gabriel, were pitched into a nightmarish situation where they did not know whether their baby girls would survive. When they were born they weighed only 2lbs each. The girls could not do anything on their own and they suffered harrowing, life-threatening infections. Segal joins me to discuss what happened next.Even if you are not one of the 100,000 women in the UK who, every year, give birth to premature babies and even if, like me, you are not a parent at all, I promise that you will find Segal's insightful eloquence both enlightening and moving.We also talk about her failure to be a rebellious teenager, her conflicted attitude to social media and how, as a writer, she deals with the eternal nagging of her fractious internal critic.

Emeli has sold over 19 million singles, won four Brit Awards and is about to return after a three-year break with her hotly anticipated third album, Real Life. Her rise to fame was rapid and overwhelming. Celebrity, she says, took some time to get used to.She joins me to talk about her body image and the long journey to self-acceptance in an industry that frequently made her feel like she was never 'enough'. She talks about letting go of the need to be perfect, and embracing failure. Plus we discuss her visit to\xa0Zambia to reconnect with her family there, and what impact that had on her. Emeli also opens up for the first time about the breakdown of her marriage, to a man she had been with from the age of 17, and the feeling of shame she had about admitting she was getting divorced before being forced to confront herself as she really was.Emeli speaks as powerfully as she sings: like an old soul channeling all sorts of wisdom.

That's right. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is back.One year on from her debut appearance on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, my first ever guest returns to talk about the craziness of her last 12 months, during which she has written and starred in Fleabag 2 (described as a televisual masterpiece by...well...almost everyone), made Killing Eve (described as a televisual masterpiece by...well...almost everyone) and been brought in by the James Bond producers to work her magic on the franchise.It's a year that, from the outside, has seemed to many of us to be the epitome of success. But what failures lie underneath the surface? What about those private moments of vulnerability and self-doubt we are so rarely privy to?Phoebe joins me to talk about three failures from the past year, including her failure to connect with her family, her failure to speak up for herself and her failure to Marie Kondo her bedroom. Along the way, we discuss what makes the perfect water bottle, filming THAT final scene in Fleabag (apparently the foxes were total divas), sexuality, exhaustion and why female creators are often unfairly assumed to be writing autobiography. And yes, the Meryl Streep apple crumble anecdote makes an appearance.Thank you, Phoebe, for coming back onto the podcast and being such a generous and wonderful friend.If you haven't already listened to her first episode, you can do so here\xa0***SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT KLAXON***I am thrilled to be taking How To Fail on tour around the UK in October, sharing my failure manifesto with the help of some very special guests.

So he made it. Over a decade\xa0later that remains one of his motivations. Sometimes ideas demand\xa0expression, putting characters – all shades of the writer, in the\xa0final analysis – into challenges and perils, or perpetrating the acts of\xa0monsters, human or otherwise.Moore believes that writing – and reading – frees us of the\xa0constraints of the civilized, moralized world. Our imaginations are\xa0unfettered. He can reach through this screen and take you, dear reader,\xa0right now. Don’t think he’s not thinking about it. Right now. There’s\xa0nothing you can do about it except close the page – or open your eyes\xa0and surrender. \xa0And if you’re still reading, knowing the utterly\xa0obscene and awful things he’s thinking of doing to you this very moment,\xa0well, that’ll be your secret, won’t it?Raziel can be found at\xa0https://eroticwriter.wordpress.com/monocles-stories/Also~Today\'s show features a poem that asks the big question... what do you like? and a very sexy story about two people coming\xa0together in such an honest and very intimate way, because they understand just how precious life really is.What Do You like is Written and performed by Fox Smoulder and is but a taste from their album, “Incorrigible & Intimate”Fox can be found at\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0YouTube.For more Sexy Stories from Rose Caraway go to\xa0http://j.mp/carawayaudiobooksContact RosePhone- (202) 810-5477Web-\xa0thekissmequicks.comEmail-\xa0thekissmequicks@gmail.comFacecbook-\xa0https://www.facebook.com/rose.caraway.7Twitter-\xa0@RoseCaraway\xa0For More Aural Pleasure\xa0Go To- \xa0http://j.mp/carawayaudiobooks', 'chan_desc': 'Sexy Stories with Rose Caraway and her friends will arouse your senses and inflame your imagination with delicious tales of love, lust, loss, romance, suspense, erotic horror, and adventure!

Beth’s perfectionist nature and her professional approach to the craft resulted in a driving ambition that got her into UCLA’s acting program and eventually led to her first role on network television as the co-star of the CBS sitcom\xa02 Broke Girls.Success wasn\'t the answer to everything though, and it brought its own set of challenges, like navigating the gauntlet that is being an actress in Hollywood. As Beth says, “We’re told so many different things in the media about how we’re supposed to be and act. When\xa02 Broke Girls\xa0began, I went from having no money and working as a nanny to being on a hit television show. At some point, the schedule, the pressure, and the anxiety from all of that started to break down my body.” In order to be the best actress she could be, she had to learn how to manage stress and take care of herself.Beth soon discovered the therapeutic power of meditation, nature, and horses. She got back in touch with her inner “theater kid in pajama pants”—the person she used to be before the overwhelming social pressures of Hollywood, and with her newfound wisdom, Beth wrote a book about self-care called\xa0The Total Me-Tox. She’s the first to admit that she still has plenty of work to do, so now, in addition to acting, she’s found a new calling. “I want to empower people to be who they are and be okay with that.”Beth joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the C that derailed her acting degree, why she’s more comfortable in a character’s skin than her own, and\xa0the audition where she was told to “cry prettier." | Zach Galifianakis had his big moment of success a bit later than most. Zach was a stand-up comedian with a small but loyal following, but when the massive hit comedy\xa0The Hangover\xa0came out, his life drastically changed. At 40 years old, Zach was unaccustomed to throngs of fans and perplexed by the attention brought by fame. As he says, “No one wanted to hear me speak or ask my opinion until I got into the movies. That doesn’t make any sense.”Zach’s down to earth approach to life likely originated with his family—a naturally funny and supportive crowd who encouraged Zach to follow his dreams of performing at an early age. After school, he moved to New York City to find an acting coach who could take him under their wing and provide an entrance into the business. Success wasn’t imminent though. As Zach says, “I worked for an uncle who managed a restaurant called Tequila Willie’s, where I had to wear a sombrero and pick up my tips off the kitchen room floor. Have you ever been on the kitchen floor on your hands and knees picking up quarters with a sombrero on? It’s very uplifting. Especially, when you’re still a busboy at 28.” Zach never found his long sought after acting coach but instead discovered stand up in the back of a burger restaurant, and never looked back.Even with his roles in big budget films, Zach continues to take on interesting, outside the box projects—whether it’s being a fake talk show host in the Netflix movie adaptation of\xa0Between Two Ferns\xa0or doing impromptu stand-up at a steakhouse in Pasadena. Over the course of our conversation, you’ll realize Zach’s honesty and modesty is as endearing as it is hilarious, as awkward as it is intimate.Zach joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about his favorite\xa0Between Two Ferns\xa0moment, his mission to take the piss out of “celebrity,” and why you should dress up as a witch and go find him on the streets of Venice if you want to have a nice ten-minute conversation. | Writer, director, comedian and podcast host Scott Aukerman is a very busy man. He is perhaps best known for his hit podcast Comedy Bang! Bang!\xa0which has been introducing audiences to the most talented comedians and improv artists for the last ten years. And that’s just Scott’s “side gig.” He’s written for movies and television shows, like\xa0Mr. Show, and more recently,\xa0Between Two Ferns, a wonderfully awkward talk show hosted by Zach Galifianakis which is now a full length Netflix movie. Even with all of his success, Scott still marvels at the fact that he gets to be silly and make other people laugh for a living. He wonders, “At what point will people figure out it’s all a scam?”He grew up with comedy in his bones and an affinity for David Letterman. In high school, he hosted a Letterman-inspired news show on his town’s public access channel. And in college he frequently turned serious, academic assignments into sketches, including a particularly memorable ballet performance which got him into trouble with his teachers. As Scott says, “I heard my whole life that I didn’t take things seriously enough, and I finally realized I should go into comedy.”Scott joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about Bob Odenkirk’s role in jump starting his career, his\xa0Between Two Ferns\xa0guest pitch/disclaimer, and how on the Between Two Ferns film, he was almost too afraid to talk to, let alone direct, David Letterman. | If you haven’t seen Andrea Savage’s comedy series\xa0I’m Sorry, you should…just be prepared to laugh your butt off. As the creator, writer, and star of the series, Andrea does it all—which makes sense since the show is based on her own experiences being a comedian, wife and mom. But it is also a show about us. Andrea has found the universal truths of being a parent while being a working artist, and her observational powers reveal the absurdity and pathos in our own lives.For years, Andrea was stuck in development hell. She had a stable acting career with roles in\xa0Step Brothers,\xa0Episodes, and\xa0Veep,\xa0but true to her improv and Groundlings background, Andrea wanted to write and create as well. She was pumping out pilot scripts and selling them, but they weren’t getting made. As she says, “It was heartbreak after heartbreak of putting your all into a project, getting good notes, and then nothing. It was always the bridesmaid, never the bride.” When Andrea turned 40, the self-described “successful failure” decided to change her approach with\xa0I’m Sorry. She put together a crew with some help from her talented friends Judy Greer and Jason Mantzoukas, and she filmed her own pilot presentation.Andrea figured out that she needed to show her vision, because her story was nuanced and personal, not full of big jokes that jumped off the page. The approach worked like gangbusters. Her presentation became the first episode of the show and established her as a creator, showrunner, director, and a force to be reckoned with. As she says, “I literally just willed it to happen.”Andrea joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about why her writer’s room is better than therapy, why her lack of darkness makes her question her comedy bonafides, and her dedication to being a “joke shepherd.” | Before she became a household name from her work in projects like\xa0Fresh Off the Boat\xa0and\xa0Crazy Rich Asians, Constance Wu was a full-time waitress in credit card debt who was trying to break into the TV and film industry.Despite her BFA in acting, Constance struggled to get steady acting work for nearly a decade. Her love of the craft never wavered—no matter how tough it was to deal with the rejection. But times got so tough she finally had to ask herself, “Are you okay if you’re still waiting tables at 50 in order to supplement your income so you can do one or two plays a year?” Wholeheartedly, her answer was, “Yes.”Finally, when the creditors were stalking her, she got her big break. In 2015, she was cast opposite Randall Park in the groundbreaking and popular ABC sitcom\xa0Fresh Off the Boat, a hilarious look at life as an Asian immigrant in America. Another historic role followed with the film\xa0Crazy Rich Asians, which featured an entirely Asian cast. Most recently, she’s acting opposite J-Lo in the film\xa0Hustlers, a true story about a group of strip club employees who drugged and robbed their rich Wall Street clientele.Constance joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about how privileged she feels to have a voice in the discussion about racial diversity in Hollywood, why she still loves going to acting class, and she also reveals the joys of sucking at guitar. | Wyatt Russell was born into the film business as the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, which can be a difficult way to grow up. But despite their massive success, Wyatt’s parents were a grounding presence who emphasized\xa0hard work. “They did a really good job of making us understand that what you get is\xa0earned, not given, and that there’s reward in earning it,” Wyatt told me. In light of that lesson and after an eye-opening trip to a hockey rink, Wyatt decided to deviate from the family way and forge his own path—he was going to be a professional hockey player.As Wyatt grew up, his NHL dream seemed more and more like a distinct possibility. He was a talented goalie, and his parents moved to Vancouver so Wyatt could compete with Canada’s best. Unfortunately, being born into a famous family brings its own unique challenges. “People were like, ‘Here comes this circus act from California. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn’s kid wants to be a hockey player in British Columbia.’ I had to prove myself by putting my head down, not talking, and doing the work to become the best goalie in the league.” His promising hockey career lasted into his early 20s, but a spate of injuries led to the end of his dream and the end of his identity as a hockey player. Sitting on a hospital bed after a particularly brutal hip injury, Wyatt asked himself: ““What do I do now? I have no idea what I am.”Wyatt reflected on his love of film, and despite the perilous nature of the business, he decided to pursue an acting career. But in typical headstrong fashion, he wasn’t going to ask his parents or siblings for advice. He was going to do it his own way. After getting work in a number of films such as\xa0Cowboys & Aliens,\xa0We Are What We Are,\xa0Folk Hero & Funny Guy, and more, Wyatt discovered that he not only has the chops for the business, but that he actually loves it. Wyatt’s recently made the transition to television. He’s the lead in AMC’s\xa0Lodge 49, a weird and whimsical show about an ex-surfer named Dud, who finds himself on a vision quest after the death of his father.Wyatt joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the uncomfortable reality of fame, the mentor who helped him discover his independence, and why the locker room is the best place to learn about male vulnerability. | Off Camera\xa0is back after a short summer break with all new episodes, and we’re kicking off the new season with a game of musical chairs. Writer, actor, and\xa0Saturday Night Live\xa0alum Jason Sudeikis takes over as host, and I take the hot seat for a change.The idea came to Jason while he was running on the treadmill a couple of months ago. Mid-exercise, he texted me to see if I was interested in celebrating 200 episodes of\xa0Off Camera\xa0by allowing him to interview me. I was incredibly flattered by the offer, but I’ve always gone off the assumption, “Who wants to hear about me?” As a director and photographer, I’ve spent most of my career behind the camera, trying to peel back the layers of the creative person in front of the lens. But as I thought about it, one thing occurred to me—I could for once see what it feels like in the other chair. And after seeing Jason make the rounds as guest host on talk shows like\xa0Ellen, it was clear I’m in good hands. Maybe too good, as it turned out. Jason surprised me with his thoughtfulness, deep research, and by connecting some dots in my own history that I had never thought about before. Dare I say I liked it?Jason and I sit down to talk about the similarities between multi-hyphenates and superheroes, how the smallest act of encouragement and praise can be the greatest gift for an aspiring artist, why we film\xa0Off Camera\xa0in a vast, white room, and more. | Good old Robert Downey Jr. is back for a second time, and his career has gone quite well since his last appearance, on episode 5 of Off Camera. It is now our 200th\xa0episode, and Robert is here to remind us that great conversations should be unconventional, surprising, and sometimes just downright weird. Check, check, and check.Since the last time he was here, Robert’s\xa0Iron Man\xa0legend has grown exponentially—thanks to the massive success of Marvel’s\xa0Avengers\xa0franchise and the recent release of the final installment,\xa0Avengers: Endgame.\xa0 But if we rewind the tape, Robert’s journey on the project, like director Jon Favreau’s, started at a low point. “We were two people who had a film we were passionate about come out on the same weekend and bomb. His was\xa0Zathura,\xa0and mine was\xa0Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.” Their mutual comeuppance led to a creative bond, a big brother relationship. As Robert explains, “If that kind of synergy happens when you’re doing a movie, it’s going to be great. End of story.”Finding people who encourage and legitimize his creativity has been a theme for Robert, who despite moments of personal turmoil, possesses a deep-seated work ethic. Growing up, he was “Bob Downey’s kid,” the son of a groundbreaking, counterculture filmmaker, whose view of the industry was the following: “Anybody can act. Few can direct, and nobody can write.” Talk about humble beginnings.Robert joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about quitting (not getting fired from)\xa0Saturday Night Live\xa0after a year, why he thought (and still thinks) he could write a better script than William Goldman, and the great life advice he got from Figueroa Slim in jail. | If Scoot McNairy hadn’t found acting, it’s possible he’d be mowing lawns for a living. Scoot grew up relishing the outdoors of his native Texas, and started his own landscaping company at age 13 to make some spending money. Towards the end of high school, he had some thinking to do about his future. Since he was dyslexic, college seemed out of the question, so one day, his father asked, “What is the one thing that you could do every single day, that would get you up and out of bed, that would make you want to go to work?” Scoot’s answer: being on a movie set.Aside from being outdoors, Scoot’s other great passion was watching movies. He was fascinated by the magic of it all. And as a kid who loved to take things apart, he wanted to know how everything worked. He decided to move to Los Angeles for film school but got relatively little out of it, and felt like he needed hands-on experience on a movie set. Scoot’s fastest way in was getting work as a background actor, also known as an extra.\xa0“I swear I learned more in two weeks as a background actor on\xa0The Practice\xa0than I did in the entire year I went to film school.”Background work turned to commercial work which eventually turned to acting in television and film—thanks to an acting teacher who politely kicked him out of class so he’d start\xa0auditioning\xa0for roles instead of compulsively going to class. Because of his unconventional education, he approaches his job from a unique angle, creating very real and emotional performances in projects like\xa0Halt and Catch Fire,\xa0True Detective, Narcos, and the upcoming Quentin Tarantino film\xa0Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Scoot joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the dark place he had to live in to embody his True Detective\xa0character, how growing up with a learning disability helped him embrace failure, and why the only time his heart beats at a normal rate is on a motorcycle. | As the child of first-generation Muslim immigrants, Ramy Youssef grew up with a sense of practicality about his future. He was drawn to comedy and performing, but he saw no one who looked like him on TV. Add to that the fact that acting isn’t exactly a pragmatic career path in the first place. “I had parents who gave up everything to move to America, and I’m supposed to call them and say, ‘Hey, can you pay a bunch of money for me to study the Meisner technique?’ I didn’t have the balls to ask that question.”While in college, Ramy developed his stand-up and sketch comedy skills at UCB in his free time while studying political science and economics. He auditioned for a small role in the Nick at Nite series\xa0See Dad Run, and got the part, and decided to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles. That gig lasted\xa0for three seasons, and then Ramy got stuck in acting purgatory. According to audition feedback, he wasn’t good looking enough to be the lead; he wasn’t nerdy enough to play the nerd; and he wasn’t “ethnic” enough to play the ethnic guy. That’s when Ramy realized, “You never know where people are going to put you. It’s nice when\xa0you\xa0get to put yourself where you want to be.”Ramy took charge of his own destiny. He had writing skills, plenty of personal experience, and a unique cultural point of view. What he came up with was\xa0Ramy,\xa0his Hulu series based on his experience growing up in New Jersey and coming to terms with his Muslim faith. It’s being hailed as the first American television show to feature a Muslim family, but more importantly, it throws away Muslim caricatures and depicts rich and complex human storylines about family, faith, and cultural differences.Ramy joins\xa0Off Camera\xa0to talk about the moment his parents finally acknowledged he had “made it,” how puberty will be forever linked with global terrorism in his mind, and why stand up comedy makes everything else seem easy.', 'chan_desc': 'Off Camera is a podcast hosted by photographer/director Sam Jones, who created the show out of his passion for the long form conversational interview, and as a way to share his conversations with a myriad of artists, actors, musicians, directors, skateboarders, photographers, and writers that pique his interest.

My man Tim Ferriss is a master at deconstructing the work of others and de-stilling it into a working practice. In fact, he wrote his book Tools of Titans as a reference of some of the tactics, routines, and habits of billionaires.

But in reality the call that we’re meant to heed—the wake-up call—is always there for us, if we’re just willing to listen more carefully. Enjoy!     Today's episode is brought to you by CreativeLive.

And today, I have my long time friend Jason Harris in the hot seat to help us with just that. \xa0 Jason is the founder and CEO of the award winning creative agency Mekanism. He is one of Creativity Mag's most creative people in business, Top 100 People Who Make Advertising Great and about 52 other awards in the creative space. You've certainly seen his work if you've watched Superbowl commercials or heard of Peloton, Ben & Jerrys, HBO, and more. He also is one of the people that I look up to as a model of giving back. He donates a huge amount of his time to causes in which he believes and uses his marketing savvy for doing good in the world. \xa0 I'm super inspired by our conversation today for so many reasons, but here’s handful to whet your palette:  Of course we get into his new book The Soulful Art of Persuasion, in which Jason breaks down the art of sharing our ideas in an honest and authentic ways We talk about the ups and downs living life identifying as a professional creator, including the internal pressure many of us have to never be satisfied - and the fear we sometimes have around our work. File under funny: Jason's love for the band KISS. Not because they are masterful musicians but because they built their success as one of the most successful rock bands of all time on a battery of tools BEYOND just music such as storytelling, lore, and -yes- persuasion. and of course much more….

And just to be clear, that is all of the countries recognized on the planet. He is the first person to do it before the age of 35. More importantly, he has built online businesses, side hustles, and mastered the art of a non-conforming lifestyle since he was 19 years old. There's almost nobody better person equipped to talk about starting lots of businesses. He has a daily podcast called Side Hustle School where he's featured more than 850 different side hustle businesses + featured many in his new book called 100 Side Hustles. Chris also started half a dozen or more himself, started one of my favorite conferences, The World Domination Summit, and is a New York Times bestselling author of books like the $100 Start Up and The Art of Non-Conformity and many others. This guy is a beast and he's so savvy, so humble. In this episode:  We go into details about some of Chris' favorite side hustle businesses he's come across in his podcast & writing this book - what are some of the most common traits and failures. Chris shares his experience with depression, how he's faced it, and focused on some self-care. We talk about transitions, how to know when to quit something or to push through. and so much more...

I came across her music almost 10 years ago and love it so much I reached out to see if she would be interested on being on the show. Not only did she respond, she left us reeling from her incredible live performance and chat on art + entrepreneurship. Now she’s back on tour with her latest album Snowmelt. In this episode, we go deep into personal growth, dealing with incredible loss, balancing parenthood and career, and landscape for independent artists. Enjoy!

He’s the founder of a global photography movement, Help-Portrait, to give back to those in need. As well as many photography projects bridging empathy and creativity into awareness and action.

Today on the show, we get into his new book I’m Possible and his biggest project to date, building a hotel where every aspect serves someone in need. We get into facing fears, overcoming doubt, and how to turn the seemingly impossible to possible. In this episode:  The fear of having a dream that’s so big. Chasing a dream for a decade or lifetime. How do you take action and get paralyzed because it’s so big? How to chase curiosity despite your fear of starting something new? Whether you’re just starting out or you’re thinking about transitioning from something you love doing and are already good at....

You may remember a band called Presidents of the United States of America. They took the world by storm in 1995 with their self titled album, Presidents of the United States of America playing songs like Lump and Peaches. Yes, that’s right. My guest today is frontman Chris Ballew. Chris and I have been friends for years, including collaborating on a music video together and at least one live performance (gotta listen to find out ;). Of course we get into his musical journey, a meteoric rise to success, and then realizing something was missing. We take some deep dives into Chris’ creative process, including his method for capturing his small bits and later using those to write new works, including his new project Casper Babypants. \xa0 In this episode:  Consider what kind of artist you are and how you relate to other artists. For years Chris played in bands, but what he learned about himself is his work is actually solo. Don’t censor yourself while you’re creating. Get it out, no matter how crazy or ridiculous or unusual and then look back later. For years Chris didn’t allow himself to write on certain topics because it seemed silly. It wasn’t until he realized that was a false limitation that it help unlock a new level for him. How staying curious with a childlike imagination will give you fresh perspectives.  Enjoy!

The challenge was following it up—and Jackson and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, didn’t make it easy on themselves.In 1989, they produced an ambitious album with a portentous title: Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814. But what could have been Control, Part 2 instead was a visionary LP that reinvented the socially conscious album from the era of Marvin Gaye for the ’90s, and envisioned what pop would eventually sound like in the 21st century. Rhythm Nation was a smash, generating more hits—and bigger hits—than any album in history. In fact, if Jackson and her label hadn’t pulled their punches with one final radio single, she could have set an all-time Billboard chart record that would have overshadowed any of the Jackson family’s historic achievements.Podcast production by Chris Berube.HostChris MolanphyFollow @cmolanphy on Twitter / https://www.twitter.com/cmolanphy\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

In this video we’ll take a look at an external GPU or eGPU setup.I\'m using a Dell XPS 15 9570 laptop, but you can use any laptop that supports Thunderbolt 3 and has a minimum of 16GB of RAM and an i5 processor (i7 8th generation recommended) - this could be somethign like the Razer Blade 15, Razer Blade Stealth or HP Spectre 13. You can also run an eGPU with a Macbook but using NVIDIA cards is going to require a lot of workarounds.This is an excellent way to speed up the performance of applications such as Lightroom, Premiere Pro and After Effects by adding an external GPU card.Also worth noting - as I am posting this video, NVIDIA has just announced as I’m releasing this video, NVIDIA has announced their new RTX Studio laptops. These new Laptops are designed for creative work and are boasting some serious specs. The new Studio drivers have been tested extensively with applications by Adobe, Epic, Autodesk, Unity and Blackmagic Design specifically with creative workflows in mind. #NVIDIAStudioMusic is from Epidemic Sound https://goo.gl/v5wWKrAoP T-Shirts https://aop.threadless.com/Need a website? http://squarespace.com/aopOn my channel you will find videos about photography, cinematography, post processing tutorials for Capture One, Lightroom and Photoshop, photo assignments that YOU can participate in, the Artist Series and more.

In this video I\'ll use Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the concept and how it works. Of course this same idea can be applied to any software application that you are using for photography (Lightroom, Luminare, DX0, Capture One etc).• Understand how to sample colors and see toning in both shadow and highlight detail• find the midtones• match a color grade using a color balance adjustment layer• match a color grade using a curves adjustment layerCheck out my other videos:Lightroom Presets :: Get Incredible Looking Images https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO6s6oRPR1AThe Film Look With Levels Adjustments https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQiqOinqHV4The One Secred Lightroom Feature Every Photographer Should Be Using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7HBdMrR6ZoCanon EOS RP :: Why? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg4C7Uipt9IWhy You Should Be Using Lightroom Mobile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNoNlJKcSNUMusic is from Epidemic Sound https://goo.gl/v5wWKrAoP T-Shirts https://aop.threadless.com/Need a website? http://squarespace.com/aopOn my channel you will find videos about photography, cinematography, post processing tutorials for Capture One, Lightroom and Photoshop, photo assignments that YOU can participate in, the Artist Series and more.

It\'s the consummate cool weather growing region, where Riesling and aromatic whites reign supreme. Bruce Murray, the founder and creative force behind Boundary Breaks, tells us how he went from newspaper man, to working with Elon Musk, to running a winery so focused on terroir, they don\'t even have a dedicated winemaker. \xa0 Boundary Breaks was founded in 2007 by Bruce on the East side of Seneca Lake. It focuses on Riesling, which range in style from dry and complex to lightly sweet to a true Riesling Ice Wine. In addition to Riesling, small amounts of Gewurztraminer, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are grown on the estate. The wines are spectacular with a purity of flavor, and excellent terroir expression. Bruce\'s life is fascinating and Boundary Breaks, indeed, has broken some boundaries in what can be done in the wine world!\xa0 \xa0 Here are the topics we discuss:\xa0  Bruce tells us how his life unfolded to bring him back to the area in which he grew up. He tells me how the Donnhoff Riesling from Nahe, Germany in a Thai restaurant in Vegas changed the course of his life.\xa0  We talk about the Finger Lakes, how they were formed, why they are so unique and why the east side of Seneca Lake produces such excellent grapes. We get extra dorky, discussing Boundary Breaks\' unique drainage system and why "wet feet" are bad for grapes  \xa0  We discuss Riesling and how\xa0vineyard management is so pivotal to getting pure flavor. We detail each style Boundary Breaks makes -- dry, off-dry, ice wine plus aromatic whites like\xa0Gewurztraminer.  \xa0  We talk extensively about the challenges of growing reds in the climate of the Finger Lakes and how quality has been spotty over the years, but is improving by leaps and bounds.

Jerry Solomon was a real estate attorney in San Diego who longed for a small town life and wanted wine to be part of it. Trey Busch was a Walla Walla winemaker who had insane talent but needed a partner to make his dream winery a reality. The two created Sleight of Hand 12 years ago to create exceptional, terroir driven wines that reflect the unique land of Walla Walla and Columbia Valley. Jerry takes us on a journey of the winery, the land, and the beautiful wines they produce! \xa0 They will be at Underground Wine Event on November 9, 2019 – don’t miss it! www.undergroundwineevents.com/events \xa0 Here are the show notes:  Jerry tells us how he and his wife Sandy made the move from San Diego Real Estate attorney to Director of Winemaking at the coolest winery in Walla Walla He talks about the wonderful friendship and partnership between him and Trey Busch, an Atlantan who became a skilled Walla Walla winemaker after working for several excellent wineries We talk about the special role of music at Sleight of Hand and how the winery got its name from a Pearl Jam song   Jerry explains why the Columbia Valley, and Walla Walla, in particular, are so special for winemaking. We talk soil (loess, which the Walla Walla folks pronounce "luss" and basalt), sun exposure, latitude and why these wines are so different from those from California We talk about the variety of Sleight of Hand wines from\xa0Riesling, Chardonnay, Syrah, and red blends and what makes each so special  We discuss why Syrah, in particular, is such a standout in Walla Walla ad why Milton-Freewater Rocks District is so insanely good   I ask Jerry if he thinks\xa0Washington gets the respect it deserves on the world wine scene and why scores work against Washington wines   We discuss why Sleight of Hand wants to stay small We close with how Neil Patrick Harris wound up on the Conjurer label!  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Norm is known to have helped grow the Walla Walla industry from a few dozen acres in 1989 to 2800 today, around the idea of impeccable quality in the vineyard. The business is truly a family business. Norm is still involved but Eric is a partner. Eric worked for 11 years in Seattle in the telecom industry, earned an MBA and then returned to Walla Walla in 2003, where he is an active partner at Amavi Cellars and Pepper Bridge Winery. In 2004, he assumed the duty of General Manager at Amavi Cellars. He also taught me pretty much everything I know about Walla Walla and is one of the best advocates for the region there is! If you get a chance to try these wines, you should do it -- they are pure Walla Walla and purely excellent!\xa0 Here are the show notes: \xa0  Eric tells us about the Missoula Floods and why Walla Walla is such a unique growing region, unlike any other in the world. If you want to see a cool PBS documentary on the Missoula Floods, here it is.\xa0  \xa0  We learn about the early days of Walla Walla -- what was here, how grapes supplanted apples, and who the early players were and what they accomplished. We talk about Jean-Francois Pellet, winemaker and partner for both Pepper Bridge and Amavi, and why he was such a believer in this region when he came from Heitz in Napa for a job interview with Amavi and Pepper Bridge.\xa0  \xa0  We discuss the "bowl" valley that is Walla Walla, the soil types and and the styles that different parts of Walla Walla yield. We do a bit of compare and contrast on Napa v Walla Walla styles  \xa0  Because it\'s timely, Eric settles our fears about phylloxera that was recently reported on in the wine pubs  \xa0  Then we spend time dorking out about the flavors that you\'ll find in Walla Walla -- Syrahs that taste plush, some that taste like licking rocks. Cabernet that expresses terroir without being too full or rich. Semillon that has beautiful acidity. All of these things and how they are achieved.\xa0   \xa0  Finally we dip into the thorny question of why so many wineries are based in Walla Walla that don\'t make any wines from Walla Walla fruit only (they blend it with things from other part of Columbia Valley) and what that means for the AVA from a marketing and reputational standpoint.\xa0  \xa0 Amavi and Pepper Bridge will be at this year\'s Underground Wine Event in Washington DC.

Today, however, exciting producers have mastered their microclimates and are making some of the freshest, most nuanced, terroir-driven wines in the United States. \xa0 This week I sit down with Elizabeth Smith of one of the top wineries in this lovely state, Afton Mountain Vineyards. We discuss everything from Virginia history with grape growing, to terroir obsession, to the European flare of the region, and why the wines are so darn good. \xa0If you don\'t know much about VA or you\'re an obsessive this podcast will be equally fascinating!\xa0 \xa0 Elizabeth and Tony Smith both grew up in Charlottesville and had lifelong ties the Blue Ridge Mountains. After working and raising a family in coastal VA, and even trying their hands at grape growing there (not quite the right terroir!), they decided to move back to their hometown for their second act – winegrowing and making. They bought Afton Mountain Vineyards in 2009 and in this show, Elizabeth shares their story and how they came to make some of the best wine in Virginia. \xa0  Elizabeth shares her background and how she went from investment management to property management to winery management (and rocked them all!)  \xa0  Elizabeth gives us a true education on the Monticello appellation – what matters to quality wine, what is challenging in growing grapes here, and why she and Tony selected the most westerly site in the Monticello AVA to make their elegant wines  \xa0  We dork out on microclimates, what makes Virginia so unique, and why elevation, and extremely attentive (obsessive) vineyard management is the only way to make great wine in Virginia and why sustainable viticulture is better than organic in a dicey climate like that in the Monticello area.  \xa0  Elizabeth answers the question: Why does Damien Blanchon, their French winemaker, and so many other French winemakers find themselves in Virginia, and decide to stay (hint: challenge without restriction!)  \xa0  We talk about the varietals that do well for Afton Mountain (Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Albariño for the whites, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Tannat, and Sangiovese for the reds) and the flavors they yield from this land. We have an interesting side bar about how Petit Verdot can really suck if not handled well!  \xa0  We wrap with Elizabeth talking about how far Virginia wine has come in the last 10 years and a BIG teaser on a project Afton Mountain is starting this fall!  \xa0 Find out more about Elizabeth and her wines at www.aftonmountainvineyards.com\xa0and come to the Underground Wine Event on 11/9/19 in Washington D.C. to meet her and taste her beautiful wines! \xa0 Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Swartland (Dutch for \'black land\') is full of young, passionate winemakers making wines that respect the hot, dry land from which they derive and are able to create wines of such depth, flavor, and nuance that it’s hard to believe so few know about them. In this show, we tell you about the Syrah, Rhône and Mediterranean varietals, the Chenin Blanc and other stunning white blends coming from this area and why you need to seek it out ASAP! \xa0 Overview of the region…  Swartland was oncea rural backwater, better known for wheat fields than vineyards Vineyards traditionally grew where wheat couldn’t -- on the northern side of Paardeberge Mountains in the south, the plains of Piketberg in the north, and the smaller Ward of Riebeekberg and Kasteelberg Mountains in the east Lots of old vines on slopes where nothing else grows, hand harvested The climate ishot and dry with very low summer rainfall but with consistent afternoon and evening breezes off the Atlantic Ocean. Growers have less concern about fungus and other diseases. They use the ecosystem to keep the vineyards healthy with integrated pest management, bush training of vines, and dry farming  \xa0 We dork out on plate tectonics!  Swartland has ancient geology. The terroirresulted from a combination of tectonic collisions, ancient volcanic activity and continental separation The soils are the oldest in the world and are a mix of shale, arenite sandstone and granite, schist based terroirs. Malmesbury shale on Kasteelberg Mtn is the dominant soil.  vertical layering structure caused by tectonic shifts. Water drains away and vines dig deeper for liquid nourishment    \xa0 Grapes/Winemaking  We talk about the grapes and terroir driven wines of the region  Red grapes: Syrah/Shiraz, Mourvèdre, Grenache Noir, Carignan, Cinsaut, Tinta Barocca, Pinotage White grapes:Chenin blanc, Grenache blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne, Viognier, Clairette, Palomino, Sémillon, Muscat d’Alexandria, Muscat d’Frontignan, Colombard and Verdelho. Viticulture:A lot of natural, noninvasive methods of farming Winemaking:larger barrels that impart less flavor, less racking and stirring to keep earthy flavors, unfiltered, unfined wines – low input wines   The Ward of Riebeekbergnear the towns of Riebeek Kasteel and Riebeek West has vineyards on eastern slopes of the Kasteelberg Mountain make big reds of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chenin Blanc, and Chardonnay that are complex  \xa0\xa0 We talk about South African and Swartland Wine history  We discuss how South Africa lies somewhere between the Old World and New World styles. We discuss the early history in the 1660s, with the arrival of the French Huguenots who planted vineyards. We tell the story of how, in late 1990s, Charles Back of Goats do Roam fame went to Swartland to source grapes and wound up transforming the area by \xa0buying land and hiring Eben Sadie to run his “Spice Route” wines in 1998. We discuss the modern history of the region and why it takes a special person to make wine in conditions withlow rainfall, un-irrigated vines and paltry yields.  \xa0\xa0 Producers and the Swartland revolution  We discuss Swartland Independent Producers (SIP), an association that runs the Swartland Revolution celebration every November Their goal: Wines that are a true expression of their origin. Like old world AOPs -- distinctive wines but also making them so as to speak about a sense of place See the list of requirements and the producers here: \xa0https://swartlandindependent.co.za/members/  \xa0\xa0 Top producers  AA Badenhorst: AA Badenhorst Family White, \xa0AA Badenhorst Family Red are flagships; Secateurs produced from purchased fruit Lammershoek:Traditional producer Testalonga:“naked” style, funky wines Lammershoek:Libero No. 5 Mullineux: Syrahs and white blends; entry level Kloof Street Porseleinberg\xa0 Sadie Family: Columella – Syrah-based blend (famous), Palladius – rich style white; cheaper, co-owned Sequillo range  \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Theresa Breuer is a young woman who found herself (sadly, earlier  than she expected) at the helm of one of the most respected, highest quality Riesling producers in the Rheingau region of Germany. \xa0I had the pleasure of spending the day with her a few years back and she is brilliant, poised, kind and a genius vigneron and cellar master, but more than anything, at 30-something, she is one of the best fresh faces and ambassadors for what Rheingau wine is, was, and should be.\xa0 This show should give you a perspective on why Rheingau is so special and make you understand why a dork like me loves this place so much!\xa0 Here are the show notes:\xa0 HISTORY  Theresa shares\xa0Weingut Georg Breuer\'s nearly 140 years in wine -- from her great grandfather Peter\'s involvement in the business side of wine, to her grandfather after whom the Weingut is named, to her dad, Bernhard, and then to her. \xa0 We discuss Bernhard Breuer\'s obsession with quality, bringing the reputation of Rheingau back from a less than stellar period, and her involvement in the business.\xa0 Theresa shares her (beautiful) philosophies about wine and why it means so much to her.  Rheingau Education!  I have rarely found anyone who can educate on a region as well and succinctly as Theresa Breuer and we are lucky to have her explain stuff like:\xa0  Where is Rheingau and what makes it so unique for wine? The parallels with Burgundy in terms of Grand Cru, Premier Cru, Village, Regional sites and why it is so easy in Rheingau Why Riesling is so dominant in Rheingau and why it does so well here (hint: reflection from the river, slate/quartzite soils, slopes!) How climate change has affected the region, what a hot year like 2019 means for the wine, and what really matters to vintage How oak is used in Rheingau (and it is used, a LOT!)    Theresa gives us the deep dive into site specific info. It\'s fascinating:\xa0  Theresa shares detailed and excellent information about George Breuer\'s sites and the why and how behind the differences in the wines. We discuss their beautiful Grand Cru sites in Rüdesheim – Berg Schlossberg, Berg Roseneck and Berg Rottland and their wholly owned site, Nonnenberg in Rauenthal (in the eastern part of Rheingau Theresa talks about her commitment to organic viticulture and her vision for the wines -- to let the vineyard produce the best wines and to let the Riesling show its home in the glass!\xa0 We talk about what makes Theresa\'s wines elegant and age worthy. We discuss the generational shift in Rheingau and what it does and will mean for wine in the future.  Theresa unveils big news: Weingut Georg Breuer bought some land in the (very different, Mittelrhein-type) wine area of Lorch, to the west of their Grand Cru vineyards. They will be learning more about the sites, and making wine from them soon!\xa0 Check out the videos on my YouTube Channel -- you will love Theresa even more!\xa0 \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

M.C. Ice and I are not big fans, but we do our best to explain the phenomenon of these whites made with skin contact. \xa0 Here are the show notes: \xa0  You know it\'s time to cover a topic when, in Europe, the supermarket chain Aldi sells a bottle of skin-contact wine for less than $8 US!\xa0  \xa0  WHAT THE HECK IS ORANGE WINE??  First and most importantly, it\'s not from oranges but from grapes!\xa0 Made exactly like a red but with longer maceration (the time during winemakig when the grape skins and seeds stay in contact with the juice)\xa0 Reds with skin contact are red wines, reds with little contact are rosés; whites with skin contact are “orange”, without contact they are whites  Rosés usually undergo less than 12 hours macerating on their skins before the juice is pressed off\xa0 Orange wine is the opposite of Rosé   Can make skin-contact wine from any grape – length of time with the skins will matter to flavor and the longer the time the more likely the wine is to mask terroir Length of time varies, but maceration is LONG – days, weeks, months     Not all are orange so it’s better to call them “skin-contact wines.”  WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MACERATING WHITE JUICE WITH SKINS?  The wine takes on a darker colored/orange-ish white color, as well as phenols, pigment.\xa0 Aromas: Bolder and more intense same grapes vinified as traditional white – like rose v red  Flavors: Nutty, oxidized flavor, very sour with a cider note.\xa0Can be bold, nutty, like old apples, sourdough bread   Textures: Dry, tannic, intense (not very pleasurable sometimes)   \xa0 Different styles:  Lightest ones, are acidic, aromatic wines, with fresh apricot, herbs Medium ones – slight oxidation, some acetone notes, old apple Then full-bodied, boldly tannic, and often smoky, nutty, lots of VA, off notes  \xa0 Regions:\xa0  The Republic of Georgia: Qvervi—underground vessels sealed with beeswax or oil soaked clothes. The practice of skin contact whites likely originated here 6,000 or more years ago (the practice still goes on today, although the Greeks and Romans quickly realized the best wines were those from free-run juice/whites not macerated, which is our "traditional" style today).\xa0Rkatsiteli is the main grape Listen to the Georgia Podcast!  \xa0  Italy: Most prominent in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, often called\xa0\xa0ramato\xa0“copper-colored” wines from Pinot Grigio but Ribolla Gialla and Tocai Friulano are often used.\xa0  Fruili producers who re-started the orange wine movement:\xa0Radikon, Gravner Sicilian producers:\xa0Cos, I Vigneri\xa0    \xa0  Slovenia:\xa0Goriska Brda in Slovenia has a long history of skin contact wine Listen to the Slovenia show!  \xa0  United States  Long Island:\xa0Channing Daughters, Shinn Estate California: Some Sonoma    \xa0  Others:\xa0Australia – Sauvignon Blanc, Greece, South Africa, Croatia, France  \xa0 Food Pairing:\xa0Skin Contact wine is versatile with food pairing but it depends on the weight and the treatment of the wine (length of maceration, barrel v. stainless steel, etc).\xa0  Serving temps – 50 – 55˚ warmer side  \xa0 Don\'t forget to order your Wine For Normal People book today too!!   \xa0____________________________________________________ Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Simone Madden-Grey returns to tell us about the stunning Pinot Noir, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling, up and coming Syrah, and other excellent Wellington wines that must be on your radar! \xa0 Here are the show notes: Wellington Wine Country Overview  In 2016 three wine regions of the Wairarapa Valley in the lower north island formally launched Wellington Wine Country: Masterton, Gladstone, and Martinborough The area is small -- just 3% of national plantings and 1% of national production, but represents 10% of producers  \xa0 Location  The southern part of New Zealand\'s North Island 35 miles (55km) north-east of Wellington (1 hr drive), New Zealand\'s capital city, in a wide river valley between Rimutaka mountain range and eastern Wairarapa hills  \xa0Climate/Terroir  Semi-maritime, dry climate – rain shadow of the Tararua Ranges with blustery winds Cool spring and autumn seasons, hot summer days with cool nights - long growing season Martinborough Terrace:\xa0a crescent shaped area on the edge of a river terrace formed by the Ruamahunga and Huangarua rivers with gravel soils that drain well and stress the vines (in a good way) Mountain ranges and hills  Remutaka and Tararua Ranges to the west protect from winds off Tasman Sea Aorangi Ranges, western mountain ranges protect area from cold southerly winds coming in off the Cook Strait and together with the western moutnain ranges, also funnel cool breezes up from the Cook Strait    Soil  River terraces in Martinborough with pockets of clay and quartz-threaded greywacke (type of coloured sedimentary sandstone formed by river deposits) and volcanic basalt.  Alluvial soils can be up to 15m deep in Martinborough    Climate  Semi-maritime climate with high sunshine hours, cool Springs and Autumns, warm Summers Warm, low rainfall, relatively long, dry growing season, low humidity and low disease pressure Diurnal variation:\xa0Summer temps during the day 30˚C (86˚F) to 10˚C (50˚F) at night Frost is an issue, very windy at times throughout the year, particularly in spring  \xa0 Sub Regions: North to south  Masterton:\xa0Largest town in Wairarapa,first area grapes were planted in the region.\xa0Known for\xa0Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir  \xa0  Gladstone:\xa0Just south of Masterton, free-draining river terraces - Shallower terraces than of Martinborough and nearby. Clay pockets – planted Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc with high aromatics.  \xa0  Martinborough – about 30 wineries:\xa0Colonial village is surrounded by small vineyards, family-owned producers – highly respected boutique wineries. Lowest rainfall of any area in the North Island and reliably cool climate for Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling and other aromatic whites.  \xa0  Te Muna:\xa0Southeast of the township with stonier alluvial gravel soils, windier growing conditions and a slightly cooler climate than Martinborough. Escarpment and Craggy Range are here.  Wine Style:\xa0Red, white, sparkling (usually Methode Traditionnelle), rosé and sweet wines are all produced in the region  Pinot Noir: Thicker skins and smaller yields contribute an aromatic, savory, dark fruited profile with good acidity and potential for age. Sauvignon Blanc: leading white grape variety, very important for export. More herbaceous and citrus driven, with mineral notes -- less of the big fruit style of Marlborough Pinot Gris: Trying to coax a spicier, more complex style with pear and white stone fruit characters\xa0 Chardonnay: For the last decade growers\xa0pick earlier to attain lower alcohol, more natural acidity -- lighter less tropical style. \xa0Varying degrees of new oak and use of MLF, lees contact and stirring, but the goal is elegance Riesling: Good acidity, very lemon-lime in flavor Grüner Veltliner, Gewürztraminer, Pinot Blanc, Syrah and some Bordeaux varieties  The producer list!  High-profile small producers: Ata Rangi,\xa0Margrain,\xa0Dry River, Escarpment,\xa0Te Kairanga,\xa0Martinborough Vineyard Paddy Borthwick in Gladstone Larger but still good producers: Palliser,\xa0Craggy Range Second labels:  Martinborough Vineyard’s "Te Tera" \xa0(UK, NZ, Oz only) Palliser "Pencarrow"\xa0(UK, NZ, Oz only) Escarpment "The Edge" (UK, NZ, Oz only)    \xa0 _________________________________________\xa0 Thanks to our sponsors this week:  Thanks to\xa0YOU!\xa0The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make\xa0the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!

Lin-Manuel Miranda on The Hamilcast:  https://www.thehamilcast.com/lin-manuel-miranda/ \xa0 | Miguel Cervantes (#HamiltonCHI’s Alexander Hamilton) was generous enough to find some time to record and we had such a great time. From the story of asking Gillian to be a stand in (seriously), to breaking down the role of Alexander Hamilton, to playing trivia with the listeners, we covered a lot of ground.

If you\'re interested, please feel free to read along with us; we\'ll be going chapter-by-chapter and provide detailed and reference-heavy outlines for each #Cherpter. But there\'s no pressure! There\'s plenty to talk about and this is not a super serious history class.When I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has built around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast for you and I absolutely love making it.If you have any great Ham stories or funny references you\'ve come across, let me know! I love hearing about things like that.

Dickens\' classic novel about a lovable urchin named Oliver Twist is equal parts social novel, mystery, and bildungsroman -- or so Charlie thought. We dive into what works and doesn\'t work about its depictions of London in the Industrial Revolution, Oliver\'s moral compass, and the titular twist. | Welcome back to HELLBOYS, a Divine Comedy podcast from the boys here at Overdue! We\'re continuing our journey through Robert and Jean Hollander\'s translation of Dante\'s Divine Comedy a few cantos at a time.Some Patreon supporters get these episodes monthly, but every two months we combine them for general consumption. This episode carries us through the back half of the Inferno, covering Cantos XVII-XXXIV. We travel through the Malebolge, meet a demon biker gang, and climb down the Devil himself!Find out more about how to get these episodes monthly at patreon.com/overduepod. | The God of Small Things is about family, and loss, and India, and the caste system, and all of its disparate plot lines and character arcs come together in the end like a Seinfeld episode but with more tragedy.  | "What if women ended the Peloponnesian War, am I right?" asks Aristophanes in his classic comedy Lysistrata. Famous for its depiction of a sex strike that brings the warring Greek states to their unsexed knees, the play has been remixed countless times as generations of artists adapt its core conceit to their own times. So we figured we\'d go back to the old Prince of Comedy himself to see what all the fuss is about.Talking points include comedies of bad manners, Ancient Greek props, and the "lioness on a cheese grater." | It\'s time to play some games! Craig\'s sister Jillian read Iain M. Banks\' The Player of Games, one of several entries in his Culture series that explores a hegemonic utopia influencing as much of outer space as it can. Banks\' ideas gameplay may be primarily analog, but he still manages to represent cultures and worlds with digital creativity.Andrew may be away, but we still find time to joke about names, make some Gatsby references, and chat about Starcraft. | Join us as we attempt to bring Pullman\'s epic god-fightin\' trilogy to a close! We start with a brief recap of the first two books, and then we dive into what does and doesn\'t work for Andrew in the final installment. Train your spyglass on the Fall of Man, cut through bear armor with your subtle knife, and follow your golden compass to the origin of Dust. Additional talking points include Andrew\'s new partyboy son, motorcycle elephants, and the debut of a new segment: Andrew\'s Dad Moment. | Friend of the show Christina Tucker (Unfriendly Black Hotties, PCHH, her new newsletter, etc.) joins us to chat about Jeff VanderMeer\'s novel Annihilation. It\'s the first of his Southern Reach trilogy, a Weird Science Fiction romp through a mysterious zone called Area X.We\'ve got our own Area X going, replete with chicken sandwiches, Edward James Olmos, and a fun-loving chat of supporters. | This week we welcome Renata and Kait from The Worst Bestsellers to talk about Becky Chambers\' first entry in the Wayfarer series: The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. It\'s a book that\'s equal parts cozy AND sexy, with plenty of aliens for you to meet and/or have...stirrings about.Our conversation takes the long way from Star Trek to the Secret, exploring what it\'s like for folks who usually read Bad books to actually read a Good one.Caveat lictor: sometimes you have to swear in space! | The titular Tarzan of the titular Apes is a lot more than "Me Tarzan. You Jane." And Edgar Rice Burroughs is here to tell you all about how and why it\'s because he\'s the sire of an English nobleman.Join us for a chat about the lost city of Tarzana, the Ernest filmography, and the invention of stabbing. | Andrew\'s Appointment Television co-hosts Kathryn VanArendonk and Margaret H. Willison join us for a chat about siblings, rivalry, and this classic of modern parenting lit from Adele Faber and Elain Mazlish.At the time of recording, Andrew\'s fatherhood was looming on the horizon, so Kathryn kindly shared with us how relevant the book felt to her own parenting experience. And don\'t worry, Craig and Margaret had plenty of wisdom to share as well.Caveat lictor: Margaret\'s here, so there\'s swearing.', 'chan_desc': "Overdue is a podcast about the books you've been meaning to read.

LeVeque helps us flip our inner narratives about food and let go of the shame that sometimes surrounds how we eat. She shares her life hacks, like how to make her Fab Four smoothie that supports balanced blood sugar, how to reset and satisfy hunger hormones, and how to not regret your takeout order. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.)\xa0 | “As a man, if you don’t express your fears fully and completely,” says Gabrielle Bernstein, “it’s going to be like a pressure cooker.” The New York Times–bestselling author of Super Attractor joins the guys to explain why she believes we’re capable of attracting what we want and why we block ourselves from this power in myriad ways. Bernstein shows us how to develop this skill, forgive our thoughts, redirect our energy—and use her tools of attraction. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | “Being strong for each other is just being real with each other,” says journalist Lauren Scruggs Kennedy, who lost her left arm and left eye after being hit by a plane propeller. Today, she talks with the goopfellas about fear and faith, finding peace as you move through grief, unexpected sources of gratitude, and how the accident redefined beauty for her. Getting your fear out in the open is paramount, says Scruggs Kennedy, because when left inside, it will only expand. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub and the Lauren Scruggs Kennedy Foundation, which provides funding for girls and women to get prosthetic limbs they otherwise might not be able to afford.) | “I remind myself I am enough, I have enough, and not everyone is going to love me,” says Antoni Porowski, Queer Eye’s food and wine connoisseur, author of Antoni in the Kitchen, and restaurateur. Today he’s sharing his experience with anxiety, self-doubt, and imposter syndrome. Porowski talks about taking in criticism, tackling compare-and-despair habits, building confidence and self-acceptance, and his unexpected homecoming. And of course, he talks to our cohosts about cooking and how food has shaped his life and the way he connects with others. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | \xa0“I never felt free in my life,” says Lewis Howes. “And I felt free for the first time when I started to share my shame and insecurities.” Howes—the bestselling author of The Mask of Masculinity, the host of the School of Greatness podcast, and a former pro athlete—joins the guys to talk about the different masks that he believes men hide behind. Howes talks about why, at the height of his success, he felt most lonely and unfulfilled. And then they get into the roots of anger and why so many boys are conditioned to misdirect and misunderstand the emotion. They talk about setting aside blame, rebuilding a culture where men have space to be vulnerable, accepting what’s enough, and breaking through whatever mask you’re wearing right now. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | “We tend to shy away from listening to our bodies and asking the right questions and seeking the right help in the moment,” says Michael Anthony, executive chef of the renowned Gramercy Tavern in New York City. Today, he’s catching up with the guys (Seamus Mullen is a longtime friend) to talk about a health scare that changed his outlook on life. Anthony had massive a heart attack that compelled him to rethink how he was living, to question the put-your-head-down-and-work chef mentality (that’s also familiar to many of us outside the kitchen), and to reconnect with the natural world, which he found a way to do through food.(For more, see thegoopfellas podcast hub.) | Dianne “V” Capaldi—aka PaleoBOSS lady—struggled for years with debilitating MS. At one point, she was given a bleak prognosis, and told to get her affairs in order. Her husband walked out. And she prevailed. Today, V joins the guys to share her wild story, the moment she decided she would never give up, and her “brick-to-forehead” moment when she says she realized what she needed to do: heal on a cellular level. She got conscious about owning her own life. And now, she’s paying it forward. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | “The main issue with conventional medicine is that it’s the wrong tool for the job that we face today,” says Chris Kresser, acupuncturist and functional medicine educator. Kresser, who wrote the books The Paleo Cure and Unconventional Medicine, believes we’re too often prescribed for our symptoms, and not often enough getting at the root causes of our illnesses. He shares his own story of chronic illness, trying every trick in the book, and finding the paleo diet and functional medicine approach that helped save him. Kresser talks to the guys about diet controversies, alternative therapies, shifting financial and self-care priorities—and the not easy, but simple things we can all do for our health. (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | Here is Rob Lowe at his best: In this conversation with the guys, Lowe talks about his health obsessions new and old, from intermittent fasting to surfing, the Atkins diet, and the fitness instructors who bust his ass. He talks about the things he no longer feels compelled to do and how he’s learned to listen to his limits as he’s gotten older. Is he still competitive? Very—which he believes has helped him stay clean. And then there’s his family. Lowe talks about the big decisions he’s made as a father, how he thinks about raising good men, and what’s made his marriage work for nearly three decades. “If there’s any way to marry your best friend,” he says, “do it.” (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.) | On this special episode of goopfellas, cohosts Dr. Will Cole and Seamus Mullen break down the ketogenic diet. Should you switch to a high-fat, low-carb baseline? What would you eat in a typical day? When do our bodies go into ketosis, and what are the potential health benefits? What about intermittent fasting? Seamus shares his personal experience of changing his diet while healing from rheumatoid arthritis. And Will shares examples from his functional medicine practice, the kinds of diets he typically prescribes for patients with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and how he tweaks the conventional keto model to be cleaner and more vegetable-forward for anyone (he’s the author of Ketotarian, after all). (For more, see the goopfellas podcast hub.)', 'chan_desc': 'What drives people to change, to heal, to reinvent themselves? How do we reclaim our health, bounce back from heartbreak, flip the script? On goopfellas, two friends who have become familiar with unlikely personal transformations have raw conversations with people who have experienced profound shifts in perspective and well-being. Together, functional medicine practitioner Will Cole, DC, and chef Seamus Mullen get at the catalysts that bring people out of their dark night and into their purpose. Each of their goopfellas guests—from athletes to actors to authors—is different. As are the hosts: Mullen himself almost died from rheumatoid arthritis, and Cole’s day job is helping people uncover and overturn the roots of dis-ease. But you’ll likely see pieces of yourself in all their conversations, reflected in every one of their challenges. And we hope, from the lessons they learned along the way, you’ll find something you need to bring about a change, big or small, in your own life.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/21/d3/e2/21d3e242-9254-b371-5f80-16521e2c5fac/mza_6786331723623561505.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-10'}}

Listen now at www.wondery.fm/scarecast1 \xa0 \xa0 | In this episode of the Scarecast, we will be going over three cases: **************************************** Dolly\'s Dip & The Death of Regena Dolly Young (1:05) In 1984, The Los Angeles Times did a story about a horrible accident involving 48-year-old, Regena “Dolly” Young on Disneyland’s ‘Matterhorn.\xa0 One day, on the attraction, Regena fell off of her bobsled and was fatally trampled by an incoming bobsled.\xa0 An analysis of the incident revealed that an unbuckled seat belt was the main issue that could have brought about the accident.\xa0 It is still unclear whether the seatbelt trouble was caused by a ride malfunction or something that Regena intentionally did, which some reports claim could have been done to help out her child who was also on the ride.\xa0 What is clear is that while on the ride, Regena stood up as the bobsled sloped downward when there was another track overhead. This sudden drop flung Regena upward, causing her head to smash into the track up above, which threw her out of her sled onto the track it was riding on. When she landed, she was still alive but unconscious, but then about thirty seconds later another bobsled came speeding along and ran her over.\xa0 She was instantly killed and supposedly wound up lodged in the structure so tightly that the track had to be taken apart to get her out. This accident became so notorious, that the place where Regena died was coined “Dolly’s Dip”, based off of her nickname.\xa0 Ever since she died, it became evident that the ghost of “Dolly” started to haunt the Matterhorn.\xa0 Many people reported they frequently saw her ghost and heard its eerie wails throughout the attraction, specifically in a large cavernous area near the center of the ride. **************************************** Harold The Doll (5:54)\xa0 \xa0 Greg Mishka first posted his doll, Harold, on eBay back in 2004. Greg had been pursuing a career as a filmmaker at the time and was adamant to fully disclose the experiences he had with the doll to potential buyers. He explained that ever since he bought the doll from a flea market in Florida, his life had been turned upside down and flooded with bad luck. Greg’s cat mysteriously died, his girlfriend broke up with him, and he would constantly have migraines. After he was told by a priest to burn Harold, Greg attempted to set the doll alight, but it simply wouldn’t burn. Instead, the doll was put in a small wooden coffin and Greg decided to store it in his basement. Unfortunately, he started to hear the voices of children playing in his basement. The eBay listing quickly gained a lot of traction. Many websites published articles discussing Greg and Harold, forums would discuss them, and at one point the Coast to Coast radio show, hosted by Art Bell, spoke about the doll. Suspicions surrounding Harold started to grow, even more so when a video was uploaded to the internet. In this video, viewers can see the doll’s arm and mouth moving. Greg claims that the doll spoke and said the word “Harold”, which is why he decided to give it that name. At first, Greg had hoped to just make a little extra cash from selling the doll, but with all the attention it was receiving, more and more bids were being made. **************************************** The Ilkley Moor Alien (15:54) In 1987, a metropolitan policeman in London quit his job of four years in order to move closer to his wife’s family.\xa0 The man went by the fictitious name, Philip Spencer, and that year, he moved to the West Yorkshire area of Ilkley Moor with his wife and child.\xa0 Later that year, on the morning of December 1st, at around 7:15 am, Spencer went out on a walk to visit his in-law’s.\xa0 It was particularly dreary and overcast that morning, and Spencer would have to cross the Ilkley Moor to reach his destination.\xa0 Spencer had heard tales of mysterious lights that had been seen around Ilkley Moor, so he brought along his camera just in case.\xa0 He also took his compass with him, to help with navigating through the early day fog.\xa0 It had been a few months since Spencer started living there, so he prepared for any sudden mist or rain, which was characteristic of the area. \xa0\xa0\xa0 As he traveled through the moor, Spencer decided to take a shortcut, which led him up a steep slope and past a group of trees.\xa0 When he got close to the trees, he noticed a barely audible humming noise that he assumed came from an unseen aircraft above the fog.\xa0 Unexpectedly, something darted past Spencer’s field of vision and he turned to check it out.\xa0 At about 30 feet away, Spencer saw a small green creature that was around four feet tall.\xa0 The creature proceeded speedily through the trees, and the bewildered Spencer shouted “Hey” at it, expecting to figure out its identity.\xa0 In response, the little being turned toward him and waved.\xa0 It was then that Spencer remembered his camera, and he swiftly took it out and photographed the creature.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The creature then continued onward up a slope that led to a quarry at its summit.\xa0 Spencer on impulse followed the peculiar being, curious to find out more about it. As he neared the end of the path, he suddenly froze in astonishment at what appeared in front of him.\xa0 Spencer observed a large silver object that rose from the moor; it looked like two saucers conjoined at the edges with a domed top.\xa0 On top of the dome, there was a white cube with a pattern of holes carved into it.\xa0 Spencer then noticed the humming sound he heard earlier, was coming from the craft, and now blared loudly around him.\xa0 Regrettably, the shock of everything prevented him from capturing a photo before the object disappeared into the sky.

And Dan Aykroyd’s Men In Black Encounter **************************************** The Haunting of Sand Canyon Road (1:42) A night that was supposed to birth memories for four teenagers on their prom night, instead, birthed a haunting urban legend that has existed in the city of Canyon Country since the 1980s. These four teenagers, one girl, and three boys had just left their high school prom and had gone for a drive down one of the many long stretches of road in Canyon Country, CA, known as Sand Canyon drive. The teenagers were headed to an area known as Nike Missile Site LA-94, an area where local teens would often hang out and party. Little did the teenagers know, this would be the last drive they would take as the car would suddenly swerve uncontrollably and would crash into a tree on the corner of Sand Canyon Road and Warm Springs Drive. The only girl in the car was still alive, and would cry for help, but unfortunately, would see her end when no one would arrive. According to the urban legend, some locals claim that the spirit of the girl can be seen around the actual crash site around midnight to 3:00am. The girl would appear to run towards the person who spots her, and request help for her injured friends, her hair flying on all sides, and her face completely ruined. The girl is said to have entirely white eyes, and half her skull is visible around her nose and mouth. Sometimes she is said to even launch at the person as if she is trying to take the person with her. Luckily, in all cases, either the person has escaped in time, or the girl has disappeared into thin air.

However, even though they had followed the exact directions to where the hotel was located on the map, they struggled to find it. Pauline stated that, “This is without a doubt the road that it was on!”. Everyone agreed for the simple fact that they saw the old-fashioned circus posters, still plastered along walls. They followed the map, made several changes to their route, but still had no luck in finding the hotel. This arose the question, “Where could the hotel have gone?”, especially if they were so sure that it was where they were looking.

(14:28) Although Walt passed away in 1966, it is believed that his ghost made its way back to his old apartment in Disneyland to continue watching over the place he cherished the most... but in a much creepier way. SEE THIS STORY VISUALLY ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL: \xa0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7q4qg9rzUo **************************************** Dan Aykroyd\'s Men In Black Encounter (17:36) Just before the cancellation of his TV show Out There, Aykroyd claims that he stepped out of the studio to take a smoke, but ended up taking a call from Britney Spears, who he had starred beside as her father in the film Crossroads. Britney Spears had called him to ask him to appear on Aykroyd’s old show Saturday Night Live with her, and as he talked he says he noticed a mysterious black Ford Sudan pull up on a nearby street. He claimed that he tried to look at the license plate of the vehicle, but it appeared “fuzzy.” Out of the car purportedly stepped two guys, in which one “very tall,” pale man in a black suit had stepped out of the backseat. The tall guy stared right at Aykroyd with a “dirty look.” Aykrord claimed to have looked the other way after noticing this, but when he looked right back after a second later, the mysterious men and the vehicle was no longer there. Aykroyd claims that the car disappeared out of thin air. Two hours after this incident, the producers of the show were told to stop taping, and the show was immediately canceled. Had the show been released, it would have made public an interview with Dr. Steven Greer, of the Disclosure Project, who was about to spill tons of testimony of UFO witnesses and supposed insider information. Unfortunately, no reason was ever disclosed in regards to why the show was canceled.

(We think!) If there indeed is, drapes would cozy up the room and add warmth to the space. Bamboo blinds would work, if they are mounted up high behind the rod with an outside mount. The other option besides panels on either side of the fireplace is doing drapes on the long wall, and using custom Roman shades using the same fabric. If the space between the drapery and the fireplace is too close, you may have to do the Roman shades to match the style of the drapes. \xa0', 'chan_desc': "We want to teach you how to decorate!

Find out why his bold gourmand blend, Love Don’t Be Shy, is  Rihanna’s ride-or-die perfume (it’s sold out in every store around the world!) We also introduce you to the all-time best-seller, Good Girl Gone Bad, a white floral that comes in a Serpentine-embellished, lacquer clutch. Plus, Kilian spills all on his next creation  launching this month – his biggest departure from the 35 existing fragrances he’s created to date. But that’s not all. Last year, Kilian introduced the world to scented lipsticks! Listen to the end to find out whether more perfumed cosmetics are to come… If the name sounds familiar, Kilian Hennessy is indeed of Hennessy ilk. Here, the dapper Frenchman recalls his family’s history starting out in cognac, which led to the LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) empire. Brushes with famous perfumers, intimate details working with a bad boy designer, and the real reason Kilian refused to work for big fragrance companies – whether you love perfume or not, you’ll not want to miss the origin story behind the sleeper label unafraid to make a big statement.

So much so that we felt it was high time to dedicate an entire episode to the topic. And who better to be our guest than Dr. Sandra Lee, aka Dr. Pimple Popper herself!? The dermatologist’s  Youtube videos have gone so viral amongst ‘popaholics’, she even has her own show on TLC. Perhaps you’ve seen one of her live-extraction videos, which have earned up to 46 million views. (Is there such a thing as pimple porn?) Or maybe you’re one of her 3.5 million Instagram followers, who tune in for “exploding lava” and accidentally learn something important about skin in the process. In today’s episode, Dr. Sandra Lee schools us on what you can do in-office and at home to make a visible difference in acneic skin. Then, stay tuned as she sheds some light on how to tackle acne and aging at once. Finally, Dr. Sandra gives us the skinny on what’s in her own beauty cabinet at home. But not before your humble hosts discuss the pro’s majorly accessible skincare line, SLMD Skincare, available at  Target as of this summer. *Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, all products reviewed are gratis media samples submitted for editorial consideration.* \xa0 Hosts: Carlene Higgins and Jill Dunn Theme song, used with permission: Cherry Bomb by Saya\u2028 For any products mentioned in this episode, check out our blog: www.breakingbeautypodcast.com/blog \xa0 Get social with us and let us know what you think of the episode! \u2028www.Instagram.com/breakingbeautypodcast\u2028 www.Twitter.com/BreakingBtyPod\u2028\u2028 Join our private Facebook group\u2028\u2028 Please rate and review us in  Apple Podcasts Produced by Dear Media. | The summer is unofficially over and while we can’t wait to stock our #topshelf for fall, we thought it would be fun to chat about the damn good products that really saw us through the summer of 2019.

With the cultural shift toward body and acne positivity, body hair acceptance is the next frontier in beauty realness. In today’s episode, Carlene and Jill discuss the merits of these latest marketing campaigns that (surprise!) are still trying to sell you a new razor. First we zoom in on Billie, the Serena Williams-backed company that’s leading the charge with its  #projectbodyhair initiative that reinforces the fact that shaving is a choice. We also break down the meaning of the “pink tax” and what some brands are doing to fire back. Next, we take a look at the industry giants duping the indie brands with radically different ads featuring women of all shapes, sizes, ethnicities and skin conditions compared to the svelte, pale and completely hairless models of years past.\xa0 Full disclosure: Carlene and Jill still shave, wax and gadget their way to a hair-free aesthetic (in some body areas, anyway). In this Damn Goods episode, Jill test drives the newest offerings in drugstores, including innovations that promise you can shave up and down, not to mention side-to-side. Meanwhile, Carlene gets down with some chic new safety razors that lean into  zero waste. (Given that two billion plastic razors end up in landfills every year, you’ll definitely think twice next time about ever reaching for a disposable again!) In-grown hairs?

Cotten recreated his role in an adaptation from\xa0The Lux Radio Theatre (originally aired on CBS on April 9, 1951) - a broadcast that retained the iconic and instantly recognizable zither score from Anton Karras. | Using stories from the files of Scotland Yard, writer-director Wyllis Cooper crafted an outstanding and authentically British crime drama with\xa0Whitehall 1212. Each episode followed the dedicated detectives of Scotland Yard as they tracked down and apprehended the guilty. We\'ll hear a pair of episodes: "The Case of Dr. Duncan Allen" (originally aired on NBC on March 9, 1952) and "The Case of Maggie Rawlinson" (originally aired on May 25, 1952). | No matter how baffling the crime appears, no matter how stumped the police may be, master detective Philo Vance will unmask the culprit. Jackson Beck - the man whose booming voice introduced Superman to a generation of radio listeners - stars as S.S. Van Dine\'s brilliant sleuth in three syndicated radio mysteries: "The Movie Murder Case," "The Birdcage Murder Case," and "The Golden Key Murder Case." | Over the course of two radio shows, Brett Halliday\'s Michael Shayne shifted from a happy-go-lucky gumshoe with a lovely secretary and a good rapport with the cops to a burned-out loner who regularly found himself short on money and up to his neck in trouble. Both were great, and this week we\'ll hear episodes from both of the shows. First, Wally Maher is Mike, with Cathy Lewis as Phyllis Knight, in "The Body in the Trunk" (originally aired on Mutual on April 23, 1945) and "Murder, RSVP" (originally aired on Mutual on May 28, 1945). Then, Jeff Chandler stars as Shayne in the syndicated mystery "The Case of the Left-Handed Fan." | When people find themselves in trouble, it only makes sense that they\'d ask a\xa0Saint for help. Vincent Price starred on radio as Leslie Charteris\' "Robin Hood of modern crime" and lent an air of sophistication to crimesolving. We\'ll Simon Templar in a pair of old time radio mysteries: "Tuba or Not Tuba - That Is the Question" (originally aired on NBC on January 21, 1951) and "The Birds and Bees of East Orange" (originally aired on NBC on March 18, 1951). | There was no shortage of private eyes during the Golden Age of Radio, but only one could carry a tune as well as he could crack a case. Dick Powell starred as\xa0Richard Diamond, Private Detective - the gumshoe who cracked wise, packed a punch, and crooned a song to his girlfriend every week. We\'ll hear Powell in three radio mysteries: "The Private Eye Test" (originally aired on NBC on March 19, 1950); "The Hatpin Murder Case" (aka "The Oklahoma Cowboy Murder Case" - originally aired on NBC on September 27, 1950); and "The Red Rose" (originally aired on ABC on March 2, 1951).', 'chan_desc': "Presenting the best detectives from the Golden Age of Radio.

And yet there’s also a danger in drifting too far from the confines of reality. A layered meditation on the fluidity of identity, “A Man Is Not His Song” centers on three people who pushed the limits of persona in their life’s work: Marc Ruskin, an FBI agent who spent over 20 years undercover, juggling 12 different identities as he infiltrated mafia families, drug trafficking circles, and counterfeit money rings; Michael Redhill, a poet, playwright, and author who began writing under the female pseudonym Inger Ash Wolfe at age 40 and found new fame as a mystery novelist; and Jason Beck, an entertainer who adopted the stage name Chilly Gonzales in the late ’90s and soon learned that his outrageous alter ego allowed him to explore forbidden truths in his music and performance.\xa0  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | No matter what form it takes, abuse leaves us indelibly altered, often consumed by an emotional confusion that feels impossible to untangle. In this episode, we hear from three people with firsthand experience of abuse, each speaking from a profoundly different perspective. Rachel Jeffs recounts escaping the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints after years of suffering sexual abuse by her cult leader and father Warren Jeffs, while documentarian Attiya Khan recollects the domestic abuse she endured as a teenager—and the experience of confronting her abuser two decades after breaking free. And in a particularly fraught account, Tom Stranger narrates the night in high school when he raped his then-girlfriend, who later tracked him down as part of her recovery. In sharing their stories with candid detail, these guests ultimately instill us with a more nuanced understanding of abuse, its impact, and the immense possibility for healing.

In this episode, three guests reflect on their life-changing experience with the wind, inviting a new sense of awe for the natural world. A professional storm-chaser known as “the tornado hunter,” Greg Johnson recalls the terror and wonder of getting caught in one of the most monstrous tornados ever recorded. Sailor/adventurer Sara Hastreiter looks back on competing in a nine-month-long race across the planet, and on living at the mercy of the wind’s erratic temperament. And in a poignant merging of story and song, Ojibwe teacher Jacqui Lavalley reveals how the increasingly catastrophic storms of recent years are the Earth’s way of responding to the damage humans have done to our environment.

In “Century,” two voices offer their radically different perspectives on the sensation of time: Centenarian Margaret Shein shares that time speeds by much faster after having lived for an entire\xa0century, while Joy Simmonds details a terrifying car accident where she felt suspended in time and found an odd sense of peace. Adding to the mystery of time’s physicality, geology professor Ulrich Wortmann speaks to certain instances in which the passing of millions of years has left no trace in nature. And in a mind-bending reflection on time and memory, physicist and time-travel researcher Ben Tippett breaks down the very real possibility of future time travel, and explains how the past lives on forever in the space-time continuum.

Guests include transgender advocate and triathlete Chris Mosier (the first known trans athlete to join a U.S. national team different from his birth-assigned gender), immigration activist Angy Rivera (a Colombia native who fled for New York as a child and later founded a groundbreaking advice column for fellow undocumented immigrants), and thespian Lisa Dwan (an Irish stage actress who suffers from debilitating panic attacks and stage fright).

A soothing 10 minute soundscape features chirping birds, wind rustling through trees, and the gentle braying of nearby cattle herds - listen carefully enough and you might even hear David Archer in the distance. Created and mixed by Liza Wallis, a studio manager with The Archers. | Writer, Liz JohnDirector, Gwenda HughesEditor, Jeremy HoweDavid Archer ….. Timothy BentinckRuth Archer …..

Ania SowinskiRuss Jones ….. Andonis James AnthonyLeonard Berry ….. Paul CopleyVince Casey ….. Tony Turner | Ed tells Clarrie that he’s spoken to George about his behaviour towards the bus driver. George has been very mature and has decided to apologise next time he sees the driver. He’s also agreed to help with the cider pressing, though Ed’s had no luck sourcing a new press. Ed gives Clarrie a lift home from the dairy and offers her an apology for being so snappy of late. He knows she’s only trying to help, but he thinks Will needs her support more than he does. Ed wonders if it’s time he found his own place to live.Justin’s concerned that his bid for the abattoir is going to fall short and asks Lilian if she will invest. She says she wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole and hopes Justin’s bid is unsuccessful; Borsetshire needs an abattoir more than it needs office spaces.  At The Bull, David fills Lilian in on their plans for Jill’s birthday celebration. He makes himself scarce when Vince Casey arrives, crowing about his bid. Justin and David are livid to discover Vince’s bid is successful. Vince brags about some inside information he’s acquired. Lilian is certain Vince knows Justin wanted to turn the abattoir into offices. If word gets out, a lot of people will be furious with Justin – including her. | Hannah is exasperated to discover that Neil still hasn’t booked someone with a cherry picker to unblock the gutters. She takes matters into her own hands and starts clearing the leaves herself on a ladder. When she’s finished, Neil scolds her for breaching health and safety regulations. Hannah storms off across the yard and trips on a pothole, bringing the ladder down on top of her. Noticing a cut on her head, Neil insists on taking her to A&E. Hannah phones Justin with her side of the story. Justin blames Neil’s poor management of the grounds for the accident, and says he’ll be watching him carefully for the foreseeable future.Justin tells Brian he’ll be delivering his Crowther’s bid tomorrow. Brian tries to impress upon Justin how much the local farmers are counting on him to prevent the abattoir from getting into the wrong hands.Ian calls in to Willow Cottage and explains to Jennifer and Brian how offended Lexi was by Brian’s offer of money. Jennifer explains that she’s been anxious about Lexi’s commitment since the birth, and is worried about her behaviour spiralling out of control. Ian explains that it’s Jennifer who’s lost control. She decides to apologise to Lexi. | Ed gives Hannah a lift to work. She noticed George mouthing off the bus driver the other day and suggests that he may be struggling with Ed and Emma’s split. She acted the same when her parents separated. At Berrow, Hannah notices a blocked gutter that’s overflowing and ruining the straw. Neil assures her it’s on his to-do list, but Hannah thinks it needs dealing with urgently.Rex and Pip are pleased to hear that Home Farm has agreed to lease them forty acres of land, though voting was close. Neil gives Rex a tip on boosting Basil the boar’s performance. He leaves another pig, Percy, and a sow in a pen next to Basil, to show him how it’s done. Basil isn’t remotely interested.Brian calls in on Lexi. He tells her that Debbie has a contact who works at one of the top hotels in Sofia; perhaps they could sort Lexi a job there? Lexi is touched, though the logistics of relocating to Sofia with her girls will be complicated and pricey. Brian reaches for his chequebook, he’s sure he and Jenny could help with moving costs. Lexi’s mortified: is he trying to pay her off? Does he think she wants to keep Xander? If she wanted to keep the baby, she could have stayed in Bulgaria. Furious, she shows Brian out. | Pip takes Rosie to see Rex and the pigs; she tells Rex she's still struggling to find Rosie a nursery. Rex explains he’s still having trouble with Basil the boar. If he can’t produce any piglets, Rex will end up looking like an amateur to Tom. After their meeting with Phoebe, they share their fears about how Kate will represent their case for Home Farm land to the partnership. Pip reckons it’ll be close.Ed wants to get a move on with the cider pressing, but Clarrie is fussing over Will. He’s pleased to be having a fresh start for himself and Poppy. Ed’s feeling smothered by Clarrie’s constant mothering; they’re not children anymore. Ed and Will work as quickly as possible to be finished in time for Poppy’s birthday tea, but disaster strikes and a key screw from the cider press breaks. The screw’s ancient, possibly Victorian, so it’ll be nigh on impossible to replace. Eddie won’t countenance buying a modern press. Grange Farm cider and the cider club are a ray of hope for the village, so whatever it takes, they’ve got to find a way to get the cider flowing again. | Tracy enjoys a Sunday lunch at Lower Loxley, courtesy of Elizabeth. They discuss how well Freddie’s settling into work at Grey Gables. Talk turns to Christmas preparations and Tracy tells them her plans for murder mystery dinners. She says that Lynda is adamant that she won’t be running a Christmas show this year. Last Christmas really was her swan song. Tracy asks Lily and Russ if they have any marriage plans, and Lily explains Russ is still married to Lara. Lily asks Russ why he hasn’t started divorce proceedings yet, but he avoids her questions.An exhausted Ian is sorting through baby clothes with Helen. He’s feeling slightly insecure after Hilary Noakes asked a tactless question about Xander’s father: with Adam as biological father and Lexi carrying Xander for nine months, he feels as though he’s third in line. Jennifer arrives to collect Alice and Kate’s birthday cards and notices that Ian is feeling emotional. Helen assures Ian that he’s bonding really well with the baby. At Willow Cottage, after a successful party for Kate and Alice, Jennifer relays to Brian her concerns about Ian: she thinks Lexi’s making him anxious. If Lexi were to change her mind, Adam and Ian would be heartbroken. So what are they going to do about it? | Ruth’s furious when Pip oversleeps and she has to cover her milking. Pip tries to lighten the mood with some gossip: Oliver and Tracy were seen having a private dinner together. Ruth feels as though Pip is putting the rewilding project first. What with juggling childcare as well, she should learn to manage her time better. Later, Ruth finds Pip to apologise. Pip’s found a way to juggle rewilding, childcare and Brookfield: they’ll enrol Rosie at a nursery two days a week.Jennifer’s worried sick. She feels as though everyone is ignoring red flags in Lexi’s behaviour: moving out of Honeysuckle Cottage, choosing Kirsty as her birthing partner and now struggling emotionally. She thinks there’s only one way her behaviour’s heading. Lexi arrives at Honeysuckle Cottage to see Adam and Ian. She explains that since she’s given birth she feels surplus to requirements, but they explain they’ve only been distant to give her a bit of space to recover from the birth. Adam actually worries that they’ve taken the baby away from Lexi. Lexi assures them that she’s always viewed the baby as theirs. Now they should arrange to register the birth. Later, Adam and Ian ring Jennifer and Brian to share the name of their new baby: Alexander Macy-Craig, Xander for short. Jennifer thinks it’s perfect, until they point out they’ve named him after Lexi. Jennifer’s convinced Lexi will want to keep Xander. | Rex is keeping a careful eye on Basil the boar. Despite the sows being in heat, Basil’s showing no interest in them. He suggests Toby should be putting more time into childcare. As he seemingly has time to spare, he enlists Toby’s help with Basil. They agree to make his wallow deeper in case he’s too hot. Unfortunately, the wallow works too well, and Basil only drags himself out for food. Rex holds a pig summit at The Bull to determine what’s affecting Basil’s libido. Meanwhile, Toby’s worked out how to ease the childcare pressure on Pip.Vince introduces himself to Justin, who’s practising shooting ahead of pheasant season. Justin isn’t there to play games and refuses to give Vince information about his bid for Crowthers. Vince warns Justin that Casey Meats is looking to expand – he shouldn’t mess with the big boys. Vince does all he can to put Justin off his game, then wishes him luck for shooting season; he’ll need it.With his ego bruised, Justin meets Lilian at The Bull. He suggests she attends another lunch with Vince to do some spying for her. Lilian is appalled by the idea; she thinks Vince Casey is bad news and Justin would do well to pull out of the bid entirely. Bring it on, says Justin. Something tells Lilian she’ll have to deal with the fallout. | Adam and Ian sit up in the night to feed the baby, still in disbelief that they have their own family. Later that morning, Ian is trying to soothe their crying baby without success. Adam takes over when Ian gets arm cramp and the baby immediately stops crying. He must have the magic touch.Roy calls in on Lexi at Ambridge Hall with a bunch of flowers. They go for a walk together and Lexi explains that her head’s all over the place. First she felt totally smothered and now she’s feeling isolated, but doesn’t want to impose on Adam and Ian. Roy hints to Adam and Ian that Lexi might appreciate their company, and they agree to invite her over.Will comes across Ian out walking with the baby. They sit down and discuss the struggles of parenthood. Will tells Ian that the urge to protect your children never goes away: his parents still fuss over him now and he’s thirty six. The chat is affirming for them both. Realising he’d do anything to protect his children, Will realises there’s something he needs to do. Back at Grange Farm, he tells Clarrie and Eddie that he’s resigned from gamekeeping. He can’t protect any of the children if he can’t look after himself. If he ends up in a dark place again, he wants his family closer to hand than a shotgun. Clarrie and Eddie are so proud of him.", 'chan_desc': 'Contemporary drama in a rural setting', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/70/29/5f/70295f99-7c6f-f12c-f0a4-6114834510c1/mza_7959680401475487281.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-09-03'}}

Get it! | There is this myth that it’s frivolous or unproductive to care about how you look. Clothing and fashion get trivialized a lot. But think about who get associated with clothing and fashion: young people, women, queers and people of color — groups of people who historically haven’t had a voice have expressed themselves on their bodies, through their style, their hair, their tattoos, their piercings and what they wear.Articles of Interest is a show about what we wear, created by Avery Trufelman; a six-part series within* 99% Invisible*, looking at clothing. | For the most part, we tend to keep our clothes relatively clean and avoid spills and rips and tears.

If the pockets match the pattern, that’s a good sign, but it’s not everything. Much of understanding an aloha shirt is about paying attention to what is on the shirt itself. It’s about looking at the pattern to see the story it tells.Articles of Interest is a show about what we wear, created by Avery Trufelman; a six-part series from 99% Invisible, looking at clothing. | Womenswear is littered with fake pockets that don’t open, or shallow pockets that can hardly hold more than a paperclip.

Rod explains how he first became interested in wine, and what led him to found his own winery in the late 1970s. He also discusses how he met winemaker Joe Swan, who would eventually become his father-in-law. Rod conveys how Joe in many ways stood apart from his California winermaking contemporaries of the 1970s and 1980s, making choices influenced by the changes Joe had seen in Burgundy, France. Those included the use of French oak barrels, an increasing interest in whole cluster, and a focus on low yields from the vineyard. As Rod explains it, Joe\'s approach to winemaking was a simple one, but he also took seriously the goal of making great wines of limited production. This extended to Joe\'s approach to Zinfandel, which he made with an eye to high quality, rather than assuming the grape variety had to have a bulk wine destiny. Rod touches on some of the other people that influenced Joe\'s vision of wine, including André Tchelistcheff, Jacques Seysses, and Kermit Lynch. This episode also features a clip from IDTT episode 460, wherein Joel Peterson speaks about his experiences working with Joe Swan in the 1970s. As the interview progresses, Rod details the changes he has made at the winery and in the vineyard since Joe Swan passed away, explaining the logic of each adjustment. This conversation also touches on topics like the "Swan clone," extended maceration, whole cluster use, tannin management, malolactic conversion for Chardonnay, the specifics of growing grapes in the Russian River Valley, and the makeup of old Zinfandel vineyards. Those wanting to understand the transition of California winemaking practice from the 1960s to now will benefit tremendously from hearing this episode.

When addressing topics like botrytis, the nature of a fermentation, brettanomyces, sulphur dose, lees contact, reduction, and tannin management, Tomoko compares and contrasts the approaches in Germany with those in Burgundy. By doing so, she explains both at a deep level. Tomoko also describes how winemaking in Germany and in Burgundy have evolved in the years that she has been making wine. For example, she describes the embrace of infusion instead of extraction in the red winemaking of Burgundy, and why it may be so common today. Those looking to better understand the character of German wine and Burgundy will find a lot of revelatory information in this interview.

This one’s a nocturnal mix.. ‘nocturne’ from wikipedia: “The name nocturne was first applied to pieces in the 18th century, when it indicated an ensemble piece in several movements, normally played for an evening party and then laid aside.” Like Ray Charles sang, “night time is the right time.” I dedicate this to ‘Bill‘ and everyone I’ve had the pleasure of exchanging a mixtape with throughout the years.

News Feed 0:43 is not the same without the UPS delivery and the dogs. 0:48 Were like all right, cut it 0:50 off. It was ok. back at it. 1:05 Alright everyone, it is Episode 221 of bourbon pursuit. I\'m one of your hosts Kenny. And as usual, we got a little bit of news to run through. The 2019 bourbon Hall of Fame induction ceremony was two weeks ago, and I completely forgot to give them a shout out here on the podcast. But congratulations to Peggy know Stevens, Larry cast Wes Henderson and Evan Cole\'s mean on all their accomplishments. If you\'re interested to hear their stories and their appearances on the podcast, you can go back and listen to episode six 153 157 167 173 181 198 and 204. I guess we\'ve been covering a lot of these people throughout the years. I\'m glad to see that or be able to bring those stories to light. A new story was on a local level new station here last week. And it talked about a new bourbon where house being erected in Jefferson town, which is a part of the local area. But this one\'s quite different. You may remember us talking to music construction back on episode 137. And how their proprietary wrecking system is used in a lot of places that we see on the bourbon trail. But we\'re now also seeing a lot of palette ties warehouse is becoming increasingly more common because of lowering costs. Well, this new warehouse that has been planned is made of shipping containers. The developer wants to stack shipping containers six stories high and these plans were filed with the local Metro government. But at this time no bourbon distiller has been mentioned for the project. So who knows what this could end up being like because of air flow and other factors that plan that are in place. But the video news stories can be found with the link in our show notes. We talked a lot about the culture that builds around bourbon and the online community is a huge portion of that. Reddit, which is the biggest message board that\'s out there today has now surpassed 100,000 members in the our bourbon forum. We recently interviewed one of the Reddit mods for an upcoming podcast, which will air here in the next few months. We\'re continually moving forward with single barrel offerings that we want to have for our Patreon community. And the newest one that we are ready to announce is that we\'ve been allocated a barrel of Eagle rare will be working through the process of nailing down a date and we will select eight Patreon community members to join us as we go to choose a barrel.

Now today\'s podcast is all about barrel bourbon, we had trip and Joe back on episode 164. But it\'s time that we get an update from what\'s happening with this team. They\'ve been winning all kinds of awards. But we want to talk more about what they\'re doing inside these walls. We talked about the flavors that they\'re pulling from different states of distillation and how that goes into the blend, as well as about hearing their newest release of the valid American single malt. We\'ve been talking about some of the greats we all have with the TTP, we take another stab at talking about online sales. And then we look at the future with new offerings. And of course looking at their new future dovetail offering. Now before you hear from Joe and the podcast, you get to also hear from him before above the char with Fred medic. So with that, let\'s get on with the show. 4:58 Hi, this is Joe from barrell bourbon. Bourbons have won a few medals, some of the most prestigious spirits competitions out there. But don\'t take their word for it. Find out for yourself, lift your spirits with barrel bourbon. 5:10 I\'m Fred Minnick. And this is above the char. I often solicit ideas from listeners for above the char. This idea comes from Don Knotts. And Don is a longtime listener. And I really appreciate this idea, because it\'s one I\'ve actually done a lot of research on, and I\'m quite fascinated with it. And that\'s kind of the short history of barrel proof Bourbons. Have they always been this popular? And the answer is no. Now in the 1800s, they would actually advertise themselves as barrel strength or barrel proof. Or some would even say that they were fireproof meaning that they would catch on fire. And so that the proof in the 1800s was a way of advertising the fact that they were pure, they were real whiskey versus being adult rated with like prune juice, or water or tobacco spit or whatever the rectifier is a whole sellers were doing. And so barrel proof in the 1800s meant something entirely different. Now we kind of lose track of this barrel proof subject during Prohibition, and hundred proof kind of becomes the standard. And we don\'t really reset in terms of what has been bottled until the 1930s, specifically 1935 to 1942, really. And you would find some brands who are trying to market themselves as barrel proof or what they would refer to as barrel whiskey. Weller was one that probably did it the best, and they were going in the barrel at a very low entry proof, and it was coming out 108 212 proof. And in fact, the barrel entry proof up until like 1962 was 110. So the barrel strength bourbon coming out prior to 1962 would have been between 108 and 112. But we don\'t really see the explosion or interest of barrel proof bourbon until really the last 1015 years. But there\'s one brand we can point toward as being the most important for leading this trend, and that is Booker\'s. Booker\'s comes out in 1987, and was really the first to push the barrel proof conversation in American households. And you had Booker know going around the country, saying that you don\'t want to drink too much of this because it\'ll knock you back. Now the truth is that we don\'t really market it for like its strength for alcohol purposes. Today, we market it for the flavor intensity. And that\'s kind of where we are right now with American whiskey is we\'re looking at things in terms of how they taste, and people think that they find more flavor in the barrel proof products. But here\'s the thing. Don\'t be fooled ruled by the flavor necessarily, that high alcohol can actually mask a lot of flaws. That\'s why distilleries will cut the alcohol down to 40 proof to see if they find any flaws in the distillate or the barrel whiskey. So if you think you really like a barrel proof product, add a bunch of water, tastes it again, and see if it still has some of those characteristics that you like. Just because it\'s high in alcohol, doesn\'t mean it\'s good. And that\'s this week\'s above the char Hey, if you have an idea, like Don did for about the char hit me up on Twitter, or Instagram at Fred Minnick, that\'s at Fred Minnick. Until next week, cheers. 8:44 Welcome everybody to another episode of bourbon pursuit, the official podcast of bourbon and we\'re down here at down bourbon bar in Louisville, Kentucky, once again, we\'re gonna be talking about, you know, barrel bourbon, and they do more than just Kentucky, right? They update, they bring stocks from last different places. And their whole goal is to blend something that\'s truly unique and different. And it\'s never going to be replicated again. So each batches is like that. 9:08 Yep. So it\'s funny. Joe and I were talking before about people in Kentucky are laser focused on Kentucky only. And we were kind of guilty of that, as well. And we had our blinders on and, and then, with Barrow, they, you know, they\'re introducing a lot of stuff to the market. And you\'re like, Okay, this is actually good. And where\'s this coming from? Where else were you know, so it\'s like, I don\'t know, they brought a lot of stuff that I never thought I would enjoy. But I really enjoy 9:36 the offerings. They really do. I mean, even at the even the single barrel program that they offer, it\'s it\'s something that most people, if it was just anything else, they might stub their nose at it, but barrel is bringing out some killer barrels that are coming through their single barrel program. And you know, most of them are all distilled in Tennessee. And that\'s one of the things that I think it\'s starting to change those people\'s minds of really what else out there and they\'re kind of on the forefront of it. 10:02 Yeah. And even inspired us to start our own brands. So thank you guys. 10:06 For the catalyst. And not only that, thank you for these killer dog toys. If you haven\'t seen these are barrel bourbon, dog toys. Yeah, they\'re awesome beer. We always love having them they bring booze and now 10:20 I can\'t wait till next time. 10:22 So let\'s go ahead and introduce our guest today. So today we have the founder of barrell bourbon as well as the master distiller barrel bourbon barrel bourbon. So we\'ve got Joe Beatrice and Tripp Stimson. So guys, welcome back to the show. Thank you for having us. So last time you were on was Episode 164. So Been a while now. And I would imagine that your next certain because you\'re carrying around all these gold medals that you\'re getting at all these competitions? 10:48 A little bit. Yeah, but it looks really good. And we go out 10:51 a little flavor. We were a lot of them. Yeah. 10:55 But it means like that Michael Phelps and bourbon. Yeah, got it kinda 10:59 kinda. How many? What did you come away with from from San Francisco this past year, because it was a lot 11:04 of this year, we won. I think it\'s three gold medals and three double golds. And we also we also picked up the best small batch bourbon over 10 years old and worn. 11:20 That\'s impressive. Who gets keep the mo 11:23 hasn\'t been the case in the display case. Yeah. 11:26 This is your week. This is not Yeah. 11:30 So before we start talking about more of the whiskey and some of that kind of things that gets people again, just a reminder, a little bit of your background and sort of where this all built out of because maybe they\'re not good stewards yet and haven\'t listened to Episode 164. But or every episode 11:45 or every barrel introduces right on above the char. 11:49 Yeah, I 11:50 should, I should have said that. It said, we\'re here with our good friend, Joe. Because I say that every single week. I said, listen to our good friend Joe from barrel bourbon. 11:56 He\'s our good friend because he pays us. 12:00 So I was going for Yeah, yeah. Well, we started this. We started the company. It\'s now it\'s stick around our six year and we\'ve just been growing in leaps and bounds. This since we\'ve seen you we have I had to make a list and had to write it down because it\'s too much because it was too much I was we\'re we\'ve been really busy. We\'ve done when we were here last time, we did our first release of the infinite barrel project. And since then, we\'ve done 10 bottlings of it and just just remind you, the way that works is we started out by blending a large amount of whiskey. And then every time we bottle, we replace that whiskey. So right now there\'s, there are these whiskies from five countries and almost 40 different. I think it\'s 40 at this point, different distilleries, a product that\'s in there. We were going to talk a little bit about I guess later about dovetail which is which is our one of our new releases. We just finished our third bottling of that. We\'re in the middle of that. And we let\'s see, we did three barrel craft spirits products, which was a whiskey of bourbon and a rum. We did 12345 batch releases a new year. Oh gosh. About 250 single barrels and release of Canadian single barrel right, so 13:22 so you haven\'t been really that busy at all. Just relaxing 13:25 on the beach. playing golf, it just blends 13:29 and dumps itself 13:30 right around around golf carts and Northern Coleman. Yeah. 13:35 I don\'t have a golf yet. It comes 13:39 to the house. 13:42 So trip, what about you. So what\'s what\'s your car about a little more about your role and everything that you\'re doing behind the scenes here. 13:49 So I\'m basically over everything that\'s operations. Bringing barrels in dumping barrels, putting blends together. I\'ll pull samples from all the different groupings and going the lab put blends together. and gentlemen, I\'ll sit around and taste all the different blends, make decisions on what barrels go with each other to create those blends. You name it. I\'m involved in just about everything. 14:19 So the blends start with you or Joe, 14:21 like what is going in the blends just kind of it\'s a conversation. We know we\'re going to do something we talk about what we have. We fill in the gaps with things that we need. We only we ask each other question, what do you think it needs. And then we go back to our stockpile of barrels and say, well, in the past, we\'ve had good luck with these particular flavors that we\'re looking for in this particular warehouse from this particular distillery. So then we\'ll bring those in, and we\'ll try it small scale first. If we like it, then we\'ll scale it up. And we\'ll scale it up step wise, to make sure we don\'t go too far. And it gives us room to kind of go back and forth a little bit toward the end, to make sure we we really hit it on the head. 15:03 It sounds like not to bring up another distillery. But we, when we do the Maker\'s Mark, you know, different states to do your own single barrel, it sounds like us, we go in and we\'re like, All right, we\'re gonna do all these different ones, and we\'re going to make our own barrel or whatever. And then you go back and realize that we should just start with something that somebody else did and work away from there, you know, because they have good flavors. So it sounds like a lot like that process for you all 15:27 it is. And it\'s a very tedious process, it\'s a 15:32 lot of time spent tasting different things walking away coming back. Again, like we talked about last time, Joe and I have similar palettes, but we\'re hypersensitive to different things that we may or may not like. So it works very well, when we have the conversation about putting our blends together because I may not get something that Joe gets, or I may taste something that joke doesn\'t. And we kind of we take each other\'s word on that and and just keep on pushing forward. Or you take that 16:00 I\'m going to say are you tasting every barrel that\'s walking through this door as well? Because I know that you you\'re blending on a pretty large scale. So it\'s Are you like, Okay, well, these barrels represent this lot, and it should have some sort of similar profile. Are you are you really going through and sampling them all out? 16:14 We have, we have to look at him his lot, to some degree, because to taste every single barrel, I mean, we\'d never leave, right? So we we spent enough time doing this, some people would think that\'s really a bad thing. You know, you get to stay there all day and just 16:28 drink whiskey. 16:29 We didn\'t get I guess it\'s one thing when you work in it versus actually doing it. It\'s 16:34 always hard and fast. So I mean, sometimes sometimes there is a lot of variation in a particular group of barrels. And sometimes there\'s not as much every barrel is unique, but it really depends on on what we on what we\'re doing. You know, it\'s sometimes we have tastes more than others. But I 16:47 would say the single barrels we do, we do handpick those. Yeah. But the batches we we try to rely on past experiences from the different distilleries, locations and put the blends good. 17:01 You know, it\'s a little bit different. As you know, we actually start with what we\'ve started the whiteboard is a clean slate, we, once it\'s once something is done and packed up, we\'ve been involved we we start with what are we going to do next? And then you know, the The first thing is, we come up with maybe a concept, you know, what is it that we want? What are we going for, we\'re looking for, what do we like about the last one that we make, we can tease out more and replicate. And that\'s really the starting point. And and you know, and then sort then the hunt is on between trying to find things that actually deliver that. But we spend, we can spend 17:34 two weeks a month on one particular blend, it\'s we have multiple projects going simultaneously at any given time. So 17:40 what are some things like he said that some things that trip likes that Joe doesn\'t and vice versa? What are some of those different flavors that you might like that Joe doesn\'t like for example, Katie and I, when we go pick our pursuit series, I know Kenny\'s searching for tannins, oak. And I\'m like, let\'s stay away from those. I want more of the sweet kind of flavor. So what are those between YouTube and new Trump\'s? You? 18:04 know, there\'s never never it\'s always we always agree 100% on we\'re doing or it doesn\'t get the bottom. But 18:11 I think a lot of the differences that we talk about is it\'s not more of what we like and don\'t like, I think it\'s what we\'re sensitive to so certain stringency, these chemical notes. You know, if there are any certain off notes, like, especially in some of the new make stuff, I\'m really hypersensitive to like a mildew note. So it\'s things like that. It\'s not that we like things that the other does. And it\'s the hypersensitivity to the different aromas and flavors that might be in there. Gotcha. 18:45 Well, what are those some of those aromas that you guys are really going for when you\'re when you\'re creating the blend? I mean, you said you start with a clean slate, but I mean, there\'s gotta be something you\'re like, Okay, like, dark cherries, or chocolate? Or, I don\'t know, carrot cake, like I don\'t know, like what\'s like what\'s like what\'s 19:01 marzipan, 19:02 bread, bread, bread pudding, marzipan, and the new all like the same sentence? 19:09 It\'s true. Well, I think one of things we really like our tropical fruit notes, juicy fruit, dragon fruit flavors, we love I love those. We love those. We love those. Anytime we can win him we can blend to that, will will just stop sometimes. And that\'s one of the reasons that badge 18 is is where it is in the sequence is that we blended that actually last winter, we bonded A long time ago. And it was a relatively small batch. But I love the story. Because as we were blending it, we were we were strips that we step our way up to the volume, like, we come up with the theoretical in the lab, and then we try to replicate it with the barrels. And as we do that, we we taste we stopped and we taste. And this one, we both at the same time said we cannot not add one more battle. And it was maybe two thirds of what we wanted. And we just stopped. Because it was exactly we had those super sweet notes at them in the middle palette of it. We just love that. We I think we look for a balance of the tannins and the grain. And I mean, that\'s, that\'s all really important. Balance is really key to us. We don\'t we try to make it as balanced as we possibly can 20:12 balance but without basically recreating the same thing over and over. So, I mean, there\'s, there\'s, there\'s got to be a lot of barrel junkies that are out there. And have you been able to say like, Okay, well, I think, you know, when we did barrel batch or bourbon barrel batch 12, like that might be pretty close to 16. Or you think like they\'re, they\'re all just worlds apart, 20:35 I think you\'re going to find some similarities in in all of them. Because you know, there\'s a, there\'s a, there\'s a grouping that we like, you know, we talk about complexity, we talk about fruit and flora, we talk about, you know, open battle, and all these different flavors that are out there. And all of those are going to mingle in different concentrations in all of our batches to some degree. So while some may be not day difference, I think you\'re going to be able to find some of those flavors in most of the batches. I would say something like maybe 12 or 14 is going to be a more traditional representation, which is going to be you know, an oak forward. traditional style bourbon, there\'s not a ton of fruit, there\'s not a ton of floral, whereas something like you know, back way back seven be was just loaded with that for floral note. So I think it Yes, the there are differences, but there are lots of similarities as well. 21:38 So when you\'re like making a blend, and you\'re trying to get those different flavor notes that you\'re looking for, how many barrels of a certain type of whiskey to make to get to that flavor. Like is it 21:50 such good? Or? Well, that\'s a really good question. It could be one yeah, it has to hit the threshold perception threshold of those particular compounds you\'re tasting. And sometimes one barrel will make all the difference. And that\'s it. Yeah, yeah. It\'s pretty incredible. Yeah, I kind of liked this live thing I can get. I\'m getting instructions sent to me is ongoing. 22:12 dining room table, and we\'re live at Kenny\'s dining room table, we get ups man and you know, and barking dogs. That\'s true. News Feed is not 22:20 the same without the UPS delivery and the dogs. 22:23 were like, all right, cut it 22:26 off it. Okay. Got it. 22:30 Alright, so I guess back on topic now. So, you know, we we had the opportunity to getting a batch 17 and it was awesome. It was really I mean, it was out of this world as one of my favorite whiskeys of the probably the past few months. And now is 18 getting ready to come out. Is this released? what\'s what\'s the time Yeah, we\'re sold out. 22:50 We\'re sold on 19 is gone. We\'re 19 is almost gone. And we\'re teeing up 24 next month 22:58 Yeah, it\'s so you\'re running through the pretty 23:00 quick. We do about four releases a year yeah, for batch releases a year and then a and then the new year so it\'s really fine. Fine Bourbons give or take 23:09 Yeah, that\'s fine but sold out to it\'s it\'s available it\'s just it\'s all been allocated yeah right we still find it 23:17 right we don\'t have any money so that means we don\'t have any more with the distribute we\'ve sold everything to distributor and then distributor now is pushing that means you\'ve gotten your check and you\'ve been paying 23:28 like yeah, you want to make sure that it\'s it\'s not sitting on shelves either right? You got to make sure you\'re still out there and doing your marketing and 23:35 we have two customers we have a customer we sell the distributor and then we have the the end customer who\'s in there so our sales are concerned with our distributor customer I\'m concerned with you standing in the shelf or in the bar buying the product that\'s that\'s where we look at the world for sure. Yeah. 23:49 So talk about like the blends themselves because I know that a lot of these you\'re doing a lot of I don\'t know, tri state the way to really put it you know, you\'re doing some Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana. what\'s what\'s sort of like your ratio when you\'re when you\'re looking at these because, you know, is it is it you know, 35% Kentucky I\'m sure it\'s different here and there. But like where where do you start at? Because there\'s got to be at by now. You got to have some sort of formula that you think in your head like okay, we know this is where we should start. How about you? 24:22 What\'s your Nashville? 24:24 Well, we stopped in the Nashville because we couldn\'t do the math on it anymore. Because there\'s different Bourbons, different Nashville\'s in from different states or Nashville\'s and then what percentage of those barrels and it was getting me know 27.2% it was was just the math was too hard, that we really truly don\'t have a starting point where it really the barrels lead us through at the barrels lead us into into what we what makes sense. And sometimes it will be more Indiana forward, but a lot of times it\'s Kentucky, it\'s Tennessee forward. And and then a lot of times we it\'s surprisingly, sometimes it\'s only, you know, 10% of 20% of a particular a particular group that makes that influence. So they really, do we have no real standard or no blueprint that we start with, we really do let the barrels lead us to the answer. 25:09 So in your opinion, when you\'re tasting each one of these different regions, different kinds of Bourbons, what are the notes that you\'re pulling out? Like if you\'re tasting something from Indiana vs. Tennessee vs. Kentucky? Do you? Do you think like where the distiller you\'re pulling from each has their own uniqueness to it? Or is it based by state like what what do you what do you kind of see that as 25:32 I think we have, let\'s back up and look at it from kind of the production standpoint where you have one, we\'re all in this same sort of region where we actually get four seasons, which is very beneficial for us. And then look at the different distilleries that are going to use different yeast strains with different grain bills to create these different flavors. And then you stretch those out in warehouses to say, Northern Kentucky, down into southern Tennessee, and you\'re going to see variations of flavor development across that region. So then being able to go in and say, you know, I\'d like to get a spicy bourbon from Indiana, or I want to get a fruity or bourbon from Tennessee. I think you\'re able to do that. Because of the different again, you strain Nashville and then the difference in the warehousing. maturation. 26:36 Well, you know, the next question people want to know is where are you getting these barrels? 26:40 We go to the barrel store barrel get in place. 26:44 I mean, let me throw something I mean, if you want to go down this road, something completely different than we\'re working on speaking of different states, is we\'re about to blend a total different product and American valid multi product, which is so there are a lot of incredible American single malt produces in the United States. can\'t call it scotch. Because I mean in Scotland, and there isn\'t even really a category for for malt. It\'s either malt whiskey, which malt whiskey technically has to be a new barrels. And a lot of times the mall producers want to put it in US barrels. So we\'re going to be working with six or eight distilleries. We are we are working with six or eight distilleries from around the country. Arizona, New Mexico, Washington, New York, Texas. I think I may be missing one or two. And so we\'re getting barrels from all over the country. And we blending those. So you\'re going to see some real incredible regional differences. We when we when we put this together. That\'s going to be that\'s one of the next projects we\'re working on. That\'s 27:44 what makes up a malt American malt whiskey. Like, like somebody doesn\'t know. AK me? Yeah. 27:51 makes an American malt whiskey. 27:53 You want to do this? It\'s it\'s, it\'s it\'s multi barley. Okay. And so it\'s generally majority is multi barley. And there\'s and sometimes there\'s some corn in there. But for the most part, it\'s distilled malt, the single malt multiplies the 28:09 primary grain I got. Yeah. 28:11 Okay, great. So this is a little bit different than bourbon. Sure. 28:13 And there\'s some, there\'s a group that\'s actually lobbying, to the TTP trying to get a multi category to create something create something for us. us being the distillers. 28:26 What is it that you like about the malt that\'s going to, I guess, fit the barrel profile or blends or whatever? 28:32 Well, it\'s, um, 28:34 yeah, I was like, Can this compete with, you know, Forbes whiskey of the year as well? Like, how many medals can this one? 28:40 I don\'t know. I don\'t know. That\'s, that\'s sort of a nice, it\'s a nice accolade. We don\'t it\'s not our, our gold. You know, we really we love hearing other people talk about our products and, but the goal is to really is to make a product that people really love to drink. I don\'t know. I mean, this hasn\'t been done before. You know, but but it the inspiration of it was we we taste a lot of whiskies in and we know a lot of producers and and there is just an incredible amount of really high quality single malt produced in the United States, and they\'re relatively unknown. I shouldn\'t say that, I mean, of course, it\'s about colonies or by knows them and then there\'s less than a Reno\'s those guys, but there are a lot when you start getting into the smaller ones are a lot of people don\'t know. So we really wanted to bring that we want to bring that out. And, you know, and, and, and, and take our cut out, which is to take some of these great products, I mean, the world is our ingredients, and well as our pantry and take them and blend them together into something you know, even greater than the parts we hope will say 29:40 I want to say you keep going down this path and we were you know what, we\'ll talk about dovetail in a second because you were talking about all the TTV different categories like it seems like you\'re you\'re trying to make their job harder by making them just create new categories just for you like blending everything from here and there. 29:55 We\'re trying to make the job easier if they just go along. 30:01 Well, the difference the valid the valid Malden the malt whiskey is sort of a different, it\'s a different it\'s a different problem because there just isn\'t a category for what they want to produce, which is a a straight malt whiskey that is does not have to go into a new barrel. Because most scotch of all scotch is in us barrels. And there are different properties, different characteristics. And we\'re doing with this valid project we\'re doing a combination of whiskey that went into new barrels and whiskey went into us barrels previously as us barrels. But that aside, the whiskey category is is the one that was the category is sort of an really unusual one. because traditionally, a blended whiskey has can have 20% grand neutral spirit in it. So it\'s a category that\'s just that it was it was really looked down on a blended whiskey category. Our whiskies every one of our whiskeys is 100% whiskey, so 31:03 we\'re not doing Seagram seven and seven we\'re not 31:07 we\'re not putting brand new show spirits and and whiskey together hollering and all and go food 31:12 but we do 31:13 not you do you really awesome food coloring 31:16 speaking of blended way I found I went to state sale the other day and got a bottle of it\'s called golden wedding is like from the 30s or some wild and it was a blended whiskey but I was like all this is gonna be great I\'m just in it was terrible. You could tell us neutral grain spirits with like, like brown died and it was on 31:35 the ground the Beatles Yeah, exactly. That was an ingredient of bourbon in the know it Yeah. In the early 1900s and it tasted 31:42 worse than that. I wish it was it was 31:44 color these kind of people he\'s Crisco to little bit but but so the dovetail is I think the dovetail is a really is an interesting project. Originally it was going to be our whiskey number six and so and what\'s in it, that was the name of that was the original idea. Well we have a series of whiskeys, we are barrel whiskey, and we do them in batches just like the bourbon so it was okay, this is the next one and and what it what\'s in this product is 11 year old Indiana whiskey that we finished in done vineyards Cabernet barrels done vineyards is is really incredible Napa Valley, hundred year old family vineyard. And they make an incredible, rich lush camber of Cabernet. And so we got the barrels and we and we finished that whiskey and then we took some Tennessee bourbon and finish some of it in in in rum casks. So our rum casks. We bring rum in from different countries usually comes in in a steel container because the barrels will leak over the place. We put it in x bourbon barrels. And then when we\'re finished, we dump it out and we take those x bourbon barrels that had rum in it and finish some bourbon in it for this product. We also have some special bourbon finishing late vintage board pipes. So there\'s a combination of different whiskeys in here with different finishes different proportions, we blended it, and sent the label off to the TTP and six months later. 33:14 And for everybody at home, this is what we\'re talking about the dope. 33:17 So what\'s what\'s the is we call it whiskey is a what\'s the category that this is followed. And so 33:22 this is technically a distilled spirits specialty, okay, which is in the same category that you can have bubblegum flavored vodka, and you could have 100% whiskey, so it\'s a little bit it\'s a little bit, it\'s a little bit of an odd category, 33:35 but it\'s fine that you have that because this is like the one product that I see like people are like this is actually really good. Like you\'ve got to go out and get some and I\'m trying it right now and yeah, I\'m kind of floored like how really good it is. I mean you get you get those Bubble 33:50 Bubble Gum notes you get some 33:53 grape airhead you know those like to you come you come as a kid, you know, there\'s like, driven sort of like fruit by the foot. You know, like, 34:03 like you said, You love those Juicy Fruit kind of that this is like 34:06 get those know that we\'re happy to get those sugary kind 34:09 of great notes. So, 34:10 yeah, we want to bring you back to your childhood. That\'s what we\'re 34:13 I do I try to take everything I\'ve had in my childhood. I\'m like, all right, I taste this and that or whatever. So it totally reminds me of that 34:20 is one thing that you know, you just kind of kind of just piqued my interest a little bit when you were talking about like all these different barrels and all these different things you\'re doing you could almost open up like your own like week long vacation where bourbon nerd to come in. And they could just like, just pay you to be there for a week. And they could just sit there and just play around and experiment with everything and try to like make their own sort of crazy blend. I mean, because this was I gotta ask like how you 34:45 you got to this 34:47 idea that we should blend these two together? 34:49 Yeah, why didn\'t you stop at the the Indian thing is Evelyn in the Cabernet. Is it because like oh, that\'s been done whatever. Yeah, once I\'m finished barrels, they\'re like so passe like everybody doesn\'t know 35:02 what we try we are always trying to try different new things. But we have these meetings where we all get together every every every month two months probably and we just brainstorm ideas what what is what is the most crazy thing we can do? What\'s the nice little story about the tale of two islands 35:20 so that was that was a meeting where we sit down and we needed some what we what we call it one off projects that we like to work on. And we knew that we wanted to use some of our leftover Jamaican rum from batch one and we want to do a finish so you know what we were going to do and we had like 20 samples set up in front of us and and what do we want to do this texture that finish and at the very end there was a blend of the rum with some scotch and we thought there\'s no way this is going to taste good. And it was one we liked the best so we put that in a bottle and called it tale of two islands and it was it was phenomenal so you\'re blending scotch now to 36:11 we do we do we do have we do blend scotch and infinite barrel we an Irish Whiskey Yeah. But these are those casks are 36:21 on but the those cat what I love about those casks is 36:27 it\'s a Kentucky distillery. So I can\'t say that which one 36:33 went to great distillery which I can\'t say that when we get the barrels 36:40 with both their names on there Why do you think that is like in the sourcing like I would think they would want to want to know like or want to be able to tell like hey this came from us like what why do you think they do that? 36:51 Well I think there\'s there\'s a lot of reasons why people do it but but part of it is they\'re protecting their trademark so in other words they wouldn\'t want us capitalize on their trademark so if we you know pick any pick any Kentucky this is already and if we username they would sue us you know, 37:09 federal bourbon brought to you by XYZ 37:13 and you know, Kentucky is a litigious state so it\'s sort of 37:16 Yeah, I agree. But I mean this is this is a fantastic blend like this is the first time that I\'ve tried it and and it\'s definitely something that I was just kind of like Wow, I didn\'t 37:27 expect it this is the first like whiskey blend or whatever category it is you want to call it that I could eat this with a rebel most like it would go perfect yeah big fatty steak or even a dessert 37:41 yeah or just like a dessert kind of finished like 37:44 every day like really is you can taste it in like current bonds Nixon was big bowl cabs I like 37:49 I\'m glad you like it you can you can pairs with so many movies tomorrow night. I\'m like bottle 37:57 coffee 37:58 in your flask. Yeah, just part of the at the table there. 38:02 So what\'s what\'s next I just got I just got an I should clarify one point which when we when we do our brainstorming it\'s it\'s the company it\'s we all get together it\'s not just we spend too much time together anyway just doing stuff 38:16 in the company now. 38:19 Let\'s see 999 people 38:23 did you when you started Did you envision it getting this big do you envision getting bigger?

Like what are you happy with where it\'s at? I mean, kind of talk about from a business standpoint. 41:03 We\'re happy with the growth. 41:06 I we\'re ambitious we want to be we want to be as big as we can grow. We\'re very happy with the control growth we\'ve been having. We\'ve been doubling every year and and we\'re it\'s where we\'re on track. We\'re absolutely on track to where we want to be. 41:21 How tough is it to like, I think you said you\'re like 100% up from last year? What are some of the challenges that you faced, like, I guess going from, you know, experiencing as much growth because like, for me a 20% growth is like chaos. In my biz I couldn\'t imagine doing like 100% growth. It still talks about some of the challenges or hurdles that you face doing that? 41:42 Well, we\'ve been, we\'ve been planning for business perspective, we\'ve been really planning on this appointment, we have 10 people in the company. Somebody 41:51 somebody just 41:54 got the list 41:56 getting fired up. 42:00 Nine tomorrow, I keep getting texts like that. 42:03 It\'s just in. 42:06 But But to answer your question. 42:09 We\'re we spent a lot of time planning, we we plan our releases, we plan our production schedule, we we we account for growth within that. And so it\'s so a lot of it is logistics planning, getting the barrels to the right place at the right time getting the bottles, the corks, all that stuff, making sure that everything is everything is is lined up and correct. And we and we plan for our goals, which are which we\'ve been pretty close. We\'ve been we\'ve been hitting our goals and exceeded our goals. So we\'re already anticipating that growth. So we\'re we\'ve factored that into into everything that we do, you know, you\'ve been selling through your batches very, very quickly. And our distributors sitting there knocking your door like Joe, we\'re ready for the next one, like Hurry up, when\'s it coming? When\'s it coming? That\'s such a complicated business. It\'s incredible, because well, first of distributor is sort of a generic term, we, we\'ve put together a network of distributors across country, where with a couple of that we\'re in more than one state. But for the most part, we\'ve been very careful about who we align with, because they have that they have to be the right size, we don\'t want to be too big. So we asked them to them, we don\'t want them to be too small, because they won\'t have the capital to buy the products that we need. So it\'s it\'s a very, it\'s a very, it\'s not such a straight line. And some are better than others, some are better others are planning and some will, will are right on top of the releases and others they need a monthly call to say by the way that you put your purchase order in and then it\'s not. It\'s not usually because they don\'t want to it\'s because they\'re they have a lot of products and they\'re they\'re torn a lot of different directions. But it\'s it\'s a very, you know, it\'s that whole aspect of the business is just it\'s just different. It\'s different from any other business. Because you have it\'s like you\'re dealing with 50 different countries. Every state has its own laws, is it is the federal there, but every state, every state can Trump it. And then you\'ve got 13 control states, which, which are all entirely different. And they\'re all government state run. But each one of those has different regulations rules. So it\'s and then you have what\'s called franchise states, which are states that you make an agreement with a distributor, and you can never leave. No matter what the contracts are about. 44:26 This is not fun. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz you gotta be careful. Yeah, you partner with somebody and they kind of screw you over. And you\'re, you\'re you\'re stuck, right? You\'re contracted in for X amount of 44:35 time we\'ve been we\'ve had good relationships. Yeah. Because our products are selling and so there\'s, they do well, and then they\'re happy. But if you don\'t do well, then they\'re not happy, then that\'s a different story. 44:44 Oh, good. Yeah. So you\'re not going to come out with like barrel vodka yet? And then that\'s going to be sitting on the shelves is that? 44:49 I see. I think Fred\'s been telling us that we should do that. 44:52 Go. Yeah, he\'s an advocate. 44:56 How much he likes. 44:58 T shirts and hands and everything. NET? How much he loves it? Oh, absolutely. 45:03 So from your side of the business, would you guys be for online sales? Or 45:11 is that 45:11 original? My original business model I wrote was all online sales. Yeah. But because it\'s just and the thing is, the reality is, is it doesn\'t affect the distributors, it actually helps distributors, it would it would open up another channel and save them money. But they\'ve got to see that point, the connection? Oh, no, the more we do with our do you think that is connected with them? Is it I mean, I guess just anything with bourbon or liquor, everything. So like old school, they don\'t want to change. They\'re like, I don\'t know, they\'re just stuck in an old nine. So you\'ve got big aircraft carriers traveling. And in order to turn those around, it requires a lot of energy, 45:50 a lot of people and a lot of regulation. It\'s all that sort of stuff combined. Now, because I think we\'ve, we\'ve talked about on the podcast before we\'ve had on the roundtables to kind of like figure out like, what, what\'s the discussion of, you know, why can\'t we open this up, like, when is Amazon finally going to start delivering to your door and prime next day, you know, dovetail next to you. And when people are going to start setting up online scrapers to go ahead and buy allocated products, like soon as it hits on Amazon or something like that, right? So the day could come, it probably will come it\'s just who knows when it\'s going to be. But I kind of want to talk about you know, a little bit more about trip, you know, the operation side of this, because I think that really what people want to know more about is is the blends and and everything that\'s going into this. So kind of talk about really what\'s next on the horizon for you all, and and are you worried you\'re going to run out. And because there\'s a thing that you talked about, before we started recording this, as you were saying that you guys are tripping over barrels at your warehouse, like you\'ve got 46:47 that much stuff going on, you\'re ready to sell some, we\'d be happy to take 46:53 that or we\'ll just go and make your own blend. Yeah, 46:54 there we go. So there is a blend. But 46:57 the process logistics get a little tricky when you\'ve basically grown out of your space. So all the way back to what we order and when we order it. So Joe, and I\'ll have an idea what we\'re going to do. So we\'re so we\'re going to have a, you know, a dovetail and a batch of bourbon will have to infinite. And we\'ll just have a list. And then in our minds, we\'ll go through and figure out what barrels we think are going to go in each of those plus what we already have in house. So we\'ll ship everything in order. And as it comes in, it literally comes off the truck, goes to the dump trough gets dumped into the tank, empty barrel goes back out and onto another trip, because we don\'t have room to keep the empties in there. So that process goes on for an entire day when the trucks delivered, so that that\'s kind of how we get our base. And then once we have the base for whichever project we\'re working on, it then becomes the treasure hunt of what flavors are we missing? Where do we find them? And how do we put those together. But it is it\'s a bit of a logistical mess to do all that in, in a small space. And it was kind of funny the last the last time we got we had three trucks in one day and for our space, that\'s a ton. And we had to strategically place them in the facility. So that right up front where the tanks are, we had tanks, forklift dumped off, and then we just started working our way back. dumping barrels working because there was no room there was a path for the play. That was it can just 48:33 used to be a two dimensional problem. What was on the floor? Yeah. Now it\'s literally the three dimensions wrong way. It\'s like Tetris. I mean, Tetris, we\'re up for four levels. 48:43 Oh, wow. Just so people know, at least at least from at least I think my knowledge so a truck is about 96 barrels. Is that about what comes in? I\'m dependent on how their ship? Yeah, yeah. 48:54 Or depends if they\'re up or down? 48:56 Yeah. So what up? what do you get for on a pallet, 48:58 what you do six pallets it for based on weight, you can get 49:03 lost, I don\'t do math, 49:04 okay. But you can do without the pallets, and you can get a few more. 49:08 So you ever more work? That\'s more human work? 49:13 Are you ever worried when when Joe or anybody else on the team, because we now clarify that there\'s 10 people on a team, 49:19 maybe 11 by now, 49:22 or none, when with like an idea comes up, and you\'re like, Oh, God, here we go another label. And like, you have to continue these these product expansion line, because you\'re still doing your barrel batch Bourbons got your infinite, you\'ve got, you\'ve got your rum. I mean, you\'ve got all kinds of you\'ve got your New Year\'s Eve bottle. So kind of talk about like, When is that going to end because you know, it\'s it\'s like a scale up thing that you\'re like a scale out thing versus like trying to scale up, that\'s kind of hard to be able to do, 49:54 I would say that. First off, we love to innovate, we\'d love to do things that have not been done, we like to be creative, going, we\'ve got a stack of ideas that if we had more time, we would be able to do. So we love that we don\'t want that to stop. When we talk about, you know, the batches and expansion and everything. When you look at someone who does a product the same way every single time, which there\'s something to be said for, they\'ve already got a cola, they already have all that stuff approved, they know what\'s going into that bottle, it\'s just a matter of doing the same thing every time. Every time Joe and I put something together, we start from square one. So the bottle doesn\'t change, the shape of the label doesn\'t change, but everything that\'s on the label front and back changes, which means it has to go get cola approvals, and then come back to us. Everything that\'s in that bottle is going to be different, which means we\'ve selected different barrels, we\'ve come up with new ideas, we put different blends together. And then once everything is approved, we\'ve we signed off on the blend, it gets bought cases shift. So every single time anything goes out from from barrel craft spirits, we\'ve started from square one, to create that. And then on top of that, trying to constantly innovate and and better ourselves with each new product that we release. 51:18 So purposely inefficient, is that the best? 51:22 Well, the one thing that we have that is we spent a lot of time in the original label design, creating the structure of the label. And we have essentially a matrix of product. So and we fill in. So there there, there\'s, you know, buy type whiskey rum, right now, DSS and rum. And then there are different levels of of that were essentially three price points in all of our products going into those three price points, to make it easy for the customer and the distributor. And so then it\'s a question of creating the content for the label that fits that particular metaphor of that matrix. So we\'ve we\'ve, again, everything we\'ve done is a lot of advanced planning, there\'s some things look haphazard, but they\'re really not. We\'ve actually done a lot of the thinking about this already in advance, we spent a lot of time planning. 52:12 So with with all these, like line extensions and other things you\'re doing, are you looking at ever phasing anything off? Because it\'s it\'s a lot to keep up with everything and to continue blending? You know, great question seven different sort of releases. 52:28 Yeah, it is a great question. And I think 52:31 I think the the the public know, you guys will decide some of that when we when we love doing everything that we\'re doing right now, he said, but he\'s upset with it. Yeah, I mean, if you if you decide or the public decided that all of a sudden they don\'t like something, then we\'re probably not gonna do that again. But I mean, currently, we\'re having fun putting all this stuff out there. 52:52 The other thing too is, is if we don\'t like we have not done rum to yet, because we haven\'t found the rum that we\'ve done. A Tale of Two islands, which is a limited release. But ROM two isn\'t out because we haven\'t found and we\'ve looked at 100 different rooms we haven\'t found the right ones with it we\'re looking at we\'re about to do around project because we we did just buy a lot of ramen, I think that what we have is going to be interesting. It\'s combination of at least Jamaica, Barbados, Ghana, and maybe even Martinique, we\'ll see I\'m not sure. And when that\'s right when that\'s right will release it but we don\'t feel the need to have it the only the only product we want to have out there all time is our bourbon and whiskey. But if the rye isn\'t the one we want, then we\'ll wait. Right three is we\'re kicking around right three right now. 53:41 That\'s been the sales like you don\'t you don\'t see a whole lot of the right on the shelves. Like that\'s kind of a really kind of hard to find product and I think correct me if I\'m wrong, you were doing a few like single barrel rise this year as well. 53:52 We did we did a fair amount of single barrel Canadian rise. They were 13 years old. And they were they were they were 99 or 95%. Right? They were spectacular. Yeah, we 54:10 we have another Canadian Roz are good we 54:12 came right you know if you leave it alone, and 54:15 you may have a lot of those great big juicy for flavors they do as like, so I\'m not surprised that like this. 54:23 Yeah. And then when we were about to acquire a lot of candy, right, and the first thing that trip days was bubble gum on it. It\'s so true. It\'s a very bubble gummy. How\'s that? 54:36 I got a question about source the buying round and sourcing. Is that similar to the bourbon game, like, is it similar? Totally, totally different? Because I know with bourbon, you got brokers and all that stuff. And you don\'t really talk I didn\'t. How\'s that process work with your you just get a one way ticket to the islands and hang out? Yeah, for a few months? Already? Yeah, 54:53 take a few 54:54 hands I figured out you can do. It\'s very different and depends on it depends on the silver, but but there is, there\'s a lot of spirits available. You just have to know where to get them in rum is rum. You know, aside for a couple of very specific distilleries, it\'s readily available. I mean, there\'s, if you you\'ll notice there\'s a lot of rums from Central America, there\'s run from South America out there now, you know, and and they\'re all very different. I mean, you know, some of them are just too much sugar. For us. It\'s, it\'s not what we want, we tend to really like those pure and kind of a funky Dunder, the fermentation distillation process, or just really heavy duty fat rums. No oily. 55:39 So if you guys do a lot of just bourbon whiskey and itself, then why run? Like why? It\'s, I guess it\'s one of those things, it\'s coming up. Well, now, I mean, look at it. You look at it from a business perspective, and you\'re like, Okay, like, we\'re gonna we\'re gonna chop off like the dead weight, like is from a dead weight to you? Or is it still like that\'s still like experimentation? Well 56:00 think about it this way. The person who drinks our rum is really a high end whiskey or bourbon drinker. So you\'re not going to take our rum and mix it with Coke. I mean, this is not a white rum or white rum. This is these are serious, serious products to drink. So it\'s a there\'s a natural crossover between some of the high end whiskey drinkers to some of these sort of vintage or really esoteric realms. They\'re not for everybody. And, and I don\'t even believe that rum is the next whiskey category. I think that this is that the people who drink the rums that we that we will bottle are a subset of the people who drink the whiskeys. They\'re not necessarily hardcore rum drinkers. Although they\'re the people who like rum do drink our rum, but it\'s not the general population. So we do it because because our customer likes it. And we like it. And you know, our promises. We only put in the bottle stuff that we like, 56:55 you know, you said rums, not the next category. 56:58 What do you think is the next category I think America was he\'s got a lot of room to go. I think we\'re, I think we\'re in the sick. My opinion completely. We\'re in the sixth inning of bourbon, we got a way to go with that. But American whiskey is there\'s a long runway on that. I think people are going to discover it the way they discovered bourbon. And that sort of fits our model. You know, we were looking at we look at people want to know what\'s new and what\'s different, what\'s exciting. We\'re always doing something new and different, exciting. And I think that if you look at that, that\'s what people like, and we\'re going to just keep doing that. I\'ll toss one at you because 57:31 I know that 57:33 you buy your whiskey. 57:35 We all go there. I know we\'re not going to get that without a chokehold here. 57:39 Yeah, actually, we already know. The 57:44 so a lot of people look at Armagnac as a as a as a kind of a good substitute for whiskey because it\'s it\'s, it doesn\'t have the same kind of flavor profile, but you do get some like very dark and condensed sort of flavors and floral fruity notes. Have you guys even thought about looking at Armagnac as a possible source? 58:04 Okay. new ones flavor? Yes, the answer? The short answer is yes. We don\'t know we\'re going to be out there. It\'s 58:12 3.5. Actually, we\'re already we just finished. 58:14 Finished, there\'s three more. 58:17 So So talk 58:18 to talk about talking about three real quick since it\'s probably going to come out. So kind of talk a little bit about like what was in the blend is a little bit different than we\'re drinking now. Like, kind of talk about that a little bit about that? 58:28 Yeah, there. The interesting thing about dovetail is that it is going to be a little bit different every time. But we do use you the same similar ingredients in that the barrels are the same. But, you know, grapes change every year. So the one that was in the barrels that we may get next time might be a little different than what we use previously. So there\'s going to be some flavor differences there, we might use a different number, we might use a Jamaican rum barrel instead of a guy in a Guyanese rum barrel, or all of those things are going to put subtle differences in there. But at the end of the day, when everything\'s put together, you still taste all of the same flavor characteristics, but a lot of them are in different concentrations. So it\'s it\'s a, it\'s a similar experience, but it\'s not the same experience. And I think being able to, to put all those compounds in there, in those different concentrations and let them vary a little bit as you go along. It\'s kind of fun to do it. 59:33 So another thing that you kind of piqued my interest, little bit too. I saw something from another friend of the show Wade wood or today and we\'re talking about finishing, it was more or less around like finishing versus aging. So you\'re talking about putting something into the barrel. And now do you all look at what you\'re doing is finishing like it\'s just in the in there for a short period of time, kind of marry some flavors you like really aging something in there? 59:57 No, I mean, everything we use is a Yes, yes. Yes, we put it in there for some maturation, but mainly, it\'s a finishing. 1:00:07 Yeah. 1:00:08 And some of us we have some whiskies. And we have some things we\'ve been finishing for two years. 1:00:13 I mean, you\'d have to classify that 1:00:14 would that would be I would consider two years age. Yeah. Well, 1:00:17 the funny thing is, you know, the I would think I think 30 minutes is finished, yours is probably age now the run finishing the run fish we do. I can be as short as two weeks. I mean, it depends on it depends on the particular finishing agent. And for us, one of things that we\'ve really been careful about is we don\'t want the finish to overpower anything. fact, we, we don\'t even really want you to taste the finish, we want the finish to enhance the whiskey and make that greater than then either either parts. So you\'ll pick up some of the notes. You may pick up brand characteristics. But for the most part, what you\'re really tasting is something that\'s that is been created from the different finishes and the different whiskeys. So it\'s a totally different new flavor experience altogether. Yeah. So john, I want you to 1:01:02 taste it and go, Wow, what\'s that? I\'m going to go back and taste it again. And then try to figure out what it is. And I know the bottom. Exactly, and we don\'t want you to take a sip of it and go oh, wow, that tastes like a big bowl cap. Yeah, you know, we want you to get 1:01:17 that deal. I know. 1:01:20 We actually that\'s that\'s probably an exception because that that cab is such an exceptional product. Right? That that it just brings out some beautiful nuance some 1:01:31 people about finishes, I guess there they have a concern that how much product is left in the barrels when your product goes into it. Can you talk about that when you get these barrels? like are they completely bone dry, they have some in the non keto 1:01:45 they just wet we don\'t mean we\'re not that\'s a that is usually they want you want to be wet, but you don\'t want them to be sloshing around with three gallons of product right and that is an issue with certain finish on products where people are buying barrels that have you know, couple 10 gallons either different different experience now where we were we replay it straight down the middle it\'s you know, if it needs if we have to wet a barrel will put a little bit into wet it but for the most part, it\'s the way we buy the barrels. So you know we\'ve we\'ve we\'re used to done vineyards now three, three bad three times. Oh, wow. And we\'re going to get more barrels on them. But you know, it really held up getting your mileage out of them that we are 1:02:29 Yeah. So I guess one of the questions where we start kind of wrapping this up a little bit kind of talk about really, what keeps you going because we\'ve talked about the barrel finishes we\'ve got actually we didn\'t really touch on the infinite stuff that too much but we know he talked about dovetail we got infinite. And then you\'ve got your your straight bourbon whiskey line. Really like when at the end of the day, like what what keeps the engine going for you all like in regards of like, just the passion behind it, you know, is it is it the finishing side? Or is it is it the straight bourbon was beside the blending? 1:03:01 You know, I think it\'s all about 1:03:04 in a cop out answer saying both. 1:03:08 It\'s all about being creative, innovating. You know, we do things differently all the time. We don\'t do the same thing day in and day out. coming up with new ideas trying to constantly better ourselves. I mean, all those things go in go into it, isn\'t it? there\'s not there\'s not a single day we go to work and do the exact same thing we did the day before. 1:03:30 We don\'t want to make me feel bad, but we have the best job in the world. I mean, every day is a great day every day is a new experience. It\'s it\'s you know two days. I 1:03:41 mean, we get to sit here with these guys and it\'s a pretty good 1:03:46 day to get to be with you are our best. 1:03:49 Our best life 1:03:49 we didn\'t even get to bourbon 18 Let\'s do it Jason 1:03:53 let\'s do it real quick. Real quick Yeah, Susan Susan thing I think I drink mine All right. 1:03:57 All right drink Did you like it? Oh my gosh, my Yeah, the What do 1:04:02 you talk about around again? 1:04:03 Yeah, might as well I mean, we\'re here 1:04:07 Did you get those you get those really subtle top notes the fruity 1:04:13 No, I do he reminds It\'s crazy. Reminds me of all right. We said that. No, I did but we\'ll talk about the dovetail but even on this It reminds me there\'s some like some of the weed in Nashville\'s had those fruity juicy for notes. And I\'m like, but I know there\'s not much we did bourbon on the source markets. I\'m like, What\'s in there? You know, I\'m trying to figure out what\'s in there because there\'s no we have yet 1:04:32 to we have not worked to the bourbon yet. We\'ve we\'ve looked at a few but just know this is there\'s no wheat in this at all. Okay. 1:04:41 Because it Yeah, the you know, the like, really good, like dark cherry still. Yeah. 1:04:47 A lot of those good toffee notes and stuff like that, too. It\'s another home run. Yes. Like I said, I love 1718 is right there with it. 1:04:54 I think I like 18 1:04:55 so this one yeah. 1818 is holds a special place worse. And it didn\'t mean it was a recreational not 1:05:03 more than 11 1:05:04 more than 11 because 11 has weapons kind of like what like really puts you on the pedestal there. You\'re kind of like rocky at that point, you know, the top of the stairs jumping up and down because 1:05:13 the answer is whatever the new one is, is my favorite. And it\'s not because of any other reason that is it really is I mean, we like the thing that we\'re doing now. But this is just this did this did this one got great recognition that one best small best 1:05:27 ones. Like I I call them a guzzlers, like you just said 1:05:33 they\'re dangerously delicious. Like wake up in the bottles empty. Yeah. 1:05:39 Like, it\'s just such good, easy drinking. Like it\'s really good. Like, I don\'t know, 1:05:45 somebody asked me did you say weed? Or we did 1:05:47 we, you know, we, you know, place the CBD oil. And 1:05:52 actually, it was my youngest daughter asked awkward. I 1:05:59 think last time we have talked, you know, you guys are in a location. But are you? Are you still I mean, I know the main main game is sourcing like, is this still distillation? The future? Is that starting like what\'s what\'s your kind of what\'s the plan there 1:06:12 gave you all those barrels? 1:06:13 Well, and that\'s part of the problem as fast as we\'re growing, it becomes a little bit of a struggle to keep putting these products together. And on top of that space becomes a factor. So while everything that we talked about in the past, building, the distillery and and you know, focusing on different nuances in the East fermentation and distillation methodology, wish to plan to move in that direction, we just have to figure out how we\'re going to do all that. 1:06:47 Again, we\'re looking at different spaces now. 1:06:52 Moving on, bigger and better. I think now you guys, I think last time we talked because you know, Joe, you know you came from we come from a tech background. You guys are in like an underground bunker that used to be a like data storage facility or something like that. 1:07:05 As a Cricket Wireless facility. Yeah. We our server room is our bottling room, which is we have the most temperature humidity control balling room in the state in the country. So we have happy workers and 1:07:18 yeah, does it 1:07:20 does it bum you out? Like because you, you\'re the distiller, do you want to make your own juice? Or you absolutely or the like, yeah, I\'m totally content with the blending side. 1:07:29 That was more my my forte in the business is really fermentation. East fermentation distillation. The blending has been fun, you know, it was, it was something that in my previous life, I hadn\'t put a whole lot of focus on. And then meeting Joe, and our collaboration has really opened up more doors, on creativity, putting things together. And really, I think that we\'ve only told part of the stories they have with the story, as far as blending and flavors are concerned because there\'s a whole nother side of this story that comes from East fermentation, distillation of maturation. And when you understand where to go to get the flavors that we talk about in these in these mature barrels, then you can start creating the things that you\'re after. And instead of going to find them you can make them on the front end. Yeah, so there\'s so there\'s a whole nother piece to this puzzle, that hopefully one day we get to get to chair. So you\'re 1:08:29 still I think just to sort of remember, we tend to look at things a little bit differently. So we went down the road, when we did the planning on the story on becoming a production facility. And then we realize that that\'s not really what we want to do. We don\'t necessarily want to build the factory to make that product. And all along that product we were going to distill would be an ingredient in in our product mix was never the idea to let it replace everything we\'re doing, we\'re going to continue to source so that that was a again, we planned everything there was a year more than a year of planning. And then we had this realization was like that\'s not the way we want to do it. So now we\'ve been in this other planning phase of how we\'re going to do it differently, the being a production facility. And I don\'t really want to say more than that right now. But that\'s it i mean to be elusive about it. But but we are thinking about and planning a different way of approaching distillation, and the way that it fits into our product mix. It\'s more in keeping with what we do. 1:09:31 Next year, we\'re going to save that 1:09:32 for Episode 350 1:09:35 chapter three right there. Save it as That\'s awesome. We\'ll have our own recording studio but then the goal is pretty nice right now. 1:09:42 Yeah, see you don\'t we don\'t get couches like this in my house when we\'re sitting here recording. 1:09:45 Oh, 1:09:46 it\'s fantastic. No barking dogs. Oh, yeah, we were able to go live at least and you know, we had we had so many awesome servers and we\'re still we\'re going the background but that\'s okay. It\'s what you expect.

Slash pursue spirits. So Julian, after the seminar was over, he pulled out a pot big friggin pocket knife on stage and started cutting the labels. He\'s like, this is how he presented. I was like, How the hell did you get that through security? 0:59 Hey, everyone is 1:00 It\'s Episode 220 of bourbon pursuit. I\'m one of your host Kenny. And last weekend at bourbon and beyond, it was nothing short of incredible. We can\'t say thank you enough to everyone that came up and said hi to us and join us during our sessions. We met folks from bourbon societies from in shape coming from Chicago and St. Louis and everywhere in between. and if you haven\'t done so yet, please go check out our Instagram page as well as bourbon and beyond official Instagram to see all the awesome pictures. I hope you feel some photo and you will be there next year. And another huge shout out to Fred Minnick for including us as a regular part of the bourbon programming. It was an awesome experience. And anybody that has been there will tell you, it was one for the record books. All right, it\'s news time. So let\'s dig into this. Last week, we announced the press release for the 2019 Buffalo Trace antique collection on our Facebook page. It\'s one of the most highly anticipated releases that are coming out from the 2:00 all season amongst our enthusiasm. Maybe it\'s also one of the most frustrating but hats off the soundtrack for always keeping a level head and doing their best to price these at a $99 MSRP. For the past few years, however, odds are, it\'s gonna be really hard to find that in most retail locations. We will be getting our sample soon and we\'ll be releasing a five minute whiskey quickie when we get it recorded as soon as we can. New riff is releasing a new heirloom rye called Bow Bow rye. This was distilled in June of 2015 and will be four years old and bottled at 100 proof without chill filtration. That low rye is one of the first specialties New Roof made back in 2015. Their corn farmer Charles fog had been grilling heirloom rye on his family farm for many years. He\'s chosen a variety of was called Bow Bow rides and heirloom grain which dates back to the 1940s as a rye variety that\'s popular in Indiana. He offered it to new riff and they distilled it into rye whiskey probably the first time in 3:00 decades that Bow Bow has been made into whiskey. And quite surely the only example on the market today, Bow Bow grain is a little smaller than modern varieties with a lower output per acre of planting. So there\'s just a little bit more tidbit or fact about what is Bow Bow arrived. This will have a suggested retail price of 4999. As a side note, I was actually able to sample this when we recorded a podcast with Ken Lewis of new riff a few months ago and I\'m telling you, it\'s going to be worth getting a bottle very quality ride. Kentucky out is going to be releasing batch nine and October. The latest introduction from the Wise Man\'s bourbon is the boldest highest proof addition to date from Master Blender Dixon Desmond, it\'s coming in at 127.6 proof. This release is made with four different disciplines from four different mash bills including a 15 year old, two different lots of 14 year olds, a 12 year old, a seven year old and a six year old 4:00 lid, Kentucky albertan. batch nine will be releasing 10,314 bottles into 42 US states with a suggested retail price of $299 and 99 cents. Alright, so today\'s episode, it\'s got a lot of things wrapped up in one. This is the first release of two of the bourbon seminars that took place during bourbon and beyond. It\'s also the first time that we\'ve had the Van Winkle family on the show before. Julian gives some history into the brand about where they were sourcing and the timeline of when it all became part of the Aztec portfolio as well. Then some of the juicy details start emerging. One of Julian\'s daughters talks about the emergence of Pappy and CO and how she is more of a tequila person and never really gets to drink any of the family bourbon. Then Preston talks about their involvement with the crackdown on the secondary market Facebook groups, which he implied that was really there as a counterfeit money. 5:00 During now, the whole time, Fred keeps a lot of good questions rolling that you\'re going to find very interesting here. And the second half of this podcast is a live recording that we did at Burton beyond on stage of the Community Roundtable, we share our thoughts on the festival and what we loved about it, as well as the news that broke the evening prior. There\'s almost too much going on, but it\'s timely and chock full of good nuggets that you\'re going to enjoy. Now, I will be the first to admit that the audio experience here is probably not going to be the best as everyone on stage was holding a handheld microphone and when that happens, you know, it\'s going to be bumping into things. You\'re gonna have some sound bleed that was coming from the other stages. And when we were recording this, it was feeding off of a soundboard so we could just get the best as that we could. So sorry in advance that, you know, really, we hope that the effort that we want to actually bring this to you is worth it as well. And of course since we weren\'t always 6:00 too, there\'s not going to be any video available as a part of this as well. So you\'ll be able to just do a lot of listening. So if you\'re driving, then continue as normal or walking or working out or whatever it is. But if you\'re watching this on YouTube or Facebook will get you next time, I promise. All right, now let\'s dive in. We\'ve got Joe over a barrel bourbon, and then you\'ve got Fred Minnick with above the jar. 6:23 Hi, this is Joe from barrell craft spirits. We work with distilleries from all over the world to source and blend the best ingredients into America\'s most curious cask strength whiskies. Find out more at barrell bourbon com. I\'m Fred Minnick, and this is above the char. This past weekend was the conclusion of my Super Bowl. bourbon and beyond. Leon bridges Alison Krauss ZZ Top Foo Fighters john Fogarty. Zac Brown band. Oh my gosh, there were so many great headliners, including Robert Plant himself from Led Zeppelin. 7:00 He didn\'t just come out playing his stuff from his bluegrass days he was singing Led Zeppelin, bourbon and beyond was so amazing. And I am honored to be its curator and a co founder in the festival. My baby is the Kentucky gold stage. And what happened on the bourbon workshops is absolutely historic. You had Jordan from breaking bourbon. You\'ve had Blake from bourbon or Kenny and Ryan were up there. Carla Carlton, the managing editor for bourbon plus, Susan regular Fon Weaver, Peggy know Stephens on and on and on. So many wonderful talented bourbon people were on that stage dropping knowledge and it was just fantastic. The crowds were packed, you could not get a place to get a tasting and people were just standing way in the back by the gates just listening to people talk about bourbon. This was unprecedented even in year 8:00 past we didn\'t draw these kinds of crowds around the bourbon workshops. And if you were one of those people, and you were there listening to the Van Winkle talk about their family heritage, you learn something so, so breaking for like our little world, this little bubble that we call bourbon. And that was when President Van Winkle said that his family worked with Facebook legally to take down the secondary markets. I was stunned by it. But I want to give you some context into this whole format of the festival. That Kentucky gold stage is to the left and about a half a football field to three quarters of football field away from our about a football field away from the main stages and while we are talking musicians are playing so their sound bleed into us now, because the panelists have their are speaking into the microphone. The people in the audience can 9:00 Hear them. But on the stage, we often depending on the musician, we can hear more of the music than some of the panelists who are left or right. And also, we were instructed by our stage manager to really get into the microphone and not yell, but speak very thoroughly and deeply. So the recording you\'re about to hear has, it sounds much, much different than what it was like for me on stage. So I was instructed to speak loudly into the microphone. And so it\'s going to sound like I\'m screaming a little bit, but really, I\'m talking to the crowd, not necessarily speaking to be recorded. So that over excitement, that\'s a stage voice that\'s that\'s kind of my way to speak to the crowd. And the van winkles, you know, they\'re also speaking a little louder, but they\'re not as loud as me. So as you will soon learn, so that this was recorded by bourbon pursuit at 10:00 bourbon and beyond festival and it\'s definitely a voice I would not use for normal recording. With that said, I have been working with the van winkles for two years to get them on stage bourbon and beyond. And last year we got rained out so they couldn\'t come on. This year they donated three bottles of Pappy Van Winkle, and told us a lot about their struggles coming through through the bourbon business and how he almost gave it up. But it wasn\'t until Preston Van Winkle started talking about how he feels about the secondary market and the counterfeiters and the flippers that my jaw just dropped. I was not expecting that on the stage, not at all. So sit back, enjoy and listen and just know that this was this was recorded around a couple thousand people. And that\'s this week\'s above the char. Hey, if you have an idea for above the char hit me up on Twitter or Instagram at Frederick 11:00 Nick again at Fred MC. Until next week, cheers. 11:07 Hey guys, my name is Jackie psych and I\'m the master taster for old forester. And my dear friend Fred medic has actually been so nice to let me MC this stage for earning beyond this year and he\'s a man who has done so much for this bourbon industry. And he really is shaping how we are experiencing bourbon today, obviously look at all of us here together. But yet for Fred Mac. 11:32 And I mean, he\'s the only one that wears the mascot when it\'s 100 degrees outside. So you know, just for that alone, you deserve an applause Thank you very much just because I have a very ugly neck. 11:44 Well, Jackie, I am so excited about this particular seminar. Look at all the people who are here to get to hear the story about Pappy Van Winkle. All right. Joining me on the stage Carrie. greener Carrie. Come on. 12:00 Beco the son of Julian Van Winkle, her brother Preston Van Winkle. He\'s the guy who gets all the hate emails whenever somebody can\'t get happy. And the man, the myth, the legend, Julian Van Winkle, who brought his grandfather\'s name back, ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce you to one of the greatest pallets of the 20th century, Julian Van Winkle. So Van Winkle, thank you very much for taking the stage with me at bourbon and beyond. And I met you backstage, and I was so disappointed in all of you 90 degrees for it. Were they drinking bourbon? Know where they drinking water know where they drinking Irish Whiskey scotch, Brandy or a beer know? What? What were they drinking vodka. 12:59 It\'s hot. 13:01 Julian, if Pappy had known that his grandson and great grandson and great granddaughter were drinking vodka, before they were going on the stage to talk about their family legacy, what do you think he would say? Smart, smart guy, hey, 13:20 I\'m not a I\'m a when I when I take a drink, I like a lot of flow into my throat when it\'s hot. So if I did that with bourbon or some other brown spirit, it would be an ugly afternoon or ugly evening. So, vodka is a little kinder to the brain than some of the other whiskey. So. All right, well, the bottle has gotten too much stage time as it is. Exactly. So let\'s move on. I want to talk about what it was like. what it was like growing up in the van Winkle household because your dad was out trying to promote American whiskey. When nobody wanted to drink it. What was it like seeing your dad out on the on the 14:00 pavement trying to sell whiskey. Well, it wasn\'t easy at all actually looking back it\'s he has scars on his head in 14:10 warehouses, right. Yeah from warehouses. So when we were little, you know, he\'d leave really early in the morning he was into distilling the bourbon down to Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. And so 14:21 it was not anything pretty what you might imagine it was no Camelot from back at the stairwell or days it was full on grunt work. And, yeah, he would sprained his ankle and he would leave early and come home late and luckily on the weekends, we would go down there to learn to work with him. So for us, it was an amazing childhood. He wasn\'t gone all the time, because luckily we were able to be there with him and enjoy that. The bottling plant and it\'s right on a creek in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. It was like a dilapidated building, but he was just working hard all day every day making it work, and we were there playing 15:00 Along with them so 15:01 now Preston, 15:04 I know you pretty well. Did you ever sneak in there and and steal a little whiskey from your dad when you were growing up? 15:12 Steal whiskey like from the liquor cabinet or from the bottling Hall. So there are multiple places you were stealing whiskey. 15:22 Actually, by the time I was able to appreciate it 15:29 I was it was 15:33 there wasn\'t really anything to steal. It was under lock and key pretty well and I was working for dad so 15:41 but I do remember 15:44 I do remember pinch in a bottle here. There are some some old stuff that was it wasn\'t anything good. It was stuff that was ultimately sold in Japan because that was the only place you could get rid of it. 16:00 $5,000 on the secondary market, there\'s none of it left. Thankfully, 16:05 we had our family had nothing to do with the distillation of that particular product but the labels were popping off of the bottles and they had been in the in the warehouse for a good many years. But in terms of stealing booze from dad and my sisters were not quite as good at it. Oh, frozen bottles of vodka in the freezer. 16:30 Okay, all right, let\'s all right, let\'s just go ahead and have Fred Yeah, I gotta say, it\'s true. That\'s fair. We drink bourbon if it was a cool September day, but it\'s just not that yet. So all right. Okay. All right. So Julian, did you ever have you you were on the road? A lot trying to make 16:51 Pappy Van Winkle or old Rip Van Winkle work. What was it like? 16:57 What was it like and bourbon and the 17:00 1980s and 1990s when nobody wanted it 17:05 well, it was, it was a struggle. My dad, 17:09 of course started working for him in 1977. And 17:13 at that point, 17:15 the bourbon part was not popular. So all the distilleries put their product in the Cantor\'s 17:21 and some ugly some fantastic but that\'s what it took with to sell the whiskey was put it in a figurine or an apothecary bottle or something. So that was the hard sell is to get a 17:34 liquor store and prospect Kentucky or wherever to pay 17:40 eight bucks wholesale for a bottle of whiskey back then which would sell for 12 or 15 maybe so that was the hard part and to sell a bottle of whiskey. We just RO written Van Winkle was next to impossible but it was bottle bottle and so forth. So it was a it was it was quite something it was it was an uphill battle. 18:00 To say the least. Now you also, you also use your whiskey as currency like you would you would barter with it, you would trade a couple bottles or a case for a magazine advertisement. And those days. Yes, we fellow that we end up meeting through the horse business and Lexington did some advertising was from New York. 18:21 He came down to this dairy and found out about her whiskey because his customer who was a horse farm owner, enjoyed the whiskey and found out about it. And he actually, he bought a case from the distillery and took a case of whiskey with him on the airplane and put it in the overhead. So that was hilarious. 18:40 But we did barter for advertising because I didn\'t have any money to pay for advertising. So we did barter, which was it worked. It was all I gotta say, what would you say? Would you say that there was ever a moment that you were in jeopardy of closing the company. I would say that what happened about once a month. 19:00 Wow, seriously, I\'m not being facetious. I would say that 19:05 the timing was perfect on this. 19:08 But 19:09 it was I would, I was buying whiskey by the barrel. And occasionally the distilleries would turn, would change their mind and not sell me any barrels. And I was buying whiskey from several different distilleries as many distilleries did. Back then, there was a lot of whiskey being traded around. The label that you bought under that distillery was not necessarily from that the story. And that still happens today, obviously, too, but I did a lot of 19:36 got nixed on buying barrels. So I was turned down and I thought, well, this is it. I\'m done here, but it\'s the only thing I knew how to do. 19:45 My dad wanted me to work for a banker or sell insurance or something. And I said, Well, that\'s no fun. I\'m just gonna stick with this. And it was more tenacity than anything because I had no other choice and just stuck with it. They look obviously it kind of worked out. 20:00 What What do you all think? Are you all glad that he stuck with it? 20:05 Now I think I am. 20:09 President definitely is. Did you as a child, did you feel that stress that your father was going through? 20:20 That\'s hard to say. 20:22 I could tell that he was overworked a lot of times. But at the same time, even with the early mornings and late nights, he usually made it home for dinner. 20:37 A lot of times with 20:39 a sack of sliders or 20:43 box up 20:45 club sandwiches from men\'s cafe down on story Avenue, 20:50 but usually made it home for dinner. So I guess that felt the stress so much because when we go down and help them in the bottling Hall, it was 21:00 It was fun. He made it fun. We helped fill bottles, put labels on. I remember one day filling like 1000 Statue of Liberty 50 ml decanters 21:13 with a soda fountain gun with my cousins. So the stress was kind of taken out of it and he always made time for 21:24 going to Louisville Redbirds games and Louisville Thunder games and whatever the 21:30 the hockey team the 21:33 river frogs, so we always had 21:37 guys made time for us as kids. So I don\'t know that I felt the stress. I feel like the only time I really realized that things were getting tough was when a 21:50 group of Japanese buyers came over. And like if they didn\'t have a good time, that was it like that could have been a while to the 22:00 road but they had a great time we took them and play golf i i caddied for them. And it was 22:07 one of the most fun funniest experiences of my life but 22:13 that was probably the only time that I I really recognized that things could be a little bit you know, on thin ice. So Carrie Did you feel like your dad ever brought the work problems home? No. And I think I we actually learned that from him. It\'s like you just work hard Put your head down during the day and then you try to cut it off at night and yeah, so we just knew he worked hard, but did not feel that like Preston said he was he was there the night and on the weekends and I never never felt anything like that. 22:50 I think that\'s a testament to you, Julian. I admit I bring work home. I it\'s hard. It\'s really really hard. I think to when you\'re just when you don\'t have 23:00 Any other way of being and it\'s all you know that you don\'t really have any other way of doing it. So it was the only way you knew how and luckily it was 23:10 being a dad and being 23:13 a great family member and just working hard and, like all the whole theme here for me and all this is like it\'s all you know, it\'s all you do, and when you work hard, and you just do what\'s right and real, it all worked out. 23:27 Now Carrie is one of three she is a triplet. And I\'ve actually never asked 23:36 I\'ve never asked Julian This Has there ever been a moment with your triplets? That you miss just one of them for the other? 23:45 Mostly when they\'re walking down the hall from the back, I would always say you know, carry Lewisham or whatever and it would be the other one because from the front, that\'s I\'ve known him since day one. It\'s a little easier, but I did have mistaken Amen. 24:01 And then on the phone up the phone conversation especially you know the last several years carry lives in Idaho and everybody lives here now but but they will call up and I think I\'m talking to Louise and it\'s scary or something. So it\'s, it\'s, it is a little confusing we just a real quick story went to Target one day and they were really small and I\'m checking out and so fellas checking me out going, is that three twins 24:27 because it\'s hard to describe, you know what you\'re looking at? Because triplets are a little different than twin lot of twins. But uh, we did get them confused. We had a magic marker on on one of the girls when they were first born on their heels. Not to mention he was 30 and he had four children. He had Preston and then within a year and a half he had three more and looking back at age 30 enough to see what he was able to do with his career and raise children and do it so gracefully. Please give your mother some credit for the raising 25:00 mature. Yeah, thank God he had her as a god, she should have come so she could have heard that. But she\'s babysitting some grandchildren. Yeah. You just mentioned that you were on the verge of closing your company. 25:14 And then something happened in the 1990s. You got you got a perfect score. 25:21 And everybody wanted Pappy, tell me about that. That big moment of when when you kind of turn the corner when you knew that you wouldn\'t have to close your doors. Tell me about that. Julian. 25:34 Well, the story was we sent our distributor in Chicago, unbeknownst to me sent a sample to the beverage tasting Institute for the beverage taste, the world beverage tasting, what they call it the beverage tasting Institute, world, world whiskey competition or something and we got a 99 and they publish that in the one in a Wired magazine called the wine enthusiast and 26:00 got out of the trade and then our phone started ringing. And that was really kind of the kickoff of I mean, you all know wine vodka, whiskey, anything. When it gets a good rating you want to you want it even though it has you have no idea if you like it or not because that guy over there might like something and that guy over there might like something and they\'re completely different tasting, but we got lucky and 26:24 got some publicity and that\'s kind of when it started so the phone started ringing and then it kind of not really took off but that was the that was the the the genesis of this whole thing I think when that when that was which was pure luck really as far as getting in that tasting and a lot of this is luck, believe me. And when what was what was the move over when you when you chose to partner with Buffalo Trace. What was your thinking behind going to partner with Buffalo Trace? 26:57 Well, they actually knocked on my door a year before 27:00 We hooked up and bought it because they own they own one of our brands WL well or was my granddad used to work for Mr. Weller here in Louisville. And the audio head on the brands, they ran all those brands brands into the brand, pretty much because they didn\'t sell well for them. So they sold them all off and Buffalo Trace bought WL Weller, and they had had it since 1999. So 2001 they asked me to do a joint venture with them. And I wasn\'t interested because I\'ve been working by myself for myself except for my son for a long time. So 27:35 it was foreign to me to work with anybody for anybody and not especially for anybody. 27:41 But I finally smartened up after a little discussions with them, and I knew that I wasn\'t making whiskey for the future. I was buying aged bourbon, which was available back then but down the road. It\'s the way you have to think in the bourbon market. Our business plan is 23 years long. I don\'t know what you all 28:00 Do but we have the longest business plan and next next to a lumber person who grows an 80 year old white oak tree, it\'s pretty incredible. So I needed future whiskey to put down for the future. So that\'s why mainly we hooked up with them. Plus they were making Weller and same formula as ours, which was still our my grandfather\'s formula. So it was a it was a it was a great moment so it and it\'s been a great relationship and and there you know with their soon as we hooked up with them the marketing and the sales force and the promotion. That\'s, you know, it\'s a little bit overdone, I guess, because we really don\'t need to market this brand. But 28:40 we did back in the day and it\'s it\'s taken off and 28:45 it\'s it\'s it\'s been incredible. It really has but you know No, Sazerac Buffalo Trace has really been a big part of it. And it doesn\'t hurt that Harlan weeklies the best distiller of American whiskey. Now he\'s pretty good. He\'s won a lot of awards. 29:00 person wins a lot of awards. Yeah, he runs he runs a tight ship he\'s actually a real master distiller you know? Yes it\'s not it\'s not it\'s not the title that was given to him easily now I\'m not a marketer. So one of the things with with with the rise of Pappy and everybody you know standing in long lines there\'s there\'s there\'s been a little bit of vitriolic kind of nature come your way and carry you and I have talked about this sometimes. How does that how does that make you feel when you see like people lamenting about the fact they can\'t get a glass of Pappy or you know they\'re throwing out some kind of crazy conspiracy theory don\'t get started. Well, that\'s why we\'re here. I\'m here to get you started. Easy carry holder. Hold your lesson. I don\'t work for the distillery just so you don\'t 29:55 notice, I asked Carrie this question. 29:59 Well, I\'ll just say 30:00 I have my own company that I started six years ago with my sister\'s Pappy and Company, which is the merchandise side of our of our business. And so we get a lot of inquiries, just just because we\'re obviously within the family realm of business. And so there\'s a lot of haters out there, and it\'s very easy to respond to those haters. And my, what I say is that, you know, I think when people understand the nature of the business and the nature of our brand, it becomes very clear that, you know, I would love for you to be an appreciator and respect your of the brand and understand it. And so I think the easiest thing to tell people is that if you think about, you know, the youngest age that we bottle is 10 years and it goes up to 23 years so not many other people have to, to plan ahead in that kind of 30:54 increments. So when I think they realized that this is not an intentional thing that we 31:00 Done, we haven\'t intentionally held back product to increase demand we have not worked with or they have not worked with a marketing team to create anything. It\'s literally creating a product that you believe in and the rest happens naturally and organically. So we\'re no cold brand that we tried to create. It\'s literally like we\'ve said from the very beginning putting your head down and working and so when people really understand that and see that it\'s nothing about marketing, you know, the world we live in is so faithful of just creating a brand and creating this fake story behind it and going out there and selling it. It\'s like, we are caught up in that and so I can understand that maybe if you don\'t know enough about the brand that that\'s your first instinct is to completely judge and say oh, it\'s, you know, there, it\'s intentional and you learn a little bit more. It\'s very easy to then be appreciator of the brand. Now Preston, you actually deal with the haters on a regular basis. What\'s it like daily 31:59 there 32:00 There are a lot of misconceptions with our brands. There\'s a lot of 32:06 there are a lot of people that I guess are, 32:09 for lack of a better term, but hurt that they can\'t get our product. So 32:14 they would rather spew hatred than just accept the reality that this has happened organically. It\'s not 32:23 it\'s it wasn\'t an intentional thing that we\'ve created. Artificial demand people accuse of accuse us of creating artificial demand to increase prices will. We\'re not the ones benefiting from these crazy aftermarket prices. It\'s the retailers that are benefiting it\'s the the people that are illegally buying and selling via Craigslist and Facebook and stuff that are benefiting it\'s not us. And it would be asinine to hold that product 32:57 that we could profit from selling 33:00 In order to, again artificially create demand, it\'s just it is what it is. We\'re not making chairs or fidget spinners. We\'re making 10 to 23 year old bourbon. So it takes time. Nobody could have anticipated the explosion and demand for for bourbon in general, but especially premium Bourbons and our Bourbons, especially 33:25 1520 years ago, we would have mattered from a production standpoint. So we basically got caught with our pants down. So we can\'t, we can\'t catch up instantly. We\'re we are trying to catch up we\'ve got more 1012 and 15 year old than we\'ve ever had, but it\'s still a drop in the bucket compared to demand. Demand is going up like this while supply is kind of ratcheting up Yeah, at a slower pace and we are increasing production every year, but we\'re doing so at a 34:01 What you would what most would consider a pretty conservative rate, because of this whole thing goes to put if this whole bourbon boom goes bust, we don\'t want to be sitting on top of a Laker whiskey we can\'t sell we\'ve been on that side of the coin. And that\'s basically what forced my grandfather to sell oil or in the early 70s was nobody cared about bourbon at that point. So we don\'t want to be on that side of the coin. And actually, Julian, your father gave an interview to the North Carolina newspaper in the 1970s saying that if you think you can, you can sell 5000 bottles, make 2000 if you think you could sell 10,000 make 5000 so it seems to be like very much ingrained in the DNA of the van winkles to make less than the demand is, it is it\'s obviously when you\'re when you grew up with something and that\'s in the back of your head. 35:00 You know, Pappy always said fine bourbon profit. You know, that Yeah, yeah. But always find bourbon profit loss, whatever, but 35:10 you, I don\'t care what you do and that\'s, I can\'t I gotta keep my mouth shut here a little bit but with any product if you make too much of it and the quality goes down 35:22 your your price that you\'re going to get for it also goes down. And if you keep the quality up there and the quantity reasonable, I think your business plan is a lot better. 35:33 You know, we\'re comfortable with the business we have. We don\'t want to, we don\'t have and it\'s different. We don\'t have stockholders behind us. You\'re looking at the stockholders or some some of them right here in our company, all three or four or five or six of us. 35:49 It\'s you, you, you know, you hit we don\'t have anybody to answer to so that\'s the problem with the big companies. They have to make money. Quality goes down. So that\'s 36:00 And we\'re not gonna, we\'re not going to do that. So what is the what is the relationship with Buffalo Trace from a business perspective? Can they dictate to you your whiskey supply where you store your barrels? It\'s complicated, but basically we we own the brand. We own 51% of our brands. So it\'s a it\'s a joint venture. So it\'s all one big happy family. So if there\'s big business decision to be made, we have the final word on it. So when they\'re when they\'re distilling the weighted bourbon recipe, is it Pappy Van Winkle day and they put it in there or is it all Weller and Pappy Van Winkle day and then you guys get barrels and you just choose where? How does that work? We production as we production and then within the Buffalo Trace campus, there are certain warehouses there are certain spots within certain warehouses that have shown over decades 36:55 that they produce the best 36:59 finished product 37:01 Especially at our age statements. 37:06 So we get first crack at the best of the best of the barrels. So when a barrel is produced at Buffalo Trace with the weeded recipe, it\'s not earmark necessarily for Weller, or 10 year old rip or 15 year old Pappy or 23 year old Pappy or whatever. It\'s more about where it ends up in a warehouse based on 37:28 space constraints and with they\'re building two new warehouses a year for the next 10 years. 37:36 So the tune of about $1.2 billion. So so what I just heard there is that William William Murray, well, our cash drink was not good enough to be happy. 37:49 Not necessarily. No, that\'s not what I heard. Okay, well, not necessarily. 37:55 There are guys giving me the evil eye. There are certainly barrels that we reject. 38:00 jack that on their own would be just fine. Yeah. But they\'re just not up to our I don\'t want to say standards. But our palates are very laser focused on 38:16 our products people have described both of us as having these amazing, amazing palettes but why we need to get involved. It\'s it\'s more that our palates are laser focused on 38:30 what we produce, and why we have what we like and what we like. 38:36 We\'re very fortunate that other people seem to enjoy the same things that that we like. I do. I do believe that there is a there is a gift and the palette of being able to blend be able to mingle, two or three barrels or five barrels, whatever, to make a batch. A lot of people can pick a single barrel but to create like a batch. That\'s again, 39:00 That\'s a gift. Julian does Preston have the does he have the types of the same touches you he\'s he\'s always had it and I noticed that from the get go but you will find this out someday as you get older your flavor 39:16 ability to smell and taste goes away a little bit so 39:21 and of course we\'re all different our DNA is different but he\'s really good at it and you know, I\'m thankful to have him and the staff at Buffalo Trace who do it every single day taste different different whiskeys but it\'s quite a it\'s quite an honor. And he\'s got it. He\'s got a got a nice little palette. What about Carrie Have you brought her in on the phone? Not yet, but she\'s I think she\'s, she\'s looking forward to getting in there someday. What do we gotta do Carrie? What do we got to do? 39:50 I don\'t know but she lives in Idaho. 39:54 It starts with moving died for to provide a home to Kentucky don\'t Louise live here. So that\'s true. You can 40:00 Get to the triplets. Yeah, if you all died tomorrow What would you do? You know, we got to start learning. Oh, 40:06 thanks 40:09 Karen you got a plan we need to know about healer. 40:13 No, I know I just you know, the more she talks the more I think she\'s gonna bump us off 40:19 I just you know, I just know we have three valuable pallets on the sidelines we can always learn learn that palette you know I do it is or just all joking. Oh, here here\'s an idea. Here\'s an idea. You could you could get you could come out with a new brand. Call it triplet, Van Winkle, tequila, tequila. 40:42 Tequila drinkers before they drink bourbon, no triplet tequila brand. 40:48 carries why you\'re not being asked to join these paddles. 40:54 It doesn\'t taste like tequila. 40:57 In 2013 I was a 41:00 I was a rookie judge on the San Francisco world spirits competition. I tasted this bourbon and we tasted a lot of different Bourbons and our meditation one I was like, I bet that\'s Pappy it\'s really fucking good. I hope it doesn\'t win. Even though I voted for it to win it because of the Pappy hype, right? I didn\'t want more Pappy hysteria. And sure enough, it was it was the Pappy Van Winkle 15 year old. This happens to be my favorite expression that you all put out. Is it yours to carry? Do you have a favorite expression of Pappy that\'s 41:35 honestly I love bourbon. I love our bourbon, but I honestly don\'t get to drink enough of it to be able to give a really strong opinion on that. But she still would like to be a taster. Yeah. 41:48 I have a lot to learn. But I do appreciate it very much. I think I know someone you can learn from. Right, right. So you don\'t have a favorite expression of your family\'s heritage. I mean 42:00 Honestly, truthfully, I, I don\'t get to drink it enough to really be able to pick up on that. I do know that I think he drinks at all before she gets a chance to I think I\'ve had most recently like the 20 year and I\'m like, Oh yeah, I\'m like, No wonder people love it. I like that is insanely delicious. It\'s like dessert to me. And so I think I probably would go not for the 15 year because it\'s a little hot for me. So I probably go with the 20 year if I had to give Okay, well, there we go. We have something to say. There we go. So, in the bourbon business, they like to say, when you ask them, How should you drink it? They usually say drink it however you like. So I\'m going to ask everyone up here. Is it okay to drink Pappy? 23 year old with Coca Cola 42:50 maybe Mexican coke. It\'s pretty good with that. 42:54 But no. 42:57 No, pushing it. That\'s pushing it exactly. 43:00 But I don\'t know why you would. Fred, what are you doing? 43:06 Yes, if you\'ve got a word, you\'re gonna push back. If you\'ve got a 43:12 few cases of 23 year old Pappy, and you got the money to burn, hey, whatever. But otherwise why would you? Why would you want to do that? You could get a perfectly good bottle of four year old bourbon to mix with your go. I\'ll just say that I guess a lot of other people besides us take it a lot more seriously than we do. And so I\'ll just say you know people, especially with Pappy and company, we make cocktails and mixed drinks and people kind of can give us a bad rap for that. It\'s like you know what, we love old fashions. We love Manhattan\'s we like bourbon cocktails we like all kinds of mixed drinks and so there\'s no harm in that so people definitely will be will say that to mix anything with any of our products. Even ice is wrong, but it\'s so 44:00 not wrong. What\'s the future for? For old Rip Van Winkle? Can we see a distillery? Are we going to continue on the same model? Are you talking to dad and breasted or me? 44:12 Are you going to start a distillery? 44:15 It\'s way too expensive. 44:17 We\'re good. Thanks. I would have done it a long time ago. But 44:23 you know, if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it. I would like to. But 44:28 we\'re definitely could change some distilling at Buffalo Trace to differentiate the Buffalo. I\'m in the van Winkle from the Weller for sure. We\'re working on that. So To be continued, but 44:42 it\'s a it\'s a huge proposition and tons of money and you can go broke aging whiskey for 23 years is all I gotta say. So there\'s a lot of craft distillers out there, and they will soon find out what it takes to hold on to whiskey for a long period of time. Well, no, not only that, 45:00 But like starting a distillery, you\'re looking at like an entirely new 45:06 machine making your product and you\'re like, it\'s a gamble. You know, who knows what\'s going to be any good? Exactly yeast distilling equipment, it\'s all changes everything. So people say well just make it over there. We made it there. You can\'t do that water used equipment, copper, stainless. It\'s a lot of variables. So staying on the future of Pappy, we talked about pricing a little bit. And I was just at an option. I emceed an option at the speed museum on Thursday, where a lot of Pappy went for $17,500 little bit of change there that someone wanted to spend on some Pappy. And the market continually shows that it will, it will bear 45:55 you could triple your your MSRP and the market would still accept it. 46:00 Is there any thought about increasing your price, your MSRP we\'ve 46:06 we\'ve taken price increases, 46:10 like every other year is kind of been our model. 46:14 At a, again, a pretty conservative rate. 46:19 Our feeling is these brands were built on the backs of people who were willing to spend them the money on a on a product that 46:30 was more expensive than the average bourbon. 46:35 And 46:37 now it\'s gotten to the point where you know when 50 or 60 or 80 bucks was kind of the top end that people were willing to spend on a bourbon. 46:49 Those people are now spending 200 300 400 $500 on a bottle. 46:57 We don\'t want to price those people 47:00 out of the market for our products. 47:05 So, but still Yeah, still a slim chance they\'re gonna give it though. Yeah, we want to leave it out there. We\'ve actually just we\'ve taken a very minor price increase that will hit stores this year. It\'s still nothing compared to the Craigslist prices and the aftermarket prices, whatever. 47:25 But it\'s the assholes in the retail shops and on Craigslist that are making all the money not us. So if if they\'re going to charge that they\'re going to charge whatever they\'re going to charge. We can\'t control it legally anyway. We\'re doing okay. 47:41 We\'re going to continue to price where we see where we think that the suggested retail price should be. 47:50 And hope that retailers will fall in line we\'ve we in Buffalo Trace have taken some steps to kind of curb the the secondary 48:00 Market Wait, what? What steps have you taken? Like, there are a lot of lot of dollars being thrown from a legal standpoint and getting Facebook groups shut down. So you all you all contribute it to shutting down the Facebook secondary markets. Yeah. 48:22 It\'s illegal first Firstly, it\'s illegal. And secondly, it makes it harder for these folks to get a bottle at a fair price which also has no sat right with us. You also don\'t know what you\'re getting in a bottle because there are tons of counterfeiters. So if you take one thing away from this little loud conference here to having today 48:45 thank god Our music is good. 48:49 If you buy something on the secondary market, you cannot guarantee what\'s going to be in that bottle. So our business was spread on word of mouth, if you will, please spread this one. 49:00 Don\'t buy on the secondary market because you cannot guarantee what\'s in that bottle because the counterfeiters are really good if they would put their effort into a legal deal they\'d be billionaires but they choose to be illegal and 49:15 you don\'t know what you\'re going to get because 1500 bucks to get one of those capsules spinners and it costs probably another three or 400 bucks to get a box of those capsules, foil capsules 49:28 and if you\'re selling 49:31 zero dollar whiskey for 49:35 three grand it\'s a pretty good investment if your if your account you could get on eBay right now and find empty bottles of Pappy 49:45 and they\'re gonna be filled someday. Yeah, so for sure anybody got a good eBay account I could partner with you on for these two bottles. 49:57 smashing. I was joking actually. I can 50:00 You are alive. What about that yet? You really take very seriously Yeah, I actually had a consumer email me the other day and said, Hey, I found a case of empties. 50:13 Can I send them to you for a second life? We don\'t have any there\'s nothing we can do with them legally. So I just asked them to either scrape off the labels or smash the bottles to avoid them ending up on the secondary market because there are countless instances of people selling a bottle on eBay and that exact same bottle ending up on Craigslist or in a Facebook group for sale again for selling an empty and then that full bottle reappears. If you could, if you could be in a room with a known counterfeiter, 50:50 one on one 50:52 who was reselling 50:55 Why would you say or do to that person 51:00 would get arrested 51:03 at the end of it 51:05 it would Yeah, I\'d be ugly. Wow. 51:10 a gallon of Chautauqua 51:13 could shut 51:16 down his throat or her throat or so do Yeah, yeah, I just make him drink the whole bottle of whatever rock they put in the bottle and hope that it was voiceprints 51:28 Wow. We\'re like we\'re deadly serious about this. It is just trying to protect our customer. Yeah, it\'s all over and the week we put out of what we feel is a high quality product and for somebody else to 51:44 benefit from that assumed quality when there is none is disheartening. I hear that, you know, the other side is for a lot of like consumers. You know, there\'s a lot of people who will never get in reach or be able to 52:00 buy a bottle, it\'s just very difficult to buy one. And, you know, they\'re those secondary markets, you know, for some people that provided that opportunity in some ways. I mean, what do you think about that I gave in some ways it could have been like an extension it\'s real though right? if if if it\'s real so like, do you do you feel like there\'s a solution there because it because I know you want to protect customers, but there\'s not a lot of happy to get to the customers and that\'s that\'s been the hard part. It\'s a fine line it really is. We hate to turn down you know, hated the people don\'t get to enjoy our whiskey as it will go to a bar where they sell it for a decent price. You can try it, you know, because it\'s more, sometimes more available in a bar, but it is a fine line. We have to tread there. So we\'re just trying to convince people to be careful and not go to the secondary market cuz I mean, you know the thing in 52:58 Costa Rica or somewhere Haiti 53:00 Somewhere where it was somewhere in the Caribbean there were the people were poisoned by people literally dying for their thing. You know, a minibar, it was poison so that\'s the best the bad part. Well, it happens every day all over the world, somebody dying from illicit alcohol. It just doesn\'t get reported because it wasn\'t an American tourist at a no inclusive resort in the Caribbean. It happens every single day in the UK, India, Russia, all over the world. 53:31 Well, I\'ve been giving the that sign which means I have to close in here and we were just kind of get in some good stuff. And Julian I always love being on the stage with you. You\'re a fun person to talk to on the stage. Pressing carry things is the first time we\'ve interacted like this and you guys are awesome.

Drink responsibly 56:12 All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to bourbon beyond this right here is the bourbon pursuit Roundtable. We are joined here with my podcasting partner Kenny Coleman. And we\'ve got Brian sip of corn Blake that also known as Cal Ripken of bourbon or, and Jordan from bait breaking bourbon, and of course, our MC and master taster for old Forester, Jackie ziketan. What\'s up everybody? Yo, 56:43 hey, I mean, I don\'t know about you all. I think our age is starting to show my back\'s already hurt. And I know about you all. It\'s been a long few days. But last night is standing up for a while heard a little bit but 56:55 I\'m wondering Hey Jackie does being barefooted help you with the backend stuff as it helps 57:00 ground and Sunday. Yeah, you know, the Barefoot the Barefoot movement is real. I learned about this and I these things are practically barefoot. So anyway, so we\'re at bourbon and beyond, and everybody out here has is on a panel or has been on the stage. And we\'ve all been moderators or MC the whole time. And I just want to get a quick thought of what, what you\'ve learned or what were some of your takeaways from your panels, or what you\'ve listened to. I\'ll start with you, Brian. Sure. I did the whiskies dark past and the the amount of knowledge that we had from Chris Morris and Bernie lovers and Susan regular was just amazing. You I don\'t think you can get three more knowledgeable people on stage at once. And we focused on lawlessness, I sort of focus on the law. So it was the opposite of what I normally do. But it was it was great and a great opportunity to have that. So thanks, Fred. What what was a good juicy story that came out of there? Well, I thought Chris 58:00 was going to going to say that the prohibition style 1920 evoked the lawlessness and he actually went the opposite direction and said brown Forman is focusing on law on them being within the law during Prohibition and having one of the medicinal licenses. So that was the one thing that surprised me but the the juiciest things I think came from Bernie and Susan about George Ramis. And that\'s where you really get into the murders. You got a guy who goes to jail during Prohibition, gets out, murders his wife in front of everybody in Cincinnati, and gets off on one of the first uses of the insanity defense. So a lot of great stories on the lawlessness side of bourbon. That\'s what we consider a great story. Yeah. What one other thing is that brown, brown Forman actually bought bourbon from George Remus through his secretary after he was in jail. So the government would allow people what they would seize the bootleggers. 59:00 barrels and then sell them back to distillers. So I think that this the the government was really double dip and makin prohibition, probably triple dipping. Sure they would tax it after that. That\'s right or chance. So, Blake, what have you What have you learned out here today? Yes, today\'s my seminar is still to come this afternoon. So you\'ll get to hear me twice today which I\'m sure is exciting. But so it\'s going to be on sweet match for sour mash. And we have Pat Heiss promoter and his trail and then Caleb from peerless, so. I\'m excited for that one. But you know, all the seminars have been great. I think there was a lot of stuff that popped up in the master distiller paying on Friday as well as the Van Winkle one, you know, that one. 59:42 Definitely had a lot of cool details coming out of it. So it\'s been it\'s cool just to see people kind of up close and a little more laid back setting where give somebody some bourbon and you don\'t always get the same PR answer as you may get in a normal and you let the secret start flowing. Yeah, that\'s what we want. 1:00:00 That\'s that\'s kind of really that\'s kind of been my vision and curating these panels, get people drunk. 1:00:06 They would reinforce 1:00:09 people talk and you know it, they\'re they\'re very different. And you can\'t 1:00:15 it\'s not like a camera interview or anything like that. It\'s not to say that we\'re trying to get gotcha questions or anything. But, you know, I, the the, the distilleries don\'t always realize that their marketing goes against them, because they don\'t let the real stories come out. And the real stories to me are always so much better. I\'m curious what you like I didn\'t get to catch the master distiller one was there, was there a good real story in there that really caught your attention? You know, I think just the question was brought up about should there be like a union of master distillers or what does that really mean? And you hear them all just kind of the respect is like, No, we don\'t need a union, but we don\'t want somebody just popping up and using the name as well. Like 1:01:00 masters just somebody has all this experience and then I think it was in this one but the kind of the quote that stands out to me is trip Simpson from barrel bourbon. He says you know garbage in garbage out like you gotta as a master you gotta know the process from beginning to end and doesn\'t doesn\'t just stop at distillation or in the barrel and so just you know they have to oversee the entire process which is interesting. It most of them say that the proof is in their whiskey Yeah, right that\'s what they want to say it and maybe they should also keep a shame list if they want to make sure that there\'s this list Yeah, well that take the name like this just all back back store kind of stories between him. Yeah, you MC the what is a master distiller? I did, what was that like for you? It was good. You know, it\'s it\'s a good melting of minds of everybody that we\'ve had on the podcast before to come up and kind of talk but also in more of a laid back way. You know, for me, it wasn\'t more or less just getting answers out of them, but it was also seeing the crowd and kind of having them have an opportunity to build 1:02:00 Let\'s see like, Oh, these are the people like these are the stories behind that the whiskey that they\'re drinking every single day. And I think for me, I love being able to see the the crowd out here and be able to really harness and get some more those inside details. I think that\'s really the coolest part because we\'re able to bring a lot of the information from really what\'s happening inside kind of share that with the world. And they have an opportunity to really understand what goes on behind some of these doors that you know, when Jackie sitting here trying to taste and figure out Oh, what\'s this year\'s all for the birthday bourbon going to be like, you know, we can be able to share that. And that\'s really what the opportunity here is able to make that happen. Now, Jordan, I know you\'ve been watching, you\'ve got a panel today, right? Yeah, my panel is going to be right after this. Stick around. You got the old fashioned versus a Manhattan. I do. And this is one where everyone\'s always asking me like what\'s your favorite cocktail? And there\'s this huge debate in like the bartending world of what is better for bourbon. Is it the old fashion or Manhattan so where are you where 1:03:00 Are you going to take this? What can we expect you where you\'re going to push one way or the other? I don\'t know. You know, I think everyone really has their own favorite right personal preference. Both are great. But I think there\'s a lot of variation talks. There\'s no set until that party line. He\'s making a hard push for vodka soda, so that\'s gonna be okay, listen, no more. 1:03:20 The stage, it\'s better. We all need Manhattan. No, no, okay, no, no. Sorry, yeah, but I\'m gonna say this. 1:03:28 Say this later. And I\'m gonna cross that line and back and forth multiple times a day. But in my previous life before being a part of the old forester team, I was a beverage director and I had to train bartenders across different states across different bars. And I would always tell them what their Manhattan so and with any cocktail you stirred, you taste it to make sure your delusions correct, right. You taste you tasting, tasting, until you get to the point where the Manhattan where it tastes like absolute shit. And then you did it right. Because that\'s Manhattan. 1:03:56 Wow. We\'re starting 1:03:59 it 1:04:03 A dual behind stage here after this. And that concludes old fashioned Merce Manhattan. Wow. So you\'ve also been watching the seminars what\'s caught your eye? Yeah, I think there\'s been you know, this festival has been great, great music, great talks. I think we had Kenny Europe here yesterday with Wes Anderson dropping some, some knowledge about the forthcoming bottle and bond ride for angels, me rock, angels me. And it\'s just been a great place to you know, here\'s the music in the background. You\'re gonna hear a lot of good influential bourbon things, but it\'s also one of the few festivals. Go back to the big bourbon 10 grab a bourbon master distillers just walking around, they just want to say hi, grab a drink. It\'s awesome. It\'s a definitely one of the few places that you can see something like this. So I\'m glad we\'re all here to experience that. Now, the one of the panels I moderated was with the Van Winkle family, and they dropped all the juice 1:04:55 came out they of course Preston Van Winkle said that 1:05:00 They had hired lawyers and work with Facebook to shut down the secondary market. What\'s everybody\'s take on that? How long is this panel? 1:05:09 No, we\'re not on the radar. I\'ll jump in. It\'s something we\'ve discussed a lot and that was always kind of the rumor you know, not the rumor in Buffalo Trace as our company would always say, you know, they hated the secondary market and all this stuff so to get the confirmation that Yeah, they\'re spending millions of dollars 1:05:31 i don\'t think you know, we are in the bourbon. I always call it nerd world of people who talk way too much about it, but I don\'t think they like that, you know, love it or hate the secondary market. It helped build a lot of these brands and build a lot of the hype and everything else. So then you\'re also attacking it at the same time and I always go back to if I can\'t find a bottle at retail, so my only option is just not to drink it at all because the supply is just so small compared to the demand. It 1:06:00 least you know, you could have that secondary market and nobody likes flipping but it was a lot more than that. Well, and I think people always assumed that they liked the secondary market because no one would buy well or special reserve if it weren\'t for the secondary market and the hype, the artificial hype. That\'s why I think it\'s important that we separate Sazerac from the Van Winkle family. I think, I think I think it\'s very important here because what I what I took away from, from that conversation yesterday, that they really felt the secondary market damage them and they felt that they were were victims of retailers jacking the prices up and everything and they didn\'t have a solution other than go to the bar, but at the same time, Preston kept saying, like, we\'re not the ones getting that money. We\'re not the ones getting that money. And, and then they brought up counterfeiting. So I think that was interesting, right? I think there was a little bit 1:07:00 is clear they want to get some of that money. But more so when you you know, when you read some of the blowback online today, it was a lot of folks were wondering and someone spending the money on lawyers shut down the secondary, put that money towards counterfeiting measures try and make bottles a little bit safer, it\'s going to take place no matter what you might as well make it safer for the consumers that they know what they\'re getting is actually going to be the product they put out, like put your resources towards something that\'s going to do well for the consumer. Katie, I\'ve only like I haven\'t really been online to see what the response has been other than like a who\'s tagged me on Twitter, but what\'s it What\'s it been like? I know you track that stuff. Within a few hours after posting I think we had almost 200 comments on the picture of people kind of given their their take on it. And you know, I think what Preston said and being able to go against counterfeiting is is it\'s a real thing. If anybody actually tries to go out there, there\'s counterfeit bourbon on the market. People can buy foils from China and you can reseal and you can do a lot of different stuff. And they do that. Now when I look at it, I thought the the secondary market was healthy. 1:08:00 But it\'s also become unhealthy. You know, if he says that we\'re trying to stop counterfeits, and, you know, maybe that is one portion of it. And and I think another part is saying that he wants the money or somebody has to have that money. Well, the end of the day, the way this is going to work out, it\'s just the retailers are going to make the money because if they\'re going to be pricing it at secondary prices, they\'re the ones making the money. Now I see potentially the future of how this could eventually shift is if the three tier system has a rapid change, and there\'s more direct from the manufacturer to the consumer market available. Yeah, but the retail industry is going to block that and the wholesale industry will block that as much as they can. What one thing that I also took away from 1:08:46 from the van winkles was how how much anger there was toward this subject. I mean, I don\'t know if you could feel it, but I could feel I could feel it coming off. 1:09:00 I mean, it was 93 degrees out here. Yes, yeah. 1:09:03 Right. He was he was really. And he It\'s like he wanted to get that off of his chest. He really did, which I\'m sure they get a ton of blowback from all of that of people mad that they can\'t find their bourbon. And then, you know, it\'s kind of the easy target is to say, Oh, I can\'t find Pappy Van Winkle. Because the secondary market, you know, whether or not that\'s true, I\'m sure they, you know, I\'d be frustrated too. I just think it was probably a, you know, maybe not where they wanted to aim the anger directly at the secondary market. I think there\'s a plug or a lot of other issues behind that. Then just recently, well, and you have to remember to so Pappy is about to drop pretty soon in the coming weeks and months. So there, you know, they must be going to constantly, we\'re not gonna be able to find it. It\'s too expensive, and that just probably boils up right towards the fall. So that\'s all bubbling towards the top of their mind right now. And it was it was just prime time for that to come out. I\'m very glad they came on the stage because you know, they didn\'t 1:10:00 too, and you know, they knew I was going to. I didn\'t share the questions with them, but they\'ve been with me before and they know that I asked questions so you\'d like to throw a few curveballs once in a while. 1:10:13 But Preston did admit that he would probably commit a felony if he got in a room with counterfeiter. And Kenny. We have an upcoming podcast with a with a admitted counterfeiter who was caught. 1:10:31 Yeah, it\'s gonna be a juicy one. Yeah, it you know, when when we were having that conversation with press in that interview that we had with him just kept coming into my mind, you know, of like, of all the things that we saw in the secondary market on counterfeiting. Where do you think we are when it comes to counterfeiting? Is the secondary market going away help it or does it hurt it? I personally think it might hurt the efforts to stop 1:11:00 counterfeiting because there\'s a pretty good little police force out there. And that\'s what I think most people don\'t understand. If you\'re not deep into the bourbon world as we are that there are pockets of people that this is what they spend their time and their hobby doing is actually chasing counterfeits. Now they\'re no part of any legal entity or anything like that, like, that\'s what they do. They love to be able to shop around on eBay, because if you can go on eBay, you\'ll see empty bottles of Pappy Van Winkle that you can buy. nobody\'s buying bottles for $50 and make lamps out of alum sorry, right. They\'re not doing that right there. They\'re going away with a purpose. And so what you can do is they spend the time tracking those serial numbers and seeing where they end up and then they go and basically flame those people that end up ektron to sell them at some point, right? And they try to trace it back and figure out exactly where the route actually came from. So there is a there\'s already a good self policing community that\'s already with inside of bourbon today. So Julian after the seminar was over, he pulled out a pot big friggin pocket knife. 1:12:00 onstage and started cutting the labels. He\'s like, this is how we prevent it. I was like, How the hell did you get that through security? 1:12:08 But yeah, so I think I think this is a, this is going to influence our, our kind of our little community, you know, quite a bit. And for them to come out publicly that they helped shut it down was really something another thing that was a first this this was the first public appearance, Marianne eaves, since she had left castle and key. Did any anybody catch her talk to her while she was on stage? I got to talk to her back behind her a little bit. It seems like everything\'s going great. She\'s got an upcoming TED Talk, which is amazing, right? I mean, I think being able to have that honor is is it\'s an incredible experience and, you know, happy for her and be able to do that. And, you know, I think we\'re all excited to kind of just see what happens next. And she\'s had some great experience since she left 1:13:00 With with rum and tequila and traveling around and and I think we\'ll see here in a lot of different places in the future. And of course she\'s on a round table alarm so we\'re always rooting for Marianne. So I got a question for you all. So we got we got some people out here and you know, we were actually there was when we had the Van Winkle thing out there, there was the we sample 15 year, right? It was amazing opportunity, amazing experience now, not everybody\'s gonna be able to get that opportunity, right. So let\'s go ahead and everybody can kind of give a if you can\'t get Pappy, what\'s the next best bourbon that you can drink? There\'s always those articles that come out and they say, here\'s here\'s, here\'s five Bourbons better than Pappy or real talking accessible Bourbons. Yes, let\'s do that for the crowd. And for people who have been think that they want to try it, but they might want some some steps, they\'ll be able to like get down that path. So it\'s only in six markets. So maybe that doesn\'t make it completely accessible but for those of you who are here from out of state 1:14:00 Kentucky is one of the markets. Four roses has a new, small batch select is what they call it 204 proof, it\'s about $50. It\'s I think it\'s my top new bourbon of the year, you should be able to find it. And again, the six markets, it competes with some really tough Bourbons. My, maybe one of my second favorites is old forester 1920, which is a higher proof, then than that. So you you really got to go to which profile you prefer, but if you haven\'t had the small batch select yet, that\'s what I\'d go for. Yeah, I think it\'s, you know, it\'s pretty tough comparison because when we\'re talking about weighted Bourbons with a lot of age on it, there\'s just not much on the market that compares or is anywhere near available. But what I would suggest is wilderness trail actually has a weeded bourbon that they\'re releasing. And it\'s, you know, obviously on the age there\'s, it\'s not even close because I think they\'re, they\'re bottling around for four to five years, but 1:15:00 We were there the other day and really great product. So if you need a weighted bourbon and looking for something a little higher proof, I\'d say give wilderness trail a try. I think you also because you made poor man\'s Pappy famous. So you got to talk about Really? What is it make or what what are the components of Forman\'s, Pappy and then and can you even find those components? I know that\'s the thing you can\'t even make a ninja comes in Yeah, yeah so so this was I wrote a blog post probably I think it\'s around 2013 about the poor man\'s Pappy I don\'t know if I came up with the actual name I\'m pretty sure I did but I definitely stole the blend from somebody else and put my own name on it but it\'s just 60 part or 60% well or 12 I what we just talked about counterfeiting 1:15:47 know so it\'s a it\'s a blend of 60% well or 12 and 40% well or antique and you know, you get somewhere around that 10 year mark and around the hundred and seven proof or excuse me 1:16:00 Hunger proof, whatever it is, I need to look at the article but so then 1:16:06 yeah, I tried to take things and 1:16:09 get it it\'s really hard to remember your own writing. So it is yeah. So take it a step earlier is I put a blind tasting together of the, you know a fresh Pappy or, you know fake Pappy. So and then you know well or 12 real Pappy and then version that I put in a Blendtec and blend it up. And every single time I\'ve done this, the blended bourbon like literal blended bourbon has won the blind taste in so I don\'t know what it is the aeration, whatever it is, you know, also stole that from a master taster saying yes, it talked about what does aeration do to it because I it was funny because we had a blind taste off. And I think you sent us 10 samples, and we were like, Damn, this is really good. And then you pulled it out and it was literally like from a ninja blender. 1:17:00 bourbon in it. So if you want a 4000 gallon ninja blender, we need that. Yeah, so some of my favorite barrels in the warehouse are actually the lowest yield barrels because they\'ve had so much headspace so much air space in there. And there are some arguments out there that once you\'ve gone through the distillation process, your liquid in and of itself has been oxidized to the point that it could ever be oxidized after going through all of the industrial process. Once you get into the barrel, though, what they\'re not taking into consideration is the extraction of different compounds from that actual wood and creating new compounds that can then also the oxidized so I love the low yield barrels if I could just mingle all the low yield barrels together into a blend which may or may not be coming Monday, exactly what\'s going on. So the same way that you would decant a really heavy tannic red wine to soften out that tannin. The exact same thing that\'s going on when you\'re going through a blender at home with your By the way, I just want to I want to say something about Jackie she\'s a champion for the people wouldn\'t 1:18:00 Whiskey my pic for like one of the one of the every it\'s not a bourbon it\'s a rides the old forced to ride I\'m just in love with the old forced to ride right now and I would buy that I do I buy cases regularly unfortunately. 1:18:15 And horrible problem. I have an old horse arrived problem. But one of the things that\'s really cool about that rye whiskey is it\'s $23 and her management wanted to actually make it be like double or triple the price right? And she bought for it to be $23 like she like intimidated presidents and vice presidents of brown Forman to keep it at $23 not that scary 1:18:44 now but I think it\'s very, isn\'t that awesome? The mafioso or the mafia? have voted for 1:18:51 Jackie O straight cut, you know it will not. 1:18:56 I know I know. But I think it\'s very important for us to stand strong. 1:19:00 is a brand that has always long been known as the sort of like, really great quality product but doesn\'t have to be a fuss about it. So old forester is known as like one of the best things for your buck, and we need to stay consistent with that, regardless of what the trends are doing. So it\'s locals house bourbon for those who aren\'t around here, that\'s what we call it. Yeah, but thank you for keeping it at 23 bucks. Jordan, I don\'t think you got a chance to say not because Jackie\'s here but you know, we get that question a lot from a lot of people and in terms of just available Bourbons, we often recommend 1920 it\'s, you know, it\'s about 60 bucks give or take right right around there and you can usually find in the stores and people just tend to love it. So it\'s one that you know, we tend to stock up on and breaking bourbon and introduce a lot of people to and you know, it\'s great, but really what we always tell people to is happy is going to be what you make up happy, right? So if you have a bourbon that you absolutely love, just stick with it. There\'s nothing wrong with that by what you love, drink what you love and, and don\'t let anyone else tell you what\'s going to be back to the damn brand. Change it like lower the age statement or 1:20:00 You know use a lesser quality barrels for something else. Oh god that pisses me off. 1:20:07 When they do that, I know we could have a whole grind your gears 1:20:11 never getting 1:20:14 any Coleman and this is grind your gears. Absolutely. So I\'ll kind of give my my take on that as well because you know, I think we had talked about some weeded Bourbons and stuff like that. I\'m a big fan of the maker\'s 46 private select program, the fact that there are 1001 different combinations of what\'s out there, meaning that you can go to a lot of different stores, you can sample a lot of different ones. And they have a lot of different varying profiles. The one that Larry had brought in here yesterday and and I think most of us can say that today it is probably the only bourbon that\'s out there that can probably come close that tasting. dusty ish, right? So anybody that\'s unfamiliar, dusty, it\'s, you know, 70s 80s it\'s got a tax stamp on it. Nobody knows why it has this kind of flavor profile to it. 1:21:00 hates it we\'ve been down this road before most of us up here enjoy it. However I think that the maker\'s 46 private select program gives any any consumer out there the opportunity to try something in a we did Nashville but have a lot of varying differences because they have all the different flavoring states and as a great pic. And unfortunately we\'re coming to the to the end of our 1:21:22 round table. Here we go. 1:21:25 Well, okay, okay, but you have to pick outside of old forester going to 1:21:32 catch it is. So in fairness, I drink the least of the 1920 because I drink barrel strength for a job on such a regular basis that I got to be kind of my liver. However, the 1920 1:21:44 No, it is what 1:21:49 it is. 1:21:52 But the 1920 is a very unique higher proof expression in that it actually holds balance as you dilute through it. So even if you\'re not 100 1:22:00 drinker, you can adjust it accordingly to where you want it to taste best that there\'s a lot of high proof whiskeys on the market that once you start watering it back they fall apart or defects starts to come. So tuition Yes, a lot of distillers will hide subpar barrels like you were saying they start putting someone like that just throw it in there and in some of these high proof blends because you cannot discern defects at high alcohol concentration. Now you have to pick something outside old forester 1:22:26 got to do it. 1:22:28 I wanted the single barrel pick from four roses It was a barrel strength single barrel pick it was with doc rose before I took this job and it had the best cordial cherry amazing flavor profile. It was exquisite of super super low proof it was tucked away in a nice cool spot. It\'s the Hunter S Thompson single barrel if you guys go into the docks and and try one but I have a case of it at home is it laced with LSD? No. Be cooler if it was. So we\'ve got to start getting ready for 1:23:00 The next panel but as we do that let\'s go ahead and tell everybody where to find you like social media I\'ll start first so bourbon pursuit so you can find us We are a weekly podcast you can download open up your your phone open up the your podcasting app type in the word bourbon will probably be up there in the top results.

On this episode, we blind taste our way through a series of five comparisons where we try to see if a single barrel store pick can compete with past limited editions. We see if Weller CYPB, Booker’s Rye, 2016 Four Roses Single Barrel, and Elijah Craig 18 are worth the price. We also talk about flavors we prefer over others and how to create your own small batch limited edition bourbon as well.

It is Episode 219 of 1:00 bourbon pursuit. I\'m one of your host Kenny, and we don\'t have a whole lot of news but it\'s festival season. And for bourbon pursuit, we are fortunate that we are going to be at some of the most prestigious ones around. We had a blast last weekend at hometown rising and now we are headed into bourbon and beyond weekend, the whole bourbon pursuit team is going to be there. And we have different sessions throughout the entire weekend. So make sure you go and check out the schedule so you can be there. bourbon and beyond.com. Of course Fred\'s gonna be there and he\'s scattered everywhere. But Ryan kicks things off on Friday at 1230 with beer drinkers bourbon, and I have the final session on Friday at six o\'clock pm called what is a master distiller. On Saturday, I kick off at 1225 with barrel finished versus traditional bourbon. And we\'re going to be joined on stage by all the personalities that you\'ve heard on the podcast before. So we would love to see you all there and please come say hi to us. There\'s always going to be bourbon pursuit t shirts. 2:00 Hats available at the Fred MC merchant so make sure you take a second and stop by their last week mark 65 years as Jimmy Russell being an active master distiller and now he is considered the longest tenured master distiller around Happy Anniversary Jimmy from the whole bourbon pursuit team. Maker\'s Mark is unveiling its first ever limited release bourbon that won\'t require a special trip to Loreto Maker\'s Mark wood finishing series 2019 new release, RC six will be available nationwide this fall. It marks the first of many upcoming whiskeys in the wood finishing series. As Maker\'s Mark plans to release a new one for a limited time nationwide each year. You probably already know about maker\'s 46 and the private barrel selection program that utilizes flavoring staves. This release was finished and secondary barrels containing 10 wouldn\'t staves dubbed RC six the staves made from Virgin America. 3:00 Or season for a year and a half and then baked in a convection oven. Before being introduced to the cast drink bourbon, Maker\'s Mark made 255 barrels, it\'s bottled at 108.2 proof. And you\'ll be able to find it nationwide in October with an MSRP of around $60. Not only is it festival season, but it\'s also release season. And release season means all the crazies come out. And for today\'s podcast, we look at really what that means because they\'re going to be bourbon lotteries that happen around the nation folks are camping out in parking lots. And there\'s a lot of hate around flippers and liquor store owners that are trying to get the most money out of these secondary values for these allocated Bourbons. So our goal in this episode was to see if we can help folks out there not feel the fo mo or the fear of missing out. We did our best to blindly set up samples of past limited edition Bourbons and compare them to single barrel private pics. The results are interesting, but the best part about this is that you can do this 3:59 At home, find a group of friends and get together and have a blind taste off and use some limited edition Bourbons versus some single barrels out there. Heck, if your taste buds prefer stag Junior over Big Boy George t stag, you\'re going to save yourself a lot of headache and money in the process. But you can do this as well for things like ego or 17 versus just standard single Eagle rare store pics. And there\'s a lot of them that spread the whole gamut of a lot of the big distilleries are out there. And if you ever get around to doing something like this, we would love to hear your results. Drop us a line on our Facebook page or mentioned us in your Instagram or your Twitter posts. All right, it\'s time to dive into the good stuff. Let\'s hear from Joe over a barrel bourbon. And then you\'ve got Fred Minnick with above the char. Hi, Joe from barrell bourbon here. We\'re always trying to push the envelope of blending whiskey in America. Find out more at barrell bourbon.com. 4:53 I\'m Fred Minnick, and this is above the char want to take you back in time, a time and bourbon will 5:00 wasn\'t cool when bourbon wasn\'t selling when Julian Van Winkle had to trade bottles of 23 year old Pappy, just to get a magazine advertisement. I\'m talking about the 1990s. In the 1990s there was a very important event that happened that would shape the bourbon economy for the next 20 or 30 years. And that is the Japanese market crashed. You see up until that point the Japanese market was the number one thing kind of keeping bourbon alive. You had brands being specifically developed for the Japanese such as Blanton\'s Booker\'s know as mill the entire small batch collection essentially anything that was a an ultra premium of that time was being sent to Japan because the Japanese absolutely loved and continue to love bourbon. When the market crashed. You saw how the company\'s decided to deal with it. You had some 6:00 Who decided to put their efforts on domestic sales. So heaven Hill basically shifted their efforts to focus on the southeast and throughout the United States. Jim Beam really tried to double down and like places like New York and Chicago and San Francisco, they had really concentrated programs there and united distillers, now the CEO decided to sell. Up until that moment, they had actually been making more of their weeded bourbon to sell to Japan under the Rebel Yell label to compete with jack daniels. They had this excess of weeded bourbon and they decided to sell it and they also decided to sell their brands. They sold Rebel Yell eventually to the company that is now Lux go. They sold it old Fitzgerald to heaven Hill, and they sold Weller the Weller brand and the stocks and the archives to SAS racks. 7:00 Those are three companies who really wanted the bourbon and they really wanted to promote it. And as we all know, that particular whiskey was quite good and made an impression on anybody who ever tasted it. And I often wonder what would have happened if united distillers decided not to sell their whiskey and their labels to three companies who really did care about promoting bourbon? I\'ve thought about that a lot. And I\'ve come to the conclusion that I don\'t think bourbon would have ever has been as hot as it is today. The reason why united distillers has always been a scotch centric company and they\'ve never put much effort into American whiskey. The exception being bullet and you know, George decal is kind of like barely, barely gets any budget, you know, at least they\'re now they\'re, they\'re paying attention to it, but that particular company has never really put a whole lot of focus on 8:00 American whiskey. So I look back on that time today as we celebrate bourbon Heritage Month. And we enjoy this incredible growth and all the fandom that we have in bourbon. I look back to the 1990s as the people who truly made the right decisions that got us to where we are today. 8:22 And that\'s this week\'s above the char. Hey, if you want to learn more about the history of bourbon, check out my book bourbon, the rise fall and rebirth of an American whiskey. Until next week. Cheers 8:37 Welcome back to the episode of bourbon pursuit the official podcast of bourbon, Kenny and Ryan here in our secondary recording studios in my basement if you\'re watching the video you you may notice the background it looks familiar. And we have a new guest on today and I\'m sure usually when people come here they\'re always like, I can\'t wait to see Kenny\'s basement through all his bottles, bottles, bottles. I like upstairs studio better. We got more room. 9:00 On the dining room table, you were a little tight down here, but we\'ll make it work. So you can see the bottles. Yeah, so when I was planning the basement I never really planned this to be like a recording space. But it kind of turned out that well now you have lights and the whole shebang. You know, it\'s like, real deal. We\'ll make it work. We\'ll make it work in the cramped space. It\'ll, that\'s how to happen. But, you know, today, today\'s topic really came as it was a good suggestion by our guests. Because when we think about the significance and what it really takes to go in chase after unicorns and limited edition releases, it\'s becoming almost it\'s been it\'s difficult. Yeah, it\'s very, very difficult. It\'s either your, I don\'t even do it. I just gave up on it. Like two or three years ago. It\'s like no, not camping. Yeah, you\'re either camping or you\'re paying secondary prices, or, you know, CP and other people are kind of like, Oh, yeah, well, I\'ve got a great relationship with the store manager. I buy everything there. And and that\'s great. But sometimes you also need to take a step back and think like, Okay, well, I 10:00 If I just keep buying a bottle of bourbon every two weeks, and I keep buying a 12 pack of beer odds are I\'m probably spending almost two months as well and I could just bought off a secondary and in my case my store relationship it caused me a probably about five to $600 in tickets to like concerts and football games and all that stuff per year so I need to add that tax on to my math whenever I\'m like I\'m getting these a cost Yeah, maybe not. Yeah, I was like that big man. We\'ve a lot be actually cost you more than the second Yeah. No doubt. That\'s definitely how it happens. But So with that, let\'s go and introduce our guest today. So today we have Mikey Conrad Mikey, welcome to the show. Welcome. Glad to be here. Yes. beautiful, magnificent basement. Yeah. See, we like to hear that it\'s all about the ambience. Right. That\'s the town. So Mikey, you know, first off, thank you for coming up with this idea because this is this is great because we get to kind of look at more of the bourbon culture side of things here. We get to look at really what does it take to look at a 11:00 Very good store, pick somebody that is from a Baroque barrel selection group, or whether they\'re stores that are very well known for it, versus chasing after those limited releases, which sometimes they\'re pretty much the same exact thing as those barrel selections just either aged longer or selected by the master distiller for various reasons, something like that. So kind of what was your your reasoning behind bringing an idea like this? Yeah, I mean that the main reason is kind of already been hinted at, like, it just got really almost ridiculous to camp to spend time, energy effort, money into chasing things that you weren\'t always sure if they were going to pan out to be what you think they\'re going to be because of everyone else telling you that you got to get this bottle. It looks pretty, you know, whatever it may be. And so you know, you start to take store pics or single barrel pics from clubs or stores or bars and you\'re like man says really 12:00 Good, this tastes better than you know the special release that came out. And so it really is just come to a simple like reality that time is something you don\'t get back. And so for a guy who\'s married, you know has three daughters. I\'m like, Man Am I am I just spend too much time trying to always chasing bourbon. Yeah, man. I mean, come on. So Miss three genetics and glasses of the past. 12:25 I mean, that\'s where some of the really practical I mean, thought came into play as like, really, like, how much time should I be spending and it\'s like, man, there\'s access to so many great stores in this area alone, Kentucky, Indiana, like man, there\'s gotta be some a better way. So yeah, that\'s what and Ryan always talks about opportunity costs. Being when you say yes to something you\'re saying no to something else. Yeah, you definitely always gotta think of the opportunity costs. It\'s that and then it\'s also you know, in the value of your time, you know, Ryan being an entrepreneur and owning a few businesses. He he has this sort of level. 13:00 Thinking, because I go back and I think of like my 2014 days of camping in front of liquor barn and being like one of the first three people there and coming away with a 23 at the end of the day. Yeah, sure. It was fun. They were good times. And now if I think about it, like what I ever do that again, like, is my time more valuable than actually waiting in line? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you gotta look at like your salary or what your earning potential is like as someone and and you\'re like, all right, I just invested nine hours to get this bottle. And it\'s, you know, 1300 1500 bucks, you\'re like, wait a minute, I could have just done my regular job and you know, done a lot better. But you know, but it\'s also fun to you got it. You can\'t discount that there\'s something in about going to the store going out for the hunt, hanging out with people to you know, get those bottles so that you can\'t totally just make it a numbers thing, but it\'s a Yeah, yeah. And nine hours is probably on the short end of the stick. Yeah, exactly. So it\'s even lower cut, you know, or even bigger opportunity costs. So, so I\'m going to talk you know, we\'re going to talk a little more about these topics as we go but one of the 14:00 things that we\'re doing today is we are going to be kind of going into a double blind here. And this is going to be store pics versus limited releases. And these are store pics that I\'ve had access to that I\'ve purchased as well as limited editions that I purchased. And honestly, I told my wife I said, Let\'s set these up. We don\'t want to know if this is an Elijah Craig pairing. If this is a four roses pairing, I don\'t really know what it is. She really want to expose us. Oh, I mean, this is gonna make us look real bad. Yeah, okay. So so we\'re going to not not only know what the brand name, the mash bill, whatever it is, but then inside of that we don\'t know which one either one or two is the limited edition or is the store pick? Yeah, so we\'re going to go through and we\'re going to start off with our first one here. We were going through so we always know number one is on our left and number two is on our right. So we\'ve got a lined up. So let\'s go ahead and kind of start 15:00 The process of nosing through these and figuring out I know what it is. Oh yeah, just by that. You\'re so fast, huh? Think it\'s a well or one of seven. You think you\'re going straight with the leader off the bat, huh? So I actually I have no idea I can I that was the first thing in my peripheral vision. 15:22 So I\'ll give you some ideas of what we have up line today. So we\'ve got on the store pick side we\'ve got a Russell\'s reserve from cork and bottle. We\'ve got a knob Creek pick that was done to knob Creek right pick that was done by Westport whiskey and wine. We\'ve got a nine year nine month OESK that was done by the North Atlanta bourbon society, which I chose that one because we\'re pairing that against a Brent face bottle which was the 20 1614 year old SK in addition to that, you know, we already said we got a well or 107 which is also cork and bottle pick versus a Weller 16:00 After perfect bourbon, which was a sample sent by Matt q six So Matt thank you so much for sending that along and hopefully we don\'t disappoint you here or hopefully hopefully we can yeah yeah 16:12 I really enjoyed the nose on this one I wasn\'t in love with the taste or finish or anything about it Mona maybe it\'s just cuz my first one 16:22 I\'m kind of with you on that one. The nose is there but what taste might be a little weird Yeah, I mean we all profile on any of those on so they\'re trying to register in my head so this is also kind of the the issue with some store pics too is that a lot of people and a lot of stores? They will they always go and they want to find something unique. Yep. And so they try to find that that off profile one and so that could be the one here that is that is the off profile side of things about you Mikey need to have a guests on me and my guess is going to be way off. That\'s okay. It\'s got my brain. Ivan land I totally just glanced over. 17:01 But there is a big drop off on the back end of this thing. Yeah. The only thing I noticed up front when I first knows it was like some cherries and always get cherry out of like Weller\'s. But 17:13 that\'s the only reason why I said that. 17:16 I don\'t know. Wow, this is actually pretty hard if I just tasted the second one. 17:22 The taste is a lot better than the SEC. Oh, yeah. The second one\'s the first one. I\'m going to go back to it because it was a little, like musty gonna, like funky? I don\'t know. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, it kind of had that weird finish to it, but I\'m like some like I said, that\'s that\'s one of those things where you know, you go into a store and that\'s what they try to do they try to differentiate it by having some unique pick like that. They taste totally different, which is crazy, like did Laurin do these right? I hope 17:52 I can\'t be 100% on that one. But I hope so. 17:57 Mikey, how many barrel pics Have you been on? I know you came with 18:00 On one. Yeah, I think, right around five, and maybe, maybe one or two more, but at least five. Yeah. Have you found to find those like off profile ones? Have you found them before, I have felt small profile ones. And my brains always go in toward the masses. Unless there happens to be a large group of folks that just wants something really off profile. But if that\'s off profile can be off putting to someone that has an expectation of something that they want to, they want to sip or drink that\'s, that\'s within their, you know, their taste, right? And so we even at a place like New riff, like we, we got down to our two, we did them blind, and one was just significantly different. And my thinking was, man, guys, if we pick this one, people are going to think we\'re crazy. Yeah, they\'re not going to want to ever again, right, but the other one was just it was great, had a great nose, super sweet on the front, and this long lasting kind of sweet oak. And so we chose that one. So 19:00 But usually when that barrel picks I\'m pretty simple like I have this very like Check. Check. Yes, yeah. Minus or check plus and yeah, if the nose on something is really weak I have a hard time putting it into the the check plus category but 19:15 I do like the nose on a second one a lot better than the first there\'s Yeah, like everything about the second one better. So I\'m not entirely sure what it is. Yeah, I\'m gonna put my vote for two on this one. I agree as well. But I mean, we\'ve had so Ryan lands he\'s been on the show before he sent us a sample. A blind sample once Brian if you remember that. Yep. And we were we were dumbfounded by it. We were going through because we were like, is this a ride? Like it\'s got this minty flavor. It\'s like, totally, that means we couldn\'t pin it down. And then he was like, No, just a nine year Buffalo Trace. 19:50 Like, yeah, we\'re like, I didn\'t expect that when we were thinking I was like, some will have families day, like eight years or something from MTV, you know? But it was 20:00 Buffalo Trace Oh yeah, it was a crazy one. So I think I got my vote in number two Yankee what\'s your vote in? Yeah number two hands down all right all right so i think you won\'t do the reveal I\'m already on the guess oh how about just trade them off you guys can you guys can both do reveals about that so you\'re real all right Mikey go ahead all right I\'ll reveal all right so here we go here we go number a number a number 20:27 oh boy sorry guys a one number one is Weller craft your perfect bourbon OC at least now I new 20:39 stuff right 20:41 the craft your own bourbon you whoever crafted it did not 20:46 you screwed up 20:49 yeah, that\'s I mean that kind of goes to show you right i mean we\'re out of the gate we already just said that doesn\'t work yeah, I mean and go me wrong like store pick one oh sevens like they trade upwards of 21:00 Like $100 now, but the crappy perfect bourbon i think is somewhere around 300 400. So you know, yeah, I mean, it was a limited release. It came in a fancy white label, but I\'m just like, thrilled. I got it right on the nose. I was like, you should just leave now. Yeah, I\'m done. See? 21:19 My drop word done? Well, let\'s uh, let\'s go ahead and refresh or reset here and he does dump dump bug it Here we go. Here\'s a here\'s a dump glass that you can use. Just go ahead and do that. All right. Have you done a 107 pic? I have not me either. 21:35 on the list though, I had the opportunity to do it. Which you know the Yeah, I mean, the honest weird thing about doing Yeah, we\'re going to have a just a big ol Weller mix mix, right here. So we\'ll just do that. We\'ll save that one for later. Is it pretty similar to like doing a Buffalo Trace where you know, you get it\'s 46 barrels and it\'s very similar. I don\'t need that here. So one 22:00 So when you do the when you do the well everyone oh seven pick. I mean, it\'s there\'s literally no difference than what you were doing with a Buffalo Trace or anything like that. 22:09 Except you have you have this high anticipation going into it. Yeah. Right because you\'re like, we did it like we\'re here like we\'re getting the Mecca. Yeah. I mean, you think like, it\'s going to be like crazy and like off the wall. Like you\'re super excited for it like you get it takes more than a little Yeah. You got barely a taste there. 22:30 And then so and so we\'re going to use it. So like I said, you go in like super, super amped for it. However, 22:38 when we did ours, I was actually sitting there with a few of the guys and I\'m kind of like, it might be like one of the few times in my life where you\'re like, like so crazy going into it. That you say 22:53 can we get some new barrels? Because life\'s all about expectation? Nothing. No, yeah, nothing was like you 23:00 We\'re over the moon about any of them. I mean, so it was just kind of like Well, I guess we\'ll just choose one of these. Yeah, I mean, they were also kind of doing us a favor of giving this group that I\'m in a 107 pick at the story behind it was this is all part of the the bourbon cartel as we\'ve had on the show before doing a 1792 foolproof pick. And we are the team that was there chose the barrel and come to find out that barrel was already pre sold. And everybody had already left like guys came in from California for this all this other kind of stuff. And they were like, Oh, I\'m so sorry. What can we do? What can we make it up for you? I don\'t know exactly how you want no seven pick and they\'re like, okay, let\'s make it happen. Yeah. And I guess when that happens, you might get the the last barrels all the rejects right into the year. Yeah, it\'s like when Eddie Russell was that the Russell\'s pig and they\'re like, well, operations is on air. Nevermind. 23:59 So we got 24:00 UV here. So with BO buddy. Oh, here we go again. So I feel like this is filling 24:10 or something logic correct maybe 24:13 behind you might be, you might have he\'s got this he\'s got his senses dialed in every night. Every night he goes home and just practice I actually do now ever since we\'ve done pursuit series like I\'ve kind of like trying to not take it seriously but really 24:30 put some effort into it. I can train my nose and palate. I don\'t know. I mean, it\'s I don\'t know I enjoy it and you know, so I\'ve really, I\'ll probably with on this one so I don\'t hide me up too much. 24:44 But I just know it\'s like an alleged occurred to me up the gate. All right. I can tell you after the taste. I don\'t think it\'s Elijah Craig. Oh. 24:52 I think it\'s a rye. Oh, yeah. Because I had one Rive blind set in here. Maybe it\'s like a 25:00 bourbon and then you get four roses and some of the different recipes you get some of like a minty profile to it as well so yeah there\'s this earthy 25:10 earth you bite at the end 25:13 yeah it\'s definitely like you said get the ride and it\'s really standing out 25:20 we are more like a kind of peanut II nutty kind of, well, one of the things that threw in here I said there was a ride blind so there\'s a problem is the rods that you did are like gateway rods. Yeah, well, I know I don\'t know if their gateway rise because of the ride that I did. I did. I did a knob Creek Westport whiskey and what it was for what sports really known for a lot of good store pics. Chris has been on the show before from there. But I said what\'s a good limited edition to pair this up with and there\'s not I ok. I tried to be a smart consumer so I didn\'t go out and buy like the knob Creek hundred and 30th or whatever it was. I came in the box. That was like 26:00 150 bucks, but I had these. These had a bottle of knob or a Booker\'s rye sitting around. And so I said, well mean it\'s still Jim Beam at the end of the day. 26:12 Both of them like art super dry, heavy on the taste. So let\'s see if we can see if we can figure it out and blind. Hmm. I\'m worried. Yeah, she\'s like, 26:25 I\'ll tell you a story because Booker\'s right, I bought a few bottles of them. When I told myself I said, You know what, like, I have a lot of money sunk into these things because they came out at 303 50 retail. And I said, I said maybe when it hits 1000 What\'s the perfect boogers raw? Is it cash flow? Its cash. Yeah, I mean, I think it\'s like around 100 and hundred and 10 hundred and 20. Some most most of the Booker\'s around 120 proof. So yeah, you could probably expect that now. I\'m also it just seems like there\'s a huge difference in the 27:00 First and second one. I don\'t know. Maybe it\'s just me. Yeah, you might be right. I\'m getting more ethanol knows on this first one. 27:08 But which one do you enjoy more? And the first one that I\'ll call like really 27:13 overpowers kind of everything for me there obviously, now that you said there\'s a lot more ethanol on the nose, 27:20 like on the nose and the palate and just really just takes over well and you know, also I can\'t be 100% of these are rise or not So, but the second one is so light, 27:34 and gullible. Is that word gullible? Not even close now, or do you think this could be I don\'t love either one of them, but I like the second one better than the first like now that I\'m tasting it. I don\'t know if it is awry. I don\'t think it\'s a wrong at this. This might be the difference in the four roses. Yeah, because it could be the Brent face 14 year OESK versus the 27:57 the nine and a half year or nine nine 28:00 nine year nine months, North Atlanta Bourbons pick and I I chose both of those. I chose the North Atlanta one because the Brett face bottle was all OESK and this was one of the last store pics that I had that was also only OESK. Alright, so if you had to choose one where do you going with 28:25 I know hopefully their listeners I\'m bored. Well 28:28 the comments going rolling around like I said, I don\'t love both of them. I think if I had to pick I\'ll pick two just cuz 28:37 like one just so I just get so much alcohol that I can\'t really taste much else whereas to I can kind of get some 28:46 basic bourbon notes you know a little bit better. They\'re both pretty underwhelming for me. Not underwhelming, but just very average number one has a bit more of a punch to me. Yeah. Which a lot of people think that 29:00 is hot or its heat. Yeah. I don\'t typically mind it as much. However, number two definitely has a little more subdued. Little more oak. Yep. And I like my tannins. So I know he does. Like, yeah, he\'s cheap for tenants. 29:19 Dry oak or the sweet. Oh, I\'m more of a shadow. Yeah, I mean, that\'s what that\'s my nickname. So they called me come to sweet. Oh. 29:27 Alright, you want to reveal this one? Kenny. All right, I\'ll reveal this one. So I\'m on number two. Ryan. I\'m number two as well, man it is it\'s a close tie. But the ethanol knows on one. I yeah, I got I gotta go with to, to just got much more sweeter kind of reveal. All right, well, we kind of nailed that one. So this was the four rows. Okay. 29:49 Number two was the bread face bottle. It was the 14 year OESK barrel strength Limited Edition. And then the first one was the nine year nine months. 30:00 SK gotcha so in this particular instance the limit earliest when the limited release me yes so how about it? Alright, so let\'s go ahead and dump them out and get ready for them the first one was a store pick right the Yes The first one was the store pick that\'s correct grab another glass over there Ron if you can and will create our glass or dump glass over here. Mikey are the ones you\'ve been on where the most memorable barrel pics or any stories from those two mean hopefully the one you went on with us but yeah you know no pressure 30:33 I mean Buffalo Trace is always on someone\'s just picking a barrel there and doesn\'t matter really what whiskey it is the set to get into a pickle Buffalo Trace it\'s on everyone\'s list right? So that one was great. I really as far as like tours go and overall barrel picking experience, man I mean castle and key. They they even though they don\'t have anything on the market yet, like the ability to taste arrived or weeded and then lay it back. 31:00 down. I mean, the experience overall was really great there. So I feel like Yeah, it was. That was overall my best so far. And you know, Buffalo Trace was great as well. But out of the out of the few that I\'ve done, castle and key was, was hands down my favorite. And usually I\'ll try to point people toward a tour there for coming in from out of town, the castle and key I was kind of blown away with like, I\'d seen it before the renovation and went, I knows time sensitive information. But last week, you know, last weekend did a pin hook pic with the breaking bourbon guys and man, that place is awesome. Like it is like the gardens are beautiful. Like all the architecture inside like it\'s a great blend of like modern architecture with old architecture like I just 31:47 I mean, it comes with a steep price tag. I think they said their tours are like 30 bucks. Yeah, for an hour. But I mean, but I know that I mean it\'s totally different. Like you could literally spend Well, we did spend six hours 32:00 If you wanted to you could spend all day there. I mean, it\'s it\'s a great beautiful location. Yeah. If you\'re a history nerd like I am. So there is that kind of on beyond that adds to the experience. Yeah. I mean new riff they\'re new, but man, they take care of you really well, there as well. So some of it is just, it\'s just different. So that\'s, that\'s the reality of some of these pics. Like, some might not be better than the other but who\'s our least favorite? Should we not say that we bought and again, bye bye. Yeah. My bad. No, don\'t do that. 32:32 There\'s really not some that are, like terrible, right? None are actually terrible. 32:38 I mean, the only ones that are terrible. 32:41 Maybe my opinion is terrible is that you don\'t even actually go in the barrel pick. You just have the sample ship tonight. Yeah, like that\'s just Yeah, I don\'t know. I mean, obviously, geographic geography kind of plays a role in that. But yeah, it\'s it\'s not as exciting. Well, it\'s just part of what it is though. There\'s probably very few people that go on a barrel pick and walk away, saying 33:00 I wish I would have done that barrel pick. 33:03 Yeah, that\'s that\'s probably very true. So I just so we\'re here at letter C Now I keep wanting to say the number c so letter C, and often knows like the nose right away like I\'m like pulling number two, like way ahead of the pack here. Yeah. 33:21 They\'re both the both noses are far better than the ones from the last rounds. Like on the these two. So we\'re tasting right now trying to figure out exactly I know where we are. Right? We are. We are easily and Eliza Craig land. Yeah, this is totally worked on. I gave that spiel about how I\'m taking seriously, I\'m failing pursuit series. That\'s okay. But I mean, this is a work in progress. So, you know, the life of Craig brain in itself, like I\'m a huge fan of it. Oh, yeah, they\'re, they\'re doing it. They\'re doing a lot of good things in regards of not only putting out what people have been asking for for years, which was a very 34:00 Proof release, you know, they brought out should I say reintroduce the 18 and 23 year expressions A few years ago, the only thing that you can\'t find anymore is the 21 year expression. But you know, honestly out of those older expressions and by the way i can tell you OA you can totally tell right just first said what each one is. Yeah, so I can tell you exactly the comparison here what we\'re looking at and ones and Elijah Craig 18 year another is an Elijah Craig store pick that was done by the lock and key society so lock Oh, I thought you were saying the first class logic Craig. I\'m like, No, it\'s not. A second one is why I don\'t know. I don\'t know. Yeah, but I\'m just saying. I\'m just saying the lineup and so anybody that\'s unfamiliar lock and key is based out of Julio up a New England. They\'re a pretty big player in that that store pic world. They\'ve been doing it for years and years and years. I\'ve actually got an old store pick. I\'m down. I think my last job 35:00 of one of the the last ever Bernheim we store pics that were ever available. Heaven Hill what opened up to doing your own Evan Williams your own Bernheim, your own header mechanic all that sort of stuff then they kind of put the handcuffs on you to is definitely got to be the 18 and one is the 35:21 it\'s that eight to 12 year like Elijah Craig got the nutty toffee candy bar notes like stuff I enjoy so I\'m definitely like one year program pick to the Hollywood pick two. But you know when I was when I was talking to Mikey about this and we were talking about store pics versus limited releases I actually thought I didn\'t do it but I thought about doing it because it\'s not actually technically a store pick or store release. But I said what if we did an Elijah Craig barrel proof versus like a nine year like will it family estate? Oh, yeah, I was like that one actually might be that would be pretty comparable. Well, obviously it is comparable. 35:59 It\'s the same exact 36:00 Liquid but both of these are really good Actually, I prefer one just because it\'s kind of got some of the sweeter not your candy bar kind of notes that I like. But that\'s just preference and I think number one, it\'s pretty easy to see that the 94 proof plan Oh yeah. And that\'s I think that\'s also evolving on both of them. They\'re both very light. Well, I mean, Mikey, like, tell me about this like, what would what in the market would change if heaven Hill opened up a logic Craig program and they just said, Yeah, put it a barrel proof. Yeah, I mean, you\'re going to get a wider range. I think of a first off people wanting Elijah Craig. Because it is it is very 36:44 I don\'t want this I don\'t want us to use the word delicate but I will use the word LB feels very delicate. When you put it next to the the UCLA team. There\'s a lot more depth to it. I think there could be a lot more depth to a single barrel pic of alleged credible 37:00 Proof if they would just open that up I guess it just depends on your consumer so like if you\'re you know the the first one like for what I think it\'s going to appeal to more of a almost a common but i mean you know like you know it\'s just because it\'s it\'s not the it\'s not the enthusiast in mind here it\'s very approachable very enjoyable but like get to you\'re definitely gonna get like you said more complexity depth 37:28 to might be more off putting to like a common consumer I\'d say common but like, you know, or new consumer but I don\'t know depends on your consumer but I want the barrel proof because it\'s logical. Operators are always home runs like I\'ve never had a bad one. Can\'t say I\'ve ever had one. Well, I mean, there\'s the mean. So you know, Mike Sahni personally so you know that there\'s a lot that actually goes into making sure that an electric guard barrel proof isn\'t just a mistake, either right? Like Like they, they choose barrels specifically that go in 38:00 into it 38:02 which is a little bit different you know we\'ve we\'ve talked to the people that haven\'t Hill and when you talk about Elijah Craig 23 or when you try to find 23 year old barrels, it\'s actually very very hard. Yeah, and end up dumping a lot of them into like, just Edwin\'s Black Label because it\'s so it\'s so it\'s undrinkable. Yes. It\'s the oak is just overpowered. There\'s a bank on that point, right? There\'s, there\'s Law of Diminishing Returns without like, you know, can and somebody went the good thing I learned to catch lucky with the Pinot guy, because I was like, so how do you? You know, you have a really good barrel it say like 12 to 14 years. Like do you bottle dinner? Do you let it age? Do you know to keep will I keep improving? And he\'s like, No, he\'s like, Do you want something that\'s going to age you need something that\'s really soft, elegant, sweet at that age, because the folks really at 15 1617 is really going to start to overpower it. If it\'s already ready, you know, does that make sense? Oh, no, it makes sense. And so that that was kind of an 39:00 Lighting because we talked about, you know, US buying some 14 year and sitting on it for three to four years. But we were like, how do you This one\'s really great. Should we just because it\'s so great we hang on to it or should we look for something that\'s will do better with age? And that was kind of good advice. Yeah. And it\'s always a it\'s always a costly mistake if it never works. 39:21 Well, we\'ll just bottle it anyway. 39:24 No, okay, so let\'s go ahead let\'s reveal this one because I think I think this one yeah, is as bad as it sounds like I knew the bottles I chose them going into it. However, I let my wife figure out exactly what we should do. However, I thought we had Yeah, it\'s it\'s I mean, we want to live correct tangent for 39:44 a bit funny. It feels like not Brussels. 39:48 It would have been funny, but yeah, this one\'s too easy. The locking key and see Tuesday 18 years. Oh, yeah. Alright, so good work. So I mean, but the thing is, is like I don\'t mind 40:00 lock and key one like you\'re right like it\'s totally like a good drinkable bourbon. Yeah, for an average consumer that just wants to get into it. However, 40:10 I don\'t know if a lot of the electric barrel pics are speaking to the the enthusiastic market yeah maybe they\'ll keep going it\'s still fun it\'s still fun to go you know you talk to people from like bourbon Crusaders and they come out with a lot of good pics too. And the thing is, is though it\'s just kind of like I just wish they didn\'t take it down in 94 proof you know there\'s there\'s something about when you cross under that hundred threshold that I don\'t know Mikey, have you found anything underneath 100 that you\'re like, Hey, you know, like I can do this every single day like there\'s one there\'s one bottle and Brandon I do and I did this in the blind. So that\'s how I know. But maybe I don\'t know the proof. Exactly. But George Remus. I tend to like I like that bottle. 40:59 Not a fan of 41:00 why they chose George Remus of all people But anyways, you\'re part of the ground 41:07 and stuff is not necessary someone to model your life after. But But Remus Yeah, I love I love that bottle. I love the bourbon in it. I think it might be 90 proof. Yeah, typically under 100 proof like, like, you have to get into some dusty. He\'s like, okay, dads, and I mean, and we\'re like, 41:27 you know, like Victor\'s 20s or something, you know, because they\'re 94 proof or they actually might be right I don\'t know I\'ve got one back there but I don\'t feel like getting up and looking at it. And so we\'re handing everything to Ryan do not mix see one and see two together like because 41:44 ECA teams just too good. I like it like it. Yeah. For me, for me. I love Elijah Craig a team when I am I\'m sitting in the basement, and it\'s late at night. And like, I can\'t do like a barrel proof. Like it\'s just it\'s just like 42:00 I\'m not able to go to sleep at night if I if I got that back in the bottle well who knows I\'ve got it\'s a long day ahead of us still so yeah, you know I liked 18 I mean it for me the tags really sit and kind of dry and just like on the in which it kind of sits there and lingers for a bit and I\'m like hi go away please 42:20 see not me I mean I\'m Mike What about you like Do you like tannins? Because I like I said I like a lot of rich oak complexity complexity that what those really bring into it. I mean, that\'s it for me when you when you get a lot of oak that means that the barrel is doing something like tremendous and that\'s that\'s really what I get out of it. Yeah, I I\'m a fan of the sweet oak if you can give me a finish with a sweet oak and like a dried cherry name that just last four days. Yeah, I mean, sign me up. Sign me up. Not a fan of the dry. Oh because much. I feel like it\'s got my get your lip smacking back and forth. 43:00 And just makes you thirsty. Not a big fan of the drive but the sweet Oh yeah, it doesn\'t make you feel like oh man you can you can almost taste the process. Yeah a little bit so I\'m with you on that one and that\'s what I mean I\'m a fan of just open general because it definitely is more of an overpowering flavor like up. I\'ll put it to you guys is like is there is there something on the flavor wheel right i mean we\'ve all seen before that that you don\'t like to get out of a bourbon. 43:33 The 2019 Kentucky\'s edge bourbon conference and festival pairs all things Kentucky with bourbon. It takes place October 4 and fifth at venues throughout Covington in Newport Kentucky, Kentucky\'s edge features of bourbon conference music tastings pairings tours and in artists and market Kentucky\'s edge 2019 is where bourbon begins. Tickets and information can be found online at Kentucky\'s edge calm 43:58 as the saying goes 44:00 Portland is weird. Perhaps it\'s something in the water. It turns out that there might be some truth to that. The Oregon capitals primary water source is supplied by the Bull Run watershed. It\'s also the key ingredient in one of the city\'s most popular watering holes, Bull Run distillery. The boulder and watershed is a very unique water source. It\'s protected by an act of Congress back in the 1870s. And the city\'s fathers got their hands on a beautiful lake up in the Cascade Mountains. And it\'s been that way since the 1870s. It used to flow through wooden pipes by gravity to Portland. It\'s that water that gives boulder and distilleries products, its distinct character. Two bottles are being featured in rock house whiskey clubs. Next box, rack house was club it\'s a whiskey the Month Club and they\'re on a mission to uncover the best flavors and stories that craft distilleries across the US have to offer rock house ships out to their featured distilleries finest bottles, along with some cool merchandise in a box delivered to your door every two months. Go to rock house whiskey club calm and check it out and try some Bull Run for yourself. Use code pursuit for $25 off 45:00 Your first box 45:04 I\'ll put it to you guys is like is there is there something on the flavor wheel right i mean we\'ve all seen before that that you don\'t like to get out of a bourbon. I mean for me definitely like some people some people are like oh I don\'t like like orange zest or orange peel or whatever No, I mean honestly I like freer freer whiskies I really like 45:25 like I\'m with you know we\'re talking the barrel guys I really like when you get those like great notes and just too much because very off putting for me, like like he said, he gets dry and you\'re smacking your lips and like trying to get some moisture back into your 45:42 region, you know, but 45:45 other than that, I mean, I obviously I hate young stuff like where you just get green forward, you know, grassy or like, where it\'s like hey are you know, we I won\'t name any names, but we\'ve had, we\'ve had 46:00 You know, that\'s just very off putting for me. I agree. I agree. It\'s the last thing you want to do is sit there and expect something and then all of a sudden, it\'s like, Did I just mow my grass a second video? And that\'s in my mouth? Yep. Yeah, for sure. Alright, so now we\'re on letter D. So, you all won that one. Right? Well, I mean, I should say you all, like I said, I\'m a nice person. Yeah, I think like I said, I\'m just a fan of of what they do there. However, you know, that\'s the limited release, you know, so limited releases up to two one. Well, that\'s a hard one, though, because it\'s because it wasn\'t the same proof. It wasn\'t, you know, yeah. You can get in the gift shop almost every day. Right. Exactly. So no, not this isn\'t limited to Maryland, Maryland. Okay, that\'s a hard one. Yeah. And, and, you know, there\'s it To be honest, like there\'s a lot of things that we thought about that we couldn\'t do today. So, we looked at the the potential of doing an old forester single barrel versus an old forester birthday. 47:00 But I would have been a good one. Yeah, problem is, we haven\'t been on old forester. 47:05 And I guess we need to probably line that up. But the other thing it was like, just weren\'t thinking ahead of time enough to be able I sounds like a little like, let\'s go ahead and get it. And then the other one was looking at 47:20 Oh, gosh, I\'m like looking at the bar thinking, Oh, yeah, we\'re looking at doing like a and this is not even a store pic versus limited release. But this is like a Sazerac rye versus a Thomas h handy. Yeah, it\'s like the proof 47:33 is me too crazy. Like you go you\'ll be able to pick it out like well that\'s and that\'s the problem is that like to do any of these with the the antique collection actually be pretty difficult to do. Because you could do a stag where\'s the stag Jr. Maybe? That was about as close as you could probably get. But you know, when you look at Eagle rare 17 versus regular Eagle rare, I think you\'re gonna hit the same exact problem that you saw at the Elijah Craig. It\'s just gonna be 48:00 Rich of depth of the oak. The same thing was Sazerac, 18 and Sasha cry, it\'s just going to be the richness and depth, I mean, you\'re going to hit that same problem no matter where you go. 48:12 So there is there is a reason why they make limited releases. It\'s just trying to find some of those limited releases that matched sort of the either the same proof or profile or age that I think that you really need to try to find and get out of this. 48:27 I love the nose on both of these. Actually. 48:31 That\'s pretty common with Russell\'s, which I think this is I don\'t think so. The other thing is the Russell\'s, or anything. It\'s raw, I guess, right? I mean, I haven\'t tasted it yet. But it\'s only because I know. 48:43 Because, you know, right now see, I need to stop it. Okay. 48:50 So far? Yeah, we\'ve been pretty good. So Mike, you all kind of point this question over to you because I know that there\'s a lot of people out there. Travis Hill. He\'s been Oh yeah, for totally rock and 49:00 Yeah, there you go. And there\'s a lot of people out there that try to make their own four roses. Limited Edition small batch. I mean have you have you looked at creating your own kind of like small batch out of like different store pics or anything like that before I\'ve not done it with great strategic content to create a certain brand or for the lease I have done the you know, the classic blend bottle or simple call infinity bottle. It was infinity until I tasted it and liked it. Then I stopped and then they became my blend because I stopped putting things in it. Yeah, so people would people tasted like this is great. And I give it out. And you had a record of it out like Exactly, yeah, regret it. Yeah, I do keep your record but I yeah, I lost it. But yeah, I would give it my dog always doing like bottle shares and things like that. Get people assemble, get everything done what it was, and they were like, this is really good. What is it like? It\'s actually just a blend of like 17 different two outs for else and things that were time, but I\'ve never done it intentionally. I haven\'t 50:00 guys that\'s tried you know the the poor man\'s Pappy and have tried to recreate the the Al young with the blends that they think will work but sometimes it\'s 50:09 in there 50:11 there is something to it. You know, there was there was a blind taste in that Blake from bourbon or hosted years ago that I was a part of as well as a few other people. And oddly enough, like he sent six samples and we had to rank each sample kind of like flavors and everything notes and everything that we\'re getting out of it. 50:31 And, and it was it was it was so climatic at the very end because it was all happening. You know, he sent the samples we submitted him. And then at the very end, you know, we all got on YouTube or Google Hangouts and promoted on YouTube and we all got on there and come to find out the variant. The number one bourbon we all love was a exactly what you said a poor man\'s Pappy that was mixed in a ninja blender. 51:01 Me and I don\'t know if it has something to say about aeration. I don\'t have the something to say about anything else but it\'s this like, Yeah, he literally threw in a ninja blender. Yeah. And that\'s what one out of like, six different Bourbons. So it\'s crazy it kind of goes to show that you can 51:18 can always just think that the most limited things are going to be the best things. Yeah, I\'ll probably be adding a ninja blender to my Amazon wish list here Yo, I have they are fantastic. My quick smoothies and movies and bourbon What else? What else you want to mix just don\'t mix the smoothies with the barber. Alright, so for me I already know like what this is I can smell it. I can taste it. So two is going to be it for me. tues definitely, I mean, I\'m torn one would be a great everyday drinker. It\'s got a lot of complex like great it\'s a great poor but to is like, to me is like really like something special. Like 52:00 That I would want out of a limited release or like a store pick, you know, something special. Like, that\'s I really like to so I they\'re both really good I already I mean, I can just buy the nose and it tastes like already know what they are. So my camera on a push over to you is to worth like $950 more right now. 52:20 That\'s a great question. 52:23 What is that? Because that\'s that\'s ultimately I mean, I\'ll tell you what if if it\'s reversed in the reveal, I will I\'ll just go ahead and wrap it up. I\'ll put my card like listen bourbon pursuit over my case the was 15 point proof difference, you know, between the wanting to 52:42 which kind of gives you a hint, but yeah, it\'d be funny though if they are reversed. Hey, is the 52:49 question, but I think it has an easy answer. And there\'s no price difference wise, there\'s no way 52:56 if you want something that\'s simple, and there\'s there\'s nothing 53:00 off putting about this, right? To me, there\'s nothing like putting at all. But this one does have the number two has a lot more depth character. And the proof differences, definitely evident. 53:15 Especially on the back end it just stick in there to your tongue in a good way. I mean, at this point, there\'s, there\'s a lesson to be learned here. Right? I mean, we\'re, we\'re four or five deep. And I think we\'ve already noticed that when it comes to special releases that the age the age is the important part. You know, the age adds a level of complexity and characteristic to it that you necessarily won\'t get anywhere else. Yeah. So far, we were dumbfounded by one, right. Yeah, having a 53:45 Weller 107 pick that actually beat out the Weller craft your own perfect bourbon. From then on. It\'s been really a difference in age. Yep. From there, I mean, it\'s Yeah, it\'s hard to replicate well, and that\'s why I mean, 54:00 With like NGP you know people go crazy with like the 1012 for it. It\'s more has to do with age like the age age whiskey is great like these Tennessee age whiskeys are fantastic. Like Kentucky age stuff it has to do with age like it\'s not necessarily the magic pill, the Jews, whatever, it\'s when you get to that 10 to 14 year range it there\'s magical, you know happens right there and it\'s it is it is what it is. Alright, so I\'m going to go ahead and do the reveal. Because I can\'t wait anymore. Yeah, that\'s exactly what we thought it was. So D one was the knob Creek from Westport whiskey and wine in D two was the but they didn\'t try. They did a great job on do you want I mean, that\'s a sore pic for me. Yes. And that\'s what I mean. That\'s, that\'s the thing that we talked about the whole entire time is that you can get that for what 60 bucks versus 950. You know, it\'s I mean, even if you were if you were even on top of it, even when it was 450 55:00 Yeah to even get your hands on it so and this was years ago so it was definitely a tough way to to make it happen so again this is one we\'re not going to mix yeah do not do not mix these guys after the show is over y\'all we are going to be probably just celebrating with the rest of the stuff we like to drink covers. Yeah the leftovers right. So the best of the all infinity bottles if you will. So Mikey, ending on a lot says elimination we have Russell\'s we 55:33 can i can tell you right now because I was a part of it. We\'re pouring out letter E. And we do with letter E like I already know what it is versus the brand. However, these guys don\'t know what it what it is. So I\'m going to go ahead and just kind of reserve my comments for absolutely everything and just let them figure it out. So you know as we as we start going down this path though. What do you 56:00 You found like the most interesting well so far I mean the three three limited releases have one versus the store pics wishes Do you think it\'s a Do you think it\'s an oversight on our part that maybe we didn\'t choose the best comparisons because as I mentioned earlier like it\'s it\'s age versus a lot of stuff some I don\'t know though because I mean it store pictures still getting really good pores I mean, but think about it like think about other brands like I mean look at the shelf like is there anything else that like we missed going into this like think of like, like I said, we already talked about old for certain for suburbia urban bag would be the bag and stag it\'s Junior would probably be a good one as well. Like I said you could do like you could do a 7092 full proof versus like a Kentucky alpha later. Oh, cuz cuz you you think that\'s where it comes from? I think so. So that\'s your that\'s your excuse guess? Yeah, I think so. But I was way off on Sunday. 57:00 These guys have them. So, but yeah, I mean, other than that, I mean, because you got some MGP stuff, but like, they\'re all there. There\'s such a wide range like from person. It\'s hard and it\'s not often there\'s not like a ton of everyday offerings with MGP. Well, we had talked about this beforehand. I\'ve tried to figure out like, Is there a single and that\'s that\'s an I guess that\'s the problem when you get when you get to what we can do this but it might kick us in the teeth like a pursuit series versus 57:31 decal, you know. 57:34 We\'re not well, just kidding. Well, 57:37 it doesn\'t exist. Yeah. So that\'s the other thing. Yeah. But the other the other part of it was ready barrel, I guess. Barrel versus procedure. They do a lot of blending. Yeah. So that\'s not a true comparison. So I mean, it\'s it\'s an Indiana country, I think the will it will it versus Elijah Craig barrel proof would be a good one because just to get it out there. 58:00 Yep, I mean, who knows, but I mean, when I look at it like I, it would have been good to do like a regular Booker\'s versus I mean, Booker\'s I didn\'t want to open up a book or 25th for this I was sorry just be honest with you, I\'m not going to achieve f4 but I mean, that versus Booker\'s 30th or something like that like Booker\'s vs Booker\'s because at the same exact, you know, the end of the day, like each one of those is very good in its own right. However, like the the proof points are can be a whole lot of difference. Yeah. When you get to that high improved and you\'re in the hundred and 25 230 130 proof. Yeah. Who knows if your your your your taste buds in your flavor profile can actually discern a lot of stuff that\'s actually happening at that level. Yeah, right. Actually. Oh my gosh, like I\'m tasting these I\'m knows the side by side. I don\'t think I can tell the difference now. So now we\'re doing a wild turkey comparison. Russell\'s reserve versus the 17 year decades for 59:00 Nice. And I mean on first on first knows, like, there\'s no difference. There\'s no discernible difference whatsoever. The first one? 59:12 I don\'t know, they\'re pretty close. I was like, the first one may have a little more alcohol, but I don\'t know. That\'s they\'re pretty similar. You mean and this is and this also goes back into each conversation right? I mean like when we talk about age like 17 years you expect to have a lot more depth on the complexity a lot more more of this sort of stuff. However, we\'ve we\'ve seen the praises of Russell\'s reserve for years. It\'s one of the best single barrel pics that you can get out there today. You know, me and the best I can I\'m one of the not been altered and pick yet I\'m turkey pick y\'all man, but you\'re the one actually brought today\'s pic. I didn\'t know. So I\'m getting I mean, maybe it\'s because I do get a little more ethanol on the first one. And then I go straight to the second one. The smells a little sweeter. Yep, I\'m totally getting a little sweeter on the second one. 1:00:00 But they are very very close. I love both of them. I knew that was was like I mean Russell\'s are one of those things you can just knows all day. Both these are fantastic. I mean it, it\'s actually very good number one is really good. 1:00:15 It\'s actually very hard to find a discernible difference. I mean, there\'s a little bit of difference in the taste, but it\'s not so much that you\'re like, Okay, this is this is a difference of $100 right here like it\'s it\'s it\'s very, very different. tues got I don\'t know I like the mouth feel have to like it\'s got and it\'s got more like a little more sugary brown sugary, kind of syrupy kind of texture to it. One is very good, but two is kind of more I don\'t know just real rich and sugary to me like syrupy like they\'re they\'re pretty damn close are very close. I mean for something that\'s almost like a mean it\'s not it\'s not a decade\'s worth of difference, but I mean, you\'re looking at at least six to nine years. Right of what you see between 1:01:00 Some of the older reserved pics from Russell\'s versus the decades releases so I\'m going to go with two but not that much. They\'re they\'re pretty close tues oily on the panel I don\'t know you kind of want to yeah two is got a longer lasting finish the nose is sweeter 1:01:20 sounds like for you it\'s a landslide one this is a yeah for me it\'s a landslide too so too Alright, so Ryan there go ahead and reveal the last one we have today. 1:01:30 haha what do you think? 1:01:34 Well it sounds like it sounds like you\'re gonna toss balls with sounds like well so two is actually the CFPB pick Oh 1:01:44 decades There we go. So yet another chance where we get the final store pick Yes, you do single barrels making a comeback. I mean, when we look at the results from today, I mean it\'s three to two but it\'s not it\'s not a it just said a landslide victory. I mean, it\'s it\'s something that is it\'s a 1:02:00 It\'s almost comparable, if you can find that, that one little place that does really good things, versus somebody that just, I don\'t know just accepts it or finds the barrels at the store and does whatever. There\'s there\'s actually validity to the, to the that. By the way, this was all for science. Yeah. So make sure that everybody knows is all today, but it\'s all subjective and we don\'t matter. Yes, that\'s also very true. And you cannot buy any of these anywhere. So it\'s it\'s it\'s all it\'s all gone. So yeah, I mean, the first two I mean, we\'re really like, you know, with the 1:02:40 the CYLB. I mean, I was amazed at how bad that was. Like, I just did not like it at all. Well, not bad. Not a bad for the money. Ryan we get a lot of stuff. Yeah, yeah, it\'s not bad. We know what bad whiskey I guess I was just after revealing it. I was like, pretty disappointed. And if anything, 1:03:00 I feel like what it does is helps people see to not fall into the trap of fo mo to fall in trap of hype because the fact that CYPB is for 500 bucks and you can get a single barrel pick a low WA for 150 or if you\'re lucky enough good at retail 60 bucks it\'s like man chase chasing one that tastes better yeah and so and it should bring some validity to those who are still into those who are blending because Ed lie is a blender and he picked this barrel at turkey so there is some validity even to like hey they they\'re getting paid lots of money every year to do this professionally. So let\'s end even if you go to a liquor bar party source or cork and bottle they have tasting bars Yeah, so you can taste these things before you get into all the gotta have it because there\'s a line well maybe you don\'t even like the bottle that you\'re standing line for. Yeah, it\'s hate tastings before you before you buy them but I mean there\'s there\'s some psychology there to the line thing. Oh for sure. I mean every everybody thinks that like 1:04:00 We\'ve all been there. We\'ve been in the morning, and then all of a sudden, there\'s somebody that walks up be like, online for. I know, like 1:04:10 there\'s, there\'s, there\'s a there\'s a group mentality to it, right? Yeah, for sure. It\'s not fun, but it\'s reality and what it is, it\'s animal spirits, you know, we\'re all we all just follow the herd, you know, so. 1:04:23 But I mean, for today, I\'m actually very pleased to kind of see the results because coming away with at least two out of the five that weren\'t limited releases, give some justification. Yeah, well, and we\'re thinking today into what I mean, when you\'re doing store pics. It\'s really based on who\'s going who\'s picking what they like and whatnot so like, you know, find a store or find someone that kind of meets your what you like, and you know, that\'s, you can find stuff that\'s just as good as the big price tag Islam releases. It\'s not even that I mean, we had we had some unfair 1:05:00 competition to. Right mean, if you think about it, like the logic reg. Yeah. 18 year versus like a nine to a 12 year? Yep. It\'s not it\'s not a fair competition. So when we think of which I preferred the nine to two, I know 1:05:17 a lot of people from you and your side to main, but you know, well, I\'m a tandem person like that. Yeah, like, but that is that is not a fair comparison. So, we\'d love to hear from other people. Maybe we\'ll, we\'ll revisit this again in a year or two. And if you think that there are other Bourbons out there that fit the either the the mash bill the proof and the age statement that you can compare against, then you know, we should we should probably look at it again. I mean, could well is Blanton\'s in like Buffalo Trace similar magical or they just they\'re they\'re different. They\'re definitely different Matadors Elmer and buffalo or what\'s Elmer trying to I\'m trying to get I\'m trying to 1:06:00 Marla and Blanton\'s are in the same Nashville. Two Gods one is Buffalo Trace Eagle rare in if we had an eagle rare rare double, whatever. 17 1:06:15 Yeah, but yeah, I don\'t think anybody will have that much funding for science. 1:06:20 I think on the the mark right now is hovering 9000. So he\'s, yeah, that\'s, that\'s not going to happen. Now. Those are trophies. They\'re not getting drunk. Yep. But Mikey, I want to say thank you so much for honestly, bringing this idea to us because this was, like I said, it\'s it\'s fascinating to go through and do this not only to test our strengths or test our knowledge. You know, I know Ryan is gonna go back home tonight and he\'s gonna be like, all right, I gotta go ahead and I\'m gonna, I\'m gonna pull the spoon of peanut butter my nose and just make sure I know what peanut butter smells. Yeah, easy, easy, easy to really take this seriously, for sure. You got to Yep, get my color wheel out. 1:07:00 My flavor wheel but I mean it was it was actually a really good not only just like I said different experience for us but I think for our listeners as well to kind of see like what else is out there like what can you experience and to not take everything at you know what what the label says Inaki cut off at the height because that\'s the problem with all of us we get caught up in the one thing we could just thought I was like Weller 107 versus like Pappy 15 or well or 12 versus Pappy 20 because of the boat the same person is more age, man. It\'s true and bigger price tag, you know, a lot bigger price tag. We\'ll do it next time I guess. So we got something for the next round. So make sure you all stick around for that. So Mikey, before we close out here, if there\'s any way that people want to know more about you, I mean, do you have any social handles that people want to know about you or anything like that? Sure. Yeah, I\'m on all most of the social medias and book faces and all those fun things. Yeah, but uh, yeah, so I do have a group and I 1:08:00 called sacred suppers we sip great whiskey for a greater purpose so we\'re on Facebook Instagram you can find us there yeah like I said I\'m on Facebook so and Instagram as well under my handle Mikey Conrad We do lots of charity work with our group charity we fund and help with barrel pics is called the arena project so check out their website by a nice thing for the charity there read more about what we\'re doing there. But that\'s kind of what you know I\'m in the game for is less than other people and and yeah and good whiskey with them and sharing fun stories. And so yeah, pleasure to be here today to do this and taste some great whiskey with you guys. Well, thank you so much for being here. And I\'m actually a take a moment just to say like, I\'m very happy to see that you know, the runner project and just everything that happens with inside of the whiskey world is actually very good in regards of donating bottles, raising money, like there\'s a lot of stuff that happens with inside of board. 1:09:00 of everything that happens here. So, you know, cheers to you and cheers everybody else that that raises money for good causes, but people don\'t need a bottle of 1:09:11 Pappy 10, right. 1:09:14 They want to, they want to put it to a better cause like that\'s Yeah, that\'s awesome. It\'s a great way to make it happen. So choose you for that for for making it happen. So, Ryan, I\'ll go ahead and let you close it out. Yeah, thanks for this awesome ideas, a lot of fun. I had a great time. Definitely need to go back and work on my skills. You know, so I can 1:09:34 be at home then. But, uh, no, this was fun. And I want to do this again. This was great. And, you know, if you like what you hear, let us know, if you don\'t like what you hear, let us know. 1:09:47 Give us more ideas because we don\'t always have the best ones. And so yeah, just keep, keep giving us feedback and comments. We\'d love them. So yeah, with that, we\'ll see you next time. 1:10:11 The world\'s biggest music and bourbon festival is even bigger September 20 21st and 22nd at Highland festival grounds at the Kentucky, Louisville with Foo Fighters. 1:10:24 Zac Brown band 1:10:27 Robert Plant and this insatiable spaceship, 1:10:30 Daryl Hall and john Oates, john CZ john Leon bridges and more complete lineup of musical artists and celebrity chefs at Herbert and beyond calm Transcribed by https://otter.ai | [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CldUgJSLO38&w=560&h=315]On this Whiskey Quickie by Bourbon Pursuit, we review Fern Creek Bourbon 2019 Exceptional & Rare.

I\'m one of your hosts Kenny. And as usual, let\'s hit some news, barrell craft spirits. You know, Joe, you hear him on the podcast all the time, they have announced the first ever barrell American bad malt. It\'s a blend of exclusively American single malt whiskies, which we\'ve actually become quite big fans of single malts on the show recently, and barrel has partnered with small and large producers across the country to select whiskies that express the full diversity of American terrier and style. This release was years in the making, and as many of the components in the blend come from emerging distilleries that have never traded or sold bulk whiskey on the market before. And this is coming from Joe who\'ve you\'ve heard on plenty of times. As we said before, in addition to expanding our ever growing portfolio of spirits, this new project is also an important step in advancing our vision in the next chapter of whiskey in America. We\'d love to hear it 2:00 Your reviews and your thoughts on it. So make sure you comment and let us know. Now smooth Ambler is relaunching their old scout brand. This is the same brand that we all knew about when it was sourced from NGP. And now this is the new return of MGP product. It is now a five year old in GP bourbon it will be bottled at 99 proof and widely available in the US starting in the fall of 2019. We have a whiskey quickie where we review the new old scout that will be published here in just a few short weeks. The na WR or the National Association of wine retailers has put out an article stating that after the Tennessee wine Supreme Court case ruling that we\'ve talked about so much on this podcast is saying that there are 21 states in violation of the Constitution. One shipping laws and these 21 states violate the Commerce Clause with their bands on wine shipments from out of state wine retailers. The case mandates that states may not pass protectionist 3:00 laws that discriminate against out of state wine stores and retailers by banning them from shipping wine to consumers. Now lawsuits have been challenging these bands on wine shipments from out of states are now underway in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Texas. The remaining states with unconstitutional wine shipping laws are California, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Washington state lawmakers in the other 14 states that we just mentioned need to take it upon themselves to start fixing their shipping laws. You can read this article in our show notes that today\'s podcast wasn\'t intended to air for quite some time. David Mendell had previously been a guest on the podcast way back on episode 19. And as Ryan would say, that\'s when we sucked, but this past week, I saw Bardstown bourbon companies, Instagram that there had been a leadership change, David 4:00 is taking a step back and they\'ve hired a new president and CEO, Mark Irwin. Everyone actually was part of the bros on bourbon company and was part of their board earlier this year. And he comes from a long history in the US Army and investment groups. Now I\'m sure we\'re going to have a lot of time to talk about more about mark in the future. But this podcast is all about David, and it\'s been a pleasure to watch him spearhead this movement from years ago into what Bardstown bourbon company is today. The growth of this company has seen has been tremendous, and you\'re going to hear about it relatively shortly, as well as some of the new product offerings. However, it looks like David wanted to go out with a blast because today also marks the grand opening of the new visitor experience at the Bardstown bourbon company. The expansive development includes curated tours, cocktail classes, exclusive tastings, and multiple private event spaces. Guests can choose from multiple levels of experiences including the main event which is a one hour fully immersive tour and 5:00 The Bardstown bourbon company\'s best, which is a top tier 90 minute tour featuring sensory exercises, cocktails, and a personal tour given by the master distiller Steve Nally. The sensory exercises will allow visitors the opportunity to examine distillate taste how bourbon ages and learn how it is used in finished products. The tours will showcase Bardstown bourbon companies experimental distilling process of 40 mash bills for over 24 customers guess will also be able to enjoy the visitor center, which is adjacent to the Rick house tasting bar, which is also surrounded by stacks and rows of Kentucky bourbon barrels, where they will feed whiskey straight from the barrel. Visitors you can book your online experience right now on Bardstown, bourbon.com. And you can read more about all this in our show notes. All right, let\'s kick off the show. Let\'s hear from Joe over a barrell bourbon. And then you\'ve got Fred Minnick with above the char. 5:57 Hi, this is Joe from barrell bourbon tasting whiskey. 6:00 Straight from the barrel was truly a life changing moment for me. In 2013 I launched our craft spirits so everyone could have the experience of tasting whiskey cast strength. Use our store locator to find a retail or bar near you at barrel bourbon.com. 6:14 I\'m Friedman again, this is above the char. If you follow me on Instagram, you might have caught me in a story where I did a live tasting. And I was testing the New Orleans glass versus the Glen Karen. Obviously, this is something very unique cannot really do a tasting objectively because you\'re touching the glass you have a feeling of what it should taste like and inherently you\'re going to like how one glass looks more than the other. So what I did was as I have blindfolded myself with a bandana and I had someone pour the whiskey in my mouth now this is is going to sound weird, but I actually could not tell which glass was which, by the way it was touching my lips, Italy 7:00 Initially, when Jessica did it a second time she liked cram the glass of my upper lip. So thankfully, I did not cut my lip. Anyway, the results were really fascinating to me in that I liked the Glencairn more because it gave me more surface area coverage on my tongue. Whereas like the New Orleans glass, which is very, very nice looking, it came in like a direct point on to my palate like a bead like shooting onto the palate, and I would have to work to get the whiskey all over the place. Now this is good and bad. It\'s good if you are a whiskey that you\'re trying to mask, like how you feel in different parts of the tongue because you\'re going in in a very narrow trajectory, and it\'s bad if you\'re like me, and you\'re trying to be analytical of the whiskey because you\'re not getting the full surface coverage that you want. Now, I own the aromatic side. I also noticed that the New Orleans glass only 8:00 offered up, you know, some of the more prominent notes like it wouldn\'t let me really assess the spirit as much as like the Colin Karen. And what I mean by that is that with the Glen Karen, I got layers of the aromatic properties, like I could tell what the various notes were and what they smell like. With New Orleans, I got one note, and then a bunch of little bitty other ones, but I could not really discern what some of those other little bitty ones were. Now some of this may be I typically drink with the Colin Karen. So I\'m more used to how that hits my notes. So preference definitely comes into here, but I\'m asked all the time, what glass should you use, and it really all depends on the moment, you can drink bourbon out of a solo cup, and it would be great if you\'re with your buddies. So I would say let\'s not focus so much on things like the glassware and let\'s focus more about who we\'re drinking it with. Now, if you\'re if you\'re being analytical and you\'re wanting to do these blind tastings, you need to have like a consistent glass 9:00 What if it\'s just hanging out with your buddies? Your old college friends? The glass doesn\'t matter. The company does. And that\'s this week\'s above the char. Hey, if you want to catch my Instagram stories, make sure you\'re following me on Instagram. It\'s at Fred Minnick again at Fred Minnick. Until next week. Cheers. 9:23 Welcome back to another episode of bourbon pursuit the official podcast of bourbon Guinea here today riding solo as we are at Bardstown bourbon company, and this is talking to a guest that you may have heard a long, long time ago. This was back on episode 19. This is when we were starting to break ground when they were starting to break ground. It was quite a while ago so the journey on both ends has been explosive and growth which is fantastic to see on both sides of the table here. And if you hear some clinging, some silverware going on, it\'s because we\'re in their their main restaurant here and you\'re 10:00 hear more about that more about really what\'s happened here? What are the big plans for everything that\'s going on more as we start diving down this this path. So today on the show, I have David Mendell, you might have remembered from back on episode 19. He is the president ceo and one of the co founders of Bardstown bourbon company. So David, welcome back to the show. Thank you, Kenny. You know it, I\'ll tell you, it\'s remarkable because when you think back to Episode 19, where we\'re sitting right here, none of this existed, and we had an empty room, you know, and we were just getting up and running. And it really is incredible. And I just want to congratulate you on your tremendous growth. I think you guys are the leading bourbon podcast out there, aren\'t you? Well, we are and thank you so much for saying that. You know, we\'ve we\'ve gone through a lot of growth as well. I mean, like I was saying at the we started this. We were We were Episode 19 like this is we do these every week and I was thinking like holy crap that\'s years ago. And I was thinking of like, wait, you united anyone put a shovel in the ground yet when we started talking about 11:00 This it was this was all just like press release it was pie in the pie in the sky kind of idea and like, how are we going to execute on this? God? That is right. I mean, you were here. That was before we actually even had the building finished. So that that\'s tremendous. That\'s tremendous. Yeah. So I guess, a few years later, how\'s it going? Well, I mean, you look around here it is really, it\'s unbelievable. I mean, I oftentimes we sit back and we say, you know, how did we do this? And I\'ll tell you it is it\'s going incredibly well. You know, since that day, more than three years ago now, you know, we have built one of the largest distilleries in the country. We do custom whiskey production. Now for 24 different companies will do 40 different mash bills. We have probably one of the most sophisticated whiskey distilleries in the world. We build an award winning restaurant and bar here in the middle of the rest in the middle of the facility. We\'re opening a visitor center and an experience. We\'ve got some really aggressive plans for bottling and a hotel coming and we could not be more excited. Holy smokes. That\'s a lot of stuff going on. 12:00 stuff. 12:02 So, I mean, I remember if I if I remember the one of the first things that we even talked about or maybe it was like a it was a rumor that that even said that was like even before like the doors were open, you all had basically contracted out I mean, cuz let\'s let\'s also make sure we set the precedent that the the the goal of what Bardstown bourbon company is is that you are a large contract distiller for anybody that wants to come in and make their own bourbon, right. And I\'ll put a little bit of a twist on that because what\'s what is interesting is we\'re a celebration, the entire craft of making whiskey. So we bring everybody together here, distillers enthusiasts, lovers, you know, and the community and we do that in our collaborative distilling program in the restaurant and bar as you can see around you, we serve everybody\'s products, and you find ours through the lens of everybody else, and we\'re really about that. But when you go back to the we call it the collaborative distilling program, because I\'d make a distinction between that and 13:00 Custom. It is a exclusive program. If you\'re accepted into it, you then get the ability to have us showcase your product. If you look, we sell everything from Jefferson\'s to Kentucky owl to many of the companies that we produce for their integrated into our cocktail menu. Then they can bring their guests, the distributors, the retailers here, this is their home. So it is a bit different. But you\'re right before we opened our doors, we sold out the first 25,000 barrel capacity of the distillery. We expanded to 50,000 barrels six months later than 130,000 barrels, about six months after that. And we have almost all of that effectively under contract for the next five years. It\'s been a remarkable program. I mean, it just it just goes to show you like how big this boom is really getting that everybody really wants to get into this action because yeah, I mean, like that\'s, that\'s an incredible number of whiskey that you all are producing. And people are saying yes let\'s I want to gobble this up. Like I want to be a part of this. 14:00 So where does Where is like the I mean, those are those are impressive numbers begin with right of kind of like, how it was and how it was all contracted out. I guess kind of give me the give the rundown if if if I\'m Joe Schmo and I\'m like, Hey, you know, I\'m ready to do this. I really want to get into get into the whiskey game. Do they call? Hey, David, I heard you on the podcast, like, what\'s, what\'s the next step? We take you? So the answer to that one is going to be? We\'re not the right, we\'re probably not the right provider for you. So we get a lot of those calls. We get them every day. But I think, you know, the beauty of our program is that we produce for great brands. So one of the you know, one of the primary considerations if you you know, even be considered as you\'ve got to have a great brand, it\'s got to be on the market. You\'ve got to be a company that has been in the industry. That\'s who we focus on. That\'s why we only produce for 24 different companies right now. We\'ve turned away over the last several years. You know, more than obviously that we\'ve accepted we get those calls every day. There are many options. 15:00 still out there for people like that, you know, that want to get in the business have never been in it before. They\'re much smaller options were not the option for them. But, you know, what\'s been most exciting for us is how we have really changed the the whole kind of dynamic and landscape of the contract whiskey production, you know, market. And it\'s that it\'s that program, and it\'s been really, really exciting. Yeah, I mean, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s fun, right? Because other than you all, like there\'s only like a few places where you can go and do something like this. Yeah, let me tell you what I think is what is one of the most exciting things about it. When you look at what happens in that distillery, we bring together of those 24 companies. We have massive companies and we have some small craft distilleries and a number of them in the middle. They\'re all working together with us there. We\'ve got their teams coming in. And we\'re learning every day. They\'re learning. We\'re learning. We\'re pushing innovation. We\'re balancing art, and science, but we\'re pushing innovation. It\'s all happening in there. 16:00 We\'re sharing best practices. And that\'s making our team better. And the result of all that is now coming out in our brands. So we\'re taking all that knowledge that we have created in a short period of time doing a lot of innovation. And you\'re seeing that now come forward in our brands, that\'s never going away. The collaborative distilling program is a core piece of who we are. It\'s something that will drive innovation drives, you know, has us pushing the edge all the time. That\'s really one of the most interesting I think an exciting pieces of what\'s happening here is by having everybody work together, you\'ve never had that before, in the whiskey industry in one place. Absolutely. Most the time. It\'s like, hey, David, here, here\'s the magical, I won\'t go make it well, and you know, even more than that, what you had in the past was you had effectively, you know, a couple of companies, you had one where you got to choose one of three different mash bills, and you got it, great whiskey, great bourbon, but there wasn\'t a lot of choice, or you had, you know, another large distiller producing for you and the problems you had, there\'s 17:00 You didn\'t get great customer service. You know, you were kind of seen as you know, we\'re not we\'re, you know, we\'re selling extra capacity. And other cases, it was kind of behind the scenes, you don\'t really want to talk about it. And sometimes you\'re not allowed to talk about it. And we were the first to really embrace this kind of production and say, we want to do it, we want to be proud of it, we\'re going to put it out there, it\'s going to be about transparency. And everything now that we drive with our customers is full transparency, access to the data in real time chemistry, we just put in a system called ignition that is used primarily the food manufacturing business that gives complete historian and transparency at every stage of the production and the customer gets to watch it in real time. They\'re kind of like really powerful. What What is it? Is it Volkswagen or BMW somebody where like you, you buy a car like you can brand new you can actually go to go to Europe or Germany and actually, like watch it as it\'s made in the last essentially the same thing. They get a portal, they can watch their production, they can see their barrels in the warehouse. We just implemented it in this last 18:00 upgraded the distillery when we just came off of shut down a couple weeks ago. Really, really neat, really neat software I was about to say I was like is do people get like push notifications like an app like it\'s like it\'s dominoes delivery dude. That\'s what this was. So it\'s really crazy about it is extremely user friendly, john Hargrove and Steve now I can, can can access the distillery from their phone at home, they can see it and they can control it. So Sierra Nevada, Coca Cola, a number of you know, very large companies are using this platform. And it is amazing because the data that comes out of it in the control of the system in the transparency, it also feeds into your financial, you know, software, it\'s really really powerful. Something that people like can could totally geek out on Yeah, so let\'s let\'s keep going down this path because you know, as a as the business side of it, like what, what more value do you think that that you get out of this by being able to give the power to Steve and john and be able to be able to do that. So it goes 19:00 Even one level beyond so we\'re giving not only this power to Stephen, john, but we\'re handing that power to our customer. And so that is really our partners in the collaborative distilling program. Never before have they been able to watch their production in real time, you\'re getting literally you\'re getting the chemistry is on each firm enter in real time as it\'s taking place, you\'re able to see it, you\'re able to, you know, work with us, there\'s something that, you know, you see that\'s wrong or is out of line, you can make immediate changes, you know, to production, but that kind of transparency. And that kind of data is really valuable for the consumer when they\'re used to an industry here. Again, when you talk about traditional contract whiskey production, you had no transparency, you had no data, you got what you got. And that was it if you didn\'t like it too bad. And that was the attitude. You know, don\'t tell me how to make bourbon. I know how to make bourbon. Well, what if the customer doesn\'t like it? So we\'re going we\'re going to make it and we\'re going to get it exactly right under your specifications, because you\'re our partner. That\'s what we do. And so it\'s it\'s been very neat when you talk about 40 different Nashville\'s 20:00 One facility. Most you know most, yeah, most facilities are one to five, maybe 20:06 two to three. So it\'s, it\'s really neat what\'s happening in there. Now it\'s making me think of like, remember Willy Wonka. And he was trying to put a candy bar like through the TV. Now it\'s like whiskey, like just be like sampling through the app like, 20:23 hey, if we could figure out how you could drink product out of your out of your smartphone, I would change social media advertising, it would it would change that might be a whole new business venture like let\'s just go Yeah, let\'s just get out of this. We\'re gonna do whiskey by the phone that\'s right. 20:39 Now but it is it is really neat. And then when you carry over what is taking place there and then when we built the the restaurant and the bar here when we invested tremendously in terms of bringing incredible talent here, we\'ve got chef, Felix Mazda, from the Greenbrier, Chef john Castro, who just joined us who ran Sullivan\'s 21:00 Culinary Institute in Louisville incredible background he is in charge of all of our culinary Dan Callaway on our beverage team who ran deca and built an incredible team. What happened is organically, they started working together with the distillery and that is how we got here to our products. And so we\'re no it\'s no longer just about one singular person making decisions about a product. It\'s about a team of experts, beverage commentary and distilling, creating these very unique blends, and bringing lots of different perspectives and pushing innovation and that\'s what I think of everything right now. That\'s one of the things we\'re most proud and most excited about where we\'re headed there. But when our own brand Yeah, before we before you\'re touching your brands, because I think that\'s that\'s gonna be a very big part of this. Talk about what it meant to actually like build bottle and bond kitchen because you know, you think about Bardstown there\'s something that is missing. Right there is you can go to Miami. There\'s nothing wrong Miami, right but like this 22:00 There\'s definitely that that sort of, like, finer dining experience that was really missing. So what, why create this this large, you know, place where people can come and eat and have a really, really good meal, rather than than just like, Hey, we\'re going to serve sandwiches out of the back of the truck over here. Well, I\'ll tell you so again, like everything, you know, I\'d love to say that, you know, we had, you know, full clarity of this vision when we when we walked into this, but when, you know, when you get into the business and you start going, it\'s an evolutionary process. And so for example, you know, with this, we like to say, you know, the distillery is our heart, you know, bottle and bond is a soul, you know, all of us and so, it really kind of brings together everybody but if you back up to 2017, you weren\'t allowed under Kentucky law, late 2016. You are unable to sell by the drink. So we worked with the state legislature, we got sell by the drink pass, we got vintage whiskey passed, and that changed everything. And we had not yet built this out at that point. So we stopped 23:00 And we said now that we can sell actually sell cocktails in the distillery, let\'s look at doing a full restaurant and full bar. And let\'s really complete this whole idea of the Napa Valley destination experience. And so, like everything else here, we launched into it without having the history and the perspective of the industry. So we did something completely different. And we worked with the community and we build something that I think really remarkably balances, the visitor on the trail coming in, and the community member of Bardstown and what do I mean by that? That\'s everything from food style, to pricing, to having a place where people can come and just enjoy. It\'s not pretentious, it\'s a high level of style and service. But you can come in here you can spend $30 for a bottle of wine, you can spend 1000 you can have a $4 pour whiskey, you can have a 20 $500 pour whiskey, you can come in and have a meal that is comparable in price to chilis, you know and to Cracker Barrel, but you\'re getting fresh food scratch 24:00 Me local ingredients. That\'s, that\'s the goal is to bring everyone together. And it\'s worked. Yeah, it really has worked. Yeah, I mean, I\'ve done here a few times. And it\'s it\'s always fun to do that. I mean, there\'s, you\'d mentioned i think that\'s that\'s one of the things that I think Bardstown was really key and missing, as well, as was having that sort of experience. We can have this sort of, like elevated dining experience, where it is good, it\'s good food. I mean, from local, we\'ve got massive amount of restaurants around us and good places, the but like, yeah, Bardstown was really missing some of that, that key and great war and the community is so supportive, and they are so proud of what we\'re doing out here. I know, Ryan\'s gonna kill me too, because he\'s from Barcelona. 24:42 And, but you know, and it\'s great. And because, you know, we\'re very proud to be here. We\'ve all moved here. We moved, you know, probably 20 people here, you know, of our team that have come from all over the country here and settled here to build this great company. But you know, what I would I\'d say is we\'ve created what I would call and we call the modern bourbon experience, and what is that 25:00 It\'s no longer just about drinking bourbon, just straight, all day long going through a formula tour and tasting. When do you want to have these types of products, when you want to enjoy them, a lot of times it\'s going to be over a great setting or a meal, you\'re gonna want them in cocktails, you\'re going to be sitting outside, you\'re going to want to enjoy them, along with a great culinary experience, because that\'s, that\'s a lot about, you know, the, the fun of having great high quality alcohol products. And so it\'s not about over consumption, it\'s about good, responsible consumption of better products. And so, and that\'s where the trends are going. And people want to see they want to know everything about their products. They want to know where they\'re from, they want an experience, and that\'s what you get here. And that\'s what this is. So let\'s talk more about the business side here because I think you bring up something relatively like a good point about finding it in moving 20 people here at least 20 people and finding the right kind of staff 26:00 kind of talk about like how that search really went and you know we john and Steve like they\'re great guys we know them like they\'ve been in the industry for for a while but like talk about everything else that that goes into this from the marketing the promotional the restaurant everything like that to to find the right staff and really what it takes to look outside of just the local area Bardstown. Yeah, I mean, I think you know, at the end of the day, you know that the story of this company is the story of the people that have come together here to build this union of all this fancy equipment and all these great furniture, but it\'s it is the people and the culture and what we have created here and it starts from the top at my level and it goes all the way on down. And we have focused on building the best team from the day that we got here. And we knew it myself, Garnet black, who was our executive vice president hospitality, Dan Lind, our CFO and COO, our chairman Peter loft, and you know, we had to, we had to make sure we were here and so we moved here and 27:00 We started the company. But when you get into each piece, every piece is different. So in the restaurant, for example, we have a program with the State Department. Jay, one program we bring in 20 culinary students from South Africa, India, in the Philippines. We have them in four different locations. Wow, I didn\'t know that. Yeah, we provide transportation educational program, they stay with us a year. Amazing program. We\'re in our second class now of students, because the culinary talent is just not here locally. We then supplement that too, with as much as we can get from the community. You know, our beverage team comes from all over many of them move from Louisville, from some of the best places there. But we try to recruit the best people we can and and show them what the opportunity is here. And to be part of something really exciting. Yeah, we\'ve done it across every aspect of the business. So you have to make those investments and you have to invest in the people and create the right culture in order to do what we\'re doing. That\'s in our opinion, is the is the miracle 28:00 town shaking your hand yet, like thank you for bringing in more people in business. We\'re at about 120 employees. We\'ve had very, very fast growth, we\'re hiring at least another 20. More here. In the next couple of weeks. We\'re opening the visitors experience here. We\'re just a couple weeks away from that the warehouse bar, we have a second kitchen that has just gone in that\'s triple the size of this that\'s going to be covering our all of our catering, wow event opportunities here. So there\'s, you know, there is so much and a lot of hiring. We work closely with the city. We work closely with economic development. We work closely with the Chamber of Commerce in both Louisville and in Nelson County, to really help attract 28:42 the folks and we\'re very invested in and and we think ultimately all of this investment you look at heaven Hill $65 million facility down the street, you\'ve got 2.3 billion over the next eight to 10 years and investment projects in bourbon. A lot of hospitality 29:00 It\'s coming. We\'re going to attract the talent here. It\'s going to be great for the state and it\'s going to be great for the community. Yeah, I mean, it\'s, there\'s, there\'s no shortage of the money that\'s getting pumped into this. And, and it sounds like you all mean it. As as like, you know, starting this business and starting another business, I know that it\'s hard to sit there and be like, all right, where can I see return for a little bit? Let\'s keep pumping money into it until we start, you know, figuring out finding our groove. So like, where do you all see the end of like, the investing into the business until you can sit back? I mean, I don\'t think you I mean, any good business. 29:35 You\'re never stopping the investment. I mean, especially when you\'re doing something, you know, as you know, innovative like we are in cutting edge. You\'re constantly pushing the boundaries here. And I think that\'s one of the things that really is exciting is we\'ve got a very nimble team, we can move quickly. We see opportunities we go after them whether they\'re on, you know, on all of this, even just and to the brand side, pushing innovation, creating 30:00 Very interesting collaborations, testing, trying not everything works. But you\'ve got to be bold enough to give everybody especially the folks on your team, the freedom to run. 30:11 And to you know, you have a good vision set out, you\'ve got good people, you\'ve got a nice structure and you give people the freedom to create any of the right folks on board. You see, amazing things can happen. And that\'s how we\'ve done this in three years. And that\'s the story. Well, it seems from from you know, from your level, that you\'re giving them the freedom and flexibility to go and try things right because it\'s it\'s tough to be able to say like, hey, let\'s go experiment. Let\'s do these things. When we know that we\'ve got to we\'ve got to do a lot of things right to be able to make sure that we are we\'re pushing the boundary our first things out there going to be home run stuff like that, too. I mean, it\'s it\'s hard to have that experimental mentality Come on. It\'s like a lot of things. I mean, you can overthink things and you know, you can over test things, but the real test 31:00 doesn\'t come until you put it in front of the consumer. So you can plan, plan, plan, test tweak. But until you take this and you stick it in front of the consumer, and you find out, do they like this? Do they love the fact that we have complete transparency on the label? How are they going to react to that? Well, the consumer really likes it. Are you going to like these unique finishings where we\'re taking different companies and we\'re pushing the envelope on some of these types of finishings with bourbon? 31:27 You don\'t know until you put them out there. But I think one of the most interesting things is having bottle and bond kitchen and bar in the middle of the facility is like having a laboratory with the consumer. So every day, we\'re experimenting, and we\'re getting direct feedback. So it\'s, this is like our focus group test. You create it, you put a better way to do it, right. I mean, you\'re right here you have, you know, you have an audience that comes in here every single day from all over the world. And we\'re able to try with them lots of different things. We\'re able to get feedback, we\'re able to tell 32:00 So we\'re getting it in real time from consumers. And it\'s a it\'s a another very interesting component of the business that you wouldn\'t necessarily think about. You know how you would use that when you first coming up with the idea. So thinking of ideas and kind of rolling back and I can\'t remember everything we talked about back on episode 19. 32:22 But kind of what was what was the idea of you even wanting to get into this wanting to do this? 32:31 The 2019 Kentucky\'s edge bourbon conference and festival Paris all things Kentucky with bourbon. It takes place October 4 and fifth at venues throughout Covington in Newport Kentucky, Kentucky\'s edge features of bourbon conference music tastings pairings tourists and and artists and market Kentucky\'s edge. 2019 is where bourbon begins.

And we had a vodka company in the early 2000s. And we learned a lot about who\'s we, by the way, myself, Dan Lind, who\'s our CFO and CEO and Garnet black, who is our executive vice president hospitality, we\'d started this vodka company. And, you know, we, we sold that in 2009. And we stayed in the business and we worked. We did a lot of work with lots of different companies in the spirit space, and we connected over that period of time with our chairman and main investor in the company, Peter loft and, and we all you know, sat down and we had this vision for creating something in bourbon, we saw where the market was going. And we wanted to do something and it at the time. It wasn\'t necessarily this, we didn\'t come here with this exact vision in mind, we had another idea. And as we all got into it together, that changed from that to here, and it continues. 35:00 evolved as we learned more, and we saw more every year every year every month as I say that the business changed and everything from standing over there when the when the city was showing this property right across the road a small parcel the turning of looking across here and seeing the hundred acres you know and saying you know what, we can see where this is headed this the Napa Valley style destination experience, you know, begins that you plant begin to plant the seed. And so nothing happens immediately overnight. It\'s it was evolutionary. 35:34 And so you had the idea let\'s get into bourbon, let\'s do this, I guess kind of talk us through those those days to of dealing with the city of, you know, weather permits where they\'re like, hey, was this was this like you saw this place and said yeah, or I mean, how many? How many other like locations where you? First I the city leadership was and is not only extremely supportive, they\'re one of our greatest allies. 36:00 Just in the, you know, in building our business is very important to make sure you have a great relationship there. Kim Houston, who has economic development, our current our current mayor, judge and judge, Dean watts, who is a county judge executive. 36:15 And Bill shackles, who was the former mayor at that time, all So, so supportive, but the funny story is, initially, they didn\'t want to sell us this property, they had it. They had it, you know, slotted or thought out for different business, you know, and when you have an unknown entity coming in, and wanting to buy 100 acres of your best city property, you know, not always 36:38 making all sorts of promises. And like a lot of communities across the country, they get burned with these, you know, people come in, they make promises, they don\'t deliver, they buy things and it doesn\'t materialize. So there\'s a lot of trust and a lot of faith that goes on and I think that\'s one of the things that I am and we are a team most proud of is we have over delivered here in Bardstown, and we\'ve been able to 37:00 Do it with their support. It is had been a team effort across the board with the state with local government. And with the community members, we named we named the company after the town. I mean, we really believe in this place, and we believe in where it\'s going. Yeah. So I know you\'re dying to talk about these kilometers. So let\'s, so let\'s let\'s, let\'s talk about I will, we\'ll talk we can cover this and cover any subjects. 37:25 I mean, like I said, you gotta get a lot of knowledge on the business side of it. I know it\'s, it\'s not a, it\'s not an easy feat to sit here and think like, okay, let\'s, let\'s dive head in. Like let\'s really go all in on this and, and, and, you know, really, I mean, let\'s be honest, like, you look around here, there\'s not you hit the nail head modern type of operation. There\'s no there\'s no corners that have been cut here. There\'s a heavy heavy dollar investment and, and I think, you know, in me personally, that I really want this all to succeed too because there\'s it\'s a different kind of experience than what you see 38:00 Really anywhere else on the drill and this is the funny thing Kenny is this there was a very significant investment made here and there has been in there has been over time. But when you compare this investment with other similarly situated companies, we spent a fraction of what they spent and that is a tremendous testament to our all local construction team. Busa construction that has been with us for six years. And so I still conduct the same construction team meeting at 9am, every Wednesday morning, and we\'ve done it for six years with the same team that has built everything on this site, and will be building everything else. And so it\'s a small team. We\'re nimble, we make decisions immediately versus bringing in huge construction companies and giant engineering firms and architecture firms and nobody\'s really understanding the business or distilling and you know, you get into spending a tremendous amount of money it goes over, you know, goes over budget it goes over time. We have done this again for a fraction of what others have spent. And that\'s really an untold 39:00 portion of the story. We couldn\'t have done this without the use of construction and that team till more of the story then because I mean, that\'s it seems that\'s that\'s really that\'s interesting, right? Because I mean, a, I guess on the other side of it too is is you do get some more of that upfront capital because you can kind of pre sell some of this sort of stuff, the contract, distilling the barrels and everything like that beforehand. It\'s not like me, if I wanted to build this over again, I would have to be like, Oh, I gotta wait five, six years until I have a product right? You can spend a lot of money creating a distillery and especially one of this size. I mean, we are now you know, but we did look, we did it. And I think we did a very smartly in terms of we built, we did it, so we had a modular expansion. So we could go from 25,000 to 50,100 30,000 barrels, we just didn\'t expect to do it in two and a half years. 39:47 It was more like the five to 10 year plan exactly, originally. But you know, so, but the ability to make those changes to say, okay, we\'re going to expand now and now we\'re going to expand again and we\'re going at the same time we\'re going to build a real 40:00 restaurant and a bar and Oh, wait a minute. before we\'re done doing that, we\'re going to start the visitor center. And we\'re going to start bottling. And that is only because we have this relationship, but the construction team that lives with us is effectively an in house construction team. We want to build something, it gets built. We have a problem, it gets fixed. You know, we\'re able to do that now. It\'s a blessing and a curse. You want to build something it\'s all of a sudden you start building something, but it is fun, like the Bochy ball court out there. You know, that showed up a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it was just that was Dan Callaway, his idea. And then now we have a professional Bochy, ball court, you know, construction team goes out there and builds it overnight. So it\'s fun. It\'s also it\'s also good for, 40:40 like employee satisfaction and stuff like that, too. Right. Like, let\'s, let\'s go, let\'s go have lunch play given Bochy will go have a few meetings. That\'s right. Yeah. Yeah. And that\'s right now, so it is, but it is. It is a very important part of the story of how we develop this so quickly, because if you tried to do it with big, conventional 41:00 construction firms, it would be extremely hard, it takes a long time, and it would cost a lot of money. And, you know, I won\'t, you know, point two examples, but you can find them out there in this industry where you have, you know, seen those problems. So talk about as well as, you know, I guess, again, business side, what do you do to like, have employee retention, right, because this is, this is an industry that most of the time people look at account managers, they look at marketing professionals, they look at, you know, you have your culinary side of things, that it\'s a lot of turnover and some of this industry, what do you do to help keep that employee retention and make this a positive working, so we do a tremendous amount there. And a lot of that work is led by Garnet black, who runs is our executive vice president hospitality, but she also is our head of HR and our HR team here, that starts with the culture and it starts with day one, you know, we created our mission, vision and values with our employees. We wrote them together. They participated in writing the employee guide 42:00 lines with us, you know, they we give them we did it all of this together every employee, the first 18 barrels that rolled off the line at this company went to the employees. And most people set most companies sell those for a lot of money. They went to the employees, every employee that starts here, I get a in whiskey gets a barrel of bourbon. Right? Yeah. You know, it\'s everything from, you know, the way you recognize the right way you reward, you know, and the type, the type of culture we create by bringing people\'s families together here too. And so, you know, we look at we emphasize all of those things, and that there\'s appropriate work life balance, and that we support the community and, you know, the charities and the organizations that the employees care about. So there are multiple different levels to this. And in a company that is growing so quickly, we I think we spend a very significant amount of time focused on culture. 42:54 And, and it\'s important, yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, because I come from a tech background. I know most listeners know 43:00 Already and, and so I, I venture out to Palo Alto in the valley very often. And I get to see the ping pong tables and the arcade machines and the puzzle room and also that kind of stuff that most companies around here would be like flabbergasted at. Right. Right, you all build about you ballpark, right? So yeah, you\'re trying to create a culture that makes you feel like you really want to be here, that it really helps, as I said, helps the employee retention but really helps create that sort of like positive environment that you feel good about coming here in China. That\'s exactly right. And that\'s what we try very hard to do. And you know, you\'re running, you know, very different businesses to you have the distilling side of the business, which is very different from the restaurant and the bar, which is different from the visitors experience, which is different from brand sales and marketing with our team that\'s out there in the marketplace. Now. You know, we\'re building world will be in six states with the product by the end of the year, and that is an entirely different business and architecture and one of the most important pieces of the business and we have just this year now ventured into that. 44:00 It\'s actually the part of the business that we know the best, ironically, because that was the business we were in before. We did a lot, right? We did a lot wrong there. But we learned a tremendous amount and it\'s one of the most exciting You know, one of the areas I am certainly most excited about with where we\'re headed is the brand All right, let\'s talk about that. Okay, let\'s talk about I know I\'ve been I\'ve been taken off the rails here and there\'s a lot going on here it well it really is and it\'s it\'s fascinating and talk about what this what the multi do do this and we can keep talking let\'s not wait 200 episodes to do another saying come back here what\'s going to be a different place a year from now as it is six months from now, so So talk about you know, the first three expressions that you all put out what did it take for the collaboration side of this to really make it happen and I should mention that you also you there was the the collaboration series that kind of came out in this like square bottle? Yes, I think about a year or so ago, correct? Well, we have one case of that left. But that would that sparked an idea and so all of us 45:00 I\'ll take back to that. But just to start this, this is the Bardstown bourbon company that you see in front of you, this is our brand format, so that this style bottle, you know, and label, this modern presentation of a cohesive brand. And I think the challenge that you have with any young whiskey or bourbon company, is how do you create and begin to create a brand, when your whiskey that you\'re making here is still maturing in the warehouse and take some time to mature. We don\'t cut corners. We don\'t plan on putting anything out that is young, we made a very early decision that we weren\'t going to put out a six month rye and a one year old, right? That we were really going to wait and we were going to put it out when things were ready because we\'re not under a rush. But in the meantime, we want to do we want to create really exciting things. So what\'s happening, what are the trends in the industry? Where are things going? blending, blending is a very exciting trend. It started in scotch. It\'s been going on for a long, long time, but it really is becoming you know more 46:00 Prominent now bourbon, we want to be great at that. And what\'s unique about it, we got a Distilling Team, a beverage team and a culinary team that are now all different flavor experts in cocktail team is looking at I mean, a beverage teams looking for cocktail balance, colonnade teams looking at for pairings distilling teams work looking at traditional methods, and they\'re blending for those reasons. So as we began to get into it, how do we bridge that gap? Well, we start with, you know, a couple of different expressions fusion. Our fusion series tells the story of our blending capability but begins to introduce our young bourbon in with a fully mature or older bourbon and we put it all on the label. So we have 60% of this is two year old bourbon. One is a 20% wheat one is a 36% rye, blended with a 11 and a half year old Kentucky, so it\'s a Kentucky straight bourbon. And what you get is these bright notes from the younger bourbon with kind of the heavier 47:00 You know the notes from the older bourbon and it makes a very complex blend, where you would get much more of just a uniform product. If you had just the 11 and a half year old here, you\'re putting these really neat notes. And we went this process went through 50, blind tastings with the Distilling Team, the commentary team and the beverage team to arrive at this unique blend. Its series one, because it\'s going to adapt. Next year at 6040, maybe several months from now, it\'ll be 7030, then at 20, but you get to really kind of see how this is going to change as we move to our fully mature product. Then Discovery Series. Discovery is our series that just is about making phenomenal blends using whiskey and bourbon that we didn\'t produce ourselves. So Discovery Series, one is a blend of four Kentucky straight Bourbons, the core of it being 11 and a half year old, but you\'ve got some, you know, sprinkled in 13 year old 10 year old and five year old and again, went through the same process with the 48:00 Teams blending. And instead of having one singular product, they\'re adding these like, it\'s like little notes like little spice notes into the blend, so that you\'re getting something much more complex. And it\'s really neat again, went through multiple blind tastings with those teams to arrive at this. Yeah. So I mean, that\'s and that\'s what I think is what you\'re starting to find that a lot more prominent now is being able to get these, these these older Bourbons and then do this blending and there\'s going to be varied amounts of the type of one product, a proof of another product. And really, you\'re not going to find the same thing everywhere you go when you do this as well. It really makes it fun because the consumer is looking for interesting things. The consumer is open to innovation, which is where the collaborative series comes in. And you go back to the square bottle. So that idea started over dinner with Joe Harris, from copper and kings. And I was sitting with him and we said, let\'s Why don\'t we just start 49:00 This was three four years ago. Let\'s just start making some neat stuff. We had this glass, we actually owned inventories of 10 and a half year old MGP Indiana bourbon 21% rye. So we took Muscat misspell barrels. And we finished, selected the bourbon finish this bourbon in the Muscat misspelled us for 18 months with the same with American brandy. It was a remarkable product. And it sparked this idea of why don\'t we create a series very limited edition that tell the story of two great companies working together to produce a really unique product. So then we did the fight for Patrick reserve with Suzanne Fiverr private, great winemaker out in Napa Valley 18 month finish in her Napa Valley cab barrels 18 months is quite a quite a long time. I mean, usually you hear about finishing it\'s like two to three months, maybe a few ways. Yeah, we were doing 18 month finish on every one of our products at a minimum. And it\'s a major investment. But you see a remarkable difference. You know, some people will say oh, you know, the products done 50:00 It\'s going to turn. We have never seen that yet. And I you know, Joe Heron is a huge, you know, believer in this to just keep waiting. And so we have 10 more of these products, projects coming out. We\'ve got three more with copper and kings. We have a really neat one one coming out and beginning of next year with prisoner one. So fabulous that\'s been that has been finishing now over 16 months. We have great Armagnac house a really neat run one again, we\'re not held on whole story of the two companies working together. And so these remarkably long finishes produce exceptional products. We actually go one step further to we make sure that there is no degradation in the underlying quality of the wine or spirits. So for example, our wine cast, we ship on refrigerated trucking across the country, they never sit out in the heat, not even for a second they come off the truck, they\'re filled. And so you prevent all degradation. So tremendous care and making them as well to say I was like, that\'s a that\'s 51:00 Investment right there, just I mean, I know what it takes to ship a barrel, you know, across 51:05 state lines and everything like that. But now to put in a refrigerated truck here, it\'s, it\'s a lot more expensive. But at the end of the day, you know, our goal is to create exceptional products. Because if you make really good quality things you\'re going to do great. And that is, we just firmly believe that, you know, if you go take the extra steps to make an exceptional product with a really deep authentic story. You know, that\'s what consumer, that\'s what many consumers are looking for these days. And we see it every day. Absolutely. And so I mean, it\'s it\'s good to see that this is where the brand\'s heading, you\'re doing a lot of good things here too. When do you start seeing it? Because granted, I know you contract with a lot of stuff, but you\'re also distilling for yourself. Oh, yeah. So all right. Oh, yeah. A lot for yourself. So what\'s the what\'s the next phase of, you know, taking fusion to its its own so you\'ll see you 52:00 You\'ll see that fusion blend change, you know, multiple times. And then what you\'re really looking at is about 2022 when our whiskey and bourbon is, you know, really hitting that, you know, about five to six year sweet spot, that\'s when you\'re going to start seeing it. And so you\'ll see rye and different bourbon mash bills. We\'ve been doing a lot with malt whiskey. 52:20 We have a lot of experimentation taking place to so I think there\'s a lot of exciting things everything also, you know, we\'re going to be launching a single barrel program here shortly for the public and for retailers, which is different because because we do 40 different mash bills and we create so many different things. You\'re not limited as a consumer you\'re going to come into our new bear can be quite the quite the experience and like I don\'t know if we\'ll be able to make it through all these Nashville\'s exactly so you go Rick house bar here, which is beautiful. I you know, I think we\'re going to take you out and see all these things today. But that structure, you have all glass looking into the warehouse, it\'s all lit, beautiful setting intimate bar, we\'re going to be able to provide 53:00 The consumer the retailer with five six different selections different mash bills you\'ll be at a try those barrels you\'ll be able to secure them now you\'ll wait several years will bottle them for you and you know you have a very different single barrel you know pick program where you\'re not just limited to one tiny let\'s do a whole array of different things yeah, I mean that\'s that\'s gonna be impressive when that when that comes around because a lot of fun Yeah, well Sign me up 53:29 great Yeah, no, I mean it\'s it\'s it\'s cool because there\'s there\'s definitely room at of what you all are doing and pushing the envelope not only just in regards of the whiskey production, the kitchen, the single barrel program and one thing we even talked about was the vintage whiskey you all are doing as well like that\'s it that\'s the way it is here. It is so exciting. And as part of the new visitors experience, we have a whiskey library that we have built a little secret hidden library back that you can do dinner for up to 10 people in it. And we\'re that\'s where we display and showcase our 400 bottles of vintage whiskey. 54:00 that date back to the late 1800s. We secure that and curated the collection with Fred Minnick. It\'s all for sale by the poor. And it is we built the product we built that collection based on stories. And we didn\'t wasn\'t based on volume it was based on what is some really hard to get very unique products that tell great stories. And so some of the some of them back there are absolutely incredible. And they further the whole discussion about whiskey and bourbon. So you come here and again, carry everything but you have discussions like why is you know, the Old Crow chess set considered one of the best whiskeys made? Why is this 1929 see grams Canadian bourbon, which we have, which was before you know, the the statute went into place. Why was that at eight years old? so unbelievably rich. Why are some of these products so terrible? Yeah, that\'s right. That\'s, that\'s 54:56 a stuff and you\'re like, Well, that was Yeah, that was good. 55:00 And you know, and so, but it starts a conversation. And, and that\'s what this is all about. That\'s what I mean, the enjoyment of whiskey, and bourbon, and all of these things is all about a conversation. It\'s all about an experience. It\'s all about trying things, sharing things, talking about them. And that is at the core of who we are, and what this place is about. All we want all those conversations about all different things happening in here. It\'s not just about one brand, or just about our brand, our brands great. And we will put it against anything. But there are also other wonderful producers out there, and it\'s a big community. And we want all those discussions taking place in here. Now, absolutely. And you know, as we kind of wrap this up and start thinking about really what\'s on the horizon for you, like on the business side, like where do you Where do you kind of want to see this year? I mean, shit, you already talked about, hey, we\'re expanding every six months, but like, do you want to stop expanding? Like is there is there a time when you\'re like, hey, like, let\'s let\'s pump the brakes on this for a little bit. I mean, you are seeing the expansion is we\'re not in 56:00 anticipating further expansion in distillery, so are now our focus we have you know, upgrading yes improving our capabilities always. But we are now focused on building the brand building the visitors experience and the elements around that including bottling and the hotel. And so those are things that we are looking at right now. And we\'re really excited about that\'s what\'s on the horizon and making this a fully not only a fully integrated production entity from you know, from whiskey production to storage to bottling but also on the vent on the visitors experience side, from restaurant to bar to lodging to being able to stay here in the heart of the bourbon capital of the world and make this a full destination experience Am I gonna be able to use my Marriott Rewards points here you know, and I went on a yet 56:49 so we\'ll leave it on that you know, David, I want to thank you again for coming on. You know, like I said, For for Ryan and myself and Orion\'s on here, but we always like to hear, you know, we can always talk about like, oh, 57:00 We can do this many barrels a day able to love but, you know, hearing it from a business aspect, I think is one one crucial component that I think a lot of people need to understand as we start getting this and, and you you really talked about it earlier about how you create the culture. And the culture is what builds everything around it right that point and, and really what ultimately makes any venture successful. That\'s right. And I look and I want to congratulate you guys, because your growth has been as significant as ours and you know, up to 200 podcasts now. It\'s incredible.

You know 1:08 This is Episode 217 of bourbon pursuit. I\'m one of your host Kenny. And as usual, a little bit of news to go through. So larceny from heaven Hill has launched a new app. It\'s an augmented reality app called unlock the Rick house. The app was inspired by the history of john II Fitzgerald. He was a treasury agent back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and was one of the only people that was legally allowed to carry the keys to the barrel storage Rick houses with a discerning palate for fine bourbon john Fitzgerald often uses Rick house keys to gain access to some of the finest bourbon barrels for himself. And those barrels from which he chose to help himself were often referred to as the Fitzgerald barrels around the distillery. The infamous active larceny led to the larceny brand and has now inspired the newest augmented reality app. So Once downloaded, you can explore the Rick houses by tapping on each one to search for the prize winning 2:00 Fitzgerald barrel, and from September 1 through December 31. Each tap of the Rick house gains one entry into the grand prize of $10,000. Daily prizes will also be awarded and include everything from a mini barrel shot glass and larceny magnets all the way up until a larceny guitar or an LED sign. So you can get unlock the Rick house available now on the Apple Store and Google Play. On Tuesday this week, I had the pleasure of joining four roses master distiller Brett Elliot, to a special media preview of the 2019 limited edition small batch, were able to ask him anything in taste through all the individual lots that comprised of this batch. And here\'s some of the details. The 2019 limited edition small batch will have a breakdown of four different bourbon runs. There is an 11 year old ESV that accounts for 26 27% of the blend. A 15 year old GSB at 40% of them blend a 15 year old ESK with 25% and a 2:59 21 year old BSB at 8% on the blind, and we got to go through each one of these and kind of rate them all and kind of figure out how they all lead into creating their own blend and the 21 year OBSV had the best knows it was super okie but the finish lacks some depth. And there was I know there\'s a lot of OESK lovers out there, but this one had a pretty strong bite to it honestly wasn\'t my favorite. However, the 15 year OESV was the real star of the show. This had depth and complexity and just kept going at all the right components into it. But come to find out. This is the same version of OESV that was sold at the gift shop this past year for Father\'s Day. So there\'s a few lucky people out there sitting on some really good bourbon right now. And the final proof of this will be 112.6 with around 13,440 bottles to be released in the US in around 3002 the rest of the world with an MSRP of $139 and 99 cents. 4:00 During this time with Brent, we also discussed the barrels and if we would ever see a single barrel limited edition ever again. Well, the unfortunate news is that he said it\'s likely to never happen again. With the explosive growth of bourbon, it\'s almost impossible to find a run of barrels that were all distilled at one time that would be able to satisfy this type of demand. Instead, these runs will be saved for future small batches for years to come. He said they have plenty of high AH stock. So this is great to hear for enthusiasts like us. And hope you\'re out there enjoying these whiskey quickies that we\'re releasing. As we get into the fall we\'re going to be bringing new reviews of all the newest releases including next week\'s as we review the new four roses small batch Limited Edition. All right now on to the podcast. On this Roundtable. We talk about bourbon festival season as we just wrapped up one, but we\'re heading into bourbon and beyond right around the corner. And if you haven\'t yet, go get your tickets. We\'d love to see you there. Drink some good bourbon and listen to some good tunes. But after that, we dive into 5:00 To the acquisition business was the 230 $3 million deal for Pernod Ricard to acquire castle brands which Jeffers is a part of. Was that a good deal? Well, we had a lot of folks that were commenting in our chat section and talking about the EPA or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It\'s a measure of a company\'s operating performance. One comment we received was from Craig Kessler, he\'s a Chief Investment Officer as well as an executive bourbon Stewart. So he talked about per node selling wild turkey at 12 times its EPA, while brown Forman was selling at 10 x. So per node got an above market value during the time of the value of other competitors out there in the market. As for promotes re entry to the market, castle was trading at a price sales ratio of one x and per node paid about to exit the company. So brown Forman is currently trading at eight x. So per node is paying 75% less than brown Forman on a price per sales basis. So from this production 6:00 It looks like four nodes sold above market for wild turkey and bought castle below. So we\'ll see about more of that into the podcast that after that we also dive into PBR is new whiskey, the artificial tongue and if you tariff data that\'s now been published is still going to continue to wreak havoc on new exports. All right, now let\'s get on to it. Let\'s hear a word from Joe over a barrel bourbon, and then you\'ve got Fred Minnick with above the char. I\'m Joe Beatrice, founder of barrell craft spirits. I know I talk a lot about blending here. But we also have a national single barrel program asked you a local retailer or bourbon club about selecting your own private barrel. 6:41 I\'m Fred Minnick, and this is above the char. In 2013. I started a series at the Kentucky Derby Museum called the legend series. It was a great opportunity for me to sit down with the legends of the industry and ask them questions about their careers and taste their whiskeys. I\'ve talked to great people. 7:00 Julian Van Winkle, Edwin Foote, Harlan Wheatley, Chris Morris, Bill Samuels, Jimmy Russell, Jimmy Rutledge, and many, many, many more. It\'s been one of the most important events of my career. And now as I go into building the eighth season of The Legend series for the Kentucky Derby Museum, I just look back on it, and all. It\'s also where I made my first connection with the fellas here at bourbon pursuit. You may have heard this story where Ryan showed up and forgot to turn on the microphone. We still razz him about that. But it really was a great, great moment. I think, not just for me or the Kentucky Derby Museum. But for all of bourbon. The Legends Series was really one of the first high level high education events that allowed people to get really connected to a master distiller or a CEO and learn about what makes them 8:00 Tick. And I\'m very glad to see that today we know everybody\'s mash bill. We know people\'s business procedures. And you have companies like heaven Hill who are creating diagrams for social media about airflow in a warehouse. So much has changed in eight years and the people who are most to be credited with this, are you, you the consumer have more power today than ever before. And let me tell you, the whiskey distillers pay attention a lot more to what you think, than they do. The USA Today or the New York Times, you are the most powerful person in the all the equation of American whiskey. They follow what you say on social media. They follow what you listen to what you read, and they want to know your opinion, constantly. So join me in the further pursuit of knowledge and let\'s 9:00 asked people to open up and tell us more about their distilleries. Some people may think it\'s unfathomable to know what\'s going behind the scenes when they\'re making a price increase, or what they\'re thinking when they\'re changing their barrel entry proof. But eight years ago, heaven Hill didn\'t disclose their mash bills. Now, they freely tell you every single grain that goes into their whiskies, so things can change. And that\'s this week\'s above the char. Hey, make sure you\'re following me on Twitter and Instagram. So you can come to next year\'s Kentucky Derby Legends Series. You can find me at Fred Minnick again at Fred Minnick. Cheers. 9:45 Welcome, everybody. This is the 36 recording of the bourbon Community Roundtable. This is where we talk about what\'s happening in bourbon bourbon culture bourbon news. We\'ve got a lot of topics to cover, but you know, this is also the beginning and how we\'re kicking off 10:00 bourbon heritage month so everybody welcome to bourbon heritage month it\'s kind of like our Super Bowl if we will right we\'re finally here doing that. But you know not only this bourbon Heritage Month starting to kick off but one of the biggest things is this is also turning into festival season. You know we just wrapped up bourbon on the banks. There\'s one called Kentucky\'s edge that\'ll be coming up and first week October however, Fred Super Bowl here is here and in two weeks so Fred you getting getting mighty pumped for bourbon and beyond? Yeah, bourbon and beyond is right around the corner. I\'ve got two other festivals right before that one but bourbon and beyond is my baby. I work on a year round. We\'ve been working so hard on it, obviously we got the Foo Fighters ZZ Top. 10:41 Alison Krauss, Robert Plant, Zac Brown band we got all these incredible bands but we also have 10:47 you know, grand Melia from top chef and we have a lot of lot of cool panels here. So you all are on the panels. Nick Jordan\'s there on behalf of breaking bourbon. But I\'m very proud of 11:00 The curation of the panels this year, and it\'s just an incredible, incredible lineup of of education and cocktail. Yeah, I mean, do you want to kind of give people a little bit of a teaser on what some of these panels are so they can go out and yeah, so well one year of moderating Kenny is like what is a master distiller and that\'s something that we in our community we talked about all the time like what is a master distiller? I mean right now technically Brian who\'s just a lawyer could be a master distiller without even going any kind of like training for it. We\'re I\'m moderating a panel about the history of slavery and American whiskey. This is the very first time that anybody in our industry has approached this and I want people to realize that you know, this is something that 11:50 you know, it we, we kind of like avoided a lot but you have people like fun Weaver 11:58 and you know, who\'s bringing 12:00 to the forefront and making sure people want to talk you know, make sure people talk about it because it is something important that is a part of the American whiskey heritage. And I don\'t think we should just like gloss over it with and so that that\'s, that\'s a big seminar we\'ve also got one called bourbon disruptors. I\'m excited about Brian\'s panel that he\'s doing. It\'s called whiskey dark past, you know, there\'s been a lot of murders, there\'s been a lot of bootlegging. All kinds of shenanigans have been associated with with American whiskey. And, and so you have some some deep ones. And then we have some like real basic like high about how to make a high ball and how to make a man hat and an old fashion. We have a lot of stuff like that as well. So licenses, as well as the hardcore ones. Yeah, and I think at least all of us, we\'re super excited to actually be there be a part of it beyond the panels. And, you know, while we\'re doing that, let\'s go ahead and introduce all of our guests that are here or sorry, our typical roundtable member 13:00 Is that are here today. So let\'s start off with somebody who might not be able to be here for that much longer because he\'s getting ready to start batten down the hatches as as the hurricane starts making his way so Blake from Florida checking in How are you, buddy? Doing well, How are y\'all? 13:18 We\'re trying to sneak sneak in a little bit. Yeah, it\'s been quite the week we you know, I\'m kind of a little bit of a procrastinator on the on the storm side, but this one looks like we could get a little bit so yeah, no school for the next two days at least. 13:36 Well, good deal. Well, make sure you you stay safe out there. You know, we\'re all we\'re all making sure that you know, everything is everything\'s good for you, as well as all the other flirty and bourbon residents that are down there. So hopefully everybody is staying safe and heat and all the warnings of evacuating if you actually need to evacuate. That is true. Yeah, you know, but the streak continues. I just kind of throw that out there. The streak continues. 14:00 Introduction. 14:01 Absolutely this qualifies. It sure does. Yep. Yep. So Blake, if you could go back 10 to family please do please go for it, man. Thanks for thanks for chiming in here. 14:12 Yeah, I\'m good for a few minutes. arena question Where were we? Not yet we\'re just still we just started going through the the table just going around the horn so well. 14:23 Yeah. Well, let\'s take a break. So Brian, you go ahead and take next. Yeah, thanks, Fred. And again, this is Brian with sip and corn. You can find me on Twitter and Facebook sipping corn Instagram to sip and corn and online at bourbon justice calm and sip and corn calm and just to echo Fred\'s comments. 14:44 Probably no one is is is as excited as he is. But I\'m I might be second place got rained out last year for my bourbon workshop. So I\'m really excited about doing it this this year. And Fred Thanks for including me. Yeah. 14:58 And Nick, let\'s go ahead break 15:00 bourbon. Let\'s hear it. All right, thanks, Kenny. I\'ve Nick from breaking bourbon breaking bourbon com. Check us out on social media at breaking bourbon. And yeah, unfortunately, I will not be able to make bourbon and beyond this year, but Jordan will be there. I will say I am pretty disappointed. It was a pretty fantastic festival last year even with the day the rain out the second day. And you know, I think anybody who\'s gonna be making it out there probably won\'t be disappointed. So I\'m sure Fred you\'re probably going nuts now still getting ready for this thing but yeah, it\'s a pretty fantastic bourbon festival seems to seems like it\'s only getting better year after year. Wow. Thanks, guys. I gotta tell you, you know, it means a lot to me hearing you all say that because, you know, getting rained out. It was like it was like a gut punch. And it was just so it was really devastating because we had to cancel the other festival which is the Hard Rock Festival louder than life the next weekend. So all three days were canceled. 16:00 So we\'re really hoping and praying that we don\'t we have great weather and we\'re at a weird a better location that can handle the rain so like it\'s at the fairgrounds it\'s like right across from the actual Expo Center building and it\'s like that flat plane and it\'s a much more it\'s not as beautiful as champions park with all the trees but it\'s something that you know is if if this thing floods the whole city\'s underwater 16:32 there\'s gonna be a new meters thick that\'s going to be on the side of the bridges the show the the great flooded 20 2019 if that\'s what it is. Knock on wood. Yeah, let\'s we\'re not gonna have that it\'s gonna be remember the first year it was hotter than hell out. The second year was just torrential downpour. Third year it\'s got to be just clear skies. It\'s what it has to get it perfect. Yep. Alright, so let\'s jump into it. So the first topic of conversation is kind of a big one. You know, we\'ve had days all our 17:00 on the show before good friend of the show from Jeffersons, and it was announced last week that Pernod Ricard is going to acquire castle brands which Jefferson\'s a part of that portfolio for 223 million. So it\'s good to see that porno is still still on the hot streak of buying a lot of stuff. You know, I was just looking at Castle brands. His website, of course, like Jefferson\'s is the one that kind of screams out to a lot of us. But they\'ve got they\'ve got an Irish cream and an Irish vodka. They\'ve got Gosling\'s rum, they\'ve got Aaron whiskey, which I had never really come around before. But again, it\'s a it\'s a bigger portfolio but it\'s it\'s pretty good to see this sort of thing you know, we\'ve been not really not accustomed to seeing a lot of these. These brands start getting acquired. Now porno is actually kind of on a buying streak. It seems a lot recently. 17:51 You all kind of see. This is a trend that\'s going to continue to happen like do you think these more smaller brands are going to continue to keep getting 18:00 swallowed up by a lot of these big ones. 18:03 One thing that I noticed about this and I know, I know what they\'re paying for, obviously 223 million sounds like a lot of money. But for these larger companies, it\'s really, to me that\'s a that\'s a low amount for a brand like Jefferson\'s, which really is a workhorse. I mean, that that\'s a good selling brand that, you know, that alone could have probably sold, you know, you know, five years ago when you had high West sell for 170 $5 million. You know, Jefferson\'s was 10 times the brand of high YS at that point. So I think and I know what I know what rabbit holes sold, but I can\'t really say and I felt like that was a low amount as well. And so I feel like they\'re getting these these these brands that might be in debt and they may not have as much like 18:56 you know, may not they I don\'t know what 19:00 How porno is doing this, but that\'s not a lot of money for for castle brands. I just don\'t I just don\'t think there was anyone else looking to buy them. And so, right now you have the big companies and I don\'t know if they\'re out there looking to buy up, you know, brands unless it\'s like white cloth at the moment. You know, the like laws the hot one. So I guess that you know I come from the I always say that where I come from the tech side and so seeing things in the, you know, a couple hundred million dollars of acquisitions aren\'t, you know, it doesn\'t really I don\'t really bat an eye at it anymore. So you said that 223 millions just really not a lot. 19:37 And you think that it also could be 19:41 are there really only like a just a tiny handful of big players in this game that actually have the capital to acquire and if they already have something that\'s in their portfolio, do they need to continue to keep acquiring? Yeah, let\'s look at the brands that the big. The big portfolio is proud for 20:00 pronounce Ricard Diaz. Do you throw Proxima in there? BM Suntory obviously 20:07 Karen which has four roses would you know throw them in there and you know there might be a couple others that could really move the needle but you have to look at like what are the who has what it says rack Africa says RX a big player obviously. 20:27 And in 2009 porno basically got out of the American whiskey game when they when they spun off 20:35 you know Barton and you know, wild turkey and so you had like this incredible you know, they got rid of these these great brands and 20:47 and, and now they\'re trying to get back into the game after it was too late and pornos got a great Irish Whiskey portfolio. So Irish Whiskey is the only you know, whiskey that\'s really hotter than bourbon and 21:01 It makes sense for them to to try and get some jargon juggernauts but you know they\'ve got smooth Ambler rabbit hole now and Jefferson I think they got rabbit hole really because of the facilities and rabbit holes facilities have incredible potential for expansion they fit right into the like the tourism model and Jefferson\'s is a hot hot brand smooth Ambler two is got you know they\'re they\'ve penetrated a lot of really good markets so they made some interesting moves and I think they did them at you know whoever negotiated their deals I think probably did a very good job for them. Yeah, you know Nick or Brian Do you kind of see this as is Fred said it is this PR know kind of like crawling back into the market a little bit. You know if you know if you got rid of wild turkey at the wrong time because you thought it was a you know, basically a bad stock and you sold when the you sold out when is low and you know you bought it when is high like it they tried to like flip the script for themselves here. Well 22:00 I think they they definitely trying to do that. But they\'re they\'re filling their roster with D league players instead of what they lost. And I think their problem is going to be capacity. I mean, how can they increase production of any of those without huge distilleries to be able to turn this out? I see that is their issue. I mean, they they can get some from rabbit hole and they can get some from smooth Ambler. But that\'s a ways off. 22:28 Jefferson\'s is still just bottling in Crestwood. Right? I mean, they don\'t have a whole lot of capacity of their own. They\'re still sourcing. So where\'s it going to come from? So I see it is problematic there, they\'re buying the league players, and they can\'t, they\'re not going to be able to increase production. And I think that to kind of piggyback on the sourcing, and that\'s, you know, probably the comments that were, at least that I saw, you know, here in there, with, of course, the focus then Jefferson\'s in the in the bourbon world. 23:00 With respect to this acquisition, you know that\'s the question thing about high West with Ambler there, they\'ve got distilleries, they\'ve got the that kind of capability, you know with Jefferson\'s for example, it really is the brand that\'s bought the distribution you know, the labels that that kind of thing. So kind of to Brian\'s point it\'s that you know, it\'s that want to get back in the game want to get in in the game. I think there\'s still a lot of growth potential in general, but it\'s what is that you know, what are you going to do with that so now they\'ve got two brands now they\'ve got a pull out from you know, pull out from behind them probably invest quite a bit more Jefferson\'s to like they go from a company that didn\'t necessarily didn\'t necessarily have the ability to walk into a company like brown Forman and and strike a deal for 5000 barrels of stock. I\'m not saying that\'s going to happen now if you\'re in our carbon now printer card. I mean, trees owners got muscle like NASA castle brand was is like 24:00 You know, that was like, 24:02 you know, a triple A baseball team, you know, in comparison to our car, who would be the Boston Red Sox or the Yankees, you know? So the buying power that they have to be on the source market. I mean, it just went up. And because they can, they can strike deals that he could never dream of before when they start sourcing from wild turkey that or MGP, which, you know, they they own the facilities after, after Seager. I\'m sad to shutter all their stuff. 24:35 They got the facility in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and DIZO. got, you know, Crown Royal and they\'re like, you know, who got the better end of the deal on that because they can never make Pernod Ricard can never make that Lawrenceburg, Indiana distillery work, and they sold it to LDI. And that, you know, I became kind of like the source capital but so that would be ironic if they end up sourcing from wild turkey. 25:00 GP. 25:02 And I guess another question that kind of throw at you all about this is do we see, this is going to be a lot tougher game going into this, you know, we had Trey on the on the podcast before I last year and we talked to him he said like, Is it getting harder now with sourcing, like our people kind of trend in your territory or you are in had all these relationships for and now you\'ve got people that are on your turf barrel prices are going up. How can you maintain, you know, with not actually having a distillery that can pump significant volume? You know, is this was this a good buy for per node like it? It\'s That\'s a tough question. I think. I think Brian kind of alluded to that and I wouldn\'t say that they\'re, you know, deep play or anything like that. I I still am a fan of Jeffersons. I still like the whiskey they put out. However, in regards of an operation, it might have been a kind of a weird acquisition in my opinion. Anybody have any thoughts of like, is 26:00 Is ditches they don\'t actually do a lot of distilling or heavy distilling, like Was it a good acquisition? Or is it just something that you know as Nick said to it, just maybe a brand recognition thing that you have to understand like this business is driven by brands like we look at things from where the liquid liquid comes from, but this business is really driven by like a name and they\'re like it or not, whether you if you if you follow it or not, the Jeffersons ocean is one of the one of the best like marketing ploys of of the last 1015 years and American whiskey. Now I remember asking, I remember asking Trey for to see a man manifest that was barrels at that it was going to punch me but you know, you\'ve got you have some people who disbelieve in that it\'s the ocean barrel concept, but he does put them out there and it\'s been one of the best like my 27:00 And the conversations that are marketing boys, I\'ve turned into conversations. 27:05 At least in my world, everyone\'s like is a real? Is it real? Is it you know, so it\'s it\'s one of those things that it\'s probably just just on that alone. And the fact that Jeffersons is, is everywhere. 27:19 I think it was a great, great acquisition for PR now. So there\'s another comment here from Dan wall ski, you know, he sees Jefferson\'s brand is probably worth the investment. However, he wouldn\'t be surprised to see it now eventually start getting separated from Kentucky artisan and then becoming like a visitor destination of its own now, it\'s a pretty good theory, I think for for what this could potentially be and where could go to think about the Kentucky owl situation, for example, you know, immediately it\'s the plans for a gigantic, gigantic park in distillery, you know, so are we going to see something like that? Is that going to be the growth plan for her, not in this 28:00 Or are they just going to keep you know, continuing with the brand as it is and sourcing and kind of doing business as usual? Be curious to see how that changes over time. 28:10 For sure, and I think you know, there\'s there\'s also something that kind of it kind of jogged my memory when I think about this when we look at you know, we had Corky was last week\'s podcast, we\'ve had coffee from rabbit hole on and there\'s always like this. A lot of these CEOs they say a lot of the same things of like, we\'re never going to sell this is going to remain in the family forever. And then it\'s like, is it though like is it like is it puts a fat check in front of your face? Like it\'s got to be pretty hard to turn down. There\'s always a number. I agree. I think you have to look at you know, let\'s take a look at at those two particular brands. Kobe had a lot of investors. 28:56 Corky did all this with his own money and he\'s got 29:00 Trust lined up and everything, it always comes down to the money. And look man, I\'m in business. I don\'t come from money. I\'ve had to work for everything I\'ve gotten. And when you sit down in a room with with money people, you know, they always want something. So, you know, you give up something to give up shares of your company or something to get what you want out of them. But this, you know, there comes a point where they\'re like, okay, we\'ve had a good time on this fried where\'s our payout? We went out and that we want to cash out and so everything depends upon how your business structure is when you have these small distillers 29:41 you know one other one other in games is that like, this is Yeah, no, I agree. And I think for anybody that is ever getting into business like you always want to think like yes I do for the passion. I do it for the for the joy of what it is, but at the end of the day, if somebody puts a big fat check in front, your face 30:00 That\'s, that\'s part of the American dream too. So you can\'t you can\'t discount that. So, you know, as we kind of almost kind of switch gears a little bit. And this is one that I actually kind of like this one because Fred sent this a little bit before we started here. And this was the fact that 30:18 PBR is getting ready to start making their very own whiskey. So I will drop the link here into the chat. I\'m also going to drop it into 30:28 the YouTube chat as well so you can kind of see it, but really what it is, is PBR is now making a whiskey that\'s been aged for a complete total of five seconds. So that should probably already kind of get your blood flowing a little bit. So they have recently talked about their have a new, hard sell to it\'s coming out with a percent. But now they\'re actually going to be doing a 40% whiskey. It\'s already 40% ABV that has been aged for five seconds. So Fred kind of talked about this one Fred does this. Make your blood boil a little bit 31:00 Yeah, I have two words for PBR. Fuck you. 31:07 Yeah, I think it\'s I think it\'s a, you know, PBR is trying to be trendy and they got some headlines with this. But you know, 31:20 given that we\'re, we have a brand that\'s raised, basically repackaged Zi Ma, taking over the space of 31:30 millennial consumption. And actually really, Why call penetrates the entire world right now. 31:37 Anything is possible with what will be the next big thing and PBR has got a big brand behind it and I just, I just wish they would, you know, 31:47 this is this is a mockery of whiskey so i just i hate everything about it. 31:55 Nick, do you share any the same the same feelings, you know, I 32:00 Always look, I do think it\'s interesting, it really created a buzz I think people who may not normally think about whiskey or bourbon or what they really are, you know, I think that just that buzz about that it\'s going to go into a container into an oak container, it\'s going to be aged for five seconds or, you know, whatever they end up doing with it, if anything, that\'s an awareness, you know, piece of will have number one, how good is it going to be, you know, so for somebody that is just doing shots at a bar, they never think about anything, you know, as far as you know, whether they like things that are you know, higher quality, you know, longer aged, etc. What am I really drinking? Where does it get its color from things of that nature? It may cause some people to kind of get curious about what\'s really there. And I think once people start getting educated reach the point of, you know, anybody who\'s listening to this or watching this right now, you know, you\'re obviously this is much farther behind, you know, where your journey started, or, you know, much farther behind where you are now where your journey started, but I think that\'s the interesting 33:00 part about it is kind of just that awareness. And what\'s probably a younger crowd that\'s going to be more, you know, 33:07 in tune with this or tasting this or whatever the case might be, you know, where it might make some people curious about exploring a little further and eventually getting to the point where they respect what\'s going on with the actual, you know, creation and aging and things of that nature. So I think it\'s interesting I don\'t hate it in the same way that I guess that Fred does. You know, Willie succeed. I don\'t know. You know, it\'s it\'s different than the beer in that sense of, you know, the beer. I see the market for this. I\'m not so sure. I guess we\'ll see. Yeah, I think you look at it, like everybody wants to try to create something. And you know, what\'s PBR? PBR is not supposed to be some glorious luxury brand, right? Like this is supposed to be like bottom shelf like how like, How fast can we get this out the door and you know, really just churn product. And this might be following that same exact suit. I\'m not too sure if this is supposed to be a a premium product by name. 34:00 Yeah, they\'re not trying to be premium and I guess from my standpoint it PBR five second whiskey has no impact on me whatsoever and I don\'t care about it. But I see where it\'s it\'s going like like Nick said it\'s going to be at the is going to be at the bar for a shot and hopefully it overtakes 34:22 you know, some of these other flavored whiskeys which I don\'t care about either as the you know, the new hot shot for college age through mid 20s. And then there\'s going to be a market for that and there always will be in my day it was Yeager Meister and you know, that\'s awful. 34:42 So, you know, knock knock your socks off, go ahead and do a five second whiskey. Try to sell it by by the shot to 24 year olds and I\'ll keep drinking what I\'ve been drinking. 34:55 So you know, you talked about flavored whiskey there. Have you all seen the the new phenomenon of 35:00 screwball the peanut butter flavored whiskey. Okay, I think I had it first at your house to tell you the truth. But it started it\'s starting to catch on now like it\'s out here. Now I see it here. It\'s I mean, it\'s in all the forums, people are talking about it. It\'s like It\'s like the white glove whiskey right now. That was the first time I had it was bourbon and beyond last year. So I don\'t want to call myself a trendsetter. But you know, we did a 35:28 shout out to Tony from keg and bottle who actually gave me that probably about a year and a half ago. And he said, Kenny, I kid you not, this is going to be the next fireball. And so I mean, I guess a year and a half ago, he gave it to me and now all of a sudden, like people are buying and it\'s taken off a little bit, but you gotta like peanut butter, that\'s for sure. Because Yeah, definitely definitely has that. That flavor to it. Okay, then liked it or hate it. 35:55 All right, right position. Yeah. So So back to back to work. 36:00 whiskey. You know, there was something else that came out a few weeks ago on on geek calm, talking about the artificial tongue. Do y\'all remember this? So I\'ll talk about it. So the artificial tongue can taste the light. Subtle, subtle, subtle differences. Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on. Okay, I got it. You don\'t have the art. I wonder what the artificial Tom thinks about the five second whiskey? I don\'t know. That\'s a good question. 36:26 I don\'t know if that\'s what it\'s really made for, though. Who knows? Right? I guess we\'ll find out one of these days. But this was built by Scottish engineers and it\'s ultimately made to sit there and try to find counterfeit frauds or anything like that. That\'s on the on the open market. And of course, you know, we talked about it with bourbon, you know, having counterfeit Pappy all the time and stuff like that. However, you\'re going to see this even larger scale in the scotch world as well. So Fred, what are your kind of thoughts on this artificial tongue? Well, I\'ve actually talked to 37:00 Quite a few people about this who are like in a tasers role and I think most everyone knows I do a lot of tasting. And I think it\'s, I think it\'s great if it\'s not like, you know, stealing 37:16 that I\'m curious to see like the data that like goes into it like how they how they create it, because I know of one like, you know algorithm that\'s out there that\'s been taking people\'s tasting notes and applying them to basically putting a collective 37:37 algorithm together of like white to say, from people various like if you\'re, if you\'re writing tasting notes on Reddit, or if you have tasting notes on a blog or anything that\'s scalable, there is now a there\'s some spiders out there that\'s out there taking him and they\'re applying them elsewhere. So, robot tasting, so if it\'s something like that, I\'m not a fan of it, but if it\'s something that really 38:00 actually adds to the, you know, our world. I\'m all for it. But, you know, the thing is, is like Canada, it\'s the right now their marketing is like spotting fakes. And that\'s great. But I wonder what their next iteration will be. Because, you know, 38:23 eventually it\'s going to be about like, you know, this is how you taste. So this is what you\'re going to like. And, you know, I think that\'s cool. Yeah, I think this could definitely lead to a lot of different things. I think. I think finding the counterfeits is a, it\'s kind of like a it\'s I don\'t it\'s like a gateway. Like, it\'s, I don\'t think it\'s going to have a large purpose at first. Like, I think you need to cover a little bit more blanket area here when you\'re trying to figure out exactly what can you do with this technology? It\'s got to be a little bit more uniform, a little more universal of actually how to catch on into the point where, you know, you know, Fred, you taste a lot, however, like, is this something where it\'s like, okay, 39:00 We\'ve got six panelists that are humans and then our seventh is this AI machine, right? To make sure like, everything works like this out of this distillery, like, you know, we\'ve been going for utilizing people for the longest time to you know, knows and tastes and actually understand what this what this is supposed to taste like and what typical batch it goes in, but we\'re human like what is human it\'s, it\'s you have error error is built in versus a computer. Whereas if you\'re feeding a data, like it\'s just computations, so you know, knicker or Brian, like, do you kind of see this like, much more spreading its way out into? Maybe distilleries should start looking into this time of technology as well. So I\'m just waiting for the movie where artificial tongues go rogue, and one of them decides is going to go and replace everybody\'s whiskey with like rapid each whiskey because it\'s got the perfect profile and there\'s just insanity and chaos. You know. 39:59 I\'m visually just look 40:00 is like little tongues across the street like just around like overtaken a rogue tongues. Yeah, rogue tongue, I think there could be great applications for it. You know, they just the question is, is it going to replace, not necessarily master distillers but you know, people that you know blend in in, you know, testing that takes place, you know, within distilleries, and producers, you think about kind of that non scientific nature of so much of this and even just tasting notes, like you\'re talking about, I mean, the very non scientific process in the sense and that\'s one of the kind of magical things about whiskey, you know, would we, you know, if there was inside each label or on each bottle, kind of like a very specific profile of a particular whiskey or almost a map that was scientifically put together, you know, would that be something that, you know, would enhance the experience to people want that, you know, is that the end result of what we\'re even, you know, kind of dealing with here? I think it\'s interesting from that aspect at the same time, I do think one of the 41:00 great things about whiskey is kind of the human and the art of whiskey. So it\'s almost a kind of a weird dichotomy of technology and, and kind of that, you know, our full human interaction that, you know, you don\'t want to see that necessarily overtaken but you do want to, you know, you do want to add you value when you can, you know, there\'s so many whiskies are so expensive, that I could definitely see a, you know, a value proposition for somebody to say, Hey, is this something I might like, you know, for example, or how do we design a better, you know, a better whiskey. I\'m just really I\'m really excited that there\'s been tech applied in 41:38 a valuable way usually, tech people apply it in the most into rapid aging or something that everyone\'s trying to fix that when there\'s really not a problem other than waiting. 41:51 But I\'m just I\'m just glad that somebody in the tech world is applying, applying their know how and skills to a very 42:00 particular area that we do probably could use some consistency. And I agree with Nick and I\'ll take it a step further though i mean i think while it\'s it\'s beneficial in some respects, to have this AI tasting because the AI is not can be thrown off with what you had for lunch or what you had for dinner. It\'s but it\'s on the other hand, it\'s going to be much more sterile of, 42:28 of an experience of a description of what you\'re supposed to be tasting. And so much as Nick said, is so much of drinking whiskey is the experience and it can change if you\'ve got a steak versus something else. And it can change in the mood and I\'ve been doing it presentation Fred did. Music can affect what you\'re what you\'re experiencing, and AI is never going to get to well Famous last words as never going to 42:58 have the experience 43:00 That you can have with whiskey and if I\'ve got a piece of Gouda that I\'m eating with it, AI is not going to be able to tell me again Famous last words how that\'s going to affect what what I\'m experiencing at that moment. So it\'s it\'s nice but it\'s to me it\'s sort of like a party trick and we all know that Jim Beam or somebody would hack it to give like something like a legion like a 95 43:28 so now Brian, I\'m picturing like, VR goggles, some scent thing going on here. 43:34 headphones with your favorite music, you know, you can certainly get right there. tastes and smells right at your at your disposal. Yeah, you see, a few Metallica, Metallica does that they have one of their tasters played various have everybody put on, you know, special headphones. And they have to taste like five different whiskeys. It\'s all their whiskey but they 44:00 People say like the whiskeys taste different based on the music they\'re listening to, and that there\'s news, new evidence that suggests that what you listen to has a much deeper effect on on how you taste. So I am definitely on board with what Brian just said there that the AI will never be able to pick out a more of a human element at least and probably in our lifetime. I think. I mean, I don\'t know, I think I think you\'re right, I don\'t think it\'s gonna have that human element to it. However, I think there\'s there\'s a lot of potential of what this could do in regards of thinking that you want to create more, say a brand that has a very, very specific kind of character. And so you take, you take one outside of a particular barrel, then you get a chemical breakdown of like the 30 different things that are in it. And it\'s like, you know, x percentage of something versus white percentage or another, and then you kind of figure out exactly Okay, I need this kind of percentages, and they all start equal now. 45:00 Alright, dump these barrels together. And now we eat. Now we kind of see this, this sort of specific profile that could be coming. So could be completely different in a way of building new brands versus just sitting there and saying like, okay, we\'ll just go and make sure this is this is this is not Pappy. This is just regular WO Weller. And you know, the thing about checking if something\'s fake or not, most the time when it matters, it\'s sealed, and you want to keep it that way. So that application is a bit of a struggle, you know, because you\'re probably rarely going to find a purchase contingent on you know, opening, pouring, tasting or testing or whatever the case might be. Yeah, how would you like to be the guy who just dropped $1.5 million on a bottle of McKenna gets a test and like, Oh, yeah, now. This is actually Glenfiddich, 12 year old, you almost don\'t want to know. 45:55 Like, no, just keep those things away. 45:59 Yeah, there\'s this 46:00 Definitely a bad side to that to it you know it as we start coming going down this path you know there\'s something news that happened last week. You know, there has been a tear on the secondary market lately like there\'s just groups are disappearing left and right. 46:17 The 2019 Kentucky\'s edge bourbon conference and festival pairs all things Kentucky with bourbon. It takes place October 4 and fifth at venues throughout Covington in Newport Kentucky. Kentucky\'s edge features of bourbon conference music tastings pairings tourists and and artists and market Kentucky\'s edge. 2019 is where bourbon begins. Tickets and information can be found online at Kentucky\'s edge.com. If you\'re making plans to visit the bourbon trail, the one thing you\'re thinking about is how do I get around to all these distilleries? We recently use Central Kentucky tours for a barrel pick and the hospitality and information was top notch tech. Even Ryan learned a few new things about Bardstown Central Kentucky tours offers public 47:00 Private tours for groups from two to 55 with pickups in Harrisburg, Lexington Volvo and everywhere in between. So book your time within the day at Central Kentucky tours.com. You\'ve probably heard of finishing beer using whiskey barrels but a Michigan distillery is doing the opposite. They\'re using beer barrels to finish their whiskey. New Holland spirits claims to be the first distillery to stout a whiskey. The folks at Rock house whiskey club heard that claim and had to visit the banks of Lake Michigan to check it out. It all began when New Holland brewing launched in 97. Their Dragon\'s milk beer is America\'s number one selling bourbon barrel aged out in 2005. They apply their expertise from brewing and began distilling beer barrel finished whiskey began production 2012 and rock house was the club is featuring it in their next box. The barrels come from Tennessee get filled with Dragon\'s milk we are twice the mature bourbon is finished and those very same barrels. Rocco\'s whiskey club is a whiskey the Month Club on a mission to uncover the best flavors and stories from craft distillers across the US. 48:00 Along with two bottles of hard to find whiskey rackhouses boxes are full of cool merchandise that they ship out every two months to members in over 40 states. Go to rackhouse whiskey club com to check it out and try a bottle of beer barrel bourbon and beer barrel rye. Use code pursuit for $25 off your first box. 48:20 There has been a tear on the secondary market lately like there\'s just groups are disappearing left and right. And even the secondary backup BSM group that was over on me we may way whatever it is, is that\'s now gone as well. So it\'s not like it\'s just Facebook, it looks like this is like a virus that\'s continually trying to spread and it\'s just getting knocked out sort of wherever it goes. Now don\'t get me wrong, there\'s still a few groups that are remaining You know, they\'re probably around like the two to 3000 member Mark but there\'s nowhere near even on the bsm on me was like almost 10,000 or above. So it seems that we\'re everybody flocks to 49:00 These are just getting can left and right. 49:03 Now I\'ve tried to reach out haven\'t really heard anything of in regards of why it happened or anything like that. However, it just seems there\'s there\'s no safe haven right now. Do you all kind of see this as is this can be the new norm? Or is it just like, it\'s just hot for the moment? We\'ll have to wait ride this wave, and then maybe here in another three months, will we back up to where it was, is going to happen. It\'s just a matter of what in when. And it might change over time. You know, as we\'re seeing right now, it\'s certainly changing how the communication is done. Probably the bigger question is if we have these call it a period of a drought, for example, which is interesting, because this is happening, you know, before we start seeing some of the big fall releases and things of that nature, you\'ve got to ask yourself is is that going to change the the primary market, you know, because how much of the primary market is driven by what ends up happening on the secondary market? You know, so a lot of people buying you know, basically 50:00 The idea that they\'re going to be able to turn around and sell for a profit, if that is no longer in place or that you know, you knock out 50% or some in reasonable percentage of the, you know, people that are able to do that or see their ability to do that. Does that start driving prices down on the primary? I think it\'ll be interesting to see how that you know, kind of goes over the the upcoming months here. Yeah, I think we\'re going to see this in Natalie. That is, I think Brad Atlas had a post that was on Blake\'s group, this past week of, you know, the the new each Taylor amaranth has been album release. However, nobody can figure out what a price should be on it because there\'s no room there is no place to auction off and figure out what\'s going to be even today. There were I think, like 72 birthday Bourbons that were sold at old forester distillery downtown to kind of commemorate the old forester birthday bourbon and George bourbon Browns birthday. However, I haven\'t seen a whole heck of a lot of them show up on anywhere. So you know, this 51:00 Is this could be a sign of the times that, you know, hopefully you\'re buying it to hold on to it because finding the outlets to sell it is getting a lot harder now. It\'s definitely interesting. 51:12 I, you know, I, I\'m beta testing an app right now and I\'ve been asked if, like, people can do that and I\'m like, Well, you know, I have that I have to, like, seriously look at that now. And I\'m thinking of like the potential liability associated with it. I\'m like, 51:29 you know, maybe you don\'t know maybe in your chat your own little private chat group, which I can\'t see but 51:37 it\'s, it\'s fascinating to me. How this this domino effect and I would love I would love to sit down with Mark Zuckerberg interview request I put out many times by the way, never that I have a probably, but I would love to find out if like he\'s had a hand in or some on Facebook, haven\'t you know, I would love to hear the rationale behind it. But I know they 52:00 said some things but there\'s more to it, there\'s gotta be more to it. It just doesn\'t. just doesn\'t make sense to me, especially with this new, this, this new social media site dumping it so quickly. It just, it\'s odd. Just, it\'s gonna be coming down from somewhere else. I mean, fame makes you wonder if brands are involved. Sorry, brands, you know, if we\'ve got brands or somebody specific, you know, with intent, you know, and is watching this more closely, and specifically, I think that\'s a great question. And they have been watching these markets for for some time because they would even like, you know, price their whiskey to, to combat it, but I would, I would argue that it may not be a brand behind it, but a very powerful retailer. You know, who wants that money 52:58 and knows that that money 53:00 He\'s out there they want they want your dollar. They don\'t want you to buy it, you know, SRP and then flip it. I mean, there\'s any number of areas this could go, there\'s any number of people who would like to see it stop. 53:13 But I do know this. I, I know that most of the like the state authorities don\'t really care. You know, I mean, I\'ve talked to him about it, and they\'re really care, you know, but like Texas does, Texas cares, Pennsylvania. All the control states actually. But 53:33 you know, this is doesn\'t seem to be like, any kind of state leading it. 53:39 Yeah, I mean, I don\'t know. The control states, they don\'t want competition. And Sylvania doesn\'t want to know, what cracks me up about Pennsylvanians. Every year they send out a press release, and oh, we lost like three or four of them this year, or one was broken in and transport. And I\'m like, wow, I bet it suddenly got lost on the 54:00 The state majority leaders front still front step and you know the bottle accidentally broke after it was consumed by the directors house in our at the directors house and me is just it\'s all kinds of silly with with Pennsylvania 54:15 well let\'s control states in general but you know I think when we when we look at just the secondary market you know we\'ve talked about it in regards of like how this built a culture This is probably how bourbon has a mass to how big it is because most people wouldn\'t even know about a lot of brands if they didn\'t see them on the secondary markets begin with I mean it\'s we all have our stories so I think it\'d be it\'d be interesting to kind of see where this is going to go you know me when I look at it I think this was this is a critical and crucial part of really what made bourbon what it is today. And you know, there\'s going to have to be somewhere where people can basically value this as sort of currency maybe it\'s trading You know, I\'m, I don\'t like to sit there and say like, yeah, go get a birthday bar, birthday bourbon, 450 bucks and go try to sell for 300 like 55:00 I\'m not all about that However, it\'s like, if you get a birthday bourbon 450 yet, you can\'t get a George t stag this year. And that\'s just part of the trade. And that\'s great, right? That\'s, that\'s something that you are able to get your hands on, you can kind of trade your way there, you know, and start with a paperclip unit with a plane. But that\'s that\'s essentially like where I like to be able to see this because it\'s all about getting the, you know, the bourbon that you want in your hands and kind of how to get it. But yeah, I mean, I think you\'re right, but for to the point of like this, this help kind of like spread the enthusiasm. 55:33 I know like the people in the groups, if you if you put it on scale, you\'re looking at maybe at most like 2 million or something, at least the various groups that I knew of, and that\'s not a lot in the grand scheme of things. Those people who are like everybody\'s influencer in their families in their workplace, and they would be the people out there talking about bourbon so and it was the these groups kind of became community 56:00 Bs and I was, you know, I, I love them. You know, I love them because we\'re actually I love them five years ago, you know, they they changed quite a bit in the last couple years, but they were very, very engaging. You can talk history, you can talk about who distilled water like, I mean, I remember having a conversation with someone educating them about Woodrow Wilson, which if you don\'t know, he was a master distiller, it\'s it\'s a well or for a very short period. But you know, he made some good whiskey. And so I guess a, you know, as we start thinking of other ways of how is the bourbon market being hindered, you know, there\'s been finally some data that\'s now coming out about the US whiskey exports and the tariffs that are now happening over in the EU. So when we start looking at this, you know, I look at some of the data here and I\'ll again, I\'ll drop the link in the chat for folks that want to be able to see this. You can see all these links in our show notes as well. 57:00 But the distilled spirits council came and said that there was a 21% decrease from June 2018 to June to 2019. That was all lost sales after shipments to Europe plummeted. So we\'ve got the data coming in. 57:19 You know, I know Fred, you\'re you\'re kind of close to this. Is there a way that things could eventually bounce back to help bourbon brains grow? And I will always say it again that if somebody says, Oh, yeah, this is great, because it means more bourbon on the shelves for me. You\'re in the wrong here. Okay. Think bigger. Well, there have been some really nice trade related things that have happened like in a couple weeks, I was invited to to meet the European Union ambassador to the United States. And they\'re celebrating scotch Irish and bourbon whiskey, the you know, the unique designations of them and like all the all the country 58:00 kind of coming together in Washington DC to celebrate this. And so, from an industry perspective, you know, they have the ears of their legislators, their ambassadors, their Parliament or whatever. 58:14 You know, Brexit also, you know, through a wrinkle into it. So in an odd way Brexit could be 58:23 you know, it could be good for for the tariffs, 58:27 you know, for that particular portion. But, yeah, so those are a couple of the good things but in in all seriousness, you know, they\'re not letting up you know, Europe is still very hell bent on applying pressure. And you know, there\'s been reports that they want to apply more pressure you know, in in in mitch mcconnell areas so I just, I just don\'t see this you know, being good and it\'s in it\'s shut out small brands like the topping Creek completely. And Kenny, I know you\'re a brand owner. 59:01 You know, you want to, let\'s say you want to open them. You have a small shop in Poland, who absolutely loves to show loves you wants to make you his number one whiskey in his store, you won\'t find a distributor in that entire country that\'ll take your call. You know, it\'s just because of tariffs, they don\'t want to pass that on it. They\'re just not taking calls from small American lyst companies. So 59:25 yeah, and I think this is this is, as I mentioned before, I mean, this is so much bigger than just what you can get here in the shelves like this is this is trying to grow the category as a whole to start taking on scotch as as, you know, the whiskey in the market. And we can\'t get to that level scotch unless you have a fair playing field, you know, across the board to be able to say like, okay, like, let\'s get this in the hands of people in Australia and Zimbabwe and China and, you know, in the EU as well, like, how can we grow this as a whole. And this is really where the tariffs are going to start really being that that first sort of 1:00:00 Hand slap, I guess you could say is, if you\'re trying to reach a new market, you know, all of a sudden, if you have a, if you got a 30 or $40 bottle here in the States, I mean, you\'re, you\'re looking at doubling that, if not coming close to triple as you start getting, you know, already just distribution overseas, but now the tariffs are adding a lot more to it. And if you can\'t compete with a, you know, 50 $60 bottle of scotch, then you\'re, you know, you\'re already setting yourself up for failure. And so, you know, as we start kind of rounding this out, you know, Nick and, Brian, I kind of want to get your sort of thoughts on this, if you have any sort of inkling of what do you kind of see next? Maybe, if it\'s an election year, is there anything that could change? You know, after that as well, Nick, you go ahead and go first. I was gonna I was gonna say the same. 1:00:53 You know, I, it\'s, I think it\'s tough to say what\'s going to happen going forward. I\'d be really curious. 1:01:00 To see, you know, what small brands are seeing the impact of this right now? 1:01:06 Immediately, 1:01:09 you know, like anything, I think there\'s the initial shock of it, but then, you know, demand is demand. So if that means to 20% increase in price or whatever the case might be, if the demand is there 1:01:21 over time might cause that to, you know, to become a non issue. But, but it\'s a barrier of entry as a starting point. So when you think about bourbon growing on a global scale, and the potential it has on a global scale, you know, certainly that\'s a pretty 1:01:40 pretty immediate, you know, block of have taken that first step for a lot of you know, a lot of these brands on that larger scale. You know, what if you see this go on for a period of time, then suddenly it goes away, you know, do you have the opposite impact you have suddenly a flood of, you know, a flood of opportunity, a flood 1:02:00 brands that are saying, Okay, now this opportunity just opened up, we\'re going to put pressure on actually doing this. Because if you think about all the brands that are out there, especially the small ones, how many of them are actually taking those steps right now to get overseas? I\'d be curious out of this 1000 or 1200 distilleries. You know, in the US, for example, how many you\'re saying, Let\'s get on the shelves in Europe, or let\'s get on the shelves in Australia or Japan or whatever the case might be? China, what\'s the market like over there? But it will be interesting to see how it plays out, you know, like anything, it\'s it\'s a global economy, we\'re going to see the push and pull. And I think ultimately, the long term play for bourbon for us whiskey is to be probably bigger than scotch, quite frankly, I personally think is better, you know, so there\'s no really no reason why it can\'t be bigger or at least just as big it\'s just a matter of time and what you know, things are going to have to move and shift around and what dominoes are going to have to fall in when 1:03:00 can\'t allow that to, you know, to really gain some momentum and happen. Bourbons got a long way before it catches scotch. And I\'ll tell you like, this is why this is why the tariffs are so frustrating to me is that, you know, bourbon became a unique product to the United States largely in part because they were trying to get special designation so they would not get tariffs after world to the country, the rest of the world basically tariff bourbon and open the open the markets for scotch to help the United Kingdom recover from World War Two because, you know, they were bombed and everything, they took a much greater hit on the physical real estate of their country. And, and so they were places like Argentina, you know, was terrifying us like 200% United Kingdom actually had like limits of bourbon that they would allow in the country for a given year. And when they would actually when the bourbon distillers would push to like, you know, have exports. You know, the French basically came back and said, 1:04:00 Why would we give you any kind of anything carefree when bourbon doesn\'t mean anything to us? Like you have no special designation, of course the French, you know being the home of cognac and Champagne has a very unique understanding of like designation for alcohol. And and so in 1958, they started the bourbon industry started banding together and working to make bourbon, a unique product in the United States. And after that in 1964, they then had the ability to negotiate and free trade agreements to peel away tariffs. And this they have been doing that since the 1960s. And they\'ve only just now gotten to the point where they\'re where their exports are over a billion dollars. So that\'s why this is like so painful for the industry is like bourbon has never been in these countries. I mean, you go to places like Portugal, and Spain you see to you know, 10 years ago, you\'d see to 1:05:00 bottles. Now, you know, you still see only two bottles and most bars but now you\'ll have some bars that will have 10 2030 so and that\'s because the reduced tariffs are no tariffs have opened up the markets and now with the tariffs coming back in, those markets are going to go away. And that\'s why it\'s so fucking frustrating. Fred, what immediate impact if you were to kind of try to quantify the impact of the tariffs as a worst case? What immediate impact do you think that could have? Look at the next say, two years, three years, for example? Well, you definitely saw some smaller brands that were, you know, gambling on opening up markets in Europe, you saw a lot of that now that\'s taken away and now they\'re being forced to like, you know, market themselves here. And as you know, Americans have a very different taste of what whiskey is in the European. So I would say like a small craft distiller could probably fool someone in Poland, that there are three year olds. 1:06:01 is actually good. You know, here, you know you\'re not going to be able to fool someone who\'s used to, you know, Kentucky bourbon. So you basically take off like, basically change someone\'s business plan. The other one. I think brown Forman is in a super risk position. They\'ve already came out said they\'re losing like 128 million 1:06:22 a year based on jack daniels exports alone. So I think they are very vulnerable. 1:06:31 And, you know, they could they could see some major, you know, reductions are some shifts in like, what they how they do things, but jack daniels is a very strong brand. And you know, they should be they should be fine. One positive note porno coming into American whiskey much stronger. That\'s another European country. It\'s another European allied to negotiate on behalf of American whiskey. And let me piggyback on that. I mean, 1:07:00 When you by no means well traveled, but when I go there, there\'s there\'s, you know that two three brands that you always say there\'s there\'s bullet and every bar there\'s Maker\'s Mark, and there\'s jack daniels. And beyond that you\'ve got to go to a specialty shop. There is one in Bath independent spirits that if anyone goes anywhere near there, you\'ve got to go. 1:07:28 But it\'s it\'s all these big brands so the small brands can\'t meet the demand that they have here. So I think it is an issue for brown Forman with jack daniels and it is an issue for the ALGEO bringing bullet over over to Europe. But they\'re all still making more bourbon than they\'ve ever made and Diaz to starting a whole nother damn new distillery. 1:07:55 I don\'t know the answer to this and that\'s why I was trying to defer to Nick but 1:08:00 Seeing the big distilleries continue to turn out bourbon at at a record pace tells me they have faith that this is just a blip and it\'ll get resolved and will be able to open the European more they\'ll get into India, they\'ll continue to change. 1:08:22 And if they don\'t, we\'ve got the same issue we had in the 60s and we\'ll all be drinking 20 year old bourbon on the cheap. 1:08:33 There\'s, there\'s a there\'s a big thing that\'s different. Now you have tourism for years, you know, bourbon has been up and down, up and down. It\'s basically just all based off of what you\'re drinking. Well, now you have tourism, tourism component. So these brands are trying to create a lot of lifestyle. And from a liquid perspective, we\'re still not back to where we were in the 70s from a production standpoint, so a lot of the money that they are spending is actually not on the liquid. It is on the lifestyle and tourism now 1:09:00 And that\'s fun and sexy. But that\'s not getting bottles on the shelf. 1:09:06 That\'s a good way to close it out. You know, as we started talking about, you know, the very beginning this we kind of talked about the growth, the hype, and now we\'re talking about like, we must save bourbon because we have to make sure that these tariffs don\'t really affect it. And, you know, I think I think it\'d be it\'d be pretty good if we could get on the inside walls if there\'s like a meeting amongst like the top eight bourbon companies and they all try to predict and forecasts and say like, Well, why are you building a 50,000 barrel warehouse? And we\'re not starting yet. Like, what do you see that we\'re not seeing? So it\'d be cool to kind of understand exactly, if we could get somebody to show that is a, I guess, a bourbon economist, kind of can forecast out really what the next 10 years look like? Well, we\'ll put that on the the to do list for us. So, you know, with that, as we start kind of rounding this out, I want to say Gentlemen, thank you again for coming on the show. And thank you, everybody to that was sitting here watching it live. I think we are concurrent watchers, some around like 75 at some point, so 63 so that was awesome. 1:10:00 Thank you so much for everybody that was on here. So we least had over 100 that joined us. But as we kind of start rounding this out, you know, Nick, Brian, go ahead and kind of, say your goodbyes, if you will. Sure. Thanks, Kenny. Thanks guys.

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E.

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light.

I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women.

I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination? Some comics/graphic novels/graphic memoirs I've enjoyed recently: Relish by Lucy Knisely, Moonstruck by Grace Ellis et. al., Sweater Weather by Sara Varon, and Lumberjanes\xa0Thank you!!-Jess5.\xa0I've been in a serious reading slump and I just need something super fast paced to get me out of it. I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve read Deep Sea and Foreign going about commercial shipping and Flower Confidential about the cut flower industry recently. I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already).

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E.

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women.

Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both.

I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve read Deep Sea and Foreign going about commercial shipping and Flower Confidential about the cut flower industry recently. I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already).

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente. Bonus points for Black American writers, but any non-white funny fantasy/sci fi author rec I’m into it!-WeatherlyBOOKS DISCUSSEDMilkman\xa0by Anna BurnsThe Psychology of Time Travel\xa0by Kate Mascarenhas (tw: disordered eating, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hazing)Sabriel\xa0by Garth NixHexed Vol. 1\xa0by Michael Alan Nelson, Emma Rios, Dan MoraRules of Civility\xa0by Amor TowlesThe Group\xa0by Mary McCarthy (tw: domestic violence, possibly others)The Electric Woman\xa0by Tessa FontaineWishful Drinking\xa0by Carrie FisherSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\xa0by Cal NewportSubversive Cross-Stitch\xa0by Julie Jackson, photographs by Bill MilneLand of Love and Drowning\xa0by Tiphanie Yanique (tw child abuse, incest)Signal to Noise\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen ChoChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesThe Prey of Gods\xa0by Nicky Drayden (tw: sexual assault, child abuse) | Amanda and Jenn discuss fascinating nonfiction, plane reads, pioneer adventures, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by our\xa0Mystery/Thriller Giveaway,\xa0Recommended, and\xa0Forged Through Fire\xa0by Mark McDonough.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKThe Alpennia series\xa0by Heather Rose Jones (rec’d by Jen)Outline Your Novel,\xa0Structuring Your Novel, and\xa0Creating Character Arcs\xa0by K.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose.

Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi.

My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz.

As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic.

Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment). Any suggestions you have would be much appreciated!

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi.

My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help?

I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination? Some comics/graphic novels/graphic memoirs I've enjoyed recently: Relish by Lucy Knisely, Moonstruck by Grace Ellis et. al., Sweater Weather by Sara Varon, and Lumberjanes\xa0Thank you!!-Jess5.\xa0I've been in a serious reading slump and I just need something super fast paced to get me out of it. I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente. Bonus points for Black American writers, but any non-white funny fantasy/sci fi author rec I’m into it!-WeatherlyBOOKS DISCUSSEDMilkman\xa0by Anna BurnsThe Psychology of Time Travel\xa0by Kate Mascarenhas (tw: disordered eating, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hazing)Sabriel\xa0by Garth NixHexed Vol. 1\xa0by Michael Alan Nelson, Emma Rios, Dan MoraRules of Civility\xa0by Amor TowlesThe Group\xa0by Mary McCarthy (tw: domestic violence, possibly others)The Electric Woman\xa0by Tessa FontaineWishful Drinking\xa0by Carrie FisherSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\xa0by Cal NewportSubversive Cross-Stitch\xa0by Julie Jackson, photographs by Bill MilneLand of Love and Drowning\xa0by Tiphanie Yanique (tw child abuse, incest)Signal to Noise\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen ChoChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesThe Prey of Gods\xa0by Nicky Drayden (tw: sexual assault, child abuse) | Amanda and Jenn discuss fascinating nonfiction, plane reads, pioneer adventures, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by our\xa0Mystery/Thriller Giveaway,\xa0Recommended, and\xa0Forged Through Fire\xa0by Mark McDonough.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKThe Alpennia series\xa0by Heather Rose Jones (rec’d by Jen)Outline Your Novel,\xa0Structuring Your Novel, and\xa0Creating Character Arcs\xa0by K.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E.

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel.

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already).

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente. Bonus points for Black American writers, but any non-white funny fantasy/sci fi author rec I’m into it!-WeatherlyBOOKS DISCUSSEDMilkman\xa0by Anna BurnsThe Psychology of Time Travel\xa0by Kate Mascarenhas (tw: disordered eating, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hazing)Sabriel\xa0by Garth NixHexed Vol. 1\xa0by Michael Alan Nelson, Emma Rios, Dan MoraRules of Civility\xa0by Amor TowlesThe Group\xa0by Mary McCarthy (tw: domestic violence, possibly others)The Electric Woman\xa0by Tessa FontaineWishful Drinking\xa0by Carrie FisherSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\xa0by Cal NewportSubversive Cross-Stitch\xa0by Julie Jackson, photographs by Bill MilneLand of Love and Drowning\xa0by Tiphanie Yanique (tw child abuse, incest)Signal to Noise\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen ChoChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesThe Prey of Gods\xa0by Nicky Drayden (tw: sexual assault, child abuse) | Amanda and Jenn discuss fascinating nonfiction, plane reads, pioneer adventures, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by our\xa0Mystery/Thriller Giveaway,\xa0Recommended, and\xa0Forged Through Fire\xa0by Mark McDonough.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKThe Alpennia series\xa0by Heather Rose Jones (rec’d by Jen)Outline Your Novel,\xa0Structuring Your Novel, and\xa0Creating Character Arcs\xa0by K.

I’m a huge fan of learning new random facts (whether it be in books, movies, or something I read online) and being able to add information to a conversation that someone wouldn’t normally know anything about.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime!

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains.

For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both.

And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination? Some comics/graphic novels/graphic memoirs I've enjoyed recently: Relish by Lucy Knisely, Moonstruck by Grace Ellis et. al., Sweater Weather by Sara Varon, and Lumberjanes\xa0Thank you!!-Jess5.\xa0I've been in a serious reading slump and I just need something super fast paced to get me out of it. I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve read Deep Sea and Foreign going about commercial shipping and Flower Confidential about the cut flower industry recently. I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already).

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both.

Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente. Bonus points for Black American writers, but any non-white funny fantasy/sci fi author rec I’m into it!-WeatherlyBOOKS DISCUSSEDMilkman\xa0by Anna BurnsThe Psychology of Time Travel\xa0by Kate Mascarenhas (tw: disordered eating, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hazing)Sabriel\xa0by Garth NixHexed Vol. 1\xa0by Michael Alan Nelson, Emma Rios, Dan MoraRules of Civility\xa0by Amor TowlesThe Group\xa0by Mary McCarthy (tw: domestic violence, possibly others)The Electric Woman\xa0by Tessa FontaineWishful Drinking\xa0by Carrie FisherSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\xa0by Cal NewportSubversive Cross-Stitch\xa0by Julie Jackson, photographs by Bill MilneLand of Love and Drowning\xa0by Tiphanie Yanique (tw child abuse, incest)Signal to Noise\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen ChoChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesThe Prey of Gods\xa0by Nicky Drayden (tw: sexual assault, child abuse) | Amanda and Jenn discuss fascinating nonfiction, plane reads, pioneer adventures, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by our\xa0Mystery/Thriller Giveaway,\xa0Recommended, and\xa0Forged Through Fire\xa0by Mark McDonough.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKThe Alpennia series\xa0by Heather Rose Jones (rec’d by Jen)Outline Your Novel,\xa0Structuring Your Novel, and\xa0Creating Character Arcs\xa0by K.

I’m a huge fan of learning new random facts (whether it be in books, movies, or something I read online) and being able to add information to a conversation that someone wouldn’t normally know anything about. I’ve always wanted to be the person in the room that can tell you something about anything! Is there a book that either of you would say that gave you the BIGGEST case of the did you knows?

I love the show 🙂-Hayley2.\xa0I work at a local book store and one of our frequent customers, a 21-year-old female college student, came in wanting a recommendation for a realistic fiction with incidental romance and a decently interesting plot. Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment). Any suggestions you have would be much appreciated!

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose.

I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter.

Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now!

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series.

My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment). Any suggestions you have would be much appreciated!

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series.

My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help?

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present.

I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel.

Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel.

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already).

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente. Bonus points for Black American writers, but any non-white funny fantasy/sci fi author rec I’m into it!-WeatherlyBOOKS DISCUSSEDMilkman\xa0by Anna BurnsThe Psychology of Time Travel\xa0by Kate Mascarenhas (tw: disordered eating, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hazing)Sabriel\xa0by Garth NixHexed Vol. 1\xa0by Michael Alan Nelson, Emma Rios, Dan MoraRules of Civility\xa0by Amor TowlesThe Group\xa0by Mary McCarthy (tw: domestic violence, possibly others)The Electric Woman\xa0by Tessa FontaineWishful Drinking\xa0by Carrie FisherSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\xa0by Cal NewportSubversive Cross-Stitch\xa0by Julie Jackson, photographs by Bill MilneLand of Love and Drowning\xa0by Tiphanie Yanique (tw child abuse, incest)Signal to Noise\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen ChoChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesThe Prey of Gods\xa0by Nicky Drayden (tw: sexual assault, child abuse) | Amanda and Jenn discuss fascinating nonfiction, plane reads, pioneer adventures, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by our\xa0Mystery/Thriller Giveaway,\xa0Recommended, and\xa0Forged Through Fire\xa0by Mark McDonough.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKThe Alpennia series\xa0by Heather Rose Jones (rec’d by Jen)Outline Your Novel,\xa0Structuring Your Novel, and\xa0Creating Character Arcs\xa0by K.

I’m a huge fan of learning new random facts (whether it be in books, movies, or something I read online) and being able to add information to a conversation that someone wouldn’t normally know anything about.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime!

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains.

For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both.

And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination? Some comics/graphic novels/graphic memoirs I've enjoyed recently: Relish by Lucy Knisely, Moonstruck by Grace Ellis et. al., Sweater Weather by Sara Varon, and Lumberjanes\xa0Thank you!!-Jess5.\xa0I've been in a serious reading slump and I just need something super fast paced to get me out of it. I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve read Deep Sea and Foreign going about commercial shipping and Flower Confidential about the cut flower industry recently. I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already).

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both.

Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente. Bonus points for Black American writers, but any non-white funny fantasy/sci fi author rec I’m into it!-WeatherlyBOOKS DISCUSSEDMilkman\xa0by Anna BurnsThe Psychology of Time Travel\xa0by Kate Mascarenhas (tw: disordered eating, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hazing)Sabriel\xa0by Garth NixHexed Vol. 1\xa0by Michael Alan Nelson, Emma Rios, Dan MoraRules of Civility\xa0by Amor TowlesThe Group\xa0by Mary McCarthy (tw: domestic violence, possibly others)The Electric Woman\xa0by Tessa FontaineWishful Drinking\xa0by Carrie FisherSo Good They Can’t Ignore You\xa0by Cal NewportSubversive Cross-Stitch\xa0by Julie Jackson, photographs by Bill MilneLand of Love and Drowning\xa0by Tiphanie Yanique (tw child abuse, incest)Signal to Noise\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen ChoChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesThe Prey of Gods\xa0by Nicky Drayden (tw: sexual assault, child abuse) | Amanda and Jenn discuss fascinating nonfiction, plane reads, pioneer adventures, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by our\xa0Mystery/Thriller Giveaway,\xa0Recommended, and\xa0Forged Through Fire\xa0by Mark McDonough.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKThe Alpennia series\xa0by Heather Rose Jones (rec’d by Jen)Outline Your Novel,\xa0Structuring Your Novel, and\xa0Creating Character Arcs\xa0by K.

I’m a huge fan of learning new random facts (whether it be in books, movies, or something I read online) and being able to add information to a conversation that someone wouldn’t normally know anything about. I’ve always wanted to be the person in the room that can tell you something about anything! Is there a book that either of you would say that gave you the BIGGEST case of the did you knows?

I love the show 🙂-Hayley2.\xa0I work at a local book store and one of our frequent customers, a 21-year-old female college student, came in wanting a recommendation for a realistic fiction with incidental romance and a decently interesting plot. Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment). Any suggestions you have would be much appreciated!

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose.

I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter.

Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help.

My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now!

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series.

My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment). Any suggestions you have would be much appreciated!

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series.

My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help?

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present.

I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi. I took your book rec for The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet and absolutely loved it (bought the second and third books already). I’d love more recommendations that follow along the same lines, specifically the space setting and character development.Thanks,-LizzyBOOKS DISCUSSEDRing\xa0by Koji Suzuki, transl by Robert B.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book. I have read “Little and Lion” “Juliet takes a breath” and “when dimple met rishi”Love the show!

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel. Thanks so much and I look forward to your suggestions!– E. W.2.\xa0Hello, ladies!I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a lesbian regency romance?I have read a few with male romance, and a ton with hetero romance, and I love these but haven’t heard of any featuring a lesbian romance…I have read Sarah Waters and some other lesbian romance set in Victorian or early 20th century, but really hoping for a regency romp in the vein of Tessa Dare or Sarah MacLean, or Courtney Milan.Thank you both!-Sarah3.\xa0Hey there!I wanted to get into more books about true crime! It creeps me out but I like reading about it, it’s like watching shows about it, I can’t get enough! Could you guys recommend me some true crime books that’ll really be sending chills down my spine?-Tamika4.\xa0Hey bookish people!My fiancé and I are taking a little bit of an unconventional honeymoon in October to Vancouver, Canada. I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot.

It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7. Hi ladies!I recently started listening and stumbled upon your episode about Fifth Element-ish sci-fi.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel.

Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination?

I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Hello!I am looking for a book that gives me the same feeling as The Black Tapes Podcast. Basically, a journalist gets pulled into a dark story dealing with demons that may have turned their attention to her. I read Paul Tremblay’s A Head Full of Ghosts and that was close. Really anything paranormal that’s got a reality spin could work!-Lora2.Hello Ladies! Thank you for the show!As the fall approaches I find myself wanting to wrap up in a blanket and read something spooky. I don’t read much horror and am not even 100% sure that’s the right descriptor for what I mean. I want something to creep me out, but that doesn’t rely on body horror and excessive gore to do it.Books I’ve enjoyed in the past with this general feeling include We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the Fireman, Frankenstein, One Bloody Thing After Another, The Hellbound Heart.I did not like Bird Box or Final Girls and generally haven’t enjoyed Stephen King’s work. I don’t generally like to read true crime & I don’t think I’m looking for something that falls in the thriller category.Please no books that contain sexual assault.Thanks!-April3.Hi! I am traveling to Prague on October 11th while I’m visiting my motherland, Poland, and I was wondering if you knew any books that are set in Prague where the city is very present. I know Lani Taylor has a trilogy set there so I would love to hear any other suggestions. Preferably adult but if the YA is great with no romance as a main plot, that would be good too. Thank you so much!-Fabiola4. Okay, I’ve got a tough one for ya. I’ve been searching for books that have a certain atmosphere and tone. Think Rebecca or In a Lonely Place. I love dark midcentury writing and also grim gothic atmospheres. I’ve read much of Hughes’ and Highsmith’s backlists not to mention those of other authors I discovered reading the Women Crime Writers of the 1940s/50s anthologies (which I loved). I’m looking for something a little different than traditional hard boiled noir. I’m more of a psychological suspense fan. I guess I’m just in love with the quaint old time-y writing of the 40s, 50s and 60s and looking for new discoveries. Bonus points if the novel is set on dark windy coastal shores.Thank you in advance and for all the great recommendations I’ve gotten from you all in the past!-Lisa5. Amanda and Jenn,I have been listening to the show since 2018 when I was off-work due to a work-related injury, and I listened to the entire backlist in a few months. I went on to devour All the Books, SFF Yeah!, Read or Dead, Hey YA, and their respective backlists- needless to say, I am a fan. My TBR thanks you both (as well your colleagues)!QUESTION: I am treating myself to a birthday request. After wracking my brain for what I finally wanted to ask, I decided I am looking for a traditional slasher in an isolated location; think along the lines of the “Scream” movies, and the show “Harper’s Island”. I recently read “Ten” by Gretchen McNeil, and that really scratched the itch. Anything you could suggest would be very much appreciated!BONUS: My favourite month for themed reading is October, I love all the autumn feels of doing Halloween/creepy/scary reading. Already on the list are “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier (with my book club), “Sawkill Girls” by Claire Legrande, “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman, “The Murders of Molly Southborne” by Tade Thompson. As well as potentially “Hex” by Thomas Heuvelt, and “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Any favourites you might have for some October reading would be great, as my October reading may or may not trail into November!I wanted to share my Goodreads, but alas, it is not up-to-date. I know my question was really specific, but just for clarity, I read across all genres, but I do not particularly love historical fiction. I am also working two jobs, and recently started my Masters degree, so I don’t have a ton of time for huge tomes.Thank-you so much for the work you do, and taking my TBR and love of reading to the next level! 🙂Sincerely,-Kachina Wicks6. I just found out I’m pregnant with my first child, and even though I wanted and tried for this, I find myself terrified. I’m worrying about all the things—my risk of miscarriage, being pregnant, childbirth, parenting— I’m just a ball of anxiety. I have just about every pregnancy book ever written, but do you have any memoirs, Mary Roach-esque nonfiction about the science of pregnancy, or happy fiction about pregnancy/parenting an infant?-Kaitlyn7.

Greetings, and thanks in advance for expanding my already out of control TBR list! A friend and I just booked a two-week trip to South Korea for early November (leaving 11/3), and I want to do as much research as possible before I go, because I am SUCH a Hermione. I’m looking for books, fiction or non-fiction, that will provide me with context about the culture, history, food, traditions, and/or landscape of South Korea. I already have Wicked Fox and Pachinko on my list. What else can you recommend that will help me learn as much as I can? I’ve never been anywhere in Asia, and I’m so excited to go.My wheelhouse is pretty broad–I’m a fan of contemporary fiction, sweeping generational sagas, YA, and sci-fi/fantasy (though I’m not so much into high fantasy). For non-fiction I especially love reading memoirs, especially by women and comedians (Bossypants and “Are you Hanging out without Me?” being two of my favorites) and collections of essays.Thanks so much–I love the podcast and I can’t wait to hear your recommendations.-Julia2.\xa0Hi Amanda and Jenn!Over the summer I’ve gotten into a reading kick of books with a certain madcap flair – like everything is bonkers but we’re going with it plotlines.I think Amanda’s recommendation of The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall is what set me off so I wanted to ask for more please!Other books I’ve read in this vein would be: The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger, Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, The Hitchhiker’s Guide by Douglas Adams – and I’m noticing a British theme here, which is fine to continue or buck!Thanks in advance.-Kelly3.\xa0Every year for Hanukkah, I send my friend 8 e-books from Thanksgiving until the last day of the holiday. When Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins came out, we both absolutely loved it and read the rest of the books in the series. At the time, we also liked some of the books by Rainbow Rowell. I’ve had trouble finding another whimsical, fun, romantic, but well written series that has the same energy as the Perkins’ books. Any suggestions? Thank you!-Malory4.\xa0I am looking for a book for my mom. She really likes fiction about all kinds of sports in which characters overcome hardships and stereotypes. Which is why she loved the Dairy Queen Trilogy by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. She has now read all three books several times and can’t seem to find anything else quite like it. Can you think of anything along these lines? Thank you!All the best!-Leah5.\xa0I’m a long time listener to the podcast and have got many many recommendations from you both over the years, but I’ve only now come up with my very own personalised request… I’ve recently realised that I read police (and private detective) procedurals as a kind of comfort read/palate cleanser/go to for when I can’t think of anything else to read, or just can’t get into any other books.I’ve read loads of Sarah Paretsky, am obsessed with Tana French and recently really enjoyed the first 2 books in Susie Steiner’s DI Manon Bradshaw series, but I’d really love some recs for this kind of thing that isn’t written by a white woman. I already have IQ by Joe Ides on my radar, have read and loved everything by Attica Locke, and have put the Widows of Malabar Hill on my TBR – do you have any other suggestions for me? Bonus points if it’s a long ass series I can really sink my teeth into and keep going back to when all is lost.I read (and write!) a lot of psychological thrillers so really don’t need any recommendations in that department..it’s police and private eyes I’m after here, I think.-Annie6.\xa0I’m a relatively new Insider, and have been loving your podcast through the past 5 months. Thank you SO much for making my TBR list super-long, and introducing me to so many books I might never have thought to pick up.As a side effect of the Read Harder Challenge, I realized that I love books of essays (who knew?!) in addition to my known-favorites of historical fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and literary fiction.I just finished reading “Selfish, Shallow and Self-absorbed: 16 Writers on the Decision NOT to have kids”. I had high hopes for this book as a 37 year old veterinarian who has made this decision myself, which tends not to be a popular one with family or peer-group. I was hoping to find my brethren in these essays, but sadly only felt some mild kindred spirits calling from two or three essays.I was wondering if you might be able to help me find a character who speaks to me through a novel? I will say that the “single and driven” female lead intrigues me, but isn’t me. I’m happily married to a man who also doesn’t want children. Also, I do love kids (and truly enjoy my time with my nephews and god-daughter), so kid-haters are also a strong no.Some of my favorite characters thus far have been Kinsey Millhone from Sue Grafton’s alphabet series; Lindsay Boxer from the early part of the Women’s Murder Club series by James Patterson, Claire from the Outlander series, and Jo from Little Women.Thank you in advance!-Jennie7.\xa0I always wondered why I felt no connection to action heroines. Then I read Sabriel and realized that I prefer down-to-earth, sensible protagonists who have a strong sense of duty. Tiffany Aching is the platonic ideal of this. I also recently loved The Bear and the Nightingale. My preferred genres are science fiction and fantasy. I’ve been especially loving “domestic fantasy” lately that takes place around the home, though a good adventure across dangerous lands is always fun too.Thank you!-JuliaBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Hole\xa0by Hye-Young Pyun, translated by Sora Kim-RussellThe Birth of Korean Cool\xa0by Euny HongThe Invisible Library\xa0by Genevieve CogmanChilling Effect\xa0by Valerie ValdesWhen Dimple Met Rishi\xa0by Sandhya MenonHeroine Complex\xa0series by Sarah KuhnThe Flood Girls\xa0by Richard Fifield\xa0(rec’d by Kathleen)Check, Please!: Book 1: Hockey, by Ngozi UkazuShinju\xa0by Laura Joh RowlandRachel Getty & Esa Khattak (The Unquiet Dead\xa0#1) by Ausma Zehanat KhanThe Signature of All Things\xa0by Elizabeth GilbertThe Magnificent Spinster\xa0by May SartonSisters of the Winter Wood\xa0by Rena RossnerGods of Jade and Shadow\xa0by Silvia Moreno-GarciaThe Tethered Mage\xa0by Melissa Caruso | Amanda and Jenn discuss queer reads, graphic novels, management advice, and more in this week’s episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0our Mystery/Thriller giveaway,\xa0All That’s Dead\xa0by Stuart McBride, and\xa0Loki: Where Mischief Lies\xa0by Mackenzi Lee, read by Oliver Wyman.Subscribe to the podcast via\xa0RSS,\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Spotify, or\xa0Stitcher.FEEDBACKHere’s to the Ladies: Stories of the Frontier Army\xa0by Carla Kelly (rec’d by Kate)Boom Town\xa0by Sam Anderson (rec’d by Miranda)I Contain Multitudes\xa0by Ed Yong (rec’d by Miranda)How Not To Be Wrong\xa0by Jordan Ellenberg (rec’d by Miranda)Sorcerer to the Crown\xa0by Zen Cho (rec’d by Miranda)Uprooted\xa0by Naomi Novik (rec’d by Miranda)The Tairen Soul\xa0series by C.

This past year, he’s really been into graphic novels: he loved Scott Pilgrim (and the movie) and having read The Watchmen myself some years ago, I gave him a copy and he loved it. We have Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman and Marvel 1602 in the house (which I have not yet read yet), but I am looking for some other graphic novels he might enjoy. Any suggestions?-Neda3.\xa0Hello Get Booked friends! Last year I was #blessed to get a job at my dream company, and am currently moving from entry-level to mid-career level responsibilities (aka “Big Kid stuff” as I like to think to stave off imposter syndrome). I have such a supportive work community as I grow into these new responsibilities, but I am wondering if you could recommend books (fiction or non-fiction) with practical advice for women stepping into leadership and “big-girl” responsibilities for the first time. I’ve read Lean In, You are a Badass, and a lot of Brene Brown, and tested the waters of some general business books, but I’d love the practical, Millennial perspective of women moving from entry-level to a management role (and managing people) for the first time.-Lauren4.\xa0Aloha Ladies!This podcast has been a godsend for me as I’ve recently rediscovered my love for books after a long hiatus. With my re-entry into the world of bibliophiles, my best friend and I created a long-distance book club (Hawaii to Boston!) with some other wonderful women who were interested. I’ve never been part of a book club before and am so nervous about picking an interesting read that will spark discussion. There are no restrictions on genre, author, etc., but I would prefer to select a book that’s written by a woman. My personal preferences lean heavily towards fantasy (not sure that’s the best for a group), true crime and mystery/thrillers. Any suggestions for books that will drive thought-provoking discussion would be greatly appreciated!Many Mahalos!-Christina5.\xa0Hello! I have a wonderful colleague who is preparing to adopt a child from Colombia. She doesn’t know a great deal yet, but knows that the child will be around 8-10 years old. I would love to get her some books that they could read aloud together. My colleague and her family are all currently taking Spanish classes, and the child will be in the process of learning English. Any thoughts on a good read that might help to ease the adjustments that will be happening in some small way? Thanks so much, for this and for your great recs in general!-DK6.\xa0hi, i’ve been a fan for a while and so i’m looking for recommendations by authors who are not from the u.s., or more specifically just anything from the other side of the world. i have so little international books, it feels like i’m limiting myself to one country, one kind of book. i recently read “gumiho” by kat cho, which i really liked, and am reading “i am not your perfect mexican daughter” by erika sanchez, a book which i’m relating to a lot since i am latinx. some books i really like/love are “the rest of us just live here” by patrick ness, “eliza and her monsters” by francesca zappia, and any series/book that rick riordan has worked on or presented. i’m open to any genre though i have a tendency to like books that mix the real world with a bit of fantasy/supernatural. bonus if there is lgbt and mental illness rep in the book.-Ru7.\xa0I am looking for a new book/books to read after finishing the books by Nina LaCour. I like books with queer characters (especially wlw and trans characters) set in western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland) where the city plays a big part of the book.

I recently finished NK Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy and was absolutely staggered by it. But since then I’ve been in a bit of rut; no book seems to catch my interest as my brain yearns for more Broken Earth. I’m looking to light the spark again so this rut doesn’t continue into the upcoming semester of my English M.A. (it would be a shame to read Jane Austen in this state). I’ve always been a fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but I think the main reason I fell in love with Jemisin’s writing was more to do with her wonderful character work and narrative structure, and the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship at the center of it. Hope this helps, and thanks a lot!Best,-Tom2.\xa0I am a teen in high school looking for something to read this summer break, and I thought this would be a great way to do it! I love Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens, I love the witty humour and style, and I would love to find something similar. I love books with demons as well. Other stories I love are Neil Gaiman’s Coraline and H.P. Lovecraft stories. I also love horror graphic novels.Thanks so much!-Vinny3.\xa0I just finished City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert and really enjoyed reading about a woman moving to New York City in her early twenties and sort of finding herself. I also really loved how this book covered such a long time span, so you really were able to observe the protagonist’s evolution. This story was very relevant to me as I’m in my early twenties and am starting my adulthood life in a new city. I would really love to find another book with similar elements as City of Girls. I enjoyed the period piece, but it doesn’t have to be one. Bonus points if there is a romance subplot of some sort. I’ve already read Sweet Bitter and didn’t enjoy it very much. Other books I’ve enjoyed: Little Fires Everywhere, A Little Life, Wild, Eat Pray Love and Beautiful Boy. Thanks!-Emily4.\xa0Last semester my brother asked me for reading recommendations for his English high school class. This semester he asked me for more recommendations, but I am stumped. The two books out of the five he enjoyed were Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain and The Dirt by Motley Crue. When I asked him what he enjoyed about the books, he said “because they are real and the drug use lol.” My brother is 17. Any suggestions would be appreciated.-Jenny5.\xa0Hi Ladies,I’m a dancer who has sustained a very bad injury. This is put my life in a tailspin to put it simply. Lost my job, lost my chance to move.. waiting to lose all my savings on a surgery that doesn’t even have a date set. It’s been 8 weeks. I’ve got 9+ months more.I need something to get me through this waiting. What would make you feel better if you couldn’t stand for a year?Or alternatively, I have roughly 8 months to learn something new. Maybe a book in that vein? I’m very open to suggestions. I’m just kinda… stuck.I mention I’m a dancer for a reason, please no dance books. It will make me sad or mad. Not the goal.Thank you. You guys and book riot are my internet home.-Claire6.\xa0I am looking for books (classics and “future” classics) for a project for my high-school freshman literature class in Mexico City. I have to start the project ASAP and need some help! I would like female authors (Even though I will also accept male authors), books that are around 300-350 pages long, that would interest a fully bilingual teen audience. The project is basically to teach them how to choose a book (I know, the irony…) they would like to read from a list of appropriate titles that I will give them and to read it. I have the following titles already on my list: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Dracula, The Secret Life of Bees, In the Time of the Butterflies, The Things They Carried, The Good Earth… but I really would like to put together a much longer list so they really have to do a little research before choosing. Hope you can help and thank you! (By the way, listening to your podcast is becoming very expensive for me!!! Thank you for the great recommendations)-Jennifer7.\xa0Hi 🙂 I’m looking for fun, romp-y, not-sad sci-fi and fantasy by authors of color. I’ve found that whenever I want to read something funny and silly I always end up reaching for white British male authors ( Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman), and I really think there has to be so much more that I’m missing! Some books I love the feel of are: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett, The Gospel of Loki by Joanne M. Harris, Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and Space Opera by Catherynne M. Valente.

Unfortunately I couldn’t help her find anything in our store, we have a very small selection, and was curious if you had any suggestions that we could order for her. Some other notes about her, she’s very academic and enjoys reading books about academia or bookish characters. She likes books from any time period as long as it feels authentic and realistic. Good luck!-Anon3.\xa0Hello! I am a huge fan of your podcast, and am seeking out a recommendation from reading experts like yourselves. I have found myself in somewhat of a reading rut lately, and am having trouble finding the perfect book to keep me fascinated, for I am going on a long trip soon. Reading on planes has always been a struggle for me, because I never seem to get my hands on a book thrilling enough to keep me entertained on long haul flights. I really enjoy books full of mystery, magic, fantasy, love, heartbreak, and characters you wish you could meet in real life. I am also looking for a book with depth and detail to keep my imagination flowing, like playing a movie in my head. I love books with magical illusions, dreams coming to life, or perhaps even a fire breathing dragon to keep things interesting. A story with strong character development is also a must. I love complex and authentic characters who are sure to grab my attention. A few of my favorite reads are:The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and A Darker Shade of Magic by V.E. Schwab, Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and Vicious by V.E. Schwab. I hope you help me to find a thrilling, romantic, magical book to keep me entertained! Thank you!-Gigi4.\xa0Ever since you guys talked about The Martian, I’ve been thinking about what it was I loved about it, because it wasn’t quite the same thing you talked about; I’ve landed on “books where there is conflict, action, and life or death stakes but I /don’t/ have to grapple with the problem of human evil”. What I loved about The Martian, and also many of my childhood favorites like Swiss Family Robinson, The Cay, The Hatchet, Z for Zachariah, Invitation To The Game– is people working, alone or together, to survive & build something where circumstance is their primary adversary. Unfortunately, this is a weirdly difficult thing to find in adult literature! A lot of classic man vs nature, like Jon Krakauer and Jack London, can live in my zone but is not very diverse or progressive. On the other hand, I’ve read several books in the last couple years involving teen girls learning to navigate remote and hostile environments where their fathers are evil abusive rapists (My Absolute Darling, The Great Alone, one which I forget the name of but she’s pregnant, the whole books is told in flashbacks, and in the end you find out her dad who kidnapped her is also the father of the baby) and I really do not like that at all.I would really like to read a book with action! striving! derring-do! problem-solving! optimism! adult complexity and language! a limited number of characters in some kind of physical isolation from the general bulk of society that forces them to think about their surroundings and resources in new and creative ways!I would strongly prefer no sexual violence at all (Sorry Octavia Butler) and truly minimal reliance on war, injustice, women in unfulfilling marriages, racism, genocide, or imperialism as plot drivers.Genre is completely open!-Ella5.\xa0Hi, I am looking for a book for my partner’s birthday. He isn’t a big reader, and it tends to take either a really great story or something that is super detailed in a field he likes to get him hooked – like the book equivalent of falling down a really niche wikipedia wormhole. Recently he read and loved Amy Shira-Teitel’s Breaking the Chains of Gravity and Tim Cope’s On the Trail of Genghis Khan. He is an engineer who loves fixing up cars, imagining epic adventures (and completing a few of them!), and the science and history of flight and space travel. Thank you!!-Laura6.\xa0I’m a professional 31 y/o woman, single & childless… by choice! I’d love to read something (fiction or non) about someone similar to me! Most of the books I read about women my age who are single/childless have some damage or some situation which causes this “issue”! Don’t get me wrong, I love these women & these books! I’m just struggling to find myself in stories lately!-Catherine7.\xa0Hello! Love your podcast–I’m always so impressed with your recommendations! I’m interested in books with strong female protagonists that are set in the 1800’s pioneer-ish era. As a kid, I devoured the Laura Ingalls Wilder books and the Dear America book “Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie” (let’s be real, I adored ALL of the Dear America books). As an adult, I haven’t really read anything that’s set in this same time period except for “The Hunger” which has a supernatural element that I’m not really looking for (it was good, just not what I’m in the mood for at the moment).

Hey guys!I’ve recently been inspired to write my own novel and have started envisioning my story, characters and setting. However, as I’ve gotten started I’ve realized I have no idea how to write a book at all let alone a book that people might actually want to read. I’m looking for a book on how to write books, specifically how to design compelling characters, write dialogue, design settings, inspire emotion and just the basics of writing that every writer needs to know. I’ve read Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and loved it. Im looking for other books to help guide my writing process. If it helps at all I’m hoping to write a character-driven coming of age novel.

I’m looking for recommendations for books that take place in that area. I love pretty much every genre except horror and romance, and I particularly enjoy stories (both fiction and nonfiction) that emphasize culture and food. Bonus points if it’s a cozy read that will go well with the gloomy October weather!Thanks ladies!-Morgan5.\xa0Hi Folks,I am starting the process of divorcing my husband and I am looking for support and an example from books as I’m struggling to find those things in real life. I am not in an abusive situation, but I’ve finally realized that I deserve a partner, not a dependent. This realization doesn’t make the process easier. Especially because I don’t have any personal experience with divorce. No one among my family or close friends has gone through divorce. Not that I’m complaining, but I don’t have a personal pattern or example to see that one can have a fulfilling life afterwards.I’m looking for examples of women or non-binary folks (just no dudes please) who have made it through divorce and come out the other side happy and successful (with or without a new partner). I’m open to nonfiction or fiction.-S6.\xa0I’m looking at a job in Richmond, VA, and I’m a little bit apprehensive about leaving the midwest. I would love to read anything set in Virginia (but not DC) that would give me a sense of the place and its history, though I’m not looking for a Civil War history specifically. Readalikes from other parts of the country that I’ve enjoyed/appreciated include Kristin Hannah’s The Great Alone; J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy; Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko; and Barbara Kingsolver’s Prodigal Summer (in case that might have been a recommendation!). I don’t have a preference for fiction vs nonfiction, and I read most genres, but am particularly loving multigenerational family stories like Pachinko. Bonus points for LGBT characters.-Stephanie7.\xa0Hi ladies, I adore the podcast!I’m a first generation Latina American, and in the wake of the El Paso shooting (and all the hatred surrounding Mexicans and Hispanic people as a whole) I’ve found myself at something of a loss. Reading is a place I inevitably turn to, and I was hoping you two ladies could recommend me some fiction about Latinx characters. It’s something I’ve been doing all summer actually, trying to seek out Latinx authors, and I know you two will have great recommendations. I read pretty much any genre, though my favorite is fantasy. Some books I love and have read this summer are Water For Chocolate, The House on Mango Street, Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe, and a bunch of Gabriel García Márquez. I also read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I loved, but even though it was a 5 star rating for me, I do feel you can tell it isn’t an own voices book, and right now I really need that.I’m also Cuban, so if you know any good books about Cubans that would be a major bonus, but not necessary.-AnonBOOKSOn Writing\xa0by Stephen KingSteering the Craft\xa0by Ursula K.

I’m getting married in the fall and am looking for books that portray marriage in a positive light. So many books use marriage as the plot twist, ie, murder, infidelity, etc. I want to read about good marriages and what will bring positive feelings in my marriage, not the negative portrayal usually used. I like historical fiction, magical realism, Mary Roach type of non-fiction, fantasy, romance.-Angela2.\xa0I have been reading Things You Save in a Fire by Katherine Center, and realized that I need more stories in my life about women working in high testosterone settings. I work in a job that involves carpentry, electrical work, and a lot of physical labor. In some ways I was originally drawn to the job because of the boys’ club atmosphere. I love confounding expectations; I love the challenge of proving myself, but some days that challenge is more daunting than others. Could you point me in the direction of some other books that capture this?-Sasha3.\xa0I have a bit of an itch I need scratched, and I’m having a hard time finding books with this specific description in mind. Earlier this year, I was very depressed and, although I love really dark fiction, I couldn’t bring myself to read it. I’m doing better now, and I want to plunge back in. I’m specifically wanting to read a fantasy/horror/thriller that’s really strange and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you’re just going with it? Something unsettling and stress-inducing possibly with a magical or supernatural element to it. I want to be so scared and confused and horrified that I feel like I’m going to throw up. The only examples I can think of that kind of have given me similar feelings (but maybe not quite as high of a distress level as I want or as strange as I want) have been Sawkill Girls, Baby Teeth, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, The Call, and, notably for it’s weirdness, Mouthful of Birds. Please no short story collections or anything too experimental (nothing has frustrated me more than trying to piece my way through House of Leaves). Please also no pregnancy horror, miscarriage, or child death. Thanks!!-Anon4.\xa0Hello Amanda & Jenn!I am looking for a two-part recommendation.One of my favorite parts of being a parent is having a built-in “book buddy”! She is a voracious little book worm despite being only two and a half, and I’ve loved using books as tools to talk about new topics. My husband and I haven’t yet traveled as much as we’d like to with our daughter. In order to bring a bit of the world to us, I’ve started choosing both my books and her children’s books by authors from a specific country or that take place in that country. For example: We’re focusing on Nigeria right now and I’m reading Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor and Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria by Noo Saro-Wiwa, while my daughter and I have read Chicken in the Kitchen by Nnedi Okorafor and Why The Sky Is Far Away by Mary-Joan Gerson. Could you recommend a book for me (any genre) to couple with a children’s book for her to help us learn about a new country? The World is Your Oyster!-Amber5.\xa0Hi there!I’m looking for some recommendations for my sister, who enjoys SF/Fantasy and a dash of humor. She’s also an interior/graphic designer so she tried Horrostor by Grady Hendrix at my recommendation – she said that she really enjoyed the unique format and worldbuilding but that it also totally freaked her out. (She read it alone while home with a fever. Oops.) I’m thinking of trying Night Film by Marisha Peesl next – too much you think?Some of her favorites include: Mogworld by Yahtzee Croshaw, The Martian by Andy Weir, American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Seconds by Brian Lee O’Malley, and the Finder Series by Carla Speed McNeil.Thank you!!-Melanie6.\xa0I’m looking for some recommendations for my husband. He wants to get back into reading, but he doesn’t really know where to begin. He only reads nonfiction titles. He’s an attorney and former history teacher, so he enjoys both political and historical biographies. Some of his other interests include sports and standup comedy. He’s also expressed interest in reading stories about Mexico or Mexican immigrants. I realize these subjects are kind of all over the board, but I’m hoping you guys can pull something amazing out of your brains. Thanks so much, I appreciate your help!-Sarah7.\xa0Hello,I’ve been listening to your podcast for a while, and I’m always looking forward to new episodes! For a while now I’ve been trying to find a good book to give to my mother in law. I’m a woman of colour, and my partner’s family is white. my mother in law is very open and willing to listen to my experiences as a woman of colour but I find that most – if not all – of the stories she finds most powerful are told from white men and women. While I’m sure the stories she loves are powerful and well-told, I wanted to find a book that offers the perspective of a person of colour and their experiences. Some of her favourite books are Still Alice, My Secret Sister, and A Dog’s Purpose. I hope you are able to help me out either on the podcast or by email.Happy reading!– SandiBOOKS DISCUSSEDAn Affair Before Christmas\xa0by Eloisa JamesThe Deepest Blue\xa0by Sarah Beth DurstCork Dork\xa0by Bianca BoskerDocumentary:\xa0SOMMShoot Like a Girl\xa0by Mary Jennings Hegar\xa0(tw: sexual assault, family abuse, misogyny)Hegar’s viral adHex\xa0by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, transl by Nancy Forest-Flier (TW: child abuse, violence)White Is For Witching\xa0by Helen Oyeyemi (tw: disordered eating, self-harm)Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos\xa0by Monica BrownSigns Preceding the End of the World\xa0by Yuri Herrera, transl. by Lisa DillmanUnder My Hijab\xa0by Hena Khan, illustrated by Aaliya JaleelThe Faithful Scribe\xa0by Shahan MuftiThe Parasol Protectorate series (Soulless\xa0#1) by Gail CarrigerUnraveling\xa0by Karen LordPit Bull\xa0by Bronwen Dickey (tw: animal abuse)The River of Doubt\xa0by Candice MillardThe Woman Next Door\xa0by Yewande OmotosoMen We Reaped\xa0by Jesmyn Ward | Amanda and Vanessa discuss Italian comics, paranormal smut, and more in this week's episode of Get Booked.This episode is sponsored by\xa0Book Riot Insiders,\xa0Libro.fm\xa0and TBR.Subscribe to the podcast via RSS, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher.FeedbackNone this week!Questions1.\xa0I was just offered a position as a 4th grade reading/writing teacher starting in the fall. I've been teaching abroad for a while and need good\xa0kid-lit recs for my classroom as I'm out of the loop. Picture books, chapter books, and graphic novels are all welcome. I've already got some good ones like Lumberjanes, the Anne of Green Gables graphic novel, and of course Harry Potter. For context, the school is very diverse and has a very high ESL population with students from South Asia, the Middle East/ North Africa, and Central America. Books where kids can see themselves represented and that can cater to different English fluency levels would be amazing.\xa0Thanks!-Teaching in America2.\xa0I love historical fiction, it is one of my favorite genres. However, I am running out of books in my tbr that are historical fiction. My favorite eras are Tudor England and the American Civil War. (please no more WW2!) I tend to prefer stories surrounding larger-than-life figures or momentous events in history. But really I am up for anything, so long as I get attached to the characters. Some of my favorites include Wolf Hall, The Killer Angels, and The Help. (I also like historical fantasy and other genre-benders, but I don't need any help finding more of THAT.)-Katie3.\xa0I hope you two can help! My boyfriend doesn’t read books at all, but that’s my main pastime and he has expressed an interest in trying to read more so we can hang out together and read. The main reason he doesn’t currently read books is because they need to grab him right away or he quickly loses interest, puts the book down, and never picks it back up again. A little about him: he’s an electrical engineer, is super smart, likes to tinker with cars and gadgets, is pretty curious about world events and all sorts of things – he will hear about something and go on an internet deep dive to learn all about it, and he has a great memory.\xa0So far I have given him Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson and he really likes that one and I have Dark Matter by Blake Crouch and All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai teed up for him because I think he will like the science-y, brain twistiness of both. Any ideas for what else I can give him? And for the record, I am totally fine with him not reading, but he has asked and so, of course, I am glad to oblige him and provide him with reading material! :)Thanks so much!-Elizabeth4.\xa0A friend recently invited me travel to Italy this Fall, but I'm not sure if it's in my budget -- Can you help me find a graphic novel set in Italy so I can travel there in my imagination? Some comics/graphic novels/graphic memoirs I've enjoyed recently: Relish by Lucy Knisely, Moonstruck by Grace Ellis et. al., Sweater Weather by Sara Varon, and Lumberjanes\xa0Thank you!!-Jess5.\xa0I've been in a serious reading slump and I just need something super fast paced to get me out of it. I really like YA fantasy and romances. Anything with a map is great. I just bought Courting Darkness but haven't started it yet... I love Marissa Meyer and Richelle Mead. Stalking Jack the Ripper... The Dresden files... I read all over the place so basically anything is fine from kid lit to Adult. Love Captain Underpants.\xa0-Rye6.\xa0Please help with audiobooks for a concussed reader! Hi! I am a voracious reader, and after concussing myself on a freezer 10 days ago, I haven't been allowed to read text. I'm going into withdrawal!\xa0I am a very eclectic reader, but generally I am more drawn to plot than characters. Humor, particularly snark, is always a plus, as well as just beautiful writing. Authors I love that I am in the mood for are Lois McMaster Bujold (particularly her Vorkosigan series, Cordelia is my favorite character), John Scalzi (particularly the Old Man's War series) and also Laurie R King (particularly her Mary Russell series). For beautiful writing, see China Mieville, though his books are way too complex for my poor brain to follow right now. Speaking of which, easy to follow is important right now! I'm having trouble with that.-Becca7. hello ladies, firstly, I love listening to you guys- even when I'm not interested in the books suggested.I am on break in August for midwinter chill (hehah) and am on the lookout for some fun reads. I have just finished the psy-changeling series (got to support my fellow kiwis!) and Polaris Rising. They are both smutty and fun while still having a good plot. Can you give me any new SSF/smutty suggestions, I feel like I have read all the good ones and they are all the same.

I’ve previously read books about the funeral trade and restaurant/food industry. So I’m looking for more! Preferably ones that are about things that don’t immediately spring to mind. Thanks in advance.-Anna2.\xa0Fun, Light, Realistic YA – Not too fantastical or sci-fi. I’m looking for recommendations for my teenage daughters, ages 15 and 16 and I’m stumped. It seems we keep finding books with material that is too young for them too dark and serious. They have liked “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “When Dimple Met Rishi” and the “Selection” series. They would love realistic fiction that isn’t teen romance but we are having a hard time finding anything fun that isn’t childish.-Cami3.\xa0I recently came out as nonbinary after several years of being out as queer/bi. I am looking for a book with queer or nonbinary characters, though that certainly doesn’t need to be the focus of the book. I would just like to see more of myself represented in the things I read, and I knew you two would do a fantastic job! I like a little bit of everything, and I don’t shy away from YA or children’s books (Jessica Love’s Julian is a Mermaid is what inspired me to come out as nonbinary!). I would just say no religious books, please, and bonus points if the book is written by a queer or nonbinary author. Side note – thank you for this beautiful podcast! I have found so many books because of it, and I just adore you two.-Cheyenne4.\xa0Hello Readerlicious Rock Stars!First off, you folks are super awesome and I adore listening to your show. My identical twin sister and I love reading about twins and I’d love some twin-ish recommendations from you all for us to read together.Some things to consider:1) We’re open to any genre (other than horror) or reading level (middle grade and beyond).2) Plots surrounding twins tend to be dark for some reason. Or, at least that seems to be the case with most twin books I’ve come across. A focus on fun/upbeat/kickass/bright/optimistic would be great. Please, no tragic death of one of the twins. That would be way too much of a bummer.3) We’d love it if you could recommend some reads that don’t involve the typical good twin/bad twin trope. As twins who are constantly facing the ridiculous tendency for folks to categorize us/twins in that kind of binary way, it’d be great to read something that doesn’t do the same. How about BOTH twins being bright lights in the world?4) Along the same lines as no twin death, I’m not a fan of any book that delves into serious abuse or tragic death of kids. As a mom of two cuties, it’s way too hard for me to read about kids and dark, tragic circumstances; i.e. abduction, murder, rape, etc.5) We’re huge fans of strong, fabulous, outrageous, potentially super power grrls who kick ass. Characters who overcome hardship and beat a crappy system are definitely ones we’d love to root for.Thank you!-Nicole5.\xa0Hello! I love your podcast! I am looking for a personal recommendation. Every so often I come upon a book or movie that broadens my mind and my heart. These books and movies usually have unconventional characters who become unlikely heroes. Strong character development, authenticity, and complexity are all fabulous, and magical realism is a bonus. Some of my favorites have in this genre have been The Seventh Gate by Richard Zimler, Peace Like a River by Leif Enger, Mink River by Brian Doyle, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, Sing Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz. I would love another one to devour and fall in love with. Thank you for your help 🙂-Melissa6. Hi Ladies, Thanks for always putting up a great show! I often pretend y’all are my girlfriends who are talking to me about books. 😉 This is my first time putting in a request, but it’s one that I’ve been wanting to submit for quite some time now. As an avid reader, I want nothing more than to read a book with my non-reader husband. My dream may soon be realized because he just asked me for some recommendations on books about politics. He reads a bunch of articles every day about politics (and sports) online, but is now ready to graduate to books! Do you have any book recommendations about U.S. politics that reads like fiction and are interesting enough to capture the attention of a non-reader? It can be about the current political climate or anything in the past as well. I can’t provide any books he’s liked since he’s a non-reader, but he does read a ton of articles and forums on reddit. I’m hoping this is enough info for you guys to go on, because I’m definitely lost on this one. THANK YOU!!-Helen7.\xa0Hi,Recently both me and my sister have got into the slightly niche genre of eastern Asian authors writing about/from the point of view of animals. The includes books like The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, anything by Seonmi Hwang, The memoirs of a polar bear by Yoko Tawada and the travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Arikawa. I would like to get my sister another book of this kind but I’m running out of ideas and was wondering if you would be able to help? It doesn’t really matter where the authors are from its just the style that we enjoy although extra brownie points if they aren’t British/American as we read so many of these anyway!Thanks love the show!-HollyBOOKS DISCUSSEDThe Line Becomes a River\xa0by Francisco CantúFire Season\xa0by Philip ConnorsHearts Unbroken\xa0by Cynthia Leitich SmithPride\xa0by Ibi ZoboiFreshwater\xa0by Akwaeke Emezi (TW: sexual assault)The Tensorate series by JY Yang (Red Threads of Fortune\xa0#2)Fangirl\xa0by Rainbow RowellSlayer\xa0by Kiersten White (some mentions of parental abuse)America is Not the Heart\xa0by Elaine CastilloExit West\xa0by Mohsin HamidOn Tyranny\xa0by Timothy SnyderWhat Truth Sounds Like\xa0by Michael Eric DysonThe Bees\xa0by Laline PaullFifteen Dogs\xa0by André Alexis (tw: harm to animals)The Bugs of Literature: A Flowchart", 'chan_desc': 'Get Booked is a weekly show of personalized book recommendations.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/b4/be/f8/b4bef82b-a481-f13c-3b85-8ff5ae88c888/mza_3959374193928873441.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-08-07'}}

Maybe there is another zone going on — one of peace and ease — that the Universe wants us to move into. | This week we had the great pleasure of having a chat with actress and filmmaker\xa0Alysia Reiner! You may know her as\xa0“Fig” on ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. This powerhouse woman will inspire you with her passion for service and\xa0activism. She\xa0talks about why RIGHT NOW is the perfect time to create, and dives deep into her personal\xa0mission to\xa0tell stories that awaken more love & compassion on the planet. | Do you do it sometimes? We all do! Sometimes we make our experience hard without realizing that is what we are doing? We erect mental blocks and dwell on negative thoughts that create a barrier to an energy that is trying to be lived THROUGH us. Why do we do this? What do we get out of it?? Is there another way to live? What might be waiting for us on the other side of “hard?" | This week we are talking about how participation means RISK. That a decision to be involved in a relationship, a creative project, a new business all mean the courage to try something new — which includes the possibility of failure, loss, and confusion. Life keeps asking us to grow and expand, which means we have to be willing to put something at stake. Existence doesn’t want us to us to stay the same, but to ever be evolving. Our leading edge of growth is always at the end of our comfort zone. It takes bravery to be involved. | Have you ever felt like you were running around looking for answers? Well, have you ever considered that there’s a place inside of you that already knows? This week we talk about that INNER KNOWING and how so many of us get caught looking for the answers on the outside or over-valuing someone else’s opinion, when there is a part of us that knows how to direct us. That’s right! We have perfect inner guidance — a built-in GPS — and it’s just waiting for us to get silent and listen. | When was the last time you felt content? And you were aware of that contentment? And when did you last take a moment to sit and value that feeling of peace and contentment? Well, the great news is that contentment is INSIDE of us, it is available at every moment, and it has something to teach us. Here’s this week’s podcast. And a little Winnie-the-Pooh too. | Do you ever shame yourself for feeling lost, unclear, or confused? But what if there was intrinsic value in being lost? What if it was a necessary part of the process that teaches us the way? This week we focus on the importance of getting lost and found, and what it has to teach us about the nature of choice, learning, and intimacy with ourself. | This week we talk about how Powerful we are!! What’s more fun than that? Yep, we are jamming on what it means to be an Alchemist — to be one who can change form! We discuss intention and perception and all the tools in our magic tool bag. | This week we speak to a listener’s email who asks, “How can I tell the difference in terms of what is uncomfortable because it is new, and what is the Universe saying ‘Don’t go this way?’” How do we read the signs? In the process of beginning, what is a natural challenge and what is a warning sign? What is a growth spurt and what is a wrong way? How do we learn discernment? Listen as we dive deep into this one! | The other day Kristin arrived to see Natalie’s face beaming with joy!

Last week-- on April 30, 2019-- I was asked to participate in a special screening of the 2010 Banksy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop at the Alamo Drafthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina. Exit was part of Alamo’s Film Club series, curated by Jackson Cooper, and after the film I sat down with Jackson to record a special conversation/Q&A about the film, Banksy, and the legacy of street art. Enjoy— and we’ll be back next week with an all-new episode of ArtCurious.Just a note that there are some spoilers in terms of the fact that we talk about the documentary in general, as well as Banksy himself and the other artist profiled in the doc, a man called Mr. Brainwash.\xa0SPONSORMyro (use promo code ARTCURIOUS at checkout for 50% off and to get started for just $5)\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

Anne Bogel, creator of Modern Mrs. Darcy and What Should I Read Next, and general, all-around amazing lady, is chatting with us today and we couldn’t be more excited. You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from all three of us: two are very similar in that they involve bookish friendships, and one is a library-related book demerit (a la Gretchen Rubin on the Happier podcast). Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. Two titles from each host, and we are bringing a wide range of books, from romance to thrillers, to interesting writing styles, to weirdo books. It’s all here! We’ve got an update for you on our Slow But Steady reads and what’s been happening in the past week, as well as a fun update from a listener. For our deep dive this week, we are chatting all things Anne Bogel. You’ll hear about the advice she would have given herself before Episode 1 of What Should I Read Next (now that she’s 200+ episodes in), you’ll hear about her new book coming out next year, and a bit of behind the scenes talk about giving book recs on the fly. Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands. And we know you cannot wait to see what Anne chose as her press! We’ve got a novella for every reader who loves books about books, the beginning of a new (old) mystery series, and a summer read that we’ve gushed about in previous episodes.

You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from each of us: family presentation at homeschool group and going into a new book completely blind. Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. We’ve got five current reads this week, and they are sci-fi/fantasy heavy, which is WEIRD for us! Lots of strong opinions here! We’ve got an update for you on our Slow But Steady reads and what’s been happening in the past week. Also a short grammar lesson on “Swifties”. For our deep dive this week, we had a number of listeners (and real life friends) request our favorite parenting books. This will span everything from pregnancy/birth to infanthood to growing children to adding siblings. Plus one funny pick for when you just want to laugh it off.

This minisode was so FUN to record! John is an absolute charmer, and I hope you love it. In this “minisode”, Kaytee and John are talking about being a serial killer and the cops combing your Google history, jury duty and writing a book from many perspectives, the transition from journalism to murder and much more! As always, we’ll end with a book he wants to press into your hands, readers! Minisode shownotes are not timestamped, but linked titles are below for you to peruse.

You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from each host: an overflow of TBR riches, and a lovely book-screen adaptation. Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. Non-fiction and thrillers is the name of the game, and we’ve got both of them in SPADES. We’ve got an update for you on our Slow But Steady reads as well, what progress looks like for us. We are loving having you chime in for what you’re reading for this challenge. It’s been great to see what actually piques your interest here, readers. For our deep dive, we are discussing the books we are “embarrassed” that we haven’t read yet. But mostly we’re having a conversation about why people let embarrassment even effect their reading lives. And it’s a good one! Finally, this week, we finish the episode by Pressing Books Into Your Hands. We’re both pressing books by male authors this week and they are a couple decades old, at least. Definitely outside the norm, but the strangest part is that we didn’t discuss beforehand!

It starts with our  grilled naan recipe\xa0and ends with a 60- to 90-second bake on a pizza stone. Next, ice cream Jedi Master Nicholas Morgenstern, of Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream, talks about how he comes up with his notoriously inventive flavors, like Burnt Sage, Black Pepper Molasses, or the Banana Kalamansi ice cream he had me taste on mike. His ice creams are excellent on their own, but Morgenstern also has a sundae bar in his shop. Why? "The ice cream sundae has come to represent the egalitarian indulgence that ice cream can be in this country...everyone can have an ice cream sundae,” he told me. “Ice cream is already strictly an indulgence, and you\'re taking it to another level by adding the things that if you were a child and could have whatever you wanted, you would have on there. It turns out everyone wants to have that." To prove his point, he also came to the studio with a seriously delicious chocolate peanut butter sundae he\'s named the Rosenthal, named after  friend-of-Special-Sauce Phil Rosenthal, the host of "Somebody Please Feed Phil" on Netflix. The final segment of the episode captures low-key rock-star Chicago chef Rick Bayless teaching me the secrets of making the perfect fresh ginger sparkling margarita. Bayless is a master storyteller and explainer, and he does it all without a script or a teleprompter- pretty darn impressive. With these three great guests, it\'s an episode you won\'t want to miss. --- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/10/nick-morgenstern-kenji-rick-bayless.html | This week Serious Eaters get to see the all-new Special Sauce format we\'ve cooked up for the new season. Every episode of Special Sauce 2.0 will start off with "Ask Kenji," a brief section in which J. Kenji Lopez-Alt will answer a pressing question one of our readers has sent in. We\'re going to do one of these every week, so keep those questions coming. This week the question comes from Tucker Colvin, who asks Kenji which outdoor pizza oven Kenji recommends. After "Ask Kenji," each week we\'ll have on a guest, and this week that guest is ice cream wizard Nicholas Morgenstern, whose eponymous ice cream shop in New York\'s Greenwich Village offers 88 flavors. As my friend Brian Koppelman said on his podcast, "The Moment," Morgenstern is Willy Wonka of ice cream. He also happens to be an extremely thoughtful person; for example, when I asked him why he chose to devote his life to ice cream, he replied, "The product itself is a terrific vehicle for expression for me...It\'s become more and more interesting to me to think about it as a cultural reference point, especially in America, and what it means to Americans, and why it\'s so important." Finally, at the end of every episode, we\'ll check in with the test kitchen crew at Serious Eats World HQ. This week, Daniel Gritzer gives us his definitive take on the pros and cons of refrigerating tomatoes. So do give Special Sauce 2.0 a listen. I hope you, like me, think it\'s snappy, informative, and surprising. \xa0  https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/09/introducing-special-sauce-2-point-0.html | Part two of my at times emotionally overwhelming interview with Tom Roston, author of  The Most Spectacular Restaurant in the World: The Twin Towers, Windows on the World, and the Rebirth of New York, focused on the employees of Windows on the World who were in the North Tower\'s iconic restaurant on September 11, 2001, all of whom tragically died that day. According to Roston, "there were immigrants from, I think it was over 25 nations.... People from Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico." For many of these employees, getting a job at the prestigious institution was a watershed moment in their lives. "It was like, basically, you made it. This is going to be your ticket to whatever it was, or maybe this is just the answer and you don\'t need to fight anymore, and then it was gone." As Roston and I discussed, those employees who weren\'t in the restaurant that morning didn\'t escape completely unscathed, and each was profoundly impacted in their own way. These survivors ranged from servers to a sous chef to the executive chef, Michael Lomonaco, who happened to be in an appointment in the retail concourse of the building at the time of the attack and struggled with tremendous survivor\'s guilt afterward. Apart from those who lost their lives, Roston said, "think about all these restaurant workers who were so irrevocably affected by this event...and they walk amongst us. There was no victim compensation fund for these people. They live with it. They live with it every day, the fact that their best friend died and they didn\'t die." In a way, the effect of 9/11 on the Windows staff was a microcosm of its effect on all of New York. "There are different layers of victim. The victim spectrum is very long and wide, and everyone felt it," Roston said. "I think it\'s interesting to think...about the city of New York, and how it was a victim." Asked if a place with the spirit of Windows on the World could ever exist in New York again, Roston stressed the restaurant\'s connection to a different time in the city\'s history. "There was a romanticism back then, in the \'70s, and there was a belief in certain things. Now, we\'re much more sporadic. It\'s about whether or not you can put it on Instagram, and attention spans are so fast and quick, but for me, I can see it all over the city, really. Not all of the city, but there are a lot of places where you can feel the spectacular spirit of the city." Our conversation was both wrenching and edifying, just like Roston\'s book. This episode of Special Sauce is not an easy listen, but it is an essential one. -- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats: https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/09/special-sauce-tom-roston-part-2.html | No matter where you were when the two planes hit the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, you were profoundly affected by the events of that day. And if you, like me, were at all involved in the food culture at that moment, your thoughts quickly turned to Windows on the World, the glitzy restaurant on the 107th floor of the North Tower, where visitors could enjoy unparalleled views while sipping $5 drinks (at the adjoining Greatest Bar on Earth) or dropping serious coin for a celebratory dinner. One hundred seventy employees and patrons of the restaurant died that day. Author Tom Roston, this week\'s Special Sauce guest, has written  The Most Spectacular Restaurant in the World: The Twin Towers, Windows on the World, and the Rebirth of New York, a compelling and doggedly reported book that details the history of both Windows on the World and the Twin Towers, from their inception to their demise. As Roston says, "It\'s no coincidence that the book is coming out in September, right around 9/11, because it\'s when we are all forced to remember. Even though we are all thinking about it. I think so many of us always have it in the back of our minds.... I didn\'t lose anyone, but as a New Yorker, my city suffered. It just makes sense when you\'re...putting a book out, let\'s do it when this is part of the conversation. And I want the life of this restaurant to be a part of the conversation about 9/11, because it\'s not just about the tragedy." Roston was particularly drawn to the poignant stories of the many immigrants from all over the world who worked at Windows on the World. "...There are these stories that have gone untold. We experienced 9/11, we think of this smoke, we think of these awful things, potentially. Or people go to the memorial, and they commemorate what happened. But it was interesting to me as a storyteller to say, \'Well, what about all these stories that haven\'t been told?\' And it turned out they were these incredible stories, like from September 10th. This range of experience of life that happened in the restaurant that, of course, is heavy with meaning and profundity when you consider what happened the next day." These next two Special Sauce episodes with Roston moved me to tears, and I imagine they will move many other serious eaters in the same way. -- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/09/special-sauce-tom-roston-part-1.html | In part two of my thought-provoking interview with San Francisco Chronicle\xa0restaurant critic Soleil Ho, we dove right into how she thinks about restaurant criticism. Soleil explained, "I like to think of restaurants as texts in the same way that you read a book and then you extrapolate upon who wrote the book, when did they write it, why did they write it, what did the audience think at the time? What does it say about society at the time? What kind of snapshot is it? You\'re really reading it for meaning, and I think restaurants, you can take the same way." When she took the Chronicle job, Soleil announced that she was banning certain words from her reviews, including a widely used adjective like “ethnic.” “When you say ethnic restaurants, I would beg you, not you Ed, but people who are listening, to think about what kinds of restaurants you\'re including under that umbrella. Are only some restaurants under that umbrella or all restaurants, because don\'t we all have ethnicity?" Soleil takes her responsibilities seriously. Very seriously. She was recently quoted as asking, ”What if I screw up and no one ever hires a queer woman of color for a role like this again?" I asked her to expand on that worry. "I get...a lot of messages from young people, younger than me, who are coming up or who are just reading my work and find me inspiring. And so I take that to heart as something that tells me to tread lightly, to be honest with who I am, but to also make sure that the door is open even wider for them.” To find out what other words and phrases Soleil refuses to use in her reviews, and why she gave a lukewarm review to the legendary Chez Panisse in Berkeley, you\'re just going to have to listen. It’ll be well worth your time to do so. --- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/08/special-sauce-soleil-ho-on-representation-in-food-media.html | Like a great deal of food media in America, the world of restaurant criticism has  a long history of hiring white writers\xa0and\xa0closing its doors to people of color.\xa0\xa0So it was exciting to see the San Francisco Chronicle\xa0break the mold last year when it hired Vietnamese-American food writer and co-host of The\xa0Racist Sandwich podcast, Soleil Ho, to be its lead restaurant critic. If that wasn\'t cool enough, Soleil also happens to be a fellow graduate of Grinnell College, the small progressive liberal arts college in Iowa that I attended a mere 40 years before she did. For all those reasons and more, I had to have Soleil on Special Sauce. At Grinnell, Soleil remembers "having to petition dining services to leave soy sauce out for breakfast, and they didn\'t understand why we needed it. And I had to make my case like, ‘No, soy sauce and eggs is a thing that people eat.’” Vocal as she was about food, though, she didn’t start out wanting to be a food writer. "When I entered college, I wanted to get into physics. I was really into quantum physics and was reading the History of Time and all of these other books,” she recalls. But cooking always had an undeniable allure. "Oh, I used to be so into Iron Chef when I was a kid. I loved the bravado of it, of peeling eels alive and all of that stuff. And that\'s what really attracted me to that.”\xa0 Learning to cook came later, initially from reading, watching TV, and dining out, and eventually from working in Portland as a line cook. It was during her line cook days that she started her groundbreaking podcast, The Racist Sandwich, with Zahir Janmohamed. "We wanted the show to be a reliable place within food media for people to find these stories that seems like they only ran on special occasions. You know, like you\'d only read black stories in February during Black History Month, or you\'d only read LGBTQ stories during June, Pride Month, those sorts of things. And we wanted to cover that stuff all the time and not feel like those stories were an exception or tokens or anything like that."  We covered so many interesting topics during the first half of our conversation we never even got to her San Francisco Chronicle\xa0gig. For that, you\'ll have to wait until next week.\xa0In the meantime, you can check out her bylines for the newspaper right here. -- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/08/special-sauce-soleil-ho-on-her-journey-from-quantum-physics-to-racist-sandwich.html | In part two of Ed Levine\'s conversation with Max Falkowitz\xa0and Matt Rodbard, the three discuss how Falkowitz and Rodbard got started in food media and how their careers evolved. Falkowitz begins by underlining how intimidating it was when he first started working at Serious Eats. "I can\'t really describe the terror upon walking into the office," he says- though, he observes, that fear was tempered by the frenetic publication schedule, which was both liberating and educational. "It was a great trial by fire," Falkowitz says. "There was no time to second-guess yourself, and there was no time to dawdle with irrelevancies that weren\'t going to move the next story forward." Rodbard notes that the early days of his food-media career, around 2006, were an incredibly exciting time to be working in the industry. "It was a great moment for me to cover New York at a time when celebrity chefs were starting to really become a thing," he recalls. "It was captivating to me to cover this burgeoning celebrity-chef world." The two then describe how they eventually ended up where they are now: Rodbard is the editor-in-chief of Taste, an online magazine, and Falkowitz is a freelance writer, consultant, and host for Taste\'s podcast. Ed asks the two of them to expound upon the current state of food media, and what they think has changed. "I think it\'s a more diverse world," Rodbard says, echoing a point Falkowitz made in part one of their interview. "I think editors and editorial directors and bosses are making a really clear and conscious effort to diversify their staff, diversify their freelancers." The three of them discuss far more about the future of food media than can be captured in this brief blurb. To hear everything they have to say, you\'re just going to have to listen to the episode. --- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/08/special-sauce-ed-levine-matt-rodbard-max-falkowitz-2.html | In the next two episodes of Special Sauce, we take a deep dive into the challenges and triumphs of building a career in food media. I invited former Serious Eats editor/current contributor Max Falkowitz, and founding TASTE\xa0editor Matt Rodbard to share their perspectives. As two people who have co-written cookbooks with chefs, been on staff as editors and writers at food publications, and freelanced extensively, I thought they’d offer unique insights into what it takes to become food writer. And sure enough, they had no shortage of thoughts to share. Max started us off with a hilarious tale about life at the Falkowitz family table: "So my dream story is to write one of those really tender, loving, emotional pieces about my dad\'s pasta sauce, which he spends all day making. He has these giant cauldrons that his aunt used to only used to boil gefilte fish in and they\'re probably 30 gallon cauldrons. He chops up all of his olives and he browns his ground beef and he gets special types of tomatoes and he spends all day making the sauce. He invites his old college buddies to have the sauce. It\'s a whole thing, and the sauce is terrible...It\'s so bad. It tastes like canned olive juice...which is effectively what it is. Both of my parents are wonderful cooks, and they were for the most part raising me as independent single parents and did a fantastic job and gave me a life long love of food, but they have their missteps and one of them is the sauce."\u2028  Matt\'s advice for aspiring food writers is quite simple: "Write all the time. It\'s like a muscle. It\'s like riding a bike. I mean, it\'s cliché, but it\'s true. You have to stay in shape. I think that\'s why I said the Yelp review was such a good thing to start with, because I was Yelping literally every meal I had and I think often with Twitter and with Social, people assume that\'s writing, but it\'s not writing. That isn\'t writing. That\'s something else." Max added this bit of pointed counsel: “Give a fuck. There\'s so much writing that feels totally dispassionate and procedural. If you\'re not doing this because you love it, you\'re not going to get paid doing this." Anyone who has contemplated pursuing this fulfilling but challenging career path should give these next two episodes a listen. --- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/08/special-sauce-matt-rodbard-and-max-falkowitz-on-becoming-food-writers.html\xa0 | In part two of Ed Levine\'s conversation with Lazarus Lynch, who goes by more titles than any 25-year-old has any reasonable expectation to have (cookbook author, performer, singer...the list is incredible!), they delve into how Lynch decided he wanted to write his book,  Son of a Southern Chef: Cook with Soul. Lynch tells Ed that he came up with the title in his junior year in college, long before he even thought about what the book would contain, during a meeting in which a campus advisor asked him to think about his dream profession. "And I remember I kept bringing up my dad," Lynch says, "and I...went to my room that evening and woke up the next day with \'Son of a Southern Chef\' sort of on the tip of my tongue." And while Lynch adopted the phrase for his overall brand, producing a cookbook was just a natural extension of the many projects he\'d already undertaken. But the process of writing the book was a bit mystifying, particularly since he didn\'t see any other book like it on the market- one written by someone who was in their early 20s and, as Lynch says, "who just came out of college, who\'s a part of the LGBTQ family, and who\'s talking about soul food." Add to that the skepticism he initially faced from publishers, many of whom rejected the book pitch out of hand. "We sent it out to about ten different publishers," Lynch says, "and...everyone was like, \'No, no, no.\'" Eventually, he found a publisher, and had to navigate the process of getting the book written and edited, but to hear more about what that was like, and how the book changed over the course of its writing, you\'re just going to have to tune in. -- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/08/special-sauce-lazarus-lynch-2-2.html | Singer, author (Son of a Southern Chef), and food personality Lazarus Lynch is not your typical cookbook writer or social media star. As an openly gay young Black man, Lynch is blazing his own trail in the food and media worlds, so I couldn\'t pass up the chance to talk to him for Special Sauce. Lynch started his food TV career in college, where he enlisted friends to hold cameras and other equipment for his cooking show in exchange for free food. "We put it on YouTube. I didn\'t think anyone was going to watch it. And suddenly people on campus started to notice it, pay attention to it, and then [online food video network] Tastemade came calling." The next thing Lynch knew, Tastemade was flying him out regularly to LA to shoot his show. Who inspired him to pursue a career in cooking on camera? "In the early days of watching Food Network, I would come home [from school] and turn on the Food Network- it was everyone. It was Bobby Flay, it was Emeril Lagasse, I mean, it was Ina Garten. It was all of the ones that we see, or that we know to be sort of the Food Network people. And that was my education, really.... I didn\'t know about the powerful women in soul food, like  Edna Lewis\xa0or Leah Chase. I didn\'t know. I didn\'t know that they existed until much, much later." Lynch came out to his parents in college. His father was immediately accepting, but his mother, a product of a strict Catholic upbringing, found his sexuality challenging. It took three conversations over the course of five years for her to come around. He told her, "I think that part of my purpose in your life is to help you evolve in accepting people of all different places, and whoever they are. That\'s part of what I\'m here- to grace you in that process of learning and knowing. And you\'re here to support me in being my best full self. So, we had a very compassionate, loving conversation the last time we talked about it." Despite the difficulty of those talks, the payoff for Lynch in increased self-confidence was huge. "It\'s been so freeing to be okay with who I am and where I am, and, you know, I think the best reward is not just living a happy life but also to know that there are other young people who are looking at me and who are being inspired, whether it\'s with their sexuality, or \'I need to change this.... My parents are forcing me to study something I really don\'t want to study,\' which was very common when I was in school. Whatever that might be, but to follow your own heart and follow your truth." I found Lynch\'s story and path fascinating and inspiring, and I think serious eaters everywhere will, too. And that\'s even before we get into a discussion of his cookbook and shows, which we\'ll do in next week\'s episode. --- The full transcript for this episode can be found over here at Serious Eats:\xa0https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/07/special-sauce-lazarus-lynch-part-1.html', 'chan_desc': "Serious Eats' podcast Special Sauce enables food lovers everywhere to eavesdrop on an intimate conversation about food and life between host and Serious Eats founder Ed Levine and his well-known/famous friends and acquaintances both in and out of the food culture.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/ab/d2/4e/abd24e57-7239-1c4e-9dce-263e8cbcb59a/mza_3900216033936247733.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-10-29'}}

Our first guest is photographer Stefan Falke, who is engaged in a 10-year portrait project called LA FRONTERA: Artists Along the US-Mexican Border, which is dedicated to documenting the “influence that artists have on their community.” He has photographed more than 200 artists, writers, singers, and photographers who live on both sides of the 2,000-mile-long border. With Falke we discuss the development of this project, his style of shooting, how he met the many artists he has photographed, and the complications and joys of shooting in border towns in the U.S. and Mexico. He also discusses how he pared down his camera and lens choices for this project to just his trusty  Nikon D850 and a  24-70mm lens. After a short break, we welcome photographer Monica Lozano, who is included in Falke’s project, and describes her portrait session with him in the main market, in Juarez, Mexico. We also discuss her incredible photographic series, which blend documentary and fine art styles to bring awareness to the struggle of migrants in Europe and the Americas. Lozano, a Mexican-American artist with roots in both countries, brings a compassionate yet objective depiction to a complex situation, and she even blends in a touch of humor. With Lozano, we discuss her evolution as an artist, the differing effects that stylized photos have compared to straight documentary, and the resounding need to understand the long and evolving history and culture of “la frontera.” Join us for this compelling conversation and check out the B&H Photography Podcast Facebook Group. Guests: Stefan Falke and Monica Lozano Photograph © Stefan Falke | When one of the world’s most “followed” photographers is available for a conversation, you make the time to talk with him, and when that photographer is acclaimed adventure, landscape, travel, and surf photographer Chris Burkard, expect that conversation to include some serious insights into the passion and ambition that it takes to create the beautiful images he makes.\xa0 On this week’s episode of the  B&H Photography Podcast, we speak with Burkard about a range of subjects—and this conversation does not disappoint. We get right into it by asking about his penchant for shooting in frigid locations and how stubbornness and even persistence can be the enemy of good photography when shooting in sub-zero temperatures. We discuss the composition of his photographs and how that is indicative of his views on nature, and we dig into his “origin story” and why clients began to come to him for the kind of photography he creates. In general, however, we stick to the nuts and bolts of his photography and learn why he prefers  mirrorless cameras, specifically the  Sony Alpha A7R IV, and how he organizes his commercial workflow to still make time for the adventures he craves and to be with his young family. After a break, we ask Burkard to walk us through the creation of a few of his more well-known images. Not only does he offer insight into the photographic aspects, but he elaborates to give us a better understanding of the remote locations he finds and the teamwork needed. To quote Burkard, “to better understand how the Earth was made, we must look at it from new perspectives.” Join us for this informative conversation and if you are in New York City this weekend, you can see Burkard speak at Stocked 2019. Guest: Chris Burkard Photograph © Chris Burkard | On today’s episode of the B&H Photography Podcast, we revisit our conversation with Stephen and Bette Wilkes in honor of the release of Wilkes’s great new book  Day to Night, and the accompanying gallery show at the Bryce Wolkowitz gallery, in New York. We also spend a bit of time reflecting on a few of the legendary photographers who have died recently. The Day to Night series that Stephen Wilkes has been working on for ten years has received much-deserved attention and has grown from its New York roots to encompass locations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. These photographs, which capture a full 24-hour cycle in one frame, are awe-inspiring when viewed as a whole; fascinating when analyzed in detail; and monumental when considered as a production. On today’s episode of the B&H Photography Podcast, we speak with Stephen Wilkes and Bette Wilkes—his wife, business manager, and the behind-the-scenes producer of these incredible photographs. Our conversation is easygoing and bounces back and forth between Mr. and Ms. Wilkes, emphasizing their intertwined working relationship. With Mr. Wilkes, we speak of the genesis of the project and the influences he finds in the paintings of the Dutch Masters and the Hudson River School. We also discuss his process, which is physically and technically demanding. He speaks of a desire to “get lost” in the moment and ultimately how his images are “a representation of his memory” from the day and place. With Ms. Wilkes, we speak of the knotty and time-consuming process of arranging a shoot that will last more than twenty-four continuous hours in some of the world’s busiest and most desolate locations. We discuss many photographs, but concentrate on two images from the Day to Night series to highlight their complicated productions—the first is a photograph of New York City’s Flatiron Building and, in the second half of the show, we visit a watering hole in the Serengeti Plain. To see these images, please visit our website, and, if you are in New York prior to October 26, 2019, check out the Day to Night exhibit at Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery. Guests: Stephen Wilkes and Bette Wilkes Photograph © Stephen Wilkes | On today’s episode of the  B&H Photography Podcast we take a deep dive into one bag and then into another one, and another. We welcome Jeannette Garcia and Yaakov Katz, two experts from the B&H SuperStore, to discuss the materials, capacities, features, and styles of  camera bags and  cases that are available today. We start with a simple question for each of them: what should one ask when purchasing a new camera bag? Both offer simple yet insightful answers to that question as they walk us down the path to finding the right camera bag for our needs. From  slings to  messenger bags,  holsters, and  pouches, we examine the differences in materials and mention the features that might serve one’s particular photographic application. \xa0 We also consider  rolling cases,  hard cases,  lens cases,  designer camera bags, and  inserts and run down a list of various brands to get feedback from Garcia and Katz, including several well-known bag companies that were founded by photographers, such as  Think Tank,  Tenba, and  Domke. Join us for this informative and enjoyable conversation. Guests: Jeannette Garcia and Yaakov Katz | With the anniversary of the September 11 attacks upon us again, those of us in New York City, particularly, think back to that terrible day with great sadness, but also with a certain resolve and a sense of pride for the way we handled this tragedy, how we came together to support each other while fear, confusion, and anger swarmed.\xa0Mostly, we remember the friends, neighbors, and co-workers who lost their lives, and the families forever broken. In September 2017, we published an episode of the B&H Photography Podcast with photojournalist Richard Drew who, like many photographers, raced to the scene of the terrorist attacks that morning, not knowing what to expect nor if they would even return alive. Drew captured the photo that for many encapsulated the horror of that day, so horrible that many outlets refused to print it, but with time, this image—now referred to as “Falling Man”—has become one of the iconic images of our still young century.\xa0 Today we will republish our conversation with Richard Drew in memory of all who suffered on that day and in tribute to the journalists who risked their lives to cover this story and to all of the first responders who began the long process of building back our city. Thank you. Guest: Richard Drew | We have been hosting the  B&H Photography Podcast Panasonic LUMIX S1 Sweepstakes for the past several weeks and, today, we are excited to announce the winners of the  LUMIX DC-S1 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 24-105mm lens and the  LUMIX DC-G95 Mirrorless Camera with a 12-60mm lens. With that in mind, we’d like to thank all of our listeners who left ratings and reviews on  Apple Podcasts, and particularly those who subscribed to the podcast and mentioned a favorite episode. This kind of feedback is well appreciated and helps us to develop the kind of episodes we hope you enjoy.\xa0 Before we make that announcement, however, Allan, Jason, and I reflect on our “photography New Year’s resolutions” and discuss our personal photography projects from 2019 and the gear we have been using to make them happen. We start with Allan, who discusses his year-long process of culling his archive of images going back to 1969, including finding what he refers to as the very first “Allan Weitz photo.”\xa0 He also explains how he uses his  Sony Alpha a7R II Mirrorless Digital Camera as his  “Franken-slide copier” and some of the gear that has impressed him this year, including the  7artisans Photoelectric 50mm f/1.1 lens and the  Zeiss Batis 40mm f/2 CF lens, and his thoughts on the just-announced  Leica M-E (Typ 240) Digital Rangefinder. John continues with a brief explanation of the resolutions on which he is procrastinating, and on his return to street photography and attempts to work with the  FUJIFILM X100F Digital Camera, the  Ricoh GR III, and the  Leica M Monochrom (Typ 246) Digital Rangefinder. Finally, Jason updates us on his telephoto cityscapes, his abstract portraiture, the Sony Clear Image Zoom function and whether or not he purchased the  Sony FE 100-400mm f/4.5-56 GM OSS lens. Join us for this enjoyable chat and check out some of the previous episodes of the podcast which we mention during this conversation, including our talks with  Jay Maisel and Stephen Wilkes, our discussion about  hard drives, and our talk with landscape photographer  Erin Babnik. | On this week’s episode of the  B&H Photography Podcast, we present two conversations from the 2019 OPTIC Photography Conference. Both chats are with photographers who understand the value of sharing their experiences and skills with other photographers and embracing the idea that to be a teacher is also a path for learning. Our first conversation is with travel and landscape photographer Elia Locardi, who is also well known for his photography tutorials with  Fstoppers, photo tours, and YouTube series on travel photography. With Locardi, we discuss the true value of travel photography and the connections to people and cultures that a camera can grant you. We also discuss how he balances his role as an educator with his personal photography. After a short break, we welcome photographer Alan Winslow to discuss his editorial and grant-funded photo projects, including a series in development that utilizes interactive technology and his own photography to inform viewers about threatened and endangered species. Winslow is also a FUJIFILM photographer who recently used the new  GFX 100 Medium Format Mirrorless Camera to shoot “alternative” landscapes in Yosemite National Park, and we hear his impressions of this camera. In addition to his photography clients, which include the New York Times and Forbes magazine, Winslow teaches at the International Center of Photography, The Maine Media Workshop, and NYCSalt. Balancing one’s own photography practice with making a living as a photography educator is becoming an ever more common practice and, on today’s episode, we gain an understanding of the challenges and benefits of this approach. Join us. Guests: Elia Locardi and Alan Winslow Photograph © Alan Winslow | Shiv Verma is a Panasonic LUMIX Global Ambassador, so it’s no coincidence that he is joining us to discuss the  LUMIX S1 Full-Frame Mirrorless Digital Camera—which is part of our  current sweepstakes—and other cameras in the LUMIX line, but Verma is also a multi-talented photographer and educator who offers insight into the subtle aspects of light and narrative, as well as the technical know-how to achieve your desired photographic results. We start our conversation relating a William Faulkner quote that Verma uses on his website, and this leads us to speculate on the nature of photography and how images can tell stories and inspire emotion. From there, we dig into Verma’s body of work to understand more clearly the threads that connect his range of styles and abilities. What connects his wildlife and bird photography to his landscapes and the professional and technical product photography he creates? We also delve into the skill sets needed for macro photography and his specialty… time-lapse photography. In-camera time-lapse capabilities were what initially drew Verma to the LUMIX line, and we discuss how this function has evolved from model to model and, in addition to relating his experience shooting with the LUMIX S1 and  S1R cameras, he provides insight into the best applications for the various LUMIX mirrorless cameras and lenses, including the  GH5 and  G9.\xa0 Join us for this informative episode and enter our  B&H Photography Podcast Panasonic LUMIX S1 Sweepstakes for a chance to win an S1 with 24-105mm lens or a  DC-G95 Mirrorless Camera with a 12-60mm lens.

For today’s episode, we present encore conversations with photographers Sisse Brimberg and Xyza Cruz Bacani. Sisse Brimberg is a veteran adventure and travel photographer who has more than thirty stories for National Geographic to her credit. Much of her work is devoted to historical and cultural stories, but our chat focuses on the informal portraiture she does in the streets, marketplaces, and country roads around the world. Brimberg relates how she is always “seeing” photographs, how she interacts with her subjects, and how to know when a photograph is worth taking. We also discuss her late husband and shooting partner, NatGeo photographer Cotton Coulson, and how her approach to work has changed since his death. Xyza Cruz Bacani, a Magnum Foundation fellow currently covering the civil unrest in Hong Kong, started taking photography seriously while employed as a domestic worker there. Her street photography blossomed into a career as a documentary photographer and photojournalist covering immigration, social justice, and human rights issues, but she still devotes time to “street.” We discuss the differences between the two disciplines, as well as her techniques and cameras and lens choices. Bacani has recently published the incredible book, We Are Like Air, about her mother and other migrant workers in Hong Kong. Join us for this insightful episode and don’t forget to enter our  sweepstakes and subscribe to the  B&H Photography Podcast. Guests: Sisse Brimberg and Xyza Cruz Bacani\xa0 | On this week’s episode of the B&H Photography Podcast, we welcome a true photography legend—curator, critic, and author, Vince Aletti.\xa0 Anyone who lived in New York in the 1980s and ’90s, and is interested in photography, will know of Aletti as the photography critic at the Village Voice. He went on to review photo exhibitions at The New Yorker until 2016. He has also curated exhibitions at the International Center of Photography and White Columns gallery, and has authored many books, including his latest,  Issues: A History of Photography in Fashion Magazines, which he joins us to discuss. In addition to his writing and curating, Aletti is a collector, and has created a collection of the most important issues of fashion magazines from the past 100 years. The book,  Issues, employs that collection to offer a history of fashion photography as it was meant to be viewed—in magazines, and our conversation focuses on the context of the magazine as “the ideal delivery system” for the best photography of several generations. We discuss the beginning of fashion magazines and introduction of photography to that format and we spend time discussing the work of Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, and Steven Meisel by looking at issues of magazines for which they were the primary, if not sole, photographer. The production of these magazines—Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue Italia, The Face, for example—are mentioned, as are the creative directors, editors, and stylists, but the point of this enlightening conversation (and Aletti’s book) is how great photographers have used the specific format of the fashion magazine for their ground-breaking and ever-evolving images. Today also marks the beginning of the  B&H Photography Podcast Panasonic LUMIX S1 Sweepstakes.\xa0 Follow the above link for the rules and entry guidelines and you’ll have two chances to win a new  Panasonic LUMIX DC-S1 Full-Frame Mirrorless digital camera with 24-105mm lens or a  Panasonic LUMIX DC-G95 Mirrorless digital camera with 12-60mm lens. Also, look for the upcoming special episode of our podcast with Panasonic Lumix Global Ambassador Shiv Verma. Guest: Vince Aletti Photograph by Erwin Blumenfeld.

In an era of punk decadence, Talking Heads created a pop revolution by combining tight, funk-based rhythms, a clean-cut image, and themes of anxiety and social isolation. Kurt brings up the early song “I’m Not in Love,” in which Byrne wonders, “Do people really fall in love?” “I was just asking all the most super-obvious questions,” explains Byrne, who has said that he may have had Asperger’s syndrome as a young person. “Why do humans, people, we do these things?

Scientists have long thought that it emerged three billion years ago in the ocean -- until astrobiologist Tara Djokic and her team made an unexpected discovery in the western Australian desert.

In a talk that\'s equal parts passionate and hilarious, he shows how studying, preserving and inventing new languages helps us understand our collective humanity -- and gives a quick lesson on High Valyrian, one of two languages he created for "Game of Thrones" (along with Dothraki). "Language is not merely a tool," he says. "It is our legacy, it\'s our way of conveying what it means to be human." | Traditional thinking on corruption goes like this: if you put good laws in place and enforce them well, then economic development increases and corruption falls. In reality, we have the equation backwards, says innovation researcher Efosa Ojomo. In this compelling talk, he offers new thinking on how we could potentially eliminate corruption worldwide by focusing on one thing: scarcity. "Societies don\'t develop because they\'ve reduced corruption," he says. "They\'re able to reduce corruption because they\'ve developed." | With fascinating research and hilarious anecdotes, neuroscientist Camilla Arndal Andersen takes us into the lab where she studies people\'s sense of taste via brain scans. She reveals surprising insights about the way our brains subconsciously experience food -- and shows how this data could help us eat healthier without sacrificing taste. | The US health care system assumes many things about patients: that they can take off from work in the middle of the day, speak English, have a working telephone and a steady supply of food. Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US. In this eye-opening talk, he shares stories of the challenges low-income patients face -- and how we can build a better system for all. | Conservationist and TED Fellow Moreangels Mbizah studied the famous Cecil the lion until he was shot by a trophy hunter in 2015. She wonders how things could\'ve gone differently, asking: "What if the community that lived next to Cecil was involved in protecting him?" In a quick talk, Mbizah shares the state of conservation in her home of Zimbabwe -- and why she thinks that communities living with wildlife are the ones best positioned to help them. | The average farmer in America makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store. They feed our communities, but farmers often cannot afford the very foods they grow. In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line. "We\'re not the goal of evolution," Chakrabarty says. "Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds. Learn how Dr. King has ignited a worldwide movement to create tobacco-free investments and how each of us can play a role in ending this epidemic. | "Building a 30-foot-high concrete structure from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security," says Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican from Texas whose district encompasses two times zones and shares an 820-mile border with Mexico. Speaking from Washington, DC in a video interview with former state attorney general Anne Milgram, Hurd discusses the US government\'s border policy and its controversial detention and child separation practices -- and lays out steps toward a better future at the border.
