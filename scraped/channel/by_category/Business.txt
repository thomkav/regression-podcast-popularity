"I was like, what is this?" he remembers saying. "I am never shaving again—ever." He soon discovered that like him, many men of color were frustrated by the lack of shaving products for coarse or curly hair. Fifteen years after that first disastrous shave, and after countless meetings with doubtful investors, Tristan launched Bevel, a subscription shaving system built around a single-blade razor. Eventually his brand Walker & Company grew to include 36 hair and beauty products, used by millions of men and women across the U.S. In 2018, Walker & Company was sold to Proctor & Gamble, and Tristan became P&G\'s first black CEO. Recorded live in Washington, D.C. | Andy Puddicombe is not your typical entrepreneur – in his early twenties, he gave away everything he owned to train as a Buddhist monk. But after ten years, he decided he wanted to bring the benefits of his meditation techniques to more people. While running a meditation clinic in London, Andy met Rich Pierson, who had burned out on his job at a high-powered London ad agency. Together, they founded Headspace in 2010. Nine years later, Headspace\'s guided meditation app has users in 190 countries and an annual revenue of over $100 million. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," how a quick fix to a broken pair of sunglasses inspired Jensen Brehm and Nikolai Paloni to create an armless set of shades: Ombraz Sunglasses. | In 2010, Katrina Lake recruited 20 friends for an experiment: she wanted to see if she could choose clothes for them that accurately matched their style and personality. That idea sparked Stitch Fix, an online personal shopping service that aims to take the guesswork out of shopping. Today, it has about three million customers and brings in more than a billion dollars in annual revenue. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," we check back with Justin Li, who created wearable equipment to keep cool and hydrated called IcePlate. | In the late 1980s, Curt Jones was working in a Kentucky lab, using liquid nitrogen to flash-freeze animal feed. He wondered if he could re-invigorate his favorite dessert by pouring droplets of ice cream into a vat of liquid nitrogen and – voila! – out came cold and creamy pellets that he soon branded Dippin\' Dots. The novelty treat spread to fairs, stadiums and shopping malls, and eventually grew into a multi-million dollar brand. But a few years ago, Curt was forced to walk away after the company was hit with debt, recession and a punishing lawsuit. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," how Nadine Habayeb  hopes to popularize puffed water lily seeds from India with her snack brand Bohana. | In the late 80s, brothers Bert and John Jacobs were living as nomads, traveling from college to college selling t-shirts out of their van. It wasn\'t a sustainable living – until one day, they created a new design. It was a simple sketch of a grinning face, with three words printed underneath: Life Is Good. The optimistic message was deeply personal to the brothers, who grew up in what they describe as a dysfunctional home – and it also resonated with customers, who started buying Life Is Good designs printed on just about anything, from towels to tire covers. Today, the Life Is Good Company has a reported annual revenue of $100 million. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," Jim Malone of CounterEv Furniture describes how he turns reclaimed wood from bowling alleys into tables and chairs for fast-casual restaurants. | Cotton muslin baby blankets are commonplace in Australia, where Raegan Moya-Jones grew up. But when she started a new life and family in NYC, she couldn\'t find them anywhere. So in 2006, she started the baby blanket company Aden + Anais, which now makes more than $100 million in annual revenue. We first ran this episode in 2017 – but about a year later, Raegan\'s role as leader and co-founder took a dramatic turn. She fills Guy in on what happened in this special updated episode. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," we check back with Brian Sonia-Wallace, who started the business Rent Poet, and makes a living writing spontaneous poetry at weddings, corporate events, and other gatherings. | In 1983, two hippie farmers decided to sell homemade organic yogurt to help raise money for their educational farm in New Hampshire. As the enterprise grew into a business, it faced one near-death experience after another, but it never quite died. In fact it grew — into one of the most popular yogurt brands in the US. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," we check back with Carin Luna-Ostaseski, who became the first American woman to start a Scotch whisky company after she created her own blend called SIA Scotch. | After high school, Marcia Kilgore moved to New York City with $300 in her pocket and no real plan. One step at a time, she became a successful serial entrepreneur. First, she used her high school bodybuilding experience to find work as a personal trainer. Then she taught herself to give facials, and eventually started her own spa and skincare line, Bliss. The spa became so popular that it was booked months in advance with a list of celebrity clientele. After selling her shares in Bliss, Marcia went on to start four new successful companies: Soap & Glory, FitFlop, Soaper Duper, and Beauty Pie. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," we check back with Emma Cohen, who explains how she helped develop and market The Final Straw, a collapsible metal drinking straw. | In 2004, German programmer Tobias Lütke was living in Ottawa with his girlfriend. An avid snowboarder, he wanted to launch an online snowboard shop, but found the e-commerce software available at the time to be clunky and expensive. So he decided to write his own e-commerce software. After he launched his online snowboard business, called Snowdevil, other online merchants were so impressed with what he built that they started asking to license Tobi\'s software to run their own stores. Tobi and his co-founder realized that software had more potential than snowboards, so they launched the e-commerce platform Shopify in 2006.  Since then, it has grown into a publicly-traded company with over 4,000 employees and $1 billion in revenue. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," after Barb Heilman invented a device that easily releases child car seat buckles, she started a business with her daughter Becca Davison called Unbuckle Me. | Angie and Dan Bastian weren\'t trying to disrupt an industry or build a massive company – they just wanted to put aside some money for their kids\' college fund. In 2001, Dan stumbled across an internet ad touting kettle corn as a lucrative side-business, so he and Angie decided to take the plunge, investing $10,000 in equipment. At first, they popped kettle corn in front of local supermarkets in the Twin Cities and at Minnesota Vikings games. Eventually, they moved indoors to Trader Joe\'s, Target, and Costco – and got a crash course in how to run a business along the way. Angie\'s Kettle Corn eventually took on a bold new name: BOOMCHICKAPOP. And in 2017, the company was acquired for a reported $250 million.

Among other things, they will be investigating the effectiveness of psychedelics as a new therapy for opioid addiction, Alzheimer\'s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (formerly known as chronic Lyme disease), anorexia nervosa and alcohol use in people with major depression. The researchers hope to create precision medicine treatments tailored to individual patients’ specific needs.I couldn’t be happier, and it wouldn’t have happened without generous support from Steven and Alexandra Cohen (@cohengive), Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt), Blake Mycoskie (@blakemycoskie), and Craig Nerenberg. Many thanks also to Benedict Carey of the New York Times (@bencareynyt) for investigating and reporting on this from multiple perspectives, as he’s done for many years.As some of you know, I shifted most of my focus from startup investing to this field in 2015, and it’s incredibly important to me that this watershed announcement helps to catalyze more studies, more ambitious centers, more scientists entering the field, and more philanthropists and sources of funding taking a close look at psychedelic science. To that end, it’s critical that more people realize there is much more reputational upside than reputational risk in supporting this work in 2019 and beyond. To broadcast this as widely as possible, I have one offer and one sincere ask:THE OFFER — If you’re involved with media and would like to learn more about the center or speak with the key scientists involved, please visit this contact page.THE ASK — Please share the New York Times articles (here is one tweet) or the announcement. Whatever you can do to spread the word is most appreciated! The short link tim.blog/nyt will also forward to one of the NYT articles.On this press conference, I am joined by Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., who initiated the psilocybin research program at Johns Hopkins almost 20 years ago, leading the first studies investigating the effects of its use by healthy volunteers. His pioneering work led to the consideration of psilocybin as a therapy for serious health conditions. Griffiths recruited and trained the center faculty in psychedelic research as well.\xa0Also participating is Matthew Johnson, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science, who has expertise in drug addictions and behavioral economic decision-making, and has conducted psychedelic research at Johns Hopkins since 2004 (with well over 100 publications). He has led studies that show psilocybin can treat nicotine addiction. Johnson will lead two new clinical trials and will be associate director of the new center.\xa0The conference was moderated by Audrey Huang, Ph.D., a media relations director at Johns Hopkins.Additional resources:\xa0Johns Hopkins Opens New Center for Psychedelic Research (New York Times)\xa0Tim Ferriss, the Man Who Put His Money Behind Psychedelic Medicine (New York Times)\xa0Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research (Official website)\xa0Johns Hopkins Launches Center For Psychedelic Research (Johns Hopkins Newsroom)\xa0Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research Contact Form***For show notes and past guests, please visit tim.blog/podcast.Sign up for Tim’s email newsletter (“5-Bullet Friday”) at tim.blog/friday.For transcripts of episodes, go to tim.blog/transcripts.Discover Tim’s books: tim.blog/books.Follow Tim:\xa0Twitter: twitter.com/tferriss\xa0Instagram: instagram.com/timferrissFacebook: facebook.com/timferriss\xa0YouTube: youtube.com/timferriss | "Your head\'s for having ideas, not for holding them." — David AllenDavid Allen (@gtdguy) is one of the world\'s most influential thinkers on productivity, and his 35 years of experience as a management consultant and executive coach have earned him the titles of "personal productivity guru" by Fast Company, one of America\'s top five executive coaches by Forbes, and among The American Management Association\'s top 10 business leaders.David\'s bestselling book, the groundbreaking Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, has been published in thirty languages, and the "GTD" methodology it describes has become a global phenomenon, being taught by training companies in 60 countries.

Motherhood changes your drive and focus, it alters the way you see things that were once priorities, it shifts your flow in life and business, it makes other people view you through a new lense, too…\xa0 Katrina Scott knows what it’s like to navigate motherhood as a business owner, lifestyle celebrity, and public figure. Katrina Scott is the co-founder of Tone It Up -- If you’re into fitness and have ever been on the internet, you’ve undoubtedly heard of Tone It Up.\xa0 She’s a new mom just like me, and we’re both learning to navigate life and business with little babes on our hips.

When you\'re the one running the show, it can feel impossible to hand over even a little bit of the reigns. It could be a time thing (who has the TIME to hire and train someone?) or it could be a trust thing… Like who could actually do the thing just as good as you? I get it because I\'ve felt ALL of these emotions. I was gripping onto my business with white knuckles to the point where I just felt straight up fatigued, but at least I was handling it all myself, right? …Wrong.\xa0 This episode will help you identify if you’re ready to outsource and walk you through how to start outsourcing in a way that doesn’t scare you.

We use the terms interchangeably but understanding the difference between the two, and knowing how our emotions impact our lives, inform our decisions, and lead our success, isn’t innate knowledge we’re born with…we’ve gotta learn.

Yup, it’s possible.\xa0 You might be thinking, "Oh, she has a huge team of people to help her," or "She\'s already made a bunch of courses so she\'s way ahead of me."\xa0 Yes, I have created courses before, and I did have help from ONE team member, but this is a feat that is totally reachable and doable for you to achieve, too, even if you don\'t have a team or experience creating courses.

Maybe you’re new to the idea altogether… Maybe you’ve never taken a full step back to look at your own genius to consider, “Hey, maybe I could do that, too.” I know that mindset, I know that feeling of curiosity and fear.\xa0 Before I even launched my email list, my inner dialog probably sounded a lot like yours.

And then I threw my credit card at the course after sitting in on a webinar and I committed myself fully to the program. Now, I’m really proud of the fact that I’m one of the success stories... my business flourished because of this mentor’s teachings, and we’re now we’re great pals to boot.\xa0 In today’s episode, I’ll walk you through how one course changed things for me and how I approach taking online courses so I get results every single time.

Ulrich is the coauthor, along with Tencent senior advisor Arthur Yeung, of “Reinventing the Organization: How Companies Can Deliver Radically Greater Value in Fast-Changing Markets.” | Nir Eyal, an expert on technology and psychology, says that we all need to learn to be less distracted into activities that don\'t help us achieve what we want to each day. Unwelcome behaviors can range from social media scrolling and bingeing on YouTube videos to chatting with colleagues or answering non-urgent emails. To break these habits, we start by recognizing that it is often our own emotions, not our devices, that distract us. We must then recognize the difference between traction (values-aligned work or leisure) and distraction (not) and make time in our schedules for more of the former.

He says that a coaching relationship moves beyond mentoring or sponsoring in that it focuses on long-term values and aspirations.

Boyatzis is coauthor of the HBR article "Coaching for Change." | Oliver Hart, Nobel-winning Harvard economist, and Kate Vitasek, faculty at the University of Tennessee, argue that many business contracts are imperfect, no matter how bulletproof you try to make them. Especially in complicated relationships such as outsourcing, one side ends up feeling like they\'re getting a bad deal, and it can spiral into a tit for tat battle. Hart and Vitasek argue that companies should instead adopt so-called relational contracts. Their research shows that creating a general playbook built around principles like fairness and reciprocity offers greater benefits to both businesses. Hart and Vitasek, with the Swedish attorney David Frydlinger, cowrote the HBR article "A New Approach to Contracts." | Laura Morgan Roberts, professor at the University of Virginia\'s Darden School of Business, says that organizations are still falling short on promoting racial diversity, particularly in their most senior ranks. While many large companies have "inclusion" initiatives, most leaders still shy away from frank discussions about how the experiences of their black employees and executives -- including their feelings of authenticity and potential for advancement -- differ from those of their white peers.

The key is to tease apart the different challenges -- from coping with feelings of loss to managing practicalities -- and to adopt strategies to better guide you through each. She points out that while a lot of emphasis is placed on parental leave, and especially new mothers, people at all stages of parenting need practical, immediate, and effective solutions they can implement themselves.

Is it only worldwide influencers who make 9-figures that should feel good about themselves & their lives? Or can you feel great about life if you\'re a blue collar worker, a teacher, or someone who doesn\'t even earn $45,000 in income? Whether it\'s people who think "happiness is the new rich" or people who equate being famous with being impactful, there\'s a lot of confusion out there about how to evaluate the worth of a job & the value of a human life. | Are you "woke?" That\'s a phrase that\'s thrown around a lot these days. Sometimes it\'s used in politics to talk about people who say they really care about racism & injustice & sometimes it\'s used for dudes who think they\'ve uncovered a worldwide conspiracy that nobody else knows about! But what does it really mean to be "woke," to have your eyes opened to what life is all about & what it takes to be happy & successful? | I recently had a friend admit to me that he didn\'t feel "worthy of success." The reality is...a lot of people feel like that. They feel like a fraud. They feel like they are running behind. They feel like there is some "secret formula" that\'s complicated & too sophisticated for them to understand. Listen...all of us feel lost & like we don\'t know what we\'re doing. In this episode, I talk about how to overcome that & we share OG stories about the early days of MFCEO. (Oh...& we announce contest winners!) | What is the key to ultimate happiness? Ask most people in the culture today & they\'ll say "the freedom to do whatever you want" & to indulge yourself any way you want...to live a life of leisure, comfort, ease, whatever. The reality is, that is absolutely, 100 percent dead wrong. In fact, the answer is pretty much the exact opposite of that. In this episode, I talk about the key to ultimate happiness & why it\'s ---not coincidentally--the key principle of my program, 75Hard. | Most people just don\'t understand how simple it is to advance in your career & climb the ladder of success all the way to the top. They think there\'s something mystical about it, something beyond their control, & that they have to be "chosen" to become the elite leaders of business & society. But the reality is, it\'s not hocus pocus or complex & complicated at all. There are 4 steps...4 concrete, actionable steps...that *anyone* can take to start moving up in the world NOW. | This is a message to anybody who is frustrated with some aspect of your life...whether your frustration is with your business, or a relationship, or your fitness...or whatever! There are two realizations you must have before success will materialize for you, & when I tell you what they are, you\'re probably going to say "well, no sh!t"...but I guarantee you\'re not really acting on these realizations.\xa0When you do...& I\'m going to tell you how...things will go far, far better for you. | Everybody wants to be happy. Everybody wants to be successful. So why isn\'t everyone happy & successful? The truth is, it\'s not because people aren\'t willing to work hard. A ton of people in the world work hard & are still not happy & successful. The problem is in how they approach the work. In this episode, I talk about why choosing the hardest path possible is a good idea & the incredible thing that happens when you push yourself beyond your limits. \xa0 \xa0 | So many of you are good people who genuinely want to kill it in your business & life, but a ton of the advice you are getting on the internet...on Instagram & YouTube & on all the podcasts by the success gurus & "business coaches"...well, it\'s f*cking terrible & really counterproductive to your success. There are three pieces of advice in particular that are the worst. In this episode, I tell you what they are & actually provide the right advice, so you can make the impact & money you really want to make. | What really does make America...and YOU...great? I\'ve been reading a ton of U.S. history, & I\'ve learned more about the most incredible men & women our country has ever produced. It\'s been so impactful to me that I created a course called UNITED WE WIN: 7 Lessons in Excellence and Success From the Greatest Americans of All Time. The full course will only be available to my email subscribers, but I\'m publishing the first lesson as a gift to you for Independence Day. Happy 4th of July, Mother F*ckers! | If you completed 75Hard - I introduced it in episode 290 - you know it\'s the program I created for winning the war against yourself & developing the kind of mental toughness that makes anything possible for you. You know it\'s changed your life & you\'ll never be the same. But you might be asking yourself..."now what? Where do I go from here?

I’ve always been a huge fan of personality assessments. DISC, Myers-Briggs, StrengthsFinder—they all fascinate me. I love reading the results of these different assessments because they’re usually pretty positive. You get an entire report that focuses on your strengths—who wouldn’t have fun reading that? Well, earlier this year, my friend Rachel Cruze convinced me to take a different kind of personality assessment: the Enneagram. I took the test, not expecting to learn anything new about myself. But y’all, I was so wrong. This assessment was so different from any other I’d ever taken. Rather than telling me what I was good at, this assessment revealed all of my weaknesses (Some I didn’t even know I had!), and the deeper motivations and fears associated with those weaknesses. Related:  Ep 79: Take Control of Your Life With the Power of Personal Responsibility Not only did I feel like there was finally a personality assessment that truly understood me, but I also felt like it helped me understand myself better. Learning about the Enneagram has been transformational for me. It’s made me so much more self-aware. And you know what? Knowing your weaknesses and being self-aware is one of the best gifts you can give to both yourself and those around you. What Is Self-Awareness? Being self-aware is about knowing your strengths and your weaknesses. For example, self-awareness is about knowing how you come across to others—not just your intentions, but how you actually come across. I’ve noticed a pattern in my life where people describe me as being intense and aggressive. But here’s the thing: I don't intend to be aggressive, and I don't think I'm intense. I describe myself as enthusiastic and passionate. I’d never use the words intense or aggressive. But you know what? After hearing enough people use those words to describe me, I started to pay attention. It turns out, intense and aggressive is how I come across to other people. Do you know what paying attention to those patterns did for me? It gave me a better understanding of how I actually come across to people so I could learn to adjust my tone, behavior or volume level based on who I'm talking to. It’s pretty easy to be self-aware when it comes to our strengths, isn’t it? And it’s important to know what your strengths are so you can leverage them in your life and your business. But I want to spend this episode talking about the other side of the coin: what we should do with the not-so-good stuff. Three Ways to Become More Self-Aware We all have blind spots. You know what a blind spot is, right? Think about when you're driving in the car and want to change lanes. You slowly start to get over and all of a sudden you’re swerving back into your lane while someone blares their horn at you because you almost hit them. But you had no idea the car was there—it was in your blind spot. And that's exactly what our weaknesses can be like for us—we’re not even aware they exist. But if we’re going to succeed in life and business, we have to be as familiar with our weaknesses as we are with our strengths. So, let’s talk about three things you should do with your weaknesses: 1. Recognize your weaknesses. I spent so many years unaware that I can come across as aggressive or intense—it was definitely one of my blind spots. If we want to mature, improve our relationships, and become more pleasant people, we have to recognize exactly what our weaknesses are so that we can work on them (more on that later). So how can you recognize some of your own blind spots?  Pay attention to patterns and themes around what people say about you. If you don't notice a pattern, ask people you love and trust. Take a personality assessment like the Enneagram or DISC.  2. Acknowledge your weaknesses. Once you recognize your weaknesses, I want you to call them out. Own them and be up-front about them. That's not to say you have to broadcast your weaknesses to the world, but when you sense you’re acting out of a weakness or you’re coming across in a negative way, go ahead and call it out. If you’re with someone, acknowledge it so they don't have to. Related:  Say What They're Thinking Here's what's so amazing about this: When you acknowledge that you’re aware of your weakness, it completely disarms the other person. They feel immediate relief because they no longer feel the pressure to call you out. If you simply acknowledge where you're coming from and the weaknesses that are influencing your reaction, it's amazing how beneficial it will be to yourself and the other person. 3. Work on your weaknesses. Being self-aware of your weaknesses doesn’t mean you’re off the hook to act however you want to act. You don’t get to use your weakness as a pass for your behavior. If your weakness is time management, and you acknowledge that, you don’t get an automatic excuse to be late everywhere you go. If you struggle with a short temper, you don’t get to say, “This is just who I am,” every time you blow up on someone. We all need to work on our weaknesses, mature, and become better human beings in the world. But we can't do that if we don't actively work on our weaknesses. For me, I’m learning to be quiet, submit and respect authority, apologize more quickly, and let others lead. So, what weakness do you need to take personal responsibility for? What do you need to commit to working on this week? Friend, there’s no shame in this. You’ll improve every relationship and interaction in your life when you work on weaknesses. Related:  Ep 82: Succeed at Anything By Understanding the Importance of Discipline Working on your weaknesses is a long and difficult journey. But if you will commit to recognizing them, acknowledging them, and working on them, I promise you’ll not only become a more self-aware person, but you’ll also become a more mature, well-rounded, and pleasant person to be around. Becoming Self-Aware Through the Enneagram with Ian Cron I'm so excited to introduce you to my guest today, Ian Cron! He’s the bestselling author of The Road Back to You (a book I personally love that has transformed my life) and a master teacher of the Enneagram. On this episode, Ian and I talk about:  How the Enneagram is different from other personality assessments The difference between self-knowledge and self-awareness The importance of being aware of your weaknesses and the underlying motivations How to navigate relationships with people who aren’t self-aware  Challenge: It’s Not the Thought That Counts As a speaker and author, I'm always trying to find ways to say something unique. I want to say something new that hasn't been said before because—let’s be honest—the world is full of overused cliché phrases. Let's just go through a few examples, shall we? Finish these sentences in your head: Where there's a will, there's a . . . Don't put all your eggs in one . . . It's the thought that . . . Here's the thing about these cliché phrases: Most of them are overused because they're true—except that last one. Who came up with “It's the thought that counts?” And who’s used the phrase so much it’s lived on for centuries? I'll tell you who: People who don't do anything. “Oh, it's the thought that counts,” said every person ever who hasn’t followed through on their intentions. It's not the thought that counts. My husband's birthday is coming up, and there’s not a chance in the world he’ll be bragging the day after his birthday about what I thought about doing for him. He’s not going to be like, “Oh, my wife, she was going to get us tickets to my favorite concert, but she never got around to it. She never made reservations for dinner or booked a babysitter. But hey, she thought about it!” Related:  Ep 34: Excuses That Steal Your Time Speaking of cliché quotes: The road to hell is paved with good intentions! No one cares what you think about. They care what you do. Your thoughts don’t change your relationships. Your actions do. Your thoughts don’t change your business. Your actions do. Your thoughts don’t reach your goals. Your actions do. So, here's the deal: It’s not the thought that counts. It's what you do that counts. It doesn't matter what you know. It matters what you do with what you know. Do you have an idea? Great. What are you going to do about it? Do you have a dream? Great. What are you going to do about it? Do you have a plan? Great. What are you going to do about it? Y'all, when you actually start to take action on your ideas, implement what you're learning, and do something with what you know, feel and dream in your heart, you really will be chasing your dream. You really will be building a business. You really will be creating a legacy. You really will be making an impact and changing the world. Stop thinking about it and go do it. | Succeed at Anything By Understanding the Importance of Discipline  1:21\xa0What Is Discipline? 5:05 What Does Daily Discipline Look Like? 14:14 How to Become More Disciplined 20:42 Maximizing Social Media for Your Business With Jasmine Star 40:56 Challenge to Just Be You  Resources Business Boutique Conference The Business Boutique Conference is coming back to Nashville Oct. 24–26.

I have a lot of feelings—even my feelings have feelings. The worst part is, my feelings can easily drive my actions. But you know what I’ve learned? If you build your business, your life, your dreams, or your goals based on feelings, you’re going to be on one heck of a roller-coaster ride. One day you’ll be up (excited, motivated and charging forward) and another day you'll be down (tired, disappointed and on the brink of quitting). That's why I think it’s so important to talk about a skill that will help you create stability (something feelings don’t have) as you reach for your goals and chase your dream. What’s that skill? Discipline. I know, discipline is not an exciting topic. In fact, the word itself can have a negative connotation. You might think of the word in terms of disciplining your children or being disciplined in school or at work. But that’s not the kind of discipline we’re talking about. We’re talking about being a disciplined person. Why is discipline important? Because discipline will help you be successful no matter what dream you’re chasing—it’s that simple. Related:  Ep 58: Perseverance in Your Business: How to Keep Going When You Want to Give Up What Is Discipline? Like so many qualities I teach about, discipline is not a gene only some people are born with. Discipline is a choice and a skill you can learn. You can actually cultivate discipline in your own life, even if you don’t feel like it comes naturally to you. The author Stephen King is a great example of this. He’s written countless bestselling books— many of which have become box office hits. He says there is one reason behind his success. You guessed it: discipline. In fact, he doesn't even believe in writer's block. He says it's just an excuse writers use when they don't have any motivation to write. Talk about some tough love. Stephen King writes 10 pages a day, even on birthdays and holidays. While you definitely won’t find me working on Thanksgiving or Christmas, I love the emphasis he places on the importance of discipline in making your dream a reality. I believe your success is not dependent upon your situation, your feelings, or how nice the weather is. It's dependent upon your level of discipline. I love how my friend Christine Caine puts it: Vision will inspire you, but discipline will get you there. What Does Daily Discipline Look Like? When you break it down, discipline in your day-to-day life is pretty straightforward. It looks like:  Following through on what you said you were going to do, even when you don’t want to Holding yourself accountable, even when no one is watching Honoring your word, even when your heart’s not in it Sticking to the plan, even when you’re not motivated Keeping promises you made to yourself, even when you’re exhausted Getting back up and dusting yourself off, even when you’ve failed Choosing to be the person you want to be over the person you feel like being, even when you’re in a tough situation  That sounds nice, doesn’t it? Related:  Ep 79: Take Control of Your Life With the Power of Personal Responsibility Y’all, it is possible to be this kind of person. That’s why I want to give you three practical ways you can become more disciplined in your daily life.\xa0 How to Become More Disciplined 1. Take the first step. When someone isn’t motivated to do something they want to do, I always encourage them to find the lowest-hanging fruit or the quickest win. Starting with big goals can be overwhelming—and feeling overwhelmed before you start is enough to make you not even try. Related:  Ep 78: How to Be Successful at Anything by Starting Small That’s why I want you to set small, realistic goals. For example, instead of saying you’re going to clean the entire house today (which would overwhelm anyone!), just start by putting away the laundry. What's amazing about taking one, small step is that once you start, you gain momentum. And that momentum propels you to take the second step. Once you put the laundry away, you’ll have enough momentum to tackle the dirty dishes. And after the dishes, you’ll naturally start cleaning the counters. Eventually, you’ll do more than you originally set out to do! Sometimes the tiniest step in a new direction is all you need to gain incredible momentum. 2. Set yourself up to win. This is really key for anyone who wants to be successful. Oftentimes, we set a goal or talk about a dream, but then we put ourselves in situations where we’re bound to fail. If you have a goal to eat fewer sweets, you probably shouldn’t keep mint Oreos in your pantry. If you need to work on your business more often, you should probably create an organized environment that gets you excited to work. If you want to exercise more often, maybe you oughta sleep in your workout clothes or set them out the night before. When you set yourself up to win, you make it possible to be a disciplined person. 3. Find accountability. Having accountability goes hand in hand with setting yourself up to win. If you want to work out more, join a workout group. If you want to become a better writer, join a writers meet-up. If you want accountability to read more, join a book club. So, what are your goals? What are your plans? In what area are you trying to become more disciplined? Surround yourself with people who have those same dreams and goals and who will support you, provide accountability, and cheer you on. The bottom line is this: Discipline is a decision you make. It's not a feeling or a gene. And it's not something negative that will make you miserable. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. Discipline is a tool and a skill that will truly get you to where you want to be. Cultivating Discipline With Dave Ramsey My guest today is a living example of the importance of discipline. Dave Ramsey is a New York Times bestselling author, host of The Dave Ramsey Show, CEO of Ramsey Solutions, and an unbelievable mentor and leader to me and so many others. Discipline is foundational to just about everything Dave teaches. Because, at the end of the day, discipline is what it takes to win at anything in life. On this episode, Dave and I talk about:  How different personality styles relate to discipline How to stay motivated when what you’re doing isn’t impressive or exciting What discipline looks like tactically and practically Why it’s important to believe in yourself when cultivating discipline  Challenge: Giving Credit as a Discipline Let’s talk about a trend I keep seeing all over social media. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been scrolling through Instagram or Twitter and noticed a catchy graphic, great quote or some other form of memorable content. Later in the day (or even a few days later), I'll be scrolling again and see that same piece of content reposted by someone else without giving credit to the person they copied it from. The post will have the same design, the same graphic, and even the same words. Now, here's the thing: I know when you see something on social media that really catches your eye, it's tempting to want to share it with your followers. And I think you should! But I want to give you a challenge. I want to challenge you to have the discipline to do a little digging to find out where that quote or content came from so you can give credit where credit is due. Or at least acknowledge that you don't know where the content originated, but that you didn’t create it. I'm not really interested in how not giving credit will hurt the person who originally created the content. I'm more interested in what it does to you and other people's perception of you. Because let me tell you, when your followers see a post you’ve shared that you didn’t create, more likely than not, they’ll know. After all, they’ve probably already seen it five other times on their social media feed! That’s why I want to challenge you to have the integrity and discipline to either create your own content or give credit when you share someone else’s. Related:  Ep 51: How to Build Trust With Your Social Media Followers You are in control of what you put out into the world, and the impression and perception you create online is massively important.

If you have a\xa0success story you would like to share\xa0with the Business Boutique community, email me at podcast@businessboutique.com. New podcast episodes are available every other week.  Let's be honest: Social media is hard to balance. Most of us have a love-hate relationship with it, right? We love to check Instagram and know what's going on. But then we hate ourselves for wanting to check it all the time. When we open Facebook multiple times a day, we feel guilty for not paying more attention to our kids or our work. So, we swing between two extremes: being on social media all the time or feeling like we can't be on it at all. That's why I think it’s so important to talk about how to balance social media. Because the truth is, social media in and of itself isn’t evil. It's all in how we use it. In fact, social media has a ton of great benefits:  It allows you to stay connected with family and friends who live far away. It gives you a place to share exciting updates—from new babies to new homes. It's like having a giant virtual album of multiple years of your life. It allows you to connect with different groups of people who have similar passions. When it comes to your business, it’s free marketing!  I want you to take advantage of these awesome benefits, but I still want to encourage you to build healthy boundaries around your screen time so it doesn’t consume your life. Here are Five Ways You Can Create a Healthy Balance with Social Media: 1. Know when not to use it. There are times to use social media, and there are times not to use social media. Some examples of times you shouldn’t use it are when you’re:  Having dinner with your family On a date with your spouse Having lunch with a friend In the middle of any kind of conversation with another human being  Related:  Ep 70: How to Be Content in Every Situation\xa0 When you check social media while someone is trying to spend quality time with you, you communicate that they're not as important as whatever is happening on your phone. To avoid the temptation to even look down at your phone when you’re spending time with someone, put it out of sight completely. Before you take out your phone to check what everyone else is doing or to post what you’re doing, you can also ask yourself some important questions like:  Is it more important that I know what everyone else is doing right now, or is it more important that I experience what I’m doing? Is it more important that the outside world knows what I'm doing right now, or is it more important that I experience it myself?  I’m willing to bet, almost every single time, these questions are no-brainers. So put your phone down. Keep it in your purse or your pocket and be where your feet are. Be present in the moment. 2. Pick your\xa0balance. I can give you all the tips and tricks to balance social media, but at the end of the day, you have to decide the types of boundaries you need. You have to decide what time you're on and what time you're off, and what times you're responsive and what times you're unresponsive. I don't want to be the person who’s available 24/7, blasting out every single thing I do. But I also don't want to be a person who's not present on social media at all. We’re all different—that’s why we all have to figure out the balance that’s right for us. 3. Check yourself. This is simply accountability. It's easy to set goals and put up guard rails around what you want to do. You can have great intentions, but it’s so easy to fall back into bad habits. That’s why I love the screen time feature that’s available on most phones. You can get a report at the end of every week that lets you know how much time you spent on your phone over the past few days. It’s an eye-opener. Y'all, I dare you to check what your average screen time was this week. Does it fit within the boundaries you want to set? Check yourself and keep yourself accountable to the life you want to live. 4. Don’t mix business with personal. Normally, I talk about this in terms of your bank accounts: Don't mix your business finances with your personal finances. But you don't want to mix your social media usage either. Of course, you should post some personal stuff on your business page and some business stuff on your personal page. What I'm talking about here is getting on social media to post for your business and then two hours later, you're scrolling through cat memes and stalking your ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend. This is where we get sucked into the black hole of social media. If you go to social media to respond to direct messages or schedule a post for your business, do that and then get out before you waste a bunch of precious time. Related:  Ep 62: How to Stay Focused and Eliminate Distractions in Your Business 5. Take breaks. It's always good to take periodic breaks from social media. Whether it's one day, one week or even one month—figure out what that frequency looks like for you. For me, I usually take breaks when I’m on vacation. If I go on vacation with my husband, I intentionally don't use my phone. I don't check social media or post updates. It's an amazing gift you give yourself (and others!) when you’re simply present. And it feels great when you’re free to disconnect and not stay up to date with the rest of the world. Your experience with social media doesn’t have to be this love-hate relationship anymore. Instead, take the pressure off yourself and find a healthy balance that’s right for you. Maximizing Social Media for Your Business With Jasmine Star I'm so excited about my guest today, Jasmine Star! Jasmine is a business strategist and photographer, and she helps entrepreneurs grow their impact through social media. I’ve been a fan of hers for a long time, and I'm so excited that she’ll be speaking at our Business Boutique Conference in October! On this episode, Jasmine and I talk about:  Starting small and turning a hobby into a business Understanding the power of one follower Positioning your business as someone else’s solution Creating the right content for your target audience Getting long-term results on social media\xa0  Related:  Ep 55: Making a Social Media Strategy That Works Challenge: Just Be You One of the things I think is really important in business and in life is to be yourself. I want everyone to intentionally make decisions in their life that make them feel more like themselves. I know this sounds crazy, but all day, every day, we tend to make decisions based on what other people think, what other people want, what other people say and what other people expect from us. Related:  How to Be More Confident But here's the thing: What the world actually needs is for you to be you. The decisions you make in your life should make you feel like you’re being true to yourself—not what somebody else expects from you. Many of you know I have a baby girl on the way. And part of growing our family meant I needed a bigger car. I've been doing some car shopping the last few months and even posted about the journey on my Instagram story. I asked all of you what your favorite SUV was because I was overwhelmed by all the options. There are a million choices out there! Well, the key word in my question was SUV. I was 100% certain I wanted an SUV because I'm an SUV kind of girl. However, in addition to all the responses I got from those of you telling me about your favorite SUV, I got equally as many responses from people trying to convince me I needed a minivan. And that group made a great case. I mean, I was actually pretty impressed with the list of features you knew off the top of their heads. Minivans might be amazing, but here's the thing: They're not me. I think they're right for some people. But to me, minivans at their core are practical. They're easy to get in and out of. They come with vacuums and DVD players. They've got sliding doors and remotes to make them open. But I'm not a practical person. So selling me on your list of practical benefits will never work on me. I would never want to drive a vehicle that doesn't feel like me. The car I ended up getting is a mom SUV, because let's be honest, that's also me. That's the stage of life I’m in with three kids. But it's not just about the car, y'all—it's anything in life. The same is true when it comes to what your business should be, what your dreams should be and what your goals should be—they should be you. If you hate running, you shouldn't make running a 5K a goal. If you hate yoga, you shouldn't set out to go be a yoga master. If you hate business, risk, responsibility and unpredictability, you shouldn't build a business. It all comes down to knowing who you are and what's right for you, and then making decisions that are in line with those values. I don't know what your friends and family are telling you, but I want to give you a challenge and an encouragement: You have the right to be you. At the end of the day, we all need to make decisions in line with who we are—and we need to encourage each other to do so as well. That’s why your challenge today is to figure out what those things are. What are the things that make you you? Have the confidence to live your life in line with whatever makes you more like yourself. | Dream Bigger and Build the Life You Want  1:24\xa0Why We Stop Dreaming and Three Steps to Dreaming Bigger 21:17\xa0Pursuing Your Wildest Dreams With Bob Goff 48:47 Encouragement to Remember that God is a Personal God  Resources Business Boutique Conference The Business Boutique Conference is coming back to Nashville Oct. 24–26.

Growing up, I had this aunt named Gloria who I thought was the coolest person around. She was beautiful, independent, drove an amazing car, and had a Rottweiler who went everywhere with her. But the coolest thing about her was that she lived on a farm by herself. She had horses, chickens, pigs, goats and everything that went along with the ideal farm life I fantasized about. To me, her life looked like the greatest life ever. I would often look at her and think, That’s who I want to be. That’s the kind of life I want to have. Well, fast-forward a few years to my early 20s when I was working 80 hours a week at a nonprofit. I was looking to downsize from a three-bedroom apartment with roommates to a one-bedroom apartment where I could live on my own. During my search, I came across an ad in the newspaper for a 40-acre farm for rent just two miles from my job—not exactly downsizing, but gasp! I immediately picked up the phone and called the number on the ad. It was perfect for me. Okay, so I couldn’t afford the rent they were asking for, I had no idea how to run a farm, and I was working insane hours at my day job. So, if we’re being completely honest, it didn’t make any sense at all—everything about it was impractical. But, y’all! It was my dream to live on a farm, so you better believe I wasn’t going to let “practical” stop me from pursuing it. Related:  Ep 60: How to Face Your Fears and Do It Scared The next day, I went to visit the farm in person. Once I left, I scrounged up enough money for the deposit and moved in a few days later. At 23, I was living my farm dream. Sure, I had to start a side business boarding horses in the empty stalls so I could afford the rent, but I couldn’t have been happier. Looking back on that experience, I could’ve easily missed out on living out that dream. Because the dream wasn’t happening on the time line I thought it would happen on (like in my 50s when I’d have more money, a spouse and kids), it would’ve been easy to convince myself that it wasn’t the right time. But you know what? More often than not, dreams aren’t practical, and they certainly don’t always come to life in practical ways. Thinking practically is just one of the many reasons our dreams get smaller and smaller as we get older. Why We Stop Dreaming It’s so easy to dream when you’re little, isn’t it? You believe you can do anything, be anyone, and accomplish all the big dreams in your heart. But at some point, life—and other people—gets to you. You get bogged down by people telling you to do more practical things that have a guaranteed path to success. So your dreams slowly start to fade into the background. Related:  Ep 74: Find Your True Self and Get Back to You And if you do dream, you play it safe. You keep your dreams small and doable so you can control and contain them. You also convince yourself that dreaming any bigger is selfish when so many people (your kids, your husband, your church, etc.) are counting on you. Does that “logic” sound familiar? So often, we women believe our heart’s desires are selfish. When the reality is, God is the one who placed that dream in you to begin with. He never called you to live a small life, and He certainly never called you to stop dreaming. I know that dreaming is hard. You feel vulnerable (because what if it doesn’t work?), silly (because what will other people think?) and even a little scared (because what kind of changes will this dream bring?). But I want you to do it anyway. It doesn’t matter how long it’s been since you’ve stopped dreaming—it’s never too late to start dreaming again. I want you to dream so big that if God’s not in it, you’ll fail. Dream so big that you can’t see the path forward—so big that you need God to show up and perform a miracle to make it happen. Friend, this is possible. Dreaming again will feel weird at first, but I believe it’s a practice—not a onetime thing. If you need to get back to dreaming big for your life, I’ve got three steps to help. When you practice these three steps, little by little you’ll see your dreams—and the real you—come back to life. Three Steps to Dreaming Bigger Step 1: Own it. Dreaming again starts with owning what you want out of life. Honestly ask yourself, What do I want for my:  life future children marriage business finances faith journey  What do you want? Your answers to these questions are your hopes and dreams. And when you acknowledge your dreams, you give yourself permission to desire those things. Because, friend, you are allowed to want more! Related:  Ep 78: How to Be Successful at Anything by Starting Small So many of us spend our lives trying to convince ourselves and others that we’re fine with how things currently are—that we don’t want more for our lives. But I’m here to tell you that life is about more than Legos and laundry. It’s okay to desire something more! God wants you to live an abundant life, and He’s prepared to “give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4 NIV). Your dreams matter. Acknowledge and own what you want, and then trust God to provide it. Step 2: Say it out loud. I know. This is scary! But do you know why saying your dream out loud to someone is scary? Because it makes the dream real. When you say your dream out loud, you take the dream out of the battlefield of your mind, where the voices of fear and doubt attack. Only then, do you bring your dream into the real world, where it can take on a life of its own. On top of that, when you tell people you love and trust about a new dream, you have accountability to work toward it, and your loved ones will rally around you to help make it happen. Related:  Say It Out Loud This Year You’ll hear things from them like: “I have several friends in a running group. You could meet up with them to train for your first 5K!” “A guy at my church does graphic design. I’m sure he’d help you with your logo and website!” “Oh, my cousin works in real estate. He can help you get your house on the market!” As silly as it sounds and as vulnerable as it feels, a dream takes on so much power when you say it out loud. Step 3: Write it down. Writing down your dreams is another level of accountability to yourself. The action turns your dreams into goals and your goals into a plan. You go from being a dreamer to being a doer. No longer is your dream just a conversation you had with a friend that you might forget about. Instead, you’ve now painted a clear picture for yourself of what you need to do to make that dream a reality. Your heart’s desires are not bad things or selfish things—they are God things. That’s why I want you to own your dreams, say them out loud, and write them down on paper. And I also want you to get your hopes up, sister, because our God is the God of hope. He will make a way for you and all those big dreams in your heart. Pursuing Your Wildest Dreams With Bob Goff I’m so excited about my guest today! Bob Goff is a New York Times bestselling author, speaker and the host of the Dream Big podcast. If you’ve read his book Love Does, then you know about his crazy determination to not only dream big, but also find ways to bring those dreams to life. On today’s episode, Bob and I talk about:  Tapping into our inner child and dreaming like we used to Living an engaged life Getting over the obsession of caring what others think about you Dreaming big for your life again  Encouragement: A Personal God One of the things I’ve noticed in my walk as a believer is that so often we want formulas for our faith. We want a road map that we can reference for how God is going to help us through whatever situation we’re going through. But God doesn’t always do things that way. God does not work in formulas. He’s not going to treat you and your situation the same way He would treat it for your friend, neighbor or coworker. Even if you’re both going through a similar situation, you likely won’t experience the same journey or results. Why is that? Does God take someone a different route because He sees something they don’t—or because He likes them more than He likes you? Years ago, I asked my mentor Eve why she thinks there are so many denominations within Christianity. My question was: How could we all love the same God but have different ideas around how to love Him? Our conversation went a little something like this: Eve: “Christy, look at Scripture. When Jesus healed the blind, how did He do it? Me: “Well, a lot of different ways. One time he used water, another time He used mud, and another time He just spoke it.” Eve: “Exactly. He had a lot of different methods to get to the same result.” When we have a certain experience with God, we tend to get together with other people who have had that same experience, and collectively we think our way is the right way. So those who were healed by mud got together with others who were healed by mud, and they believed God always heals with mud. And those who were healed by spit got together with others who were healed by spit, and they believed God always heals with spit, and so on. Don’t we also do that in life? We see our way of doing things and think it’s the only way or the right way. We think, If God did something in my life, then that must be the way He will always work. So our way becomes the rule for everyone else. We think, This must be the way you worship. This is the way you hear from God. This is how you practice obedience. But you know what? God is not only bigger than the box we try to put Him in—He’s also much more personal than that. God will take people down different paths that lead to the same destination: restoration. It’s easy for us to pass judgement on someone who is going in a different direction than the way we went. But what we don’t realize is, God is taking them that way on purpose. Your relationship with Him is personal, so your path with Him will be personal. So, if you’re seeing a friend, coworker or neighbor going down a different path or handling a situation differently than you would, don’t be discouraged. It doesn’t mean God has forgotten about you. It doesn’t mean He doesn’t have good plans for you. And it certainly doesn’t mean your friend is “doing it wrong.” It might just mean that God is using a personal approach with them, and He’ll do the same for you. \xa0 | Take Control of Your Life With the Power of Personal Responsibility  1:25 Three Reasons You Might Not Be Accepting Personal Responsibility 19:39 The Importance of Personal Responsibility with Rachel Hollis 33:12 Encouragement to Choose Could Over Should  Resources Business Boutique Conference The Business Boutique Conference is coming back to Nashville Oct. 24–26.

Taking control of your life sounds like a nice idea, doesn’t it? But let’s be real: So often we feel like we actually don’t have any control at all. We feel like we’re tossed left and right by the seasons of life and the people in our life. You know what, though? We actually have more control than we think we do. Your situation right now might be really hard—maybe it’s harder than anything you or I have ever been through. But here’s the great news: That’s not your only story, and it’s certainly not the end of your story. You Can Take Control of Your Life If you’ve ever seen the hit ABC show Shark Tank, you know the story of how Daymond John built his clothing company, FUBU, from nothing. Daymond was raised by a single mother. When he was 10, he started working to help his mom make ends meet. The hip-hop movement inspired him to start a clothing line, so he started sewing sweat shirts and hats in his mother’s living room. (By the way, when he first officially launched his clothing company, he was still working as a server at Red Lobster!) Today, FUBU has brought in more than six billion dollars in global sales.1 Let’s look at one more example: Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx. (Who else is grateful for this shapewear brand?) Nobody handed Sara her fame and fortune on a silver platter. In fact, she failed the LSAT twice, worked as a chipmunk character at Disney World, and even spent seven years selling fax machines door to door before she ever started working on her idea for Spanx. When she pitched the idea for Spanx, she was met with rejection after rejection, until finally she convinced one manufacturing company to produce her product. Today, Sara is one of America’s richest self-made women.2 Do you know what stories like those reveal to me? We often fall into the trap of believing our situation is impossible to climb out of. Meanwhile, others—like Daymond and Sara—are refusing to be defined by their circumstances. Instead, they’re taking control of their lives and changing the outcome. Related:  Ep 70: How to Be Content in Every Situation The truth is, you have control in the good and the bad times. The way you view your life—and your belief about the amount of control you have—will have a major impact on how your life turns out, whether you reach your goals, and how your story unfolds. Your ability to take control of your life is connected to the amount of personal responsibility you’re willing to take. It’s also connected to the amount of determination you choose to have in your life. The important thing to note here is that taking personal responsibility for your life is more dependent on you, your choices, your beliefs and your actions than anything else going on around you. Whatever your situation, I know it’s real. I’m not discounting what you’re going through—I know your situation is a factor in your ability to be successful. But I also believe your circumstances should not define you. Because there is a person who can change circumstances, who can fix broken things, and who can choose something different—and that person is you. That’s why today, I want to talk about three major reasons we often feel like we’re not in control of our lives. Three Reasons You Might Not Be Accepting Personal Responsibility There are three different obstacles I’ve faced in my life—and seen other women face in theirs—that could have easily led me to believe I didn’t have the ability to control my destiny. Let’s walk through each and talk about how we can overcome them moving forward. 1. A victim mentality A victim mentality is all about your beliefs. You don’t believe you have any control of your situation, so you sit back, wait and pout. You have a pity party, and you invite everyone else to join. When you have a victim mentality, it’s always someone else’s fault that you can’t have what you want, do what you want, or be who you want to be. It’s never your fault. This victim mentality is really common and can come from many outside sources, like teachers, parents or the culture around you. But you’re not born with the idea that you’re not in control of your life—this belief is learned. That’s why I want to encourage you to change your attitude. Because guess what? Your belief system is just that—it’s yours. You get to choose what you believe. If you start looking for examples of optimism, perseverance, persistence and determination, I’m willing to bet you’ll find them—because they’re out there. No one is going to change your attitude for you—you have to do it. You can choose to believe something better than what you were raised to believe. You can choose to believe something different than what you’re surrounded by every day. You can choose to change your attitude and take control of your life. 2. Exhaustion As women, we’re experts when it comes to running ourselves ragged. We go nonstop, 24 hours a day. We do whatever it takes to be a great mom, wife, business owner, church member, and then some. And because we’re doing all the things, we’re constantly tired. That reminds me of a really challenging season I went through in the fall of 2017. I was still adjusting to being a mom of two while launching my new book and traveling a ton for speaking engagements. I remember coming home one day and telling my husband, “I don’t know why I do this. I don’t have to do this.” And I’ll never forget what my husband said in response: “Yes, you do know why you do this. You know about the lives that are being changed and how God is using you. You’re just tired.” There was such wisdom in his words—he was spot on. The reality is, I love my work! But in that moment, I didn’t feel in control because I was so tired. I was moving nonstop and feeling like a passive participant in my life. All along, there was one simple solution: rest. Related:  Ep 76: Practice Self-Care and Give Yourself Grace So, if you’re just feeling discouraged, it doesn’t mean you’re not in control of your life. You might just be tired. You can fix that by going back to your  why and getting some well-deserved  rest. 3. Inactivity This is one of the hardest obstacles to face because it’s often disguised by holiness. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a woman tell me she was not taking action on something because she was waiting on God. And you know how I always respond? I tell them, “God can steer a moving vehicle. He cannot steer a stalled car.” If you’re praying and asking God to direct you, as you’re walking, He will direct you. Instead of waiting for a lightning bolt from the sky or for an angel to appear in your living room, why don’t you get up and do something? Sometimes we sit around under this banner of holiness while waiting our life away for God to show up. All the while, God is there telling you to get moving! He’s attracted to activity. He will show you the next step after you take the first step.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Related:  Ep 72: Push Forward and Get Unstuck This doesn’t mean you abandon God and move ahead of His plans. But God does give us free will and calls us all to take personal responsibility for our lives—we are stewards, after all. If you look at the parable of the talents in the Bible (Matthew 25:14–30), you read that God honors active participants in this life, not passive ones. So get moving, sister! What brave step—or even baby step—of faith can you take today? What knowledge do you already have that can inform your decisions today? Stop procrastinating! There is certainly wisdom in waiting sometimes, but don’t use waiting as an excuse to do nothing. We are partners with God in this life on Earth, and you have more control than you think you do. I don’t know which one of these obstacles you struggle with the most—maybe it’s a combination of all three like it has been for me—but I hope this message encourages you. It’s just like my friend Christine Cain says, “I’m living proof that you can start bad and finish good.” The Importance of Personal Responsibility with Rachel Hollis I’m so excited to have my good friend Rachel Hollis on the show today! She’s a #1 New York Times bestselling author, a motivational speaker, the host of the Rise and Rise Together podcasts, and the founder and CCO of The Hollis Company. On this episode, Rachel and I talk about:  Being a good steward of your gifts and resources Why we struggle with the victim mentality and how we can change that How to talk yourself into things versus out of things One of the biggest lies women believe and how we can get over it  Encouragement: Choose Could Over Should “I should do that…” All day long, I tell myself about all the things I should be doing. But you know what I realized recently? Almost all my should’s started as could’s. My ideas begin as creative, fun, exciting dreams—like I could make handmade invitations for Carter’s birthday party, or I could get these party favors and decorations. But once the could’s make it onto my to-do list, they instantly become should’s. Before I know it, it’s been weeks or months, and I’m still holding my feet to the fire of this long list of should’s. There I stand with a list of 75 things I now feel like I have to do. They’re no longer optional. They’re no longer creative options that could be fun. They become laws that I now have to follow. When in actuality, I came up with that list. That list started as an idea in my head, and no one is holding me to that list but me. And yet we do this to ourselves all the time, don’t we? The high expectations start and end with us. When, in reality, other than paying taxes and feeding your family, there are very few things in life you have to do. Related:  3 Quick Steps to Reduce Stress You don’t have to go all out for your child’s party! Did you know that? You don’t have to, but you tell yourself all day, every day, that you do. The words we use are exhausting—they’re words of bondage. I just want to remind you: The person in control of your life, your to-do list, your tasks and your responsibilities is you. You get a choice in what you do and what you don’t do. You get to choose what is a could and what is a should. Maybe it’s as simple as changing your words. Instead of telling yourself all day long that you should do something, what if you just changed it back to could? A could gives you options. A should has burden tied to it. | Tips From an Etsy Expert on How to Make More Money Online  1:17 Tips From an Etsy Expert on How to Make More Money Online with Melissa Kaiserman 25:50 Encouragement on What to Consider When Receiving Feedback  \xa0 Resources Business Boutique Conference The Business Boutique Conference is coming back to Nashville Oct. 24–26.

Making money online has never been easier. You can start a successful business tomorrow with nothing more than an idea and a Facebook page—or, in Melissa Kaiserman’s case, an Etsy store. Melissa’s story began like so many of yours. She was using Dave Ramsey’s envelope system and wanted a wallet that would help her divide her cash into different categories. When she couldn’t find one she loved, she decided to make one herself. And then she made the “mistake” of showing it to her friends—because, of course, they all wanted her to make them one! Her wallets were a hit. This gave her the idea to simplify her design so she could create more wallets in less time and also make a profit by selling them online. She opened a shop on Etsy—A Time for Everything—and hit publish on her first wallet listing. Y’all, in just under a year, Melissa’s Etsy store was providing full financial support for her family! Related:  How to Make Money on Etsy I love stories like Melissa’s because women often find it hard to believe that their talents, passions or hobbies can actually be profitable. Melissa’s story is one of many that proves it’s possible. In fact, her success on Etsy led to even more opportunities. Today, not only does she still have her online shop, but she’s also blogging and selling courses to help other people succeed on Etsy. You can see why, when it comes to the topic of making money online and successfully selling on Etsy, I wanted to talk to Melissa Kaiserman! She and I took a deep dive into all the things. We started by talking through the pros and cons of choosing Etsy as your selling platform. How to Make Money Online by Selling on Etsy There are so many good things to say about starting and growing your business on Etsy. Thankfully, Melissa was able to narrow it down to her top three pros: 1. People know about it. Etsy currently has 41 million active buyers.1 That’s right—a whole lot of people immediately think Etsy when they need a unique, handmade item. If you’re just getting started selling online, it’s going to be a while before you can get 41 million people to start scrolling through your personal website. I always tell you to hang out where your customers are. And in this case, your customers are hanging out on Etsy! 2. You’ll get organic Google searches. SEO (search engine optimization) is just a fancy term for the likelihood that your product, page or Etsy store will pop up on Google when someone searches a particular word or phrase. And the good news is, Etsy does a great job of getting products found on Google. There are also some strategies you can do on your own to increase the chances of your Etsy store showing up on Google search results. I’ll say more on that later. Related:  Ep 41: Digital Marketing Strategies That Work 3. It’s easy to use. I like to think of Etsy like a “business in a box.” They make it so easy to set up a shop and maintain it. Not only does Etsy walk you through the whole process, but they also provide the tools to create a profile page and online presence. Plus, they handle the hosting, order intake, and even accept payment for you. These are all things you’d have to figure out on your own if you decided to start selling from a personal website. I know all of those pros make Etsy sound great, but I want to make sure you’re aware of some of the cons as well. Things to Consider Before Choosing Etsy: 1. You have limited control. Because Etsy handles everything for you, there are some limitations to consider. You’ll have to operate within their rules and guidelines, and you’ll be limited with how you can represent your shop online. 2. They charge fees and take a portion of your profits. Don’t be mistaken—selling on Etsy is not free! Etsy charges you 20 cents to publish each listing in your store. If your product sells, you’ll owe them a 5% transaction fee. And if you use Etsy Payments, they’ll also collect 3% plus a 25-cent payment processing fee on top of everything else. Related:  Pricing Strategies: How to Set Prices 3. There will be a lot of competition. To say there are a lot of sellers and products for sale on Etsy would be an understatement. I’m talking 2.2 million sellers and more than 60 million items for sale.2 There are a lot more buyers than there are sellers, so keep in mind that Etsy wants to be as helpful as possible to the buyer. This means that even if someone is shopping in your store, Etsy will show the customer related products from someone else’s store (potentially distracting them away from your products). So, you end up competing for your customers even after you’ve gotten them to click on your page. Related:  Ep 57: Standing Out From Your Competition With Your Unique Selling Proposition The competition may be fierce, but I still wholeheartedly believe that Etsy is a great place to start (and grow!) your business. That’s why Melissa and I came up with five tips you can use to maximize your Etsy shop and attract more customers. Top Five Tips for Selling on Etsy: 1. Don’t focus on the competition. I know we just talked about how competitive the marketplace is on Etsy, but if you choose to use this platform, don’t let the competition be your focus. Melissa made that mistake early on. She spent a lot of time obsessing over other shops on Etsy and looking for people who were copying her products. At the end of the day, even when she did find copycats, knowing wasn’t helpful. All it did was cause her anxiety in her first couple of years in business. She finally realized she couldn’t control what other people did. All she could control was where her focus was. 2. Do your homework and be prepared. Things like registering your business with your state and collecting sales tax is not exciting stuff, I know. But when you take care of that stuff on the front end, you’ll have the peace of mind to focus on the important stuff—like making and selling your products. Don’t wait until tax season to figure this stuff out! 3. Prioritize your photos. Etsy is a visual marketplace. When there are thousands of options for the same type of product you sell, people are going to click on whatever product looks the best. You could have the best product in the world, but if the photo is awful, people are just going to scroll right past it. Oh, and by the way, the less people click on your shop, the lower you’ll appear on Etsy’s search results. Here are a few quick tips to make sure you have top-notch photos:  When you’re taking the photos, make sure the background isn’t cluttered. Use a clean, white backdrop with lots of natural light. Make it really clear what the product is. Don’t confuse buyers by cluttering a bunch of other items around your product. Yes, it’s a good idea to style your photos, but make sure your product is the focus of the shot. Give your store a clean and consistent look by photographing all of your products with a similar theme. Make sure you have at least one close-up of your product—that’s the photo you want to be your thumbnail. You can post up to 10 photos for each product, so use the more styled photos to complement the close-up.  4. Write great product descriptions. Product descriptions are so important for the customer. If you can be really detailed in your descriptions, you’ll receive fewer messages with questions that could have been answered on the product page. Here are a few quick tips for writing great product descriptions:  When choosing a title for each product, use the words potential customers would use. This increases the likelihood that your product will appear during a search. That’s SEO at work! Don’t use the cute, branded name you came up with, because no one is going to search for those words! More simply put, you don’t want to make it hard for the customer to find your stuff. Again, this is exactly why you want to use keywords and keyword phrases that your potential customer would use in a search. Your images can also work as product descriptions. Show your product at scale and describe details in some of your images by including text overtop of them. This is ideal for those customers who tend to skip product descriptions! If you’re unsure about whether you provided enough details in your product description, just ask yourself: If there were no photos at all, would my customer understand what my product is?  Related:  5 Steps to Writing Awesome Etsy Product Descriptions 5. Serve well. Did you know that 81% of purchases on Etsy are actually repeat purchases?  3 I’m definitely one of those customers! I remember working with a designer on Etsy to create a custom Christmas card a few years ago. She took such good care of me that the following year, I didn’t bother searching Etsy for another cute design. I just went straight to the same designer I’d worked with before. The easiest way to get repeat customers is to take really good care of them. Under-promise and over-deliver every time. Not only will they come back to you, but they’ll also tell all their friends about you. No matter what platform you end up choosing, the important thing is that you just start. I know you’ve got a lot to offer the world, and I’m willing to bet your idea can be profitable. So stop waiting until you’re ready, because “ready” is a myth. Just go for it! Encouragement: What to Consider When Receiving Feedback Earlier this year, I trained for the Nashville Rock ‘n’ Roll half marathon. It wasn’t going to be my first time running a race while pregnant. I actually ran that same race when I was five months pregnant with my second son, Conley. I trained, took my time, and was able to finish the race in two and a half hours. I had a positive experience to base this year’s race on. But while I knew I’d run the race before and assumed I could probably do it again, many people didn’t feel the same way. On my first day of training for this year’s race, I was gearing up to go out on a seven-mile run. Before I started, I posted a quick update on my Instagram. Y’all, that Instagram Story got so many responses. And I quickly noticed that each response was either an encouragement or a warning. On the one hand, I got tons of messages that said things like, “Yes! You can do this! So inspiring!” And on the other hand, I got responses that said the complete opposite. People warned me and told me it wasn’t worth the harm I’d do to my body or my baby. They shared their horror stories of going into preterm labor and encouraged me not to race. These polar opposite responses made me realize one thing: When you get feedback from people (good, bad or in-between), it’s more about them than it is about you—because the feedback will come through the filter of their experience. Related:  Ep 40: Top Traits of Highly Successful Women For example, the moms who ran while pregnant and had a healthy experience were telling me if they could do it, so could I, while the moms who had a scary experience warned me to avoid the mistake they’d made. Both types of feedback were a reflection of where these people were coming from. This is so important to remember in your business as well. When you ask for feedback or when you get feedback from your customers, family, well-meaning friends, or strangers on Facebook, keep in mind that while feedback is valuable and helpful, it’s also being filtered through their unique experience. You can and should learn from other people’s mistakes and take into account their tips and tricks. But you also have to keep in mind that just because someone else had that experience, it doesn’t mean you will. So, I encourage you to keep asking for feedback and advice. Just keep in mind that the unique perspectives, experiences and circumstances of the people giving the feedback can impact whether it’s helpful or not.

Give yourself permission to be a beginner. We have a bad habit of calling successful people an overnight success—as if they just woke up one day on top of the mountain. But, in most cases, that’s just not true. In reality, most successful people started small doing something unimpressive. Here are just a few examples I can think of: Television pioneer Oprah Winfrey started her career as a news anchor in Nashville, Tennessee—way before it was the cool and popular city it is today.1 Y’all, she was even demoted once from an anchor job she had in Baltimore.2 (I bet that person still regrets that to this day!) And then there’s self-made millionaire Dave Ramsey. He grew his business from a card table in his living room to a multimillion-dollar company with more than 850 team members—and he’s helped millions get out of debt and change their family tree. Did you know that world-famous author J.K. Rowling was living on welfare when she wrote the first Harry Potter book?3 And finally, let’s talk about Ellen Latham—a name many may not recognize. But I bet they recognize the name of the business she started: Orangetheory Fitness. The massively successful chain of fitness studios actually started in a spare room of Ellen’s house.4 Do you see what I’m talking about? The early stages of their careers did not look impressive by any means. But, eventually, because they were consistent and refused to let their humble beginnings define them, their careers surpassed even their wildest dreams. Related:  Don't Be Sorry for the Struggle The Importance of Starting Small Let’s just go ahead and acknowledge that starting small is not fun. You’re probably not going to update your friends about it any chance you get, or post pictures about your journey on Facebook. But you know what? Starting small is actually one of the most important steps in building your business—or anything for that matter—wisely. That’s why it’s so important to give yourself permission to be a beginner. Aside from the fact that it works and is proven, starting small makes your dreams and your goals so much more attainable. As you begin to think about your big dreams and goals, what usually happens? Fear creeps in, doesn’t it? You start to doubt that any of your dreams are even possible, because they’re just too big and overwhelming. But when you embrace the idea of starting small, your dream doesn’t feel so crazy after all. How to Start Small The commitment to start small requires persistence, dedication and a go-getter attitude—qualities I know you’ve got in you! That’s why I want to give you a few do’s and don’ts that you can use as a guideline as you chase your dreams. 1. Don’t wait until you’re ready. “Ready” is a myth. Because let’s be real—do we ever feel ready for anything in life? Related:  How to Be More Confident There’ll always be a new doubt or excuse that will try to convince you it’s just not time yet. But the truth is, the only way you figure anything out for yourself is by doing it—by learning on the job. Early on in my career, I learned something important: Say yes before you know how. When an opportunity comes your way and you don’t feel ready, qualified or educated enough, it doesn’t matter. Just get out there and get moving—ready or not. 2. Do take baby steps. When you break down your big idea and big dream into baby steps, you begin to see the impossible become possible. For example, if you want to train for a marathon, you don’t start by running 15 miles. You start by training for a 5K. If you want to open a boutique, you start with an Etsy store. If you need more sleep, you start by winding down and turning off the screens 10 minutes earlier than you normally would. If you miss seeing your friends, you send one text to one friend and set up one lunch date. Baby steps. What you’ll find—in business and in life—is that small changes tend to make the biggest impact. It’s the small things you do repeatedly that make up life-change that actually lasts. That’s why I don’t want you to think of your dream in terms of giant leaps you need to take. Instead, think: What’s one baby step I can take this week? 3. Don’t worry about what everyone else is doing. In our overconnected culture, it’s so tempting to get on social media and compare your journey to someone else’s. But you shouldn’t compare your small steps to someone else’s giant leaps. I love the quote by Theodore Roosevelt that says, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” I wholeheartedly believe you cannot be present for your dream and for your life if you’re looking and comparing it to everyone else around you. And you can’t make changes or improvements if you’re too busy obsessing over someone else’s progress. Take the focus off everybody else and instead focus on your life, your business, your dreams and your values. Stay in your lane and run your race. And as you take small steps, be confident in knowing that those are faithful steps God will honor. Related:  Ep 70: How to Be Content in Every Situation 4. Do keep it simple. When I graduated from college with no money and no job, I remember trying to convince myself that I needed to purchase a bunch of new suits for job interviews. It’s ridiculous, isn’t it? But we do this in business too. We say we need a new laptop, a new studio or new equipment to get started. Let’s be honest—no, you don’t! Often, our desires and efforts to buy new things are not really because the business needs it. We’re just trying to justify and validate our dream. The truth is: Working on your business is what validates the business, not the stuff you buy. In the words of Arthur Ashe, “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.” 5. Don’t go into debt. There is this myth in the business world that somehow business debt is different from personal debt. As if the debt belongs to the business and not to you. But they’re the same thing. Because guess who has to pay that business debt at the end of the day? You do. Business debt is no different than personal debt. In both scenarios, you’re giving up power, ownership and control—three things you really should maintain. The worst part is, when you take on debt to do anything, every decision you make will become dependent upon the debt you owe. It’s all debt, and it’s all a bad idea. Save up for the things you want and be scrappy in the meantime. Related:  Ep 24: Money Pitfalls to Avoid in Your Business 6. Do make a plan and set goals. You don’t just need the dream. You need a plan for how you’ll get from where you are today to where you want to be. And once you have that plan, it’s critical to set goals that will get you there. For example, if you want to become a teacher, your plan might be to get a teaching certificate within two years. That’s a great plan. Then, you might set goals like: take the PRAXIS exam before August, or enroll in courses that start this fall. Related:  Ep 13: How to Write and Reach Your Goals When you make a plan for where you want to be, and then set goals for how you’re going to get there, you’re much more likely to make that dream a reality. Because I promise, you will not get to where you want to be by accident. Get Started Today! There is no such thing as an overnight success. You’ve got to put in the hours and the work required to accomplish your big dreams. And it’s totally possible when you start small, use what you have, and grow slow. Remember, the impressive things in life often start as unimpressive things. Someone who has done this really well is my friend Melissa Kaiserman. She’s the owner of A Time for Everything and Makery Space. Melissa is going to be my guest on the show next week, and she’ll share all of her secrets on starting small and working on Etsy.

I get this question almost every single day. But before we go any further, I need to bust a myth you might be believing that is keeping you from getting more customers. For as long as I can remember, I’ve heard people say: “If you build it, they will come.” How many times have you heard that line? How many times have you believed that simply creating a website meant people would visit? Or opening a store meant people would stop in? Related:  Market Research: How to Know What Your Customers Want I hate to tell you this, but it’s just not true. No matter what you build, customers don’t show up out of the blue. Why not? Because . . .  They’re busy. They’re distracted. They’re tired. They have hundreds of other messages vying for their attention.  We have to stop building these big, awesome, impressive things and wondering why customers aren’t showing up. We have to do something different. Instead of sitting back and waiting for customers to come to you, it’s time for you to go after your customers. You have to figure out where your ideal customers hang out and build relationships with them. And only then, when you’ve added value to their lives, can you invite them to become a customer. So, how do you actually do that? I’ve got four different tips to get you started! Four Ways to Find More Customers \xa0 1. Get scrappy. Some of you are sitting around waiting for some sophisticated formula or fool-proof plan to attract more customers. I hate to break it to you, but business doesn’t work that way. Business is a science and an art, which means that while there are certainly best practices to keep in mind, there’s no perfect path to success. Most business owners become successful not because they’re sophisticated, but because they’re really stinkin’ scrappy. They’re willing to get their hands dirty and try a bunch of different things to get the word out. They’re willing to show up at other businesses with donuts, coffee, samples and a business card. They’re not afraid to pick up the phone and do some cold calling. The bottom line is, you have to be willing to do the hard work of building relationships—and that takes a whole lot of scrappiness. 2. Get referrals. When you need your hair colored or your house cleaned, who do you want to hire? Someone you trust, right? And how do you find someone you trust? You ask your friends! Y’all, this is so important! Referrals are just another way of describing word-of-mouth marketing—the most effective form of marketing. The best part is, it’s free! So, if you’re not actively incentivizing your current clients to refer their friends and asking them for testimonials, you’re missing out on an amazing opportunity to find new customers. 3. Improve your marketing. I want you to take a good look at your marketing efforts as a whole. Look at the different ways you’re marketing your business—from your website to your social media posts and the emails you send. Then I want you to ask yourself:\xa0  Is the design clean and beautiful? Is the copy clear? Is your call to action direct and obvious?  Try to pinpoint what’s working and what’s not. Get to the root of the problem before you look for a solution. For example, if you’re not getting any sales from your online store, is it because no one is visiting the website or because people are visiting but not buying? Knowing exactly why you’re not getting sales will help you know what you need to change and improve. Related:  Branding the Look and Tone of Your Business 4. Try something new. If you keep doing the same things you’ve always done, you’ll just keep getting the same results. So, if you want to grow your business by increasing your customer base, you have to be willing to experiment to find out what works best for your target market. Try something new on social media, on your website, on your Esty store, or even in person as you pitch your product or service to someone. Try a new promotion and see what kind of buzz you get. Or maybe you need to show up at a different place and meet a different group of people. When you try new approaches, you are much more likely to find fresh, innovative ways to attract more of your ideal customers. Related:  Keep Things Fresh by Trying Something New Finding more customers is not as hard as it sounds. In fact, there are so many different ways to do it. Let’s recap the four you should start with. Get scrappy: Don’t worry about a sophisticated formula—just show up and meet new people. Get referrals: Encourage your current tribe to market for you. Improve your marketing: See where you can make tweaks and adjustments to your marketing strategy. And finally: keep experimenting, trying new things, and doing more of what works. You got this! Attracting New Customers to Your Business with Reina Pomeroy Reina Pomeroy is an expert at sales and attracting more customers. She’s the founder of Reina + Co., host of the Fueled with Heart podcast and the creator of the Dreamy Client Magnet program. I love how she encourages business owners to be heart-centered, where their passion for the work and the customer always gets first priority. On this episode, Reina and I talk about:  How to make more sales by serving your customers well How to work on your money mind-set Why you don’t need more followers to get more customers How to network and build relationships the right way  The One Quality That Will Transform Every Relationship I was on a panel a few years ago at a Ramsey Smart Conference alongside #1 bestselling author Les Parrott. Les is a brilliant clinical psychologist and relationship expert. We were a part of a Q&A session, and someone in the audience asked Les for his best piece of marriage advice—no small question. His answer completely changed my life. Turns out, his best piece of marriage advice was simply to have empathy. That’s it: empathy. Put yourself in your spouse’s shoes as often as possible. This advice has been transformative for me. I have used this nugget of wisdom so many times since that night. It has helped my husband and I dissolve conflict, increase understanding, and improve our connection. It seems so obvious, but I wonder why we don’t do this more often in life with all of our relationships. We tend to judge ourselves by our intentions (they’re always good, of course!), but we judge others by their actions. Seeing the world from only our perspective leads to conflict, misunderstanding and broken relationships. If we’re going to have healthy relationships, we have to be willing to see the situation from the other person’s point of view. And you can do that by empathizing. By putting yourself in the other person’s shoes and giving them the benefit of the doubt. Whether it’s your spouse, best friend, coworker or customer, empathizing will transform every relationship and every interaction you have. \xa0 | Practice Self-Care and Give Yourself Grace  1:22 The Importance of Making Self-Care a Priority 18:00 Giving Yourself Grace with Ashley LeMieux 44:15 Challenge to Act the Way You Want to Feel  Resources  Get Christy's 10 Ways to Take Care of You by filling out the form here!

The Importance of Making Self-Care a Priority The moment I became a momma, everything changed. My first son, Carter, was born in January of 2015, and he instantly became my entire world. This tiny human consumed my every thought, concern and desire. It was beautiful and awesome, but it was also really hard. Now, I’d gone through many hard seasons before this one. I’ve walked through seasons where I worked 80 hours a week, lost all my friends, and didn’t have much of a life outside of work. But, for whatever reason, there’s nothing quite like that feeling of losing yourself when children come into the picture. Not only do they instantly become the center of your universe, but they also just need you a lot. And that’s exactly what happened to me. I lost myself when I first became a mother. I no longer felt like Christy. I no longer felt like the young, independent, fun person I’d always known myself to be. I had so many interests—and I still do—but I wasn’t doing any of those things because taking care of Carter consumed my world. Related:  Find Your True Self and Get Back to You I know many of you have probably experienced this as well. You begin to create habits and grooves where all you think about is your kids. That was definitely me, even more so when Conley came into the picture a very short time later. I got into a habit of identifying myself as Carter and Conley’s mom. That was my first point of identification. Now, I love being their mother. It’s the greatest joy of my life. But it’s not the only part of me. I quickly realized that, in keeping up with the day-to-day demands of my job, my children and my household, the first thing to go was me. The first things to go out the window were my interests and anything that brought me joy and rest (outside of my family). This was the first time in my life that I experienced this kind of guilt. Anything I wanted to do for myself felt selfish in the grand scheme of being a mom, so I wasn’t taking care of myself. Related:  Getting Rid of the Guilt Doesn’t this happen to so many of us? We forget about the things that make us feel like us: exercise, shopping, pedicures, time with girlfriends or time alone. Those things become luxuries we’ll indulge in only if there’s time leftover. And you and I both know there is never time leftover. There will always be something more demanding of your time, attention and energy until you put yourself at the top of your priority list. Self-Care Is Your Responsibility If you feel rushed, run down, busy, burned out, grumpy or resentful in your own life, it’s probably because you haven’t taken care of yourself. And there’s only one person who can fix that: you. The most important truth you need to know about self-care is that it’s up to you. That’s why it’s called self-care. No one can do it for you. No one can make you take time off work, take a vacation, soak in a bubble bath, get a pedicure, or make you value yourself but you. So, if you’re sitting around and waiting for someone to give you permission to take care of yourself, it’s not going to happen. Now, don’t get me wrong. Loving your children more than life is not a bad thing. But, it’s still okay to want more for your life. It’s not wrong to have a busy season, but you have to stop putting everyone else first and then resenting them for it. The truth is that what your people need from you more than a warm meal on the table or a ride to soccer is a woman in their life who has come alive—a woman who is full of joy and is confident and happy to be doing whatever it is she’s doing. And, by the way, self-care is a way of life. It doesn’t mean taking a bubble bath once a quarter and hoping it’s going to wash your troubles away. I’m talking about valuing yourself and making yourself a regular, consistent priority in your own life. It’s about filling your own tank. It’s just like when you drive. If you run out of gas on the side of the road, it’s so much more frustrating and stressful to get the gas you need to fill up your car. But, if you keep your tank full, it’s pretty easy to stay moving and get a refill when you’re running low. So, stop waiting until you’re on the verge of a nervous breakdown to throw up a flag, raise your hand, and ask for help. Stop waiting until there’s a crisis. Instead, keep your tank full. Stop Apologizing for Taking Care of Yourself So, how do you keep your tank full? Do the things you love to do regularly. It might feel a little awkward or selfish the first time you do it. But I want you to know you don’t have to apologize for it—not the first time you do it or the hundredth time. A few years ago, I was hanging out with some of my mom friends when one of them said she was taking a trip to Florida with a girlfriend. The exciting update was immediately followed by a long list of reasons she needed to go. I wanted to stop her and tell her she didn’t have to explain herself. She didn’t need to have a list of reasons to take this trip. She didn’t have to validate it to us or to anyone else. And I want to say the same thing to you today. The sad part is that I don’t think my friend was trying to justify it to us. I think she was trying to justify it to herself to get through the guilt of doing something for herself. The truth is that doing something for yourself should be a consistent priority, and you never have to be sorry for doing it. Related:  Finding Your Purpose Through Intentional Living\xa0 I’m not saying you should neglect your family or any of your responsibilities. I’m saying that, in order to take care of them, you have to take care of yourself. Taking care of yourself is not selfish. It’s self-preservation, and it’s smart. So, let me ask you: What brings you joy? What gives you energy and fills your tank? What makes you feel rested? Make a list, save it on your phone, or put it by your bedside, and then start to integrate those activities into your life—not just on your birthday or on a holiday, but on a regular basis. When you do this, not only will everyone around you benefit but you’ll enjoy your life so much more. Giving Yourself Grace with Ashley LeMieux I’m so excited for you to meet my good friend Ashley LeMieux. She’s the founder of The Shine Project and Shop Ashley LeMieux. And she’s also the author of the upcoming book Born to Shine: Practical Tools to Help You Shine, Even in Life’s Darkest Moments. Ashley exemplifies this truth so beautifully. Despite the hard roads she’s walked, she shines so brightly. About seven years ago, Ashley was fresh out of college, newly married, and working as an intern at an inner-city high school in Arizona. At that school, she worked with soon-to-be first-generation college students who didn’t have many resources or mentors to help them reach their potential and pursue higher education. Ashely was so passionate about these students, and she wanted to be the person to help them build a successful life. She already had a successful blog called The Shine Project, so she used that platform to advocate for these students and raise money to send them to college. In her first year of doing this, she was able to raise enough money to send 10 students to their freshman year of college. It was an amazing accomplishment, but she wanted to do more. Ashely felt strongly about building a business where these students could work while in college. So, she taught herself how to make jewelry, then taught the students to make it, and they sold the products online. Today, not only are these students learning a valuable skill, but through the sales, The Shine Project is able to send even more students to college. On this episode, Ashley and I talk about:  Pushing past fear to make your dreams come true Knowing what your next step should be Taking care of yourself when devastation strikes Turning your pain into your power Giving yourself grace in difficult seasons  Challenge: Act the Way You Want to Feel On the last episode of the podcast, I told you the story of my recent trip to the beach with my husband. We were so excited to be taking a vacation—just the two of us. We had booked this amazing hotel that (based on the website’s photos and descriptions) we thought would be right on the beach. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we realized it was all a lie. The hotel actually sat on a busy street. As you can imagine, I was so disappointed. I shared that story with you to challenge you to under-promise and over-deliver for your customers. But, today, I want to share the second part of that story. After being completely frustrated by the hotel, I quickly started researching other hotels to see if I could find a last-minute room that overlooked the beach. I found one just down the street that looked beautiful, but it was so expensive. Plus, we would have had to pay a fee to cancel our current reservation. After about 20 minutes of research, I decided it wasn’t worth all the money and hassle. I realized in that moment that I had two choices:  I could continue being disappointed and get frustrated every time a motorcycle drove by. I could change my attitude.  I literally told my husband, “We’re not changing hotels. Instead, I’m going to change my attitude right now. I won’t bring this up again. We’re going to have an awesome vacation. Thank you for letting me explore my options, but now that we know it’s not right to move, we’re going to stay at our current hotel, and I’m going to have a great attitude about it.” Related:  How to Be Content in Every Situation In that instant, I flipped a switch in my mind, and I made a choice to have a great attitude. Here’s what I want you to take away from that story: You’re going to find yourself in situations in which you’re unhappy or disappointed. It’s inevitable. If you can fix the problem, certainly explore your options. But, if you can’t fix it, my challenge to you is to change your attitude. Flip that switch in your mind, and let it go. Not only will it benefit everyone around you, but you’ll have a much better time as well. You are in control of your feelings. Your feelings are not in control of you. You don’t have to feel a certain way to act a certain way. You can act the way you want to feel, and your feelings will follow. | What would you do with a nine-hour layover in Chicago? Would you:  Keep it safe and sit at the airport reading a book to ensure you didn’t miss your connecting flight? Grab your best friend, do as much exploring as possible, and make it back to the airport just in time to board?  I don’t know what you’d pick. But can you take a wild guess which one I’d choose? That’s right, I’d choose option two any day. But do you know what I’ve noticed? There are actually people out there who would choose the first option every single time. Crazy, right? Even more shocking, one of them is a very good friend of mine. Related:  5 of the Most Important Qualities You Can Teach Your Kids When I was a junior in college, I got the opportunity to travel to Europe for my Western Civilization class. The week before we left, I remember receiving a very detailed itinerary from our trip leader, and the first thing I noticed was a nine-hour layover in Chicago. Normally, I wouldn’t get pumped about a nine-hour layover anywhere. But, I was a 21-year-old southern girl who had never been up north. So, the potential to have a big chunk of time to sightsee, shop, and eat my way through a very cool northern city got me pumped. I immediately called one of my good friends who was also going on the trip. Our conversation went a little something like this: Me: Guess what? We have nine hours in Chicago! We can go sightseeing, tour the city, and try new restaurants! Friend: No, we can’t. Me: We can’t? Friend: No. We can’t do that. We can’t leave the airport. Me: How do you know? Did you read something I missed? Friend: No. I’m just sure we can’t go. Me: Did someone tell you that? Like a leader or a past participant? Friend: No. I’m just sure we can’t go. Me: That’s so interesting, because I am so sure we can. I learned something about myself and other people that day. There tend to be two personality styles when it comes to trying new things. There are those who, when in doubt, assume they can’t. And there are those who, when the information or rules are not clear, assume they can. But you know what? Regardless of how you’re wired, you will go further and faster in life when you assume that you can. More importantly, someone who assumes they can do whatever it is they want to do is more willing, able and confident to try new things. And trying new things in life and in business is vital to growth. Your life will be small and predictable if all you ever do is what you know—if you only ever stick to is what is safe. That’s not the life God wants for you. He wants you to push the limits, get outside your comfort zone and try something new. Related:  How to Push Past Your Comfort Zone and Try Something New Oh, and in case you were wondering, a group of 21-year-olds who were paying for a trip to Europe can, in fact, leave an airport to run around Chicago for a few hours. And once my friend got all the approvals she needed, we had an amazing time exploring the city. I don’t want you to miss out on all that God has prepared for you. That’s why I want to encourage you to train yourself to assume you can. Because when you do, you’ll try new things, see new things, experience new things, and grow in new ways. Now, don’t get me wrong: I’m not saying you need to change things just for the sake of changing them. If something in your life is rocking and rolling, keep doing that. However, don’t let things get stale in your life. Don’t keep doing what you’ve always been doing simply because you’ve always done it that way. Bring renewed vigor into your life by mixing things up a bit. Here are three tactical things you can do this week to try something new: 1. Add some personality. Maybe, up until this point, everything has been strictly business—in work, in your parenting, and in your marriage. That’s no fun! I want to encourage you to add some playfulness and humor into the mix. Don’t just show your followers the good stuff. Laugh at yourself as you show them some failures and mistakes you’ve experienced that week. Tell them all the ridiculous things that happened. People love that kind of realness. When you add personality to your business, it not only makes it fun for your followers, it makes it fun for you. Win-win! 2. Show behind the scenes. Have you ever noticed how reality TV shows will always show a person’s backstory before they get on the stage to sing or dance? Y’all, that’s on purpose. People love to hear other people’s backstories, especially when there’s a redemption angle. So, what can you share to become more relatable? I love the quote by Fred Rogers (Mister Rogers) that says, “Frankly, there isn’t anyone you couldn’t learn to love once you’ve heard their story.” This week, why not try pulling the curtain back and revealing a few secrets? 3. Learn something new. This is probably my favorite. You’ll never know the limits of your capabilities if you don’t learn something new. There are so many ways to do this: Listen to a new podcast, attend an event, read a new book, or seek out a new relationship. When you invite something new into your business and life, every part of you experiences growth. I know new things can be scary and overwhelming. But I promise you that everything you want— everything that’s good and worthwhile in the world—exists outside your comfort zone. So, assume that you can, try something new, and I promise you’ll be glad that you did. Embracing Change with Kelsey Humphreys Kelsey Humphreys is the queen of trying new things. Hence why introducing her consists of a long list of talents: She’s a speaker, comedienne, author, musician, YouTuber and host of The Kelsey Show podcast. In everything she does, she keeps one mission top-of-mind: To get you laughing and keep you moving toward your goals. I love that she uses so many different avenues to accomplish that mission. But how was she able to discover all those talents she’s capable of? You got it: By having the courage to try new things. Kelsey started her career in corporate advertising. She worked her way up the ladder when, one year, a frozen yogurt company reached out and asked her if she would run all of their marketing and branding for their more than 200 stores. This new giant client allowed her to leave the corporate world to start her own business as a freelancer. But when this major client was sold to another company, Kelsey had two options: She could seek out new clients and continue building her freelance business, or she could do what she really wanted to do—start her own show. The rest, as they say, is history. On this episode, Kelsey and I talk about:  How to discover who you are by trying new things How to overcome the fear of rejection What to do with failure when you try something new Discovering new avenues for pursuing what you love How to fit new things into what you’re already doing  Related:  Learning From Failure: How to Dust Yourself Off and Move Forward Setting the Right Expectations Every spring, my husband and I take an extended weekend vacation to the beach—just the two of us. After the long winter season, all we want is to spend a few days with the sun beaming down on our faces. As we were planning this trip, we kept coming across this one hotel that had great reviews. People recommended it again and again. It had a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach and oceanfront rooms. It had everything we wanted, so we booked it. The day finally came when it was time to fly down to Florida. But the moment we pulled into the hotel, I was confused. This hotel was not on the ocean. It was on a busy street. I was mystified because every single photo we saw online showed the hotel right on the beach. I was amazed at how they managed to manipulate the photos to suspiciously remove the busy street where the hotel actually sat. As you can imagine, all my excitement and anticipation for this trip diminished. I’d looked forward to walking out of the hotel and immediately stepping onto the sand. I’d fantasized about listening from my balcony as the waves crashed on the shore. And now, none of that would be possible. But here’s the thing: If the hotel’s website had mentioned that this hotel was on a busy street that led to another street actually connected to the beach, I wouldn’t have been disappointed when I arrived. I would’ve known exactly what I was signing up for, or I would’ve booked a different hotel that offered what I was looking for. It’s so easy to do this in business. You want to attract more customers, so you make big, grand promises. But do you know what happens if you don’t meet those expectations? Your customers are disappointed because you overpromised and under-delivered. Related:  The Right Way to Handle Your Competition So, I want to encourage you to do something different. I want you to under-promise and over-deliver to your clients. Be incredibly realistic and conservative with your quotes, timelines and capabilities. Be conservative about what you know you can do, and then blow your customers away. Exceed their expectations. When you do this, not only will your customers be much happier, but they’ll come back, too.  1:19 Three Tactical Things You Can Do This Week to Try Something New 13:37 Embracing Change with Kelsey Humphreys 41:44 Challenge to Set the Right Expectations for Your Customers  Resources Business Boutique Conference The Business Boutique Conference is coming back to Nashville Oct. 24–26.

Earlier this year, Cody and Justin from The FI Show interviewed me and asked some excellent questions about my journey to financial independence, entrepreneurship and passion, and minding the gap between your income and expenses. We talk about the importance of side hustling and how to create a well-paying job from your skills. We touch on real estate and why I chose this strategy to reach FI. We also discuss the bone I have to pick with the financial independence movement. Finally, we chat about what financial independence is really about, because it’s not about sipping margaritas on a beach. It’s about having the freedom to use your time in whatever way you want. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! Thank you to Cody and Justin for giving us permission to air this interview.

In light of that, we’re digging through the archives and airing some of my favorite interviews on the show, in between airing interviews I’ve done on other podcasts.\xa0 Welcome to another episode from our archives! This one was recorded in March 2018, and Dr. Wade Pfau had a ton of insight into the four percent rule that so many of us are concerned with. First, here’s a brief history of how the four percent rule came to be.\xa0 In 1994, William Bengen decided to look at 30-year timespans throughout U.S. History, beginning with the year 1926.\xa0 He worked under the assumption that a retiree held 50 percent stocks (in the form of S&P 500 Index), and 50 percent bonds (intermediate-term government bonds).\xa0 He looked at two things: the worst-case scenario, and how much an investor could sustainably withdraw from their portfolio under that worst-case scenario.\xa0 The year 1966 ended up being one of the worst to retire during, and an investor could withdraw 4.15 percent during the first year, and 4.15 percent, adjusted for inflation, every subsequent year.\xa0 That is how the 4 percent rule came to be.\xa0 Dr. Wade Pfau, a Professor of Retirement Income at The American College of Financial Services, argues that the 4 percent rule may not be the end-all-be-all we think it is. He voices his hesitations and explains how you can determine how much you can afford to spend in retirement on this episode.\xa0 Enjoy!

This originally aired back in 2016! Besides being another fun and fascinating interview, this is one of our most popular episodes. Which isn't surprising, given the topic we're exploring. :-) Financial independence means many things to many different people, which might be why we find it challenging to settle on a definition that everyone can agree on. Regardless of what your personal definition is, Joshua Sheats, a financial planner and host of the well-known Radical Personal Finance podcast, says that financial independence can be separated into seven stages. We explore these seven stages of FI in this episode, and we also talk about how to enjoy the journey no matter what stage you're at. Enjoy!

In light of that, we’re digging through the archives and airing some of my favorite interviews on the show, in between airing interviews I’ve done on other podcasts. I’m super excited to share an interview I did with Brad and Jonathan of ChooseFI back in December 2018. It was fun to have the tables turned, and Brad and Jonathan left no stone unturned in their interview with me. If you ever wanted to know my origin story, including where my love for travel comes from, where my desire for freedom came from, and how I combined both, then give this interview a listen. We talk about everything from:  How travel wasn’t a big part of my life until college How I prefer to travel Why the idea of mini-retirements is so important Making the transition from freelancing to having my own business and giving up that business in favor of focusing on Afford Anything Dealing with imposter syndrome Overcoming and working with a scarcity mindset What financial independence means to me The importance of self-care  Brad and Jonathan are two of the most thorough interviewers I’ve ever recorded with, and this interview was a lot of fun.

If you missed the last episode, you might want to listen to it before diving into this one, as Andrew and I go into the finer points of investing here. Seriously. This is one of the most in-the-weeds shows I’ve done to date. If you’re playing catch up: Andrew Hallam is a teacher who became a millionaire in his 30s and reached FIRE in his 40s. His starting salary was $28,000 - net. If you want to know how he did it, and what his first three rules of building wealth are, then listen to episode 212. Otherwise, tune into this episode, where we review his six other rules that can turn middle-class people into millionaires: Understand your inner psychology. Conquer the enemy in the mirror. Learn how to build a balanced, responsible portfolio. Create an indexed account, no matter where you live. Don’t resign yourself to taking this journey alone. Inoculate yourself against slick sales rhetoric. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.a While these rules sound simple on the surface, Andrew and I go way beyond that, talking about hedge funds, human psychology, and casinos. This was a favorite among listeners back in 2017 and it’s one of the most enjoyable interviews I did. I hope you enjoy! P.S. - We’ll return to our regular podcast production schedule in October!

In light of that, we’re digging through the archives and airing some of my favorite interviews on the show, in between airing interviews I’ve done on other podcasts. First up is a two-part interview with Andrew Hallam, a teacher who became a millionaire in his 30s and reached FI in his 40s. How? Beyond investing small sums (we’re talking less than $100 per month) throughout college, he also saved half of his starting salary of $28,000. This episode is for anyone who thinks it’s impossible to reach FIRE on a low salary. I originally interviewed Andrew in January 2017, and we could not stop talking. Which is why our three-hour interview was divided into two parts. In this first part, Andrew shares his story - how he became a millionaire, and why he wanted to achieve FIRE in the first place. He also shares three principles from his book, Millionaire Teacher: Nine Rules of Wealth You Should Have Learned in School: Rule 1: Spend like you want to grow rich. (Don’t waste money on junk.) Rule 2: Use the greatest financial ally you have. (Time.) Rule 3: Small percentages pack big punches. (Avoid high-fee funds.) As for the other six, they’re coming up in Part 2. :) Enjoy!

I’m writing this from Croatia, where I’m beginning five weeks of travel that I’m calling my September Sabbatical. From now through September 23rd, I’ll be exploring the globe and enjoying a one-month break. Today, I’m kicking things off with a community-based episode. Here’s the backstory behind today’s show: There’s an event called CampFI, which is a 3-4 day gathering for people who are interested in financial independence. CampFI holds around half a dozen events per year in various locations; I spoke at one in Colorado Springs this past July. While I was there, two other podcasters and I decided to interview the participants to find out their “why of FI.” What motivates them to build financial independence? These interviews and stories from the community are today’s episode. Enjoy! For more information, visit the show notes at http://affordanything.com/episode211 | #210: We live in a fascinating era: huge sections of society are more prosperous, advanced and safe than at any other point in human history, yet depression and anxiety are at record highs. It’s a paradox of progress: the richer the nation, the more likely its citizens are to suffer from mental health issues and report feeling crushing isolation and unhappiness. What gives? At the individual level, pursuing financial independence and early retirement (FIRE) often fills people with enthusiasm, purpose and meaning. Yet once people reach FIRE, they often report feeling purposeless or rudderless. It’s a paradox of hope: nothing kills a dream like achieving it. And in the absence of anything else for which to hope, a person becomes, by definition, hopeless. Ouch. When we’ve taken care of the bottom of the Maslow Pyramid, how do we find hope and meaning? How can we create purpose in a vast world? This week, I invited one of my favorite writers, megabestselling author Mark Manson, to join me on the Afford Anything podcast to discuss these critical issues. Mark Manson is the author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, which sold six million copies and became the #1 bestseller in 13 countries. His latest book, Everything is F*cked: A Book About Hope, lays a framework for finding hope and happiness in a confusing world.

They’re going overseas, where they’ll make their annual salary within six months. Where should they put their extra income? Anonymous also wants to know: how can they find a financial advisor they can actually trust? Another anonymous listener wants to know - is it possible to spend more while minimizing taxes in early retirement? JuanCarlos asks: is $20,000 too little to invest with a financial advisor? Angela is wondering how to create a Roth IRA account for a teenager. Rose is thinking about switching from mutual funds to index funds because it means encountering less fees, but her and her husband are in their 60s. Does this make sense? Ari has $700,000 to invest in a taxable brokerage account. He wants to know if a 90 percent total stock market index and 10 percent bonds is a good asset allocation. Dave and his wife want to use their defined benefit plans as their primary income stream in retirement, and supplement with Roth and 457 incomes. Where else should they be saving? Myself and former financial planner Joe Saul-Sehy answer these questions on today’s episode. Enjoy!

In reality, it’s usually a terrible investment.

This new podcast -- from the creators of Masters of Scale - was designed to create calm amid an always-on schedule.  The particular episode we’re sharing was inspired by Reid’s interview with Arianna Huffington, where she told a sliver of this story: it starts in the tiny Athens apartment where she grew up and takes her to the University of Cambridge. Listen for the lesson she learned from her mother ... about embracing life’s journey without being\xa0attached to the outcome. A lesson every founder needs to hear. Interspersed with the story, you\'ll hear prompts from a guide to help you center your mind; after the story, your guide leads you on a quiet meditation to help you recharge and refresh.\xa0If you like the effects - the way the episode makes you feel — subscribe to Meditative Story on the app you\'re using now. | When Anne Wojcicki co-founded 23andMe, she carved out a brand-new space in personal health -- helping people become experts on their bodies right down to the DNA level. Then the federal regulators came calling. But instead of trying to outwit, sneak past or straight-up fight the FDA in the name of moving fast, Wojcicki made the call to work with regulators directly and collaboratively. Hear how (and why) she embraced red tape. Cameo appearance: Daniel Ek of Spotify. | This short trailer offers a taste of a new podcast from the team that created Masters of Scale. And just like MoS, it\'s unlike anything you\'ve heard before. In each episode of Meditative Story, you\'ll hear a storyteller who will transport you to a time and place where everything changed for them, telling a story you might find yourself relating to deeply. As the story unfolds, mindfulness guide Rohan will offer gentle prompts to settle you more deeply into the story, and calm your mind.The entire experience is elevated with breathtaking music — all giving you the headspace to feel restored and refreshed.

Can you see it clearly enough to navigate toward it? Can you convince others to come along? Then you have to pivot away from your old idea. This can be incredibly difficult, because it involves humans. And humans don\'t tend to let go of old ideas easily. You risk blowback from your co-founders, your staff, your investors and your users. This will likely be be the single greatest test of your leadership skills, because your credibility will come under scrutiny. The moment you find the thing that your users cannot stop doing, you need to slash and burn the rest of your business. | Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd knows: The smallest feature can make or break your product. The challenge is recognizing the impact of that feature – and making sure it’s actually positive. This is what Wolfe Herd tapped into when she founded a dating app that required a whole new way of communication. She has become a master of understanding what her users want, and then making the small changes to Bumble that help them achieve their goals. While small changes typically lead to incremental improvements, every so often the impact is exponential. With cameo appearances by Steve Spohn (AbleGamer), and Marissa Mayer (Google, Yahoo). | Would-be entrepreneurs, this one\'s for you. It’s never too late to join the entrepreneurial party. We\'ve all heard the stories of young geniuses, but plenty of influential entrepreneurs founded companies in their 30s, 40s, 50s. There’s value to being a late-stage founder -- like the fact that you’re bringing along all your life experience. That’s what Gwyneth Paltrow did when she launched Goop. Paltrow transitioned from Hollywood star to startup founder with her lifestyle brand, which now has over 8 million subscribers -- and she did it by leaning in to what she knew, embracing what she didn’t, and coming up with strategies to fill the gap. With cameo appearances by Sara Blakely (Spanx), Brian Chesky (Airbnb), Boyd Martin (Olympic horse rider), and Ruben Harris (Career Karma). | On Masters of Scale, we talk a lot about how businesses grow. But we also talk about how people grow: How key decisions (and happy accidents) can shape your future, and how your setbacks can actually set you up for success. On this special Graduation Episode, guest host Jordan Harbinger teams up with Reid Hoffman to share advice that will help you navigate choices in your career. Including clips from Instagram\'s Kevin Systrom, Yahoo\'s Marissa Mayer, Spotify\'s Daniel Ek, and more.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'The best startup advice from Silicon Valley & beyond.

Remember, when you live in glass White Houses, you don\'t want to throw stones.Chinese Still Big U.S. InvestorsThe United States benefits from a lot of direct investment from overseas, particularly China.\xa0 Chinese invest a lot in U.S. businesses; they\'re big buyers of U.S real estate, and, of course, they\'re still big holders of U.S. Treasuries. If the United States says, "Well, Americans can\'t invest in China." what happens if the Chinese return the favor?\xa0 I think we have a lot more to lose than they do. I think the following day or maybe over the weekend the President kind of backtracked away from that trial balloon and they said, "No, we\'re not considering that." So probably that was good news and a relief for the market that that wasn\'t going to happen. | Check out my podcast, "What it Means to be an American", Episode 265Earthquake Hits Puerto RicoLast night, I was lying in bed, I wasn\'t asleep yet; I just finished watching television; my wife and I were still awake, and next thing we know, the house starts shaking. And it kept on shaking.\xa0 I couldn\'t believe I was in an earthquake. This was a decent-sized earthquake - it was over 6.0 on the Richter scale. The earthquake occurred in the ocean, but not too far from Puerto Rico.\xa0 I think it rattled a lot of the islands here in the Caribbean. I haven\'t felt an earthquake since I lived in California. To be honest, I never even considered earthquakes here in Puerto Rico.\xa0 I knew about hurricanes, but I really didn\'t think we would be hit by an earthquake - and we did.\xa0 Fortunately, it didn\'t do any actual damage; in fact, I don\'t think anything in Puerto Rico was damaged.\xa0 Of course, the big risk when you get earthquakes in the ocean is tsunamis - but that didn\'t happen.\xa0 In the meantime, I\'ve got a tropical storm overhead as I am recording this podcast.\xa0 Tropical Storm Karen has arrived in Puerto Rico later than expected.\xa0 It was supposed to come this morning but it didn\'t get here until this afternoon, although "Karen" doesn\'t sound particularly menacing, and it\'s living up to its name. It\'s really just a little rain, not too much wind; so that\'s not bad.Disaster in the Cryptocurrency MarketsThe real disaster is not here in Puerto Rico with earthquakes and tropical storms; it\'s the disaster that is unfolding in the cryptocurrency markets.\xa0 We are seeing some real carnage - a real bloodbath over there. I think this is just getting started, because we\'ve finally really broken down on the Bitcoin chart, although the biggest declines today are in the alt coins. Bitcoin is down about 13% right now. But this about the high that Bitcoin is been in the last half hour. We\'re trading up around $8500.\xa0 We did get as low as $8000; I think we maybe ticked below it briefly.\xa0 That means from the nearly $14000 high that\'s a better than 40% drop in the price of Bitcoin from that peak, which, by any definition constitutes a bear market. | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4These two videos were referenced in today\'s podcast:How government programs drive up college tuitionsIs a college degree worth the cost? You decideFed Proving Me RightAs I surmised, when I recorded my podcast on Wednesday, it seems pretty clear that the Federal Reserve has already returned to quantitative easing.\xa0 And that didn\'t take long, because they just ended QT (quantitative tightening) and they\'ve already begun QE. - Although, the Fed is not going to admit that that\'s what they\'re doing. Apart from proving me right, which was one of my forecasts from the very beginning, even before the Fed was talking about ending QE, I said they could never end it before they even started it.Monetary Roach MotelI had forecast what the Fed was going to do before they did it. And when they announced quantitative easing, not only did I say it was a mistake, but I said the Fed was checking us into a monetary roach motel from which we could never check out.\xa0 It was the delusion that we could check out - the Fed was able to convince the markets that it was a temporary policy and that they would only be doing it in an emergency, then they would unwind the policy and shrink their balance sheet and the market believed them.QE Plus Zero Interest Rates Equals Bigger ProblemI didn\'t believe them, and I was warning everybody that the Fed was either lying or didn\'t know what they were talking about or foolish, but the markets bought into this nonsense.\xa0 So, clearly, if the Fed were going to go back to quantitative easing, they would basically be admitting that the policy was a failure. Because the policy was intended to be temporary, not permanent. If they have to do it again, then it proves that it wasn\'t temporary.\xa0 Again, what I said, by doing quantitative easing in conjunction with lowering interest rates to zero, they were simply taking a debt problem and making it much bigger by encouraging even more debt. So once you load up with debt, once you encourage everybody to lever up, then you can\'t pull the rug out from under them. | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4No Surprises from the Fed: Quarter Point ReductionA lot has actually happened since I recorded my last podcast on Friday. I want to start with what happened today and then work backwards.\xa0 First of all the big news of the day is the Federal Reserve did exactly what the markets expected and reduced interest rates by a quarter point.Fed: "Mid-Course Correction"?This is the second quarter point reduction since the Fed reversed course on monetary policy and started what it once called a \'mid-course correction".\xa0 The markets didn\'t really like that, so the Fed kind of walked that back. Although, in the press conference today, Powell was asked about the "mid-course correction" and he kind of dodged it a little bit, but still maintained the pretense that all is well in the economy. But anyway, the Fed delivered the quarter point cut #2.\xa0 It is now targeting the Fed Funds Rate at between 1.75% and 2%.Short Term Interest Rates Back Below 2%So we now have short-term interest rates back below 2% - certainly on the way to zero, maybe even lower, we\'ll see.\xa0 Jerome Powell was specifically asked about negative interest rates during the Q&A session following the announcement.\xa0 He basically said the Fed is not really thinking about negative interest rates, or don\'t think they\'re going to be doing\xa0 negative interest rates, but of course we\'ll see what happens when we get to zero, and the problems are not solved. The Fed may well do negative interest rates; they may well not want to let that cat out of the bag just yet.Bullard:\xa0 "Interest Rates are Too High"At one point there was some anticipation that the Fed would do 50 basis points but by the time we actually got the announcement this morning, I don\'t think anybody was really looking for 50 basis points. Although, in the decision to reduce rates, Jim Bullard actually dissented and said that he wanted a 50 basis point rate cut, rather than the 25, but there were 2 other dissenters who didn\'t want any cuts at all. | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4Dow 200 Points from Record HighIt was pretty quiet today in the equity markets; the Dow Jones managed to inch up 37 points, closing at 27,219 but, you know, how we\'re less than 200 points away from a new all-time record high in the Dow Jones.Long on Bonds? Bad Friday 13th!But the real action today was in the bond market. If you\'re suspicious on this Friday the 13th, and you were looking for bad luck, that\'s where you would have found it, if you were long the bond market.\xa0 Now, I\'ve been talking about this bond market bubble for a long time - it\'s been inflating for a long time. Whether or not it\'s actually popped, well, we\'ll have to wait a little longer to find out.\xa0 But the carnage in the bond market that I mentioned on my last podcast has continued, with bonds continuing to suffer.Biggest Single Day Decline on 10-Year TreasuryIn fact, today was the biggest single day decline of the entire move.\xa0 The yield on the 10-year Treasury up to 1.903%.\xa0 Now, of course, it\'s still a very, very low yield, but when you consider that a week ago, we were as low as 1.429%.\xa0 That is a huge increase, percentage-wise, in the yield on the 10-year bond, which means a big drop in prices.Risk in Bonds if Interest Rates Go UpI\'m not sure the percentage decline; maybe 5 or 6% was the drop, which, in the stock market, that\'s not a big deal.\xa0 Stock prices could drip 5% in a week - no big deal. But when the price of a bond drops by 5% in a week, especially a Treasury bond - people think about Treasury bonds as being risk-free - well, there\'s actually a lot of risk.\xa0 Especially when you\'re buying a bond with such a low coupon. There\'s a lot of risk if interest rates go up, then the value of that bond is going to go down. | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4Millions of Americans were Affected by the Terrorist Attack on 9/11Today is the 18- year anniversary of the tragic events that surrounded the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon back in 2001.\xa0 I do not wish to make light of the suffering of the individuals who died tragically, not only the people who lost their lives on the ground, but also the ones aboard the airplane that crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. And, of course, thousands of families were profoundly affected by those events, and they\'re still affected by those events today.Loss of Liberty and FreedomSo, what I am about to say is not to minimize their suffering, but there are 300 million or so Americans who were not personally affected by those events, other than the fact that we certainly empathize with our fellow citizens who did have to endure the tragedy on a more personal level.\xa0 But on a broader level, the biggest loss, historically, from those events is not just the loss of lives and the family members who lost loved ones, but all Americans who lost individual liberty and freedom.Self-Inflicted LossThat is the real tragedy, historic tragedy of 9/11. The tremendous loss of individual liberty and freedom. America today is a far less free society than it was prior to those attacks 18 years ago. And that means that the terrorists won. They didn\'t win based on the damage that they inflicted.\xa0 They won based on the damage that we inflicted on ourselves. The self-inflicted wounds are much greater on a national scale than the terrorists\' direct acts.And it\'s not just the 300 million Americans who are alive today. It\'s all the Americans yet to be born who are going to be born into a society that is far less free than America would have been but for these attacks. | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4The Numbers Really Look Bad in Private PayrollsWhere the\xa0 numbers really start\xa0 to get bad is when you look at the private payrolls.\xa0 There, they were expecting 150,000 private sector jobs created. The private sector jobs are far more important than the government jobs.\xa0 The private sector jobs are self-sustaining. The tax payers are on the hook for paying the salaries of the government workers and the private sector employees, by and large are actually productive.\xa0 They\'re making our lives better.Manufacturing is Very WeakThey were looking for 150,000 private sector jobs; we got just 96,000 jobs. AND, they revised last month\'s private payrolls down from 148,000 to 131,000.\xa0 Manufacturing - very weak: they were looking for 8,000 jobs - instead, we added just 3,000 manufacturing jobs in August and last month, July, they originally said that we created 16,000 manufacturing jobs and we only created 4,000 manufacturing jobs.34,000 Jobs Created in Category "Government"Now if you actually look at the breakdown of all the jobs that were created, 34,000 jobs were created in the category of "government".\xa0 So, of all the different job categories, the one that added the most was government - 34,000 jobs. I think about 20,000 of these people were temporary hires associated with the 2020 Census. Where\'s the money coming from to pay for these government jobs?\xa0 It\'s being borrowed. We\'re borrowing more money to hire more government workers.\xa0 Of course, ultimately the taxpayers are on the hook for paying all these salaries, for paying interest on the money\xa0 borrowed, to pay all these salaries.Slowest Job Growth in Private Sector Creation in 8 YearsIn fact, if you look at the private sector job creation so far in the Trump Presidency, this year, 2019, is on track to have the slowest growth in private sector job creation in 8 years. Trump is out there talking about how this is the greatest economy ever - he\'s the greatest jobs president ever.\xa0 We\'ve got the manufacturing sector, the weakest it\'s been in 10 years, we have the slowest growth in private sector payrolls in 8 years - this is a disaster! | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4Silver DID Join Gold\'s PartyBack in mid-July I titled my podcast, "Is Silver Finally Joining Gold\'s Party?". Well, I think we know the answer to that question. Since I recorded that podcast about a month and a half ago, the price of silver is up another 15%.\xa0 In fact, it\'s up better than 30% since the end of May. Silver having a sterling performance today. As I am recording this podcast, it\'s about an hour after the close of the U.S. market, we\'re up almost 90 cents an ounce. We\'re at 19.22.Gold Still Meeting Resistance at $1,550Gold, not quite having as strong a day as silver; gold isn\'t making a new high.\xa0 It\'s up $19.50 on the day: $1548.\xa0 Still having some problems with the $1550 resistance area. GLD, the exchange-traded ETF did make a new high for this move, but the spot market did not register a new high - but I think that\'s just a matter of days - if not hours - before that happens.Silver is Leading the ChargeBecause silver is leading the charge. It\'s leading gold higher; pretty much the way I said.\xa0 A week ago, I titled my podcast, "Hi Ho Silver, Away" and that prompted a number of people to comment that somehow I had just capped the silver rally by getting too optimistic on silver.\xa0 Well, that was a week ago.\xa0 We just hit $18.00, we\'re now over $19.00, and I said on that podcast, I thought we would have a pretty quick move up to about $20, and once we take out $20, I think this thing could really, really take off.Overdue Move Down in the DollarWhat is going to be the catalyst, I think, for a much bigger move up in both gold and silver is going to be the long overdue move down in the dollar. Paradoxically, when the dollar starts its decline, it is even possible that gold and silver take a bit of a breather, or maybe pull back a little bit, in terms of dollars, but pull back even more in terms of other currencies. Remember, as strong as gold has been in dollars, it has been even stronger in other currencies. | Don’t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the\xa0New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4Let\'s Debunk Andy Yang\'s PlatformI decided to take a little time out on my Labor Day to record a podcast debunking Democratic Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang. I\'ve been getting a lot of emails about Yang; especially since he did the Joe Rogan Podcast about six months ago.\xa0 He said a lot of things that certain people find appealing, so I\'ve been asked to comment on him and I\'ve seen other notes about Andy Yang and I wanted to talk about him because, number one, he is rising in the polls. He\'s now in sixth place among the Democratic candidates; he\'s polling at about 3% ant that puts him ahead of established politicians like Cory Booker, Beto O\'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, so he\'s gaining in popularity and I think the trend is going to continue.Yang Rising in the PollsThe next Democratic Debate is coming up in about a week and a half and they\'re no longer going to have two debates; they\'ve narrowed it down to just ten candidates and Andy Yang is one of those 10.\xa0 I think as there are fewer candidates in the race, Yang is going to get more and more attention from the media and I think he is going to rise in the polls.Attractive Among a Bunch of Democratic SocialistsTo me, he is like the Bernie Sanders of this campaign. Sanders, and "Feeling the Bern"… he was popular in the 2016 campaign, mainly because he was the only alternative to Hillary Clinton, who was extremely unpopular.\xa0 So, given that matchup and there was only two choices, it made it very easy for Sanders to gain a lot of support.\xa0 He\'s having a much harder time galvanizing that support this time because people have a lot of alternatives. If you want a Democratic Socialist, there\'s a bunch of them to choose from.Clearly a Smart Guy… ButBut a guy like like Andy Yang, a younger guy, and clearly a smart guy.\xa0 I had not watched his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience until just yesterday.\xa0 I decided to watch it, and that\'s the motivation for doing this podcast. Once I heard him talk about his ideas, I spent a lot of time on his website looking at a lot of things he didn\'t discuss with Joe Rogan.\xa0 One thing is certainly clear to me: he\'s a smart guy.\xa0 Clearly, if you gave an IQ test to all of the Democratic candidates, Yang would win. | Recorded August 30, 2019Don\'t miss my upcoming appearances:The Las Vegas Trading Conference, Oct. 4-5The Dallas Money Show October 13-14and the New Orleans Investment Conference, Nov. 1-4Waiting for Hurricane DorianWhen I recorded my last podcast on Tuesday evening, we were getting ready for Hurricane Dorian, which was supposed to pass by the south coast 0f Puerto Rico on Wednesday.\xa0 But when I woke up on Wednesday morning, the meteorologists had the hurricane pretty much coming right over my house. It had changed course and had moved north, and it was supposed to come right through Puerto Rico, rather than just go by it to the South. But then the hurricane kept moving north, and it ended up missing Puerto Rico completely.\xa0 We were here, the kids were home from school, everybody was battened down waiting for what at that time was maybe a strong tropical storm… maybe a category 1 hurricane.Puerto Rico Spared from HurricaneBut we didn\'t even get a rain drop. Not even a gust of wind, as the hurricane just missed Puerto Rico to the north. I think it did go by the U.S. and British Virgin Islands - didn\'t really do much damage, there, because the store hadn\'t intensified but Puerto Rico\'s gain will be Florida\'s loss. The storm did not go over Puerto Rico, and initially it was supposed to go over the Dominican Republic, and the mountains there, it\'s a much bigger island, and it would have really beaten up the storm, but because the storm was really uninterrupted, and it has been over water the entire time, now it looks like it will be a category 4 when it hits somewhere along the Florida coast. It looks like a pretty powerful storm.Broken Window TheoryYou\'re going to hear, as is always the case, economists are going to be saying, "Oh, well, this is good for GDP." Whenever there\'s a hurricane, people say, "Oh, look!\xa0 We have to spend all this money repairing and rebuilding everything that was destroyed."\xa0 But that is not good for the economy. If you haven\'t heard the "Broken Window Theory", Henry Hazlitt does a very good job of explaining that and refuting the Keynesian idea that disasters are somehow good for the economy.', 'chan_desc': 'Peter Schiff is an economist, financial broker/dealer, author, frequent guest on national news, and host of the Peter Schiff Show.

My guest today believes we must start by teaching important words at a young age.\xa0 Chana Ginelle Ewing is an accomplished entrepreneur. She’s the founder and CEO of Geenie. It’s a self-development platform for black women. She’s also a recently published author having just released her first book, An ABC of Equality. The book aims to teach children and everyone of all ages about the world we live in and how to navigate our way through it by breaking down keywords, from ability, to gender, to multiculturalism. While the book doesn’t speak specifically about money, Chana and I had a very deep conversation around our early understandings of what money is, its constructs, its influences (for me, the all too economically charged school cafeteria growing up in Massachusetts) and so much more. You can learn more about Chana and her book on her website, ChanaEwing.com and connect with her on Instagram @chanaewing and on Twitter @chanaewing | Overwhelmed, over-worked, and feeling like you just can’t ever get enough done?

My guest today co-founded a company we all know, that fundamentally changed the way that we experience media. Marc Randolph is a veteran entrepreneur and investor who\'s best known for co-founding and serving as CEO of Netflix. I\'m sure you\'ve heard of Netflix. How do you take an idea to rent movies over the internet and turn it into a company with some 150 million subscribers? Well, it takes grit, it takes gut instincts, it takes failure and determination. Marc\'s book, That Will Never Work, is out now. It\'s about taking a leap in business and in life to bring your ideas to market and change the world. Marc and I talk about the beginnings of Netflix, borrowing money from his mother and what happened in that meeting with Blockbuster all those years ago when they actually pitched Blockbuster to buy Netflix.\xa0 | Kelly Brogan is a holistic psychiatrist who has gone through a radical transformation in her career. When she began her career she was — as she says — great at prescribing drugs. But after an experience treating her own thyroid condition, she put down her prescription pad. In the nine years since then, she’s focused her work on treating and healing her patients with more natural solutions. In her new book, Own Your Self, Kelly shares how she believes people can become free from depression, anxiety, and fatigue and finally become their real selves.

The problem is that we create complexity for ourselves, which virtually guarantees getting bogged down. We may achieve one goal but miss ten. It’s discouraging.\xa0 The problem is that you’re trying to do too much too fast. In this episode, we’ll show you how to narrow your focus to just two or three goals per quarter. When you do, you’ll go from achieving just one or two goals a year, to nailing nearly all of them most of the time. Finally, you can start celebrating wins almost every month. | You want to be a high achiever, but sometimes you feel more like a plate spinner. Between your goal sheet, project management app, daily to-do list, and calendar, you’re managing a lot of details. It’s overwhelming, and something inevitably hits the floor.\xa0 We’ve got the answer. What you need is not one more app to throw in the mix. You need a system that binds all these elements of productivity together. We call it the Goal Achievement Formula.\xa0 Try this, and you’ll finally stop feeling like a juggler at work. All of your projects, goals, and tasks will be in alignment. And? You’ll get more done than ever before. | Everybody has big projects or goals they’d like to achieve. The problem is that our “real work” keeps us from making progress on our goals. It’s frustrating to watch your goals slip away, or get sidelined for another year.\xa0 But that can change! We’ve got a simple hack that will ensure you make progress on your goals every single week. And it really works! It’s time to trade your frustration for achievement. You’ll make huge progress on your goals and end every week feeling on top of your game. | You’re a high achiever, which means you want to get things done! The problem is that no matter how many apps, hacks, and time-management systems you try, you still get caught up in the whirlwind of the modern workplace. It leaves you feeling that something’s wrong with—or missing from—what you’re doing.\xa0 There is! And we know what it is. You don’t need a new system, hack, or app to make you more productive. You need to change the way you think about productivity and achievement.\xa0\xa0 When you adopt the Full Focus mindset, you’ll instantly go from feeling scattered and overworked to feeling calm, focused, and in control. You’ll escape that feeling that “something’s missing” from your approach to work, and you’ll start to experience a greater level of productivity than you ever thought possible. | Everyone wants to be productive at work. But there is just too much to do! Your to-do list grows throughout the day, and you never get finished—no matter how long you work. It’s exhausting. But we’ve got the answer.\xa0\xa0By narrowing your to-do list, you’ll actually achieve more by doing less. As a result, you’ll escape the sick feeling of always being behind, and you’ll get your most important work done every day. This one change will transform your days from out of control to perfectly focused. | Start loving Mondays!

This is one area I really struggle with so reading his new book and, of course, having this conversation proved to be transformative for me. I know it will be for you too. MAINE EVENT Many of you already know that a couple of months ago we held our first-ever Maine Event.

With me getting involved in hunting over the past several years, I’ve been more intimately connected to the outdoors than I ever have.So, when Coyote Peterson’s team reached out, I knew it would make for an interesting discussion (And, if you have children, they’re really going to like this one). Today, we talk about nature, encouraging youth to get involved in the wild, the unintended consequences of excessive human interaction with nature, where Coyote and I disagree on hunting, and, ultimately, some of his craziest animal encounters. SHOW HIGHLIGHTS  Introducing animals to the digital space A lasting legacy\xa0 Learning about the world Differentiating yourself\xa0 Interacting with nature\xa0 Hunting for survival Conservation efforts Being in-tune with animals\xa0 Creating your own experiences\xa0 Encouraging kids to read The Sting Pain Index Inspiring future generations\xa0  COYOTE PETERSON Nathaniel “Coyote” Peterson is a wildlife educator and the host of the Brave Wilderness YouTube channel with nearly 15,000,000 subscribers. I was first introduced to Coyote by my two oldest sons while they were on YouTube and asked me to come watch this “crazy guy who intentionally gets stung and bit by animals.” He’s also the author of 4 books, the host of a new Animal Planet television show set to be aired early next year, and the recipient of an Emmy for one of his series’ called, Breaking Trail.This one is a little different than you might be used to on the Order of Man podcast but if you’re interested in hearing our intelligent disagreement/discussion about hunting and, if you have children, you’re definitely going to want to tune in.I hope you enjoy my podcast with the fascinating and interesting Coyote Peterson.

Today, I have the honor of talking with André Almeida (he simply goes by “Dedeco”), a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Blackbelt who has been practicing for over 30 years. We talk about his rocky past in Brazil, how Jiu-Jitsu saved his life, what to look for when getting started on your own path, and the mindset needed to be a successful Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. SHOW HIGHLIGHTS  Watching from the sideline Experiencing variances in life Learning opportunities\xa0 Growing up in Rio de Janeiro Building self-confidence\xa0 First-class mentorship\xa0 Relocating to America\xa0 How to get involved in Jiu-jitsu Helping others grow The importance of lineage Basic starting points for beginners Learning through vulnerability\xa0 The power of a small arsenal\xa0 Developing your style  ANDRE “DEDECO” ALMEIDA Today, I have the honor of introducing you to my friend, Dedeco. Dedeco and I met last year at Origin’s Immersion Camp and since then, he’s become a friend and a bit of a mentor (although mostly online via social media). And, with as many questions as I’ve received about me starting Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I can’t think of anyone better to talk with that him.  Dedeco has been practicing Jiu-Jitsu for more than 30 years and credits his life to being introduced to the art. He’s a Brazilian National Champion, 3x State Champion, and 2x Pan American medalist.On top of that, he’s one of the most sincere and genuine people that I know and I can’t wait for you to hear our conversation. I hope you enjoy, gentlemen.IRON COUNCIL Most of you know about the Iron Council by now. It’s our exclusive brotherhood designed to give you the tools, resources, and accountability you need to thrive and accomplish your biggest objectives.This month, we’re talking about being prepared for emergencies and potentially catastrophic events. But more than talking about these things, we’re actively working towards making ourselves more capable husbands, fathers, business owners, and community leaders. That’s why we issue challenges and assignments as tools to bridge the gap between what we know we should be doing and what we’re actually doing.If you want to band with us and take the leap from knowledge to action and accomplish more in the next 3 months than you potentially have all year, head to www.orderofman.com/ironcouncil.

Our conversation is about one specific issue that has popped up as a topic of interest in the investing community in recent months: the comparison between bringing a company public through a traditional IPO vs. what’s known as a direct listing. As a third party observer with no real dog in the hunt (as we don’t buy IPOs at O’Shaughnessy Asset Management), I thought this was a small and nuanced issue. I’ve therefore been surprised by the strength of opinions on both sides of this issue as I’ve explored it behind the scenes this past week. It feels almost like I’ve encountered a political third rail, where one side throws a lot of vitriol towards the other.\xa0 To be clear, this episode is very much in favor of direct listings instead of traditional IPOs. For those that want a good discussion of the IPO process and its upsides, check out episode 173 of the Exponent podcast with Ben Thompson.\xa0 Now please enjoy my very interesting conversation with Bill Gurley \xa0 For more episodes go to InvestorFieldGuide.com/podcast.

Albert studied economics at Harvard and earned a PhD in information from technology, but if you’d asked me to guess before looking those up, I’d have guessed that he studied philosophy because of how widely he has thought about the world and the impact of technology. Our conversation is about how technology is changing the world from an Industrial Age to a knowledge age. We explore how cryptocurrencies, low cost computing, and regulation will impact our future and why the transition may require delicate care. I loved this conversation because of my obsession with the concept of scarcity. We explore what has been scarce through time and what may be scarce in the future.

I first met Matt almost 10 years and, in that time, I’ve grown to respect him as much as any investor that I’ve ever met. Now having spent time with Ian, who specializes in oil and gas field exploration companies and the rest of the Deep Basin team, I have similar respect and admiration for all of them. Deep Basin does almost the exact opposite of what us quants do. In fact, their entire goal is to build a portfolio of mostly idiosyncratic or stock specific risk, the very thing us quants mostly remove from portfolios. Deep Basin positions the portfolio to make a series of carefully constructed bets, long and short, without taking market risk, style-factor risk, or even commodity risk. They use a hybrid fundamental and quantitative process which we explore in detail.\xa0 This is definitely another good example of who we are all up against in public markets. What makes this story unique is that we are investors in Deep Basin’s management company and so have a clear interest in their ongoing success. Listeners know that I want to be as transparent as possible on this podcast so we event spend a little time telling the story about how it all came together a few years ago. I have learned a ton about investing from my countless hours with this team and hope that this conversation gives you a glimpse into what is happening at the cutting edge of investing in the world of hedge funds.

Several years ago he left Morningstar to form his own asset management firm, Dorsey asset management, and build a portfolio of companies with wide moats like those he studied at Morningstar. And while moats are critical, equally important is how companies allocate the capital generated--or made possible--by the existence of the moat.\xa0\xa0 A special thank you to Brian Bares who introduced me to Pat, and to Will Thorndike--an earlier guest on the show.

Stedi is a platform for exchanging and automating 300+ types of business-to-business transactions - transactions like purchase orders, invoices, etc. It’s a modern take on an archaic protocol called EDI - electronic data interchange, something I’d never even heard of until several months ago. Learning about EDI is a bit like finding out about the Matrix - every physical object you come across, from the food you ate for breakfast to the clothes you’re wearing and consumer electronics you use - anything with a barcode on it - was likely touched by EDI, often dozens of times before making it into your hands. Stedi is the first update to this messaging later in decades. Our conversation in this podcast is about business in general, starting with Zack’s fascination with Walmart and Amazon. I should also not that my family is a recent investor in Stedi, and I’m thankful to have learned a great deal from him over the past few months.

And just as important today. ------------------------------------------- For most of us, our jobs are the economic engine that drive every aspect of our financial plan. One of the worst things that can happen is to lose a job. If the engine on your car dies, you\'re going to be stuck by the side of the road for a while. That\'s not pleasant for anyone, even if you\'re stuck in a safe area. But, if you\'re driving up a mountain (paying off debt and digging yourself out of a hole), having your engine die can be disastrous. And, if you have a destination in mind (financial independence), losing the engine in your car will at least delay you from reaching your destination. So, the key is plan in advance to not lose the engine. Make sure you\'re doing the things you need to be doing now to avoid being laid off. Obviously, you can\'t guarantee that you\'ll never be laid off, but you can do a lot to improve your possibilities! On today\'s show, we cover:  The need to proactively improve your position within your company, your company\'s position within the industry, and your industry\'s overall prospects in advance.

The “traditional” method is to send out dozens, even hundreds of emails to other site owners trying to land a guest post.

His approach to SEO and link building is a little different. “Build friend’s first, not links,” is Brendan’s motto when it comes to outreach.

Tune in to hear Brendan explain how you can create your own Dream 100 list of the sites you’d like to work with to grow your business.

Looking for ways to turn a service or a skill you already have into a digital product? This is exactly what Matt Bochnak of HowtoMotorcycleRepair.com has done. He’s turned a "blue collar" service business--repairing motorcycles--into a lucrative business with multiple streams of time-leveraged income. This is a “Where are they now?” episode. I first caught up with Matt early in 2016 when he was a guest on  episode 160 of the Side Hustle Show. Back then, Matt’s revenue split was about 50/50 between repairing bikes and selling the video guides of the repairs. Overall, his business was doing around $800-$1,000 a month. Fast forward almost 4 years later and Matt is earning $4,000-$5,000 a month, still on the side from his day job. What’s more impressive is that this boost in revenue is mostly from passive income streams, and he’s spending less time than ever in his garage. If this sounds like a side hustle you’d like to replicate with your own business, tune in to hear how Matt’s creating content without repairing customer\'s motorcycles, and the various passive income streams he’s built up over the past 4 years. Related: Need a website for your service business? Here’s the  fastest and cheapest way to get one online. | A small blog doesn\'t have to mean a small income. By helping a specific group of people solve their problems, Carol Tice has attracted more than 1500 members -- at $25 a month -- to join her community. Note: Click here to download Carol’s top tips for starting and growing a paid membership community from this episode. Carol went from working as a freelance writer, to coaching others how to become freelance writers, to building one of the largest online membership sites for freelance writers. (I found Carol while doing keyword research for terms like “get paid to write” and “make money writing” – and Carol OWNS this space.) The best part is that the paid membership model is an awesome way to build an online business, and it’s a model that can be applied to just about any niche. It didn’t come without sacrifice for Carol, who was working full-time and had two preschoolers when she started her blog. “I didn’t see a TV show, I didn’t go out to a movie, I didn’t go to dinner parties,” Carol explained. But with hard work, a laser-focused attitude towards her goals, and good communication with her audience, Carol has built something special for freelance writers. Tune in to hear how Carol built her membership site from the ground up. She explains how she uses funnels to constantly bring in new members, and how she keeps members engaged (any paying) for the long-haul. You’ll learn loads of actionable stuff, and how you can also apply the same tactics to develop a recurring revenue business of your own. | I wish I was half as smart now as I was at 16! But learning everything you don\'t know is part of the process. One thing I love about my work is I feel like I learn new things every day. Sometimes they\'re small little tweaks and hacks, and other times they\'re broader strategies or ideas. I originally drafted this list 7 years ago, after my 30th birthday, but decided it was due for an update. (I updated it at 35, too, but keep learning more!) For context, that was pre-Side Hustle Nation, pre-podcast, pre-kids, and pre-almost everything I\'m working on now. I\'d been a full-time entrepreneur for 4 years already at that point, but my business had seen lots of ups and downs. Turning 30 had hit me harder than I expected it to, and I\'m guessing it was because I really wasn\'t where I wanted to be. I\'d been battling with flaky developers, fighting with the state Assembly in Sacramento over affiliate marketing tax laws, and we were in the process of short-selling our home -- which had been a major source of stress. Seven years later, that stuff is thankfully in past, and I’m in a better place today. That\'s not to say I\'m completely stress-free, but I\'m incredibly fortunate to have a healthy family and to get to work on stuff I love every day. Each year that goes by makes me more and more aware of that fact. But the life I have today didn\'t happen overnight. It\'s the result of literally decades (well, at least 2) of entrepreneurial education, trial and error, hustle, and if I\'m being totally honest, luck. In any case, here are 37 life lessons I\'ve picked up in my 37 years on this planet. Enjoy! | The fastest way to multiply money? It might be reselling. That is, buy low, sell high, repeat. Keely Stawicki started reselling when she was just 12 years old, flipping a horse saddle on Craigslist and making $100 profit. Fast forward 15 years--and more than $270,000 in sales--and reselling is now her full-time gig. Today, Keely focuses mostly on vintage goods, clothing, and furniture--all items in great demand right now. Reselling is a business model we keep coming back to because it checks some of the boxes for an awesome side hustle:  Anybody can do it It doesn\'t require a huge upfront investment It’s quick to get started and see results  If this sounds like a side hustle you’re interested in, listen in to hear Keely’s top tips for sourcing profitable inventory, the types of products she sees doing well today, and where she lists and markets her items for maximum exposure and profitability. | Buy a house. Rent it out. Tenants pay it off for you. It’s possibly one of the oldest side hustles in the books, right? Done right, owning rental properties can be an attractive long-term income and wealth-building strategy. But done wrong, it can be a recipe for headaches and a mountain of debt.\xa0 It’s a side hustle that I know a lot of the Side Hustle Nation readers and listeners are interested in (as am I). For this one, I collected my own real estate investing questions, and gathered more from the Side Hustle Nation Facebook community. On the other end of the line is Zach Evanish, a remote real estate investor and Director of Retail for Roofstock.\xa0\xa0 Roofstock is a marketplace designed to make it easy to shop for, compare, and purchase rental properties. (Zach was Roofstock employee #3 -- and has bought 11 rental properties of his own through the platform.) | She always knew she wanted to start her own business, she just didn’t know what kind of business. Sound familiar? So, Sylvia Inks asked friends and colleagues what they saw her as an expert in, and what they go to her for advice and help with. Their answers? “They said I’m great with finances, and they said I have great research skills,” Sylvia told me. This helped Sylvia narrow down her focus to financial coaching. From there she started networking, wrote a book, and worked diligently on her presentation and speaking skills. Her business has taken off as a result. Tune in to hear how Sylvia found her niche, found her first clients, and continues to level up her impact and income. As you listen in, you\'ll notice the common theme throughout the call: conversations + action. |  | Michele Mattix of SedonaMeditationExperiences.com has a unique side hustle where she gets paid to breathe. As a tagline that sounds great, but there’s a lot more to her side hustle than just breathing. In fact, in Michele’s own words she describes her business as helping, “people experience the spiritual side of Sedona and to bring more awareness and wellness into their life through meditation, mindfulness, and a deep connection with nature.” Michele is able to offer all of this because she is a certified meditation instructor. The interesting part is how she\'s managed to carve out a profitable business model in the experience economy using Airbnb’s Experiences platform. When travelers book a stay in Arizona using Airbnb, they are also offered one of Michele’s meditation experiences -- at a cost of course. This enables Michele to take advantage of the huge marketing machine that is Airbnb. They drive the traffic and raise awareness of her meditation experiences, and it’s paying off. Tune in to hear how Michele found her first experience customers, what she’s done to market and grow her business, and how you may be able to apply the same strategies to an experience of your own. | It’s time to dive into the ol’ listener mailbag and answer a few questions in this week’s\xa0edition of The Side Hustle Show.

We also discuss the fact that everyone has a different capacity and how you should never compare yourself and what you’re capable of to that of someone else. The conversation goes on a bit of a tangent and we go OFF THE RAILS, but we finish things off by leaving you with three pieces of homework: try and figure out what your capacity is, make a vision board, and if you really want something, tell yourself you want it and you deserve it and then work hard for it.This week’s podcast is brought to you by…Ruggable is one of our sponsors and we are all about these machine washable, waterproof, stain resistant and non-toxic rugs (because how could you not be?!).

He is the author of 11 books, my favorites being The Affluent Investor and The Overtaxed Investor. We really focus on taxes in this episode, especially investment-related taxes. Phil says that doctors are ducks in a shooting gallery. We are the most vulnerable people in terms of taxes and we need to learn to defend ourselves as best we can. In this episode we look at all the tax reducing tactics like maximizing the use of retirement accounts, using tax efficient investments in your taxable accounts, getting your asset location right, making sure your dividends are qualified and that your capital gains are long-term, depreciating real estate, tax loss harvesting, donating appreciated shares to charity to flush those capital gains out of your portfolio, getting a step up in basis at death, etc. Which of these tactics will make the most impact? Listen to this episode to figure it out. Contract Diagnostics http://contractdiagnostics.com/ is a long-term advertiser with us here at WCI. I love this company as they’ve helped hundreds of WCI get a ‘fair shake’ when it comes to reviewing and understanding their employment contracts – its 100% they do there.

They\'ve have helped many of your WCI colleagues. | See the show notes for this episode at https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/ One listener asked about how to rebalance his portfolio. A lot of people still get confused about this. He said rather than sell from the oversized asset, and transfer the proceeds to the undersized one, he has always just invested additional funds out of pocket and purchased more of the smaller one. He wanted to know if he was making a mistake. I encourage people to look at their portfolio in its entirety and not at individual accounts when rebalancing. I think most people will find in the first half of their career at least, that it is very rare that they have to sell an appreciated asset in a taxable account in order to rebalance. Most people will find that they can rebalance with just the new contributions, especially in their first decade of saving. And especially if they have been reading the WCI blog or listening to the podcast, they probably have been maxing out some significant retirement account and can do their rebalancing inside those accounts. I recommend you do your rebalancing inside the tax deferred accounts with new contributions if possible. We get into more details on this as well as answer questions about buying a home while still having student loans, using leveraged ETFs in order to maximize tax loss harvesting and donation of appreciated shares, deducting travel expenses, how to start a taxable account, and negotiating an employment contract.

He blogs for advisors who are serious about their craft, the ones who actually view this profession as a calling and want to get better at it. He wants to teach them how to be a more successful advisors and how to serve their clients better with more expertise. He believes that most harm inflicted on clients by their advisors doesn\'t occur because of malice or greed but out of ignorance and he wants to help provide a higher standard for competency. We discuss financial advisors acting as fiduciaries and what training we should expect our advisors to receive and what services they can provide. We talk about assets under management fees and whether we will see the end to them in our lifetime or not. We discuss conflicts of interest and advisors trying to specialize in different types of clientele. But he really wanted you to take away from this discussion that you have to get pretty far down the line of investing portfolios before the growth rate of your portfolio is larger than the impact by just spending less than you make and figuring out how to grow your income.

I\'ll just wait, because if I pay them back and then they cancel them, I\'m out of luck." Now for some of you this might sound crazy but this is the thought process for many people right now. Should people be changing their student loan plan based on the discussion of canceling and forgiving loans that politicians are currently having? We discuss this question in today\'s episode. But bear in mind presidential candidates make a lot of promises that they don\'t keep. We have a long history of that. Plus a lot would need to happen for this to take place like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren being elected and then getting a plan to cancel student loan debt through Congress. But even more than all that historically legislature like this does not favor the top 1% of income earners in our country. As a physician the chance that any kind of forgiveness or cancelation of student loans will really make a difference in the amount of money you owe is very low. We also discuss in this episode gender neutral disability insurance policies, VTI or VTSAX in a taxable account, what to do with a traditional IRA, disclaimers for physicians giving personal finance lectures, when to cancel your disability policy, dealing with multiple 401(k)s, and the most tax efficient investment to put in a taxable account.

In this podcast episode I interview Dr. Disha Spath, of the https://www.thefrugalphysician.com/ who did just that. They were stressed about money and making limit progress towards being debt free, so her and her husband made some drastic changes in their life. The result? They paid off $208,000 in student loans in 17 months. How did they do it? Focusing on the big expenses; housing, cars, and food. They tried to be intentional in their spending, ensuring that they were spending on things that brought them joy. Doctors are in the top 1- 5% when it comes to income in this country.

In this episode I discuss quarterly payments or a way to avoid making them if you have W2 income as well to avoid penalties by being in the safe harbor. Bear in mind, what you pay in advance or what is withheld, may have little to no relationship to how much tax you actually owe. So I discuss what we do in our monthly financial plan to ensure that we have adequate money to pay our tax bill come April 15th. Spoiler - investing your money set aside for taxes is a bad idea. You really don\'t want to owe money to the IRS. They have a lot of rights that most lenders do not have, like being able to garnish your paychecks, take money out of your bank account, and send you to jail. We also discuss your term life insurance needs and how to invest that insurance money in the unfortunate situation that you become the beneficiary of a term life insurance payout.

As long as your foreign tax paid is less than $300 single, or $600 married, it is a rather straightforward process. However, once that threshold is breached, the more complicated form is required come income tax time. The good news is if you\'re doing your own taxes, you\'re probably using tax software, and it does this all automatically in the background. But for those with higher foreign tax form 1116 is required. We discuss this in the episode so if this applies to you, make sure you are getting your tax credit.

From the cosmetics maker in California grappling with Donald Trump\'s tariff war, to the coffee vendor in Argentina burdened by the nation\'s never-ending crises, Bloomberg\'s 130-plus economic reporters and economists around the world head into the field to tell these stories. Stephanomics will also look hard at the solutions, in the lead-up to Bloomberg’s second New Economy Forum in Beijing, where a select group of business leaders, politicians and thinkers will gather to chart a better course on trade, global governance, climate and more. Stephanomics will help lead the way for those debates not just with Bloomberg journalists but also discussion and analysis from world-renowned experts into the forces that are moving markets and reshaping the world. The new season of Stephanomics launches Oct. 3. | For years, China has experienced blistering growth. Driven by an investment-heavy economic model, this growth has limited household income while subsidizing business. This system worked extraordinarily well for years, but the system has recently been hitting its limits. On this week\'s Odd Lots, we speak with Michael Pettis, a longtime China expert who serves as a finance professor at Peking University as well as a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment. He explains why China must rebalance its domestic economy, and how its domestic policies helped contribute to today\'s trade tensions with the U.S. | History is littered with collapsed civilizations ranging from the Maya\xa0to\xa0Angkor Wat. But what can they tell us about the world today, or doing business in it?. But what can they tell us about the world today, or doing business in it? On this episode, we speak with previous Odd Lots guest, archaeologist Arthur Demarest, often described as the "real Indiana Jones" and who is also Ingram Professor of Anthropology at Vanderbilt University. Demarest has recently been applying business management concepts to his studies of the Mayan economy and the civilization\'s subsequent collapse. He talks to us about what businesses can learn from these moments in time. | For years, people have been predicting the demise of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Although\xa0the U.S. economy has been shrinking as a share of the world\'s GDP, the dollar continues to grow ever more\xa0dominant. Yet its strength is increasingly cited as a factor behind economic problems around the world. On this week\'s Odd Lots, the economist David Beckworth, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center, explains the dollar\'s persistent and growing strength. | Last month, central bankers gathered at the annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. A lot of the talk was about the limits of monetary policy when it comes to boosting economic growth and what negative interests could do to the financial system. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also gave a speech in which he talked about replacing the U.S. dollar\'s role in the financial system with something else\xad\xad—maybe even a central bank-run digital currency similar to Facebook\'s Libra. On this episode of the Odd Lots podcast, we speak with Huw van Steenis, who was senior adviser to Governor Carney and spent the last year chairing a BOE review of the \'Future of Finance.\' He talks about how central banks might respond to a number of issues including the rise of new technology, the changing nature of money, and the harmful effects of negative rates. | One of the oldest, most basic strategies in investing is value investing, which, for lack of a better way to put it, means "buy stocks that are cheap." Value investing, a style associated with Warren Buffett, systematically attempts to uncover low-priced stocks. But by many measures, value investing hasn\'t been working recently, as high-priced growth stocks (think: technology) have trounced cheap stocks. On this week\'s episode, we speak with Chris Meredith, Co-CIO of O\'Shaughnessy Asset Management about what\'s behind this underperformance, and why that may be coming to an end. | On this new season of Prognosis, we look at the spread of infections that are resistant to antimicrobial medicines. You\'re probably more likely to have heard of these as superbugs. Their rise has been described as a silent tsunami of catastrophic proportions. We travel to countries on the frontline of the crisis, and explore how hospitals and doctors around the world are fighting back. Prognosis’ new season launches Sept. 5.\xa0 | Every day, people are bombarded with predictions of what will happen in the future. In recent months, talk of \'inflection points\' in the markets has heated up, and the possibility of the U.S. economic expansion, now the longest in history, coming to an end is being actively discussed. But how do we know if such predictions are good ones? And how can we learn to be better forecasters ourselves? On this week\'s episode of the Odd Lots podcast, we talk to Philip Tetlock, the Leonore Annenberg University Professor of Psychology and Management at the University of Pennsylvania, and the author of numerous books and papers on the topic of predictions.\xa0 | We live in a world of generally expensive stock markets and bank equities trading at 30-year lows. So says John Hempton, co-founder of hedge fund Bronte Capital and a former bank analyst, who also calls it "one of the great puzzles of the world." On this episode, we take a special trip to Australia to speak with Hempton about banks and how they fit into the way he evaluates good businesses and promising stocks. He notes that bank profit margins have been declining in places with both positive and negative rates. We also speak about how he picks stocks in a market currently trading at eye-watering valuations, why you shouldn\'t necessarily seek \'value,\' and what investors can learn from the early 2000s tech bubble. | The amount of negative-yielding debt keeps climbing and now includes bonds issued by emerging market countries and some junk-rated companies. On this week\'s episode, we talk to Viktor Shvets, Macquarie\'s Head of Asia Strategy, about why interest rates keep getting lower and why that\'s a problem for the global economy and financial system. He argues that undermining the \'time value\' of money–or the principle that money available now is worth more than money in the future because you can use it to earn additional money–won\'t lead to economic growth. In fact, he says, negative rates are going to end up leading to a rethink of modern capitalism and political society once people realize they have big consequences. He\'s also one of the few sell-side analysts who takes Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) pretty seriously.', 'chan_desc': 'Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway take you on a not-so random weekly walk through hot topics in markets, finance and economics.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/05/54/47/0554475d-0644-ba85-f920-39b5be807833/mza_2474577541299911360.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-11-04'}}

We can hold ourselves accountable by using tools like a 411, 66-Day Challenge, or The ONE Thing Planner. We can bring accountability into our world by recruiting an accountability partner. Then, when we want the highest level of accountability possible, we have to look to an expert – to a coach. A lot of people ask us what it means to have a coach, how to know if it’s the right fit, and how to get the most out of that relationship. So, today, we sit down to learn the answers to those questions from Charlotte Savoy, who both embodies accountability in her businesses and coaches other people on The ONE Thing through MAPS Business Coaching. \xa0 If you think this sounds like a good fit for you, you can learn more about our  Get a ONE Thing Coach,  Become a ONE Thing Coach, or  Living Your ONE Thing Community. \xa0 In this episode, you will learn...

You’ll often hear that owning your own business can be a very lonely endeavor, even when you have downline, uplines, and sidelines like in network marketing. However, what you need to know is that the problems you have are the same problems so many others are experiencing as well!\xa0 Which is why I’m excited to release our very first podcast answering YOUR submitted questions! Last week, Sarah, Tiara, Jessica, and Sarah submitted questions to me about issues they are personally facing in their network marketing businesses, and in this episode I go through them one-by-one. 06:29\xa0\xa0 Question #1 (Sarah) – How do I keep myself ‘unstuck?’\xa0 If you have been inconsistent for a really long time in your business, where do you even begin to build consistency, be an example to your team, and get the momentum going? 17:04\xa0\xa0 Question #2 (Tiara) – I’m a runner.\xa0 But, how do you change the speed and momentum of your team?\xa0 How do you adjust your expectations of other people who aren’t like you? 28:12\xa0\xa0 Question #3 (Jessica) – I want to cast vision and think BIG, but when I think about who I need to be in order to make that happen, it’s threatening my current identity BIG TIME.\xa0 How do I change my identity and shift into that person that I need to be? 39:42\xa0\xa0 Question #4 (Sarah) - How are you supposed to see yourself running a million-dollar company when you are so far in debt?\xa0\xa0 How can you truly believe that one day you’ll be able to retire your husband and spend every day together as a family when I barely ever get to see them now as it is?

Enrollment is opening in October. | Are you frustrated with team members who don’t take any action on their monthly goals?\xa0 Or how about team members who don’t even have monthly goals in the first place?\xa0 How can YOU, as the team leader, set and achieve goals based on relying on other people taking action?\xa0 Today I’ll be sharing with you leadership & team building strategies to help you close out a month strong with momentum and excitement to help you crush your goals. It’s a very different way to approach the topic of goal setting and working with your teams. You don’t hit big goals in your business by trying to be everything to everyone There are actually two parts to reaching a goal: 1) the setting of the goal, and 2) the action that takes place to meet the set goal.\xa0 But, how do you work with people who have not ‘owned it” and stated, “This is my goal for the month!”? Effective goal setting and achievement is all about driving production and learning how to really motivate your people to action. And as leaders, we need to learn that owning a business with a ‘voluntary army’ of team members means we have to learn WHO and HOW to influence people on our team.\xa0 Influence is leadership! And this is where I see a lot of team leaders struggle.\xa0 Most of your team members probably don’t even know how to set big goals and that these goals are, in fact, achievable. And instead of being a servant leader and working with the team members to help them define and achieve their own goals, we end being a “SELF-SERVING” leader, asking team members to contribute towards a ‘team goal.’\xa0 So many of us (myself included at one point), miss out on the concept of Legacy Leadership. Legacy Leaders understand that a personal goal means nothing unless it’s based on the solid foundation of helping other people succeed on their team and achieve their goals. In this episode, I am going to share exactly how to reach your month-end goals through servant leadership, how to effectively set goals, and how to implement an action plan for hitting your goals in your team that puts your team first…but still allows you to crush your month-end goals in the process!

Today we are going to talk about the magic of thinking big and how mastering this skillset transformed my business and TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE. Greatness is believing in a dream for your life far beyond your current circumstances Thinking big and developing a compelling vision for your life is an extremely important job as a leader. And if you own a business, then you ARE a leader! Casting a vision for your life and how others’ lives can be is the starting point to being a great leader. Great leaders learn how to paint a vision for the future for themselves and their teams that inspires them to move into action! However, the reason why most people are stuck and lack passion in either their business or life is because they lack vision. And I have to admit one of my own personal struggles was always using my past to determine what my future was going to look like. But here’s what I want you to understand, your past or current circumstances have NOTHING to do with your future! So join me in this episode as I share the magic of thinking big and the steps on how to create your own big vision for your future!

Overcoming negative thinking is the most important thing you must do if you want to create breakthrough in your business.\xa0 My Transformation Formula guides you through exactly how to take a negative thought, reposition it inside your head, and create a positive, productive, forward-moving thought in its place.\xa0 It is our thoughts, not the circumstances, around us that actually creates our results Podcast guests - Cassie, Chelsea and Haley - share their own experiences in one of the biggest challenges for leaders – NEGATIVE THINKING – and I coach them through exactly how to take a negative thought and turn it into a thought that is positive and action-producing.\xa0 In session #1, Cassie shares her struggles with second guessing and doubting herself in all areas of her life and how to deal with inconsistencies and overwhelm. In session #2, Chelsea and I talk about her need to control all of the outcomes in her business, her distorted view of her own success, and her strong faith and passion for missions. And in Session #3, Haley shares her struggles with enjoying the journey of building her network marketing business, finding joy in the moment, and how her strong personal relationships hinder her role as a leader. Cassie, Chelsea, and Haley share their struggles and negative thinking experiences in the business and my personal coaching for each one of them. | There are three simple steps to implementing any kind of new system or change into your business and into your team. You will never scale your business beyond yourself without the proper systems Let’s all admit it - most of us are into network marketing because we want a business that gives us FREEDOM. However, as I look around our industry, I see a lot of network marketers who are NOT experiencing the freedom they crave.\xa0 Here’s the reality that a lot of ‘successful’ network marketing leaders don’t understand: If your business doesn’t run WITHOUT YOU, it’s not a business.\xa0 It’s a JOB. I want you to know that you don’t need to be the ‘center of the universe’ on your team. In fact, I give you permission to purposely NOT be the ‘center of the universe’ on your team! However, in order for you to grow a business that doesn’t 100% depend on you, you must develop leaders in your downline.\xa0 And to develop these leaders, you need a proper system in place to identify them and train them to step in and do what you do. And so today, I am going to talk about why you need systems to scale your business, how it can develop the people in your team, the three steps for implementing new systems in your business, and the right attitude you need to have when implementing these changes. Need help with figuring out and implementing systems for your business? Make sure to visit www.LegacyLeadershipAcademy.com | This episode is part 2 of a 2-episode series where we really dive into the subject fear plays in building a successful business. In part 1 we talked about what fear actually is and how you can actually change your thoughts actually perpetuate and feed that fear. If you haven’t listened to part 1, episode 111, see the link to it below! In this pod episode, we dig farther into how exactly fear can be used to actually BUILD your business and how to adopting a healthier attitude towards failure is the key to unlocking success in your business and in your life. The only way to get ‘unstuck’ in your business is to adopt a new mindset about failure It is ingrained in us during childhood that failure is a horribly bad thing to avoid. We also think that two paths exist: one is a path towards success and the other is a path that leads us to failure. However, the reality is that only ONE PATH EXISTS! Success and Failure are merely different steps or stages along the same path! You literally have to fail your way to success every single day. Failure is unavoidable on your way to success! We must shift our mindsets to understand this and accept it so that as we do meet failure during our journey, we can mentally check it off as a step in the process and move on! Join me in this episode as I talk about my personal experience with failure, the biggest shift I had to make when it comes to failure, how to adopt a new mindset to the ‘NO’s’ in your business, and my action plans for you to increase your failure threshold. Mentioned:  episode 111 | In this podcast episode, we dive into a topic that I believe everyone can relate to which is how to overcome your fear of prospecting. I am going to give you a totally different way to look at fear and what I wish I would have known when I first started in network marketing. The goal is not to eliminate FEAR… it is to build your FAITH As humans we start off free from fear.\xa0 My son, Greyson, proves this!\xa0 He is a maniac and fearless in how he lives his life and what he’s willing to try each day.\xa0 However, over time, as humans, we start to develop a fear that resides deep inside of us.\xa0 When I started my own first network marketing business, I was so excited at first!....until I had to make that first phone call!\xa0 Then the fear stepped in!\xa0 In fact, I, Bob Heilig, hated prospecting at first!\xa0 Oftentimes, we wind up clinging to our fears because we want to be certain and be in control. We can call fear different things, but I want you to understand that no matter the term you use, they are all the same.\xa0 And the solution to overcome every single type of fear is the same as well. You need to know this - the solution is not eliminating fear; it is building up your faith. To be successful in your business, you must break the habitual pattern of negative thinking that you’ve created in your life.\xa0 This way of thinking has created your current results! You must be able to interpret the things you are scared of – the ‘no’s,’ the rejections, the lack of responses from people you respect – in a different way than your current emotions are allowing. And so, in this episode, let’s dig a bit deeper on what exactly fear is, exactly why we love to cling to our fears, but also what you need to consciously and intentionally see to overcome fear’s grip on your life and your business.\xa0 \xa0 Mentioned: EPISODE 73 https://yourvirtualupline.com/podcast/73/ | Today, I am joined by Jasmine Star, photographer, entrepreneur, and Instagram expert. In this episode, Jasmine and I talk about Instagram Stories, how to effectively use it in your network marketing business, and the best practices you can implement in your own business. We are not using Instagram Stories to sell… we use it to build our personal brands Facebook has been monumental in changing the way we do business in network marketing. However, Instagram has become the most highly effective and fastest growing platform today in the social media world. And many network marketers are taking advantage of it! Instagram, with its focus on pictures and the telling of stories, allows your customers and prospects to connect and engage with you professionally and personally in ways not possible on other social media platforms. In this episode, Jasmine and I focuses on Instagram Stories, why it is so great, why you should use it, and how to use it effectively in building your brand. We talk about how to actually create an effective Instagram Story, and Jasmine provides us with the best practices that we can implement in our network marketing business. And be ready!\xa0 Because as have an action plan for you at the end of this episode to help you implement Instagram Stories into your own social media plan for growing your business!\xa0 | My leadership training program, the Legacy Leadership Academy, will be opening for new members soon!

Join me at www.reviveyourdownline.com. \xa0 As a leader, you must understand the importance of focusing on BOTH new acquisition as well as retention on your team. If you focus on retention of current team members too much, your team will eventually become stagnant. If you focus on personal recruiting too much, you’ll wind up building a team without any strong independent leaders and get stuck on the treadmill. So today, I am going to share my number one strategy for increasing retention on your network marketing team. Leaders must understand the importance of focusing on BOTH new acquisition and retention while building their teams Without a doubt, retention is a big problem for most network marketers. Some days it feels like your team is a leaky bucket – you’re losing team members just as quickly as you’re signing on new ones! However, retention is the key to unlocking long-term residual income and the eventual freedom that you so crave through your network marketing company! So, as a leader, you must understand the importance of focusing on BOTH acquisition and retention. Join me in this episode as I share with you the concept of ‘the retention point,’ my number one strategy on how to retain people in your team, and the three things that leaders do differently while training new team members that result in higher, long-term retention. | I truly believe that there is a fundamental shift happening inside the network marketing industry.\xa0 Just a few weeks ago, I hosted some of the best and brightest in network marketing for three days at my live event, the Impact + Growth Summit, and during my keynote, I spoke in depth about how network marketing, as the world has come to know it, is coming to an end. The people that were sitting in front of me in the audience represented a new generation of network marketers who are doing things differently.\xa0 They are not ‘out for the next quick sale’ or to ‘get someone.’\xa0 Instead, these like-minded servant leaders are building their businesses from a place of abundance.\xa0 They are out to change the world, one person at a time, and create their own movement in the process. The solution to scarcity is not abundance, but building your business through legacy leadership. I truly believe that the ‘scarcity mindset’ that so many network marketers operate from is one of the biggest issues in our industry today.\xa0 However, we as individuals must begin knowing that you have a mission and responsibility to build your network marketing business from a mindset of abundance.\xa0 So, listen up and discover why you are here for a bigger purpose, the power of knowing your self-worth, and why we need to pursue legacy leadership as network marketers.', 'chan_desc': 'Welcome to the Your Virtual Upline podcast hosted by Bob Heilig.

She is going to help you know what you should do next. Before you listen, Chalene wants you to download a questionnaire that she created. This isn\'t one of those random, quick quizzes you take on some website that gives you a very generic answer about the kinds of things you could do. No, this is much more personal and gives you an exact answer. Today, Chalene wants to walk you through the mindset and ideology behind finding your thing or knowing the next thing you should do. The actual answer, the, "Oh, this is it!" needs to come from you, and it requires deliberately thinking about it and putting a pen to paper. Your pen becomes a magic wand and it is going to reveal to you what that thing is. So before going any further, take a moment to download this Questionnaire. It\'s really simple. There are several questions and once you\'re finished listening to this podcast, Chalene wants you to fill them out. You can answer them on a separate piece of paper, but your answer will be revealed to you in your own handwriting! It\'s really profound.\xa0 To get your questionnaire go to Chalene.com/mything.

So I polled the Ziglar audience and asked them, “With the demands of your job or business, what do you do to make relationships a priority? What are your main challenges?” I was joined by Brian Dixon, our guest from episode 715 where we talked through the message in his brand new book, “Start With Your People.” Brian’s responses to the candid comments were significant and will give you some strategic and actionable steps you can put in place to nurture the relationships in your life, even as you fulfill demanding work schedule!Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Is it really a choice? Can you really believe that? The reality is, if you are going to win, it will take a whole of of choices. The right choices. So which choices are the right ones? That’s what this show is about. For 53 years Tom Ziglar has been privy to a constant influx of the absolute best in personal development, self help and best business practices. He’s been CEO of Ziglar for 24 years. He’s a featured speaker around the globe. And now he brings us the first Ziglar book in over a decade and it’s the culmination and simplification of all he’s been exposed to, learned and added to in a truly revolutionary way to walk out your personal success. In this show we talk through the core ingredients of Tom’s Choose To Win methodology and expound on these ingredients: We do have a choice, the absolute necessity of having a why, but we get into an interesting discussion about the why not necessarily having to be big, but it must be strong and intense. We discuss desire, hope (the right kind), grit and then...how. Goals. But how goals only resonates with approximately 20% of the populace so if you aren’t thrilled by goals, you’ll want to hear this. Then we discuss the big kahuna of it all, our daily habits. And which one is most paramount? Tom will tell you. We finish by getting into his next book, already titled and in the works. This is a foundational show. You can find Tom’s book, Choose To Win, at Ziglar.com or wherever you get books.Learn more about your ad choices.

Yet we have so many stories of people who had no natural ability and performed at a very low level, but trained themselves up into a level of mastery. In a stark example we have James Earl Jones, with one of the most recognizable voices in the world, who was almost mute as a child for eight years, thanks to a severe stutter. Not that drastic, but in this show I bring you a message from Zig Ziglar explaining his desire to enter sales solely due to a financial incentive, and his following two years of languishing as a very poor salesman. It’s an entertaining story of course, but it really puts into perspective the reality that often the masters did not start off with an advantage. They simply applied themselves, learned and trained.

But I wanted more, for a reason I can’t explain. And the aspect of self-care occurred to me. So along with what you do for yourself, fun or play, I asked him, “What about in regards to self-care?” He immediately gave three answers for significant things he does for himself, and all three are things I’ve never done myself, such as using salt-water float tanks and seeing movies at the theater in the middle of the day.

Often you can combine a spoke. And doing a five minute workout or a three minute devotional will keep your positive inertia going. “Falling off the wagon” or “losing momentum” is a death knell for most people, as when we fall behind it can feel overwhelming to make up the deficit. Sometimes it unavoidable, but most often we have the ability to at least make a small contribution that can keep us moving forward. This was the main focus of this show, though I also posted this question to the Ziglar audience and Tom and I reviewed a handful of comments, “In the 7 spokes on the Ziglar Wheel of Life, which areas do you have a plan you consistently fulfill?” It was from the comments we were drawn to the power of even small, positive investments in your daily routine.Learn more about your ad choices.

There are many people, even more so in the world of business and entrepreneurship, who more often than not put priority on the project as opposed to people. Yet our guest today, Brian Dixon, found he was shortchanging himself and in fact putting people first was far more rewarding, and profitable. Brian Dixon is a podcaster, conference speaker, and business coach and specializes in helping authors, speakers, and aspiring messengers create a sustainable business through growing their platform, and creating compelling online courses. He is the co-founder of hope*writers, a membership site of over 2,000 working writers.\xa0 Brian’s brand new book, Start With Your People, is an instant best seller with the who’s who in the business and personal development world fervently touting the book and it’s message. I think a reason for this is because we are all suffering. Culturally we\'ve grown into "doing the job" as the expectation. Going beyond that to put people first feels like a lost art in the workplace and sadly, often in the home as well. Brian provides acute stories, compelling data and tangible action steps to put people as the first priority, not the exception. The message provides far more than testimony to putting people first as the right thing to do, but undeniably the most profitable to our personal lives and business bottom line. Visit Brian’s website at briandixon.com. I’d encourage you to check out his free Clarity quiz, and of course you can get his book there, “Start With Your People”, or find it at Amazon, the audio at Audible, or wherever you buy books.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | I don’t like titles claiming to be the end-all or holy grail for anything. But I believe this claim to be irrefutable. The biggest influence in your life is your inner voice. Your personal thoughts. They were not pre-programmed at birth, you have so far spent a lifetime having your inner voice programmed, either proactively with intention, or you’ve allowed other people and things to program you. Though the truth for everyone is, both. But to what percentages? The danger is we primarily believe our thoughts. We feel they come from our beliefs and what we deem to be true. But brain and personal development research has proven this to be false. How you perceive yourself and what you believe about yourself is often a faulty perspective. More importantly, if you want to become something different, you must start telling yourself something different. Zig Ziglar made this topic one of his primary messages and in this show we hear him deliver a seven minute message about it that will equip you to do something about your own voice. Then I posted this question on Facebook, “The voice inside your head...what is a positive and negative label it gives you?” and had Tom Ziglar join me to talk through the comments. As always the comments were authentic, vulnerable and sometimes hard hitting.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | This is a special episode on habits. For almost two years now I’ve had every single guest on the Ziglar Show, comprised of today’s most successful influencers in personal development, share their personal habits for success. They share exactly what they do in each of the seven spokes of The Ziglar Wheel of Life. It is inspiring and empowering. From this I want to help you with your own habits. It’s one thing to understand the benefit of great habits and to hear what all these successful people are doing. It’s another thing to actually make the decision ahead of time and then in the appropriate moment, to start your own habits. And you may be in a tough place in life where you feel trapped and overwhelmed, or even just desiring, but stalled out. The point of this show is to reveal what is needed before the habit can really happen. And it will likely showcase to many of you WHY you are struggling with your healthy habits, or lack thereof. So this dives down from the Habits shows where you hear what successful people do, to the how and why. I’ll run through five attributes that precede establishing healthy habits, then walk through the seven spokes on the Ziglar Wheel of Life and clarify the background and roots understanding that will help you not just take action but really know why beyond the face value comprehension.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Are you suffering from a desire you have but you aren’t making progress toward? Are you clear on why you want it? Why you REALLY want it. The truth is, most people are not. They have a list of wants and desires they think they should want and maybe actually do to a degree, but they don’t have a clear picture in mind of what the actual payoff really is. If you press in to clarity on what and why you want something, you will either gain clarity and get true motivation, or you may realize you don’t want it enough, which is not always a bad thing, as you’ll hear in this show. The idea came from Hal Elrod, our guest in show 707, where we talked about his new book, “Miracle Equation”, which was a message geared toward helping people take action on the things that inspired them. From this I posted this question to the Ziglar listening audience, “What is a desire you have...that you are struggling to take action towards? What do you think might help your motivation?” We received responses from people who wanted to find a fitting career they believed in, make more money, write a book, and pursue their physical fitness. A surprising majority shared side businesses and business ideas they really wanted to pursue but were feeling stalled out. I asked Michelle Prince to join me and talk through the comments. This show should be convicting and freeing. Quite possibly both!Learn more about your ad choices.

Or let’s say...you can. If you pay attention. That’s the crux of this show with wise guy...Guy Kawasaki. This is actually my second interview of Guy. His new book is called Wise Guy and it’s a compilation of life lessons. Guy is an unprecedented influencer, which accounts for the half million people who follow him on Facebook and almost 1.5 million on Twitter. He’s chief evangelist of Canva, an online graphic design tool and brand ambassador for Mercedes-Benz. He was the chief evangelist of Apple and his stories of working with Steve Jobs, and lessons learned, are intriguing.\xa0 He’s a bestselling author of multiple books such as The Art of the Start 2.0 and Enchantment. But in this book he walks through much of his life and career and literally shares a ton of great stories and then what lesson he learned from them. As you’ll hear, it really caused me to consider the many events that have and are always happening in my life, and ask...am I learning lessons from them, or just letting them pass by? Honestly, we hit some really poignant issues in this show, and we laughed a lot. He’s just a total joy to be with and learn from. He’s as humble and authentic as anyone I’ve ever met. You’ll learn and I think thoroughly enjoy this show. Find Guy’s book, Wise Guy, wherever you buy books.Learn more about your ad choices.

The report acknowledges the importance of reducing carbon emissions but focuses on the need to adapt to ongoing changes in the climate. Cities, which are home to the majority of the world’s population and generate most of its GDP, will need to develop climate resilience across all types of infrastructure, including coastal protection, transportation, energy and communications. They will need to take an “all-of-the-above” approach to financing, according to Sandra Lawson, executive director of the Global Markets Institute, because “even the most prosperous cities are not going to be able to fund this alone.” Amanda Hindlian, chief operating officer of Global Investment Research and president of the Global Markets Institute, recommends that cities “start now” and allow for maximum flexibility, so that they can “benefit from input costs and economies of scale that that come from new technologies and that make these problems easier to address in economically feasible ways over time.”\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | What’s it like to be a Goldman Sachs intern? In this episode, two interns from this past summer talk about their experiences at GS, as well as what they value in an employer—from diversity to work-life balance. Also in the studio was head of Human Capital Management Dane Holmes to discuss how the interns’ perspectives—and the results of a larger, firm-wide intern survey—translate into how employers are thinking about connecting with a younger generation of workers. | John Waldron is a busy man. He’s almost a year into his role as Goldman Sachs COO and President, and he’s also a father of six. In this episode, Waldron demystifies his day-to-day and explains why he’s even more focused on executing on the title “COO” than “president.” “My role right now really is to first learn the firm and understand the inner workings of the firm, and so that’s a really operationally intensive job, thus the chief operating officer component,” says Waldron. “The president job comes into play more on an external basis where you’re out with clients, with governments, with regulators and other external constituencies where that title has real resonance.” Waldron also discusses how younger employees can identify and invest in mentors, as well as the importance of recharging out of the office. For Waldron, that means getting home for dinner with his family if he has to head out to a client event later in the evening. “I’ll have a little bit of peanut butter and jelly and then I’ll have a steak tartare later on,” he tells podcast host Jake Siewert.\xa0 | Technology is changing the structure of the financial industry, says Marty Chavez, global co-head of the Goldman Sachs Securities Division. In this episode, he discusses how the industry is reshaping. “If you look inside a financial services firm, you’ll find there has traditionally been a relatively small number of roles that we talk about—so there’d be bankers, salespeople and traders,” Chavez says. “Now, all of those simple, easy categories are going away and they’re going away fast, and it’s becoming much more complicated and much more multidimensional.” This breaking down of clear categories also changes how financial firms compete with each other. “The traditional notions of ‘You’re my competitor’ are giving away to something that looks much more like coopetition—maybe not my favorite word, but you compete in some areas and you cooperate in some other areas; and some other areas you might be a client, or they might be a client,” Chavez says.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 | For this special episode of Exchanges, we’re running our newest podcast, Top of Mind at Goldman Sachs. Hosted by Allison Nathan, a senior strategist in Goldman Sachs Research, Top of Mind examines the macroeconomic issues that are shaping the global economy. In each episode, Allison interviews Goldman Sachs experts—as well as influential policymakers, academics, and investors—on market-moving topics. The series’ latest installment, Dissecting the Market Disconnect, takes a close look at the divergence between falling bond yields and rising equity prices. Bridgewater Associates’ Ray Dalio and Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius join Allison to dive into this dynamic and understand how concerned investors should really be about economic growth.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | The next 10 years of mobility will bring more change in the way that people and products move than any decade since the invention of the automobile, Goldman Sachs Research’s Heath Terry explains in this episode. Emerging technologies and business models like ride-hailing and sharing, autonomous driving and delivery, micro-mobility and even eVTOL (flying cars, finally) stand to disrupt profit pools that we estimate exceed $700 billion, and venture-backed startups and incumbents will attempt to address over $7 trillion in spending. Given the size of the opportunity, it should come as no surprise that access to capital has created a hyper-competitive environment marked by massive operating losses driven by marketing, subsidies, incentives, and capital investment. As this environment matures and rationalizes, Goldman Sachs Research expects consolidation that will lead to profitability, the establishment of category leaders, and significant opportunities for investors. | In this episode, Jennifer Davis, head of retail investment banking for Goldman Sachs, explains how retailers are expanding their growth strategies against a backdrop of continued e-commerce growth and shifting demographics. While Davis acknowledges that growth strategies are “very specific to a retailer or brand,” she outlines three key areas of focus for her clients: customer demographic growth, channel growth (including the rise of digitally native brands), and geographic growth. \xa0 | Although financial markets tend to be explained largely in quantitative terms, human behavior still plays a major role in driving price action, says Sheba Jafari, head of technical analysis for Goldman Sachs’ Securities Division. Jafari, who looks at historical patterns to predict movements in markets, explains: “In my opinion, the mere fact that we have the existence of [asset] bubbles indicates that markets are still run by emotions -- fear, greed and hope.” Also in the episode, Jafari discusses the impact of AI and machine learning on trading decisions and her own unlikely path from film studies to finance. | While systematic investing has origins in academia dating back to the 1950s, only in the past several years has it evolved into practical applications for portfolio construction. In this episode, Heather Shemilt and Tom Leake of the Goldman Sachs Securities Division explain how ARP strategies work and the diversification and customization benefits they offer investors.  "Alternative risk premia, or ARP, are long/short strategies that are designed to generate positive returns in exchange for an investor taking risk," Shemilt explains. "These strategies are seeking to provide persistent exposure to these factors or risk premia, such as carry value or momentum...What\'s interesting is that ARP can be systematically harvested across all of the asset classes." Also in the episode, they discuss how the ARP industry will continue to evolve, including the impact of big data, AI and machine learning on these strategies, with Leake acknowledging adoption of these technologies is still in "early days."This podcast was recorded on May 15, 2019.All price references and market forecasts correspond to the date of this recording.

For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Credit cards can be valuable financial tools, if you know how to use them correctly. They can also get you into serious trouble if you don’t. Learning the difference between healthy and unhealthy credit card use is key to having a strong financial life. And since credit cards often offer rewards and points that can be redeemed for travel miles or cash back, if you’re diligent, they can help you get the things you want, as well as \xa0build your credit.Brianna McGurran*, a contributor to the financial site Nerdwallet, teaches us how to use credit cards properly so that they work for, not against us.The following are excerpts from McGurran’s recent conversation on Stash’s “Teach Me How To Money” podcast, with our editorial director Lindsay Goldwert, edited for clarity.1. You should understand why credit is important.Credit is the thing that lenders look at before they issue you a loan or a credit card. It's your financial history--it's who you are as a person, in the financial world…[And determines] whether or not you can be trusted to borrow money or to pay something back on time.You [need credit] for anything from getting a mortgage to getting a credit card.You need credit history in order to get [a travel rewards credit card]. You also need credit, sometimes, to rent an apartment...Landlords will check your credit history, as it's sort of this proxy for how responsible you are.2. Closing a credit card may not actually help you.Unfortunately, what happens when you close an account [is that] your average length of credit history goes down. Suddenly, all the history that you built up with that account goes away. So, your [credit history is] starting from the first day of your next oldest account opening.Also, say you have a credit limit of $2,000 on [the] card you closed, but the card you keep open has a credit limit of $1,000, and you have $300 of debt outstanding. Your credit utilization ratio now becomes higher because you have $300 in debt on a $1000 credit limit, instead of a $2000 credit limit...That ends up actually making it look like you have more debt compared to your credit line[s].3. Applying for credit will likely impact your credit score.There is a penalty if you apply for credit cards. A hard inquiry (when a potential lender looks at your credit history) on your credit report will affect your credit.Applying for a lot of credit cards over the course of a long period of time, you're just going to get dinged over and over...there's really no reason to [do it].4. There may not be a “best” credit card--so, look for the right card for you and your goals.We all get so many offers, letters, and ads...My advice is usually to ignore the offers and the letters, and only search for [a card] when you're ready for it. When you are ready to get a financial product, you are more likely to actually apply wisely and find something that is good for you.Think about your goals. If you're the type of person who travels a lot, a travel credit card that gets you rewards based on your spending could be right for you. If you're the type of person who, even if you travel a lot but you just can't be bothered with tracking rewards or knowing how the credit card works, a cashback [card] might be better. Or, if you really need to build credit, there are certain credit cards that are good for that.5. Don’t forget about fees.It's important to see what fees are associated with every credit card, and every financial product in general. If you are interested in a rewards card, but it comes with an annual fee, you have to do the math to make sure that you're actually going to use enough rewards to offset that fee. [Remember]: There are some cards that do offer rewards with no annual fee.6. A good way to potentially start paying off your credit card debt is with a balance transfer.The balance-transfer is a really good option for people who have a lot of credit card debt and want to j... | What was your New Year’s Resolution in 2018?

But as the post-World War II boom began to sputter, economists gained influence and power.In The Economists\' Hour, Binyamin Appelbaum traces the rise of the economists, first in the United States and then around the globe, as their ideas reshaped the modern world, curbing government, unleashing corporations and hastening globalization.Some leading figures are relatively well-known, such as Milton Friedman, the elfin libertarian who had a greater influence on American life than any other economist of his generation, and Arthur Laffer, who sketched a curve on a cocktail napkin that helped to make tax cuts a staple of conservative economic policy.Others stayed out of the limelight, but left a lasting impact on modern life: Walter Oi, a blind economist who dictated to his wife and assistants some of the calculations that persuaded President Nixon to end military conscription; Alfred Kahn, who deregulated air travel and rejoiced in the crowded cabins on commercial flights as the proof of his success; and Thomas Schelling, who put a dollar value on human life.Their fundamental belief? That government should stop trying to manage the economy.Their guiding principle? That markets would deliver steady growth, and ensure that all Americans shared in the benefits.But the Economists\' Hour failed to deliver on its promise of broad prosperity. And the single-minded embrace of markets has come at the expense of economic equality, the health of liberal democracy, and future generations.Have a money question?

On this week's episode, senior trade reporter Shawn Donnan heads to the front lines of the US-China trade war in Wisconsin, and Stephanie talks through its global impact with Penny Goldberg, chief economist at the World Bank.One silver lining to all this, says Goldberg, is that more attention is finally being paid to trade policy. She also discusses whether this period will mark the high point for globalization - and confirms the suspicions of manufacturers that Shawn spoke to out in the field, who believe that they are paying the tariffs - not China, as claimed so often by Donald Trump.\xa0 | Stephanie Flanders, head of Bloomberg Economics, returns to bring you another season of on-the-ground insight into the forces driving global growth and jobs today. From the cosmetics maker in California grappling with Donald Trump's tariff war, to the coffee vendor in Argentina burdened by the nation's never-ending crises, Bloomberg's 130-plus economic reporters and economists around the world head into the field to tell these stories. Stephanomics will also look hard at the solutions, in the lead-up to Bloomberg’s second New Economy Forum in Beijing, where a select group of business leaders, politicians and thinkers will gather to chart a better course on trade, global governance, climate and more. Stephanomics will help lead the way for those debates not just with Bloomberg journalists but also discussion and analysis from world-renowned experts into the forces that are moving markets and reshaping the world. The new season of Stephanomics launches Oct. 3. | On this new season of Prognosis, we look at the spread of infections that are resistant to antimicrobial medicines. You're probably more likely to have heard of these as superbugs. Their rise has been described as a silent tsunami of catastrophic proportions. We travel to countries on the frontline of the crisis, and explore how hospitals and doctors around the world are fighting back. Prognosis’ new season launches Sept. 5.\xa0 | Under pressure from President Donald Trump, Mexico is cracking down on migrants coming from its own southern neighbor, Guatemala. But the hit to the local economy could have unanticipated consequences for the U.S. Bloomberg's Eric Martin reports from the border, while Stephanie takes stock of these and other challenges for international economic cooperation at a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.\xa0\xa0This month also marks 75 years since the Allied powers gathered at the Mount Washington hotel to lay the groundwork for the post-World War II economic order. At a conference commemorating the anniversary she talks with Meg Lundsager, the U.S.'s representative at the IMF from 2007 to 2014 and Nouriel Roubini - the economist famed for predicting the financial crisis who's recently become a big critic of the speculation in cryptocurrencies.\xa0 | The yellow-vest protests that shook France last year may be over, but the forces of political and economic anger continue to ripple around the world. Stephanie visits the City of Lights to speak with two key figures about how the country is faring and how major nations' finance chiefs are tackling these issues -- as well as Facebook's proposed digital currency, Libra -- at this week's Group of Seven meeting in France. Listen to her interviews with French Finance Minister Bruno le Maire and Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. | Donald Trump’s trade policies have created winners and losers around the world. Among the big losers so far, count Spanish olive farmers. Their exports to the U.S. were hit with a huge tariff last year. U.S. officials claimed they had been undercutting California olive growers by selling Spanish olives on the cheap. Though barely a blip on the global trade war, it has been very bad news for the olive groves of southern Spain. But business is booming for Europe’s aluminum industry, especially its exports to the U.S., despite President Trump’s tariffs. What gives?\xa0\xa0Bloomberg's Jeannette Neumann wades into the worlds of olives and aluminum to figure out what's going on, then Stephanie talks through some of the many other unintended consequences of U.S. trade wars with Bloomberg trade tsar, Brendan Murray. She and Executive Editor Simon Kennedy also chat about the political pressure being piled on the US Federal Reserve and many other central banks.\xa0 | This week we bring you a special conversation between host Stephanie Flanders and Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf. They try to make sense of the rise in populism in recent years, what it means for the global economy, and whether it spells the end of liberal democracy. The event was recorded in London on July 1. | This week we focus on the two giants of the global economy: China and India. At first glance, China seems to be shrugging off the effects of U.S. tariffs, but Bloomberg economists looked closer and found that Chinese exports to the US in 1,000s of product categories had been hit hard and this trade had not also been replaced by U.S. production or exports from other countries. Host Stephanie Flanders gets the full story from Bloomberg economist Maeva Cousin. We also explore a great economic puzzle of recent times:\xa0 how can India grow by 6%-7% a year for 20 years without creating jobs for half of its potential workers?\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0The world’s second most-populous economy has seen a step change in its economic performance in the past 20 years but job growth keeps coming up short. Less than half of the working-age population is in work or even looking for a job -- and nearly 80% of women are not in the workforce at all. Anirban Nag and Vrishti Beniwal go in search of an answer on the streets of New Delhi, and Stephanie asks Bloomberg Opinion columnist Mihir Sharma what it all means for India’s newly re-elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. | European Central Bank President Mario Draghi earned the ire of Donald Trump this week with his farewell speech at a major annual conference. Editor Paul Gordon was there at the prestigious gathering in Sintra, Portugal, and breaks down Draghi's comments with host Stephanie Flanders.\xa0\xa0Then hear a special recording of Stephanie's engaging live panel discussion this week in London with two of the city's most prominent economic voices, HSBC Chief Economist Janet Henry and the Chief Economic Advisor to the UK Treasury, Clare Lombardelli. They discuss an increasingly hazy outlook for the world economy and offer their unique perspective on women and diversity in the economics profession -- or lack thereof. | Workers around the globe are in for a shock in coming decades as automation transforms the workplace and maybe destroys their jobs. But for Nobel-winning economist Christopher Pissarides, it's not all dismal. Host Stephanie Flanders has an extended talk with the London School of Economics professor about the upsides of automation and how Europe may actually be well-positioned to survive this transition. They also discuss the risk of another Eurozone crisis and the need for a broader measure of economic success than national output or GDP. Then Stephanie catches up with Bloomberg reporter Shawn Donnan for an update on the U.S.-China trade war and his observations from a recent visit to the Asian nation.\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Who will win the trade war, and how?

He’s also considered to be one of the forefathers of trading systems and a pioneer of trend following. By 1988, Mint achieved an average annual compounded return of over 30%—it’s best year being 60% (in 1987, the year of the stock market crash) and it’s worst year up 13%. By 1990, Mint was the world’s largest hedge fund at the time, with $1-billion of assets under management. It was also around this time, that Mint’s performance caught the attention of Jack Schwager, as Larry was profiled and interviewed in the first book of the best-selling Market Wizards series. Now almost 30-years on, Larry has written a book of his own titled The Rule. It reflects on life experiences, trading lessons, and pretty much, how the most unlikely kid in the classroom went on to generate a significant personal fortune. During this episode, Larry and I discuss trading, risk philosophy and probability, life and memorable moments, and Larry’s work as a philanthropist too. | For many, this will likely be the first time hearing about Mike Komaransky, but those who know him already, know him as a Bitcoin OG—and deservedly so, as he began accumulating the cryptocurrency around 2010. Though Mike has been a professional trader of fixed income derivatives since 2001, when he joined powerhouse trading firm DRW. Mike later became a partner at DRW, and in 2014 he launched its cryptocurrency trading business Cumberland—which grew to become one of the world’s largest market makers. After leaving the company in 2017 and a hiatus from active trading, Mike has returned as the founder and head of Grapefruit Trading. Over the course of our conversation, we chat about; Mike’s distinguished trading career, the strange ways that he bought Bitcoin in the past (when it was far less accessible), Cumberland’s participation in the auction of seized Bitcoin from the Silk Road bust, Mike’s disdain for technical analysis, and plenty more… | Returning guest Nick Radge is a systematic trader of trend following, momentum and mean reversion strategies—which he runs across Australian and U.S. equity markets. When I asked Nick if he\'d be willing to do another podcast, I said to him, "This time around, I\'d like to discuss something very specific with you; how to create a simple trend following system." So, that\'s exactly what we did; a complete breakdown of Nick\'s process. This includes details about strategy objectives and idea generation, portfolio testing and analyzing results, position sizing and risk management, and execution in a live market. This episode should be helpful for anyone interested in riding big market trends (regardless of asset class). And even if trend following doesn\'t overly appeal to you, then you\'ll still pick up useful insight to trading systems. | This episode features Sam Bankman-Fried, who’s trading skill originated from 3-years at Jane Street—a proprietary trading firm renown for being one of the world’s largest ETF liquidity providers. In late-2017, Sam relocated to Hong Kong and began his foray into the cryptocurrency market when he co-founded Alameda Research. Alameda trade a range of quantitative strategies—such as statistical arbitrage and market making—which are mostly automated, but with a layer of human intervention. Within 2-years Alameda has grown to a point, where each day, it does approximately one billion dollars of turnover across 35 exchanges, accounting for somewhere near 5% of global crypto volume. Sam and I got to discuss many aspects of how Alameda operate and how his team have found lucrative opportunity amongst a chaotic environment… | This episode takes on a slightly different format to normal. Essentially, it’s a response to an email that I received from a listener… The email comes from a gentleman who’s 38 years old with a full-time job, his wife is currently studying and he has three kids. He also has the goal to transition out of his current career into full-time trading, but he has a family who are dependent on his income. And that’s the part he has questions about. Therefore, I asked Alex (@TAGRtrades) if he’d be willing to join me on this episode and share his thoughts on the matter. Alex is a full-time day trader, who has developed skill for trading long side momentum in U.S. equities. He’s also appeared previously on episodes 119 and 157. | Jonathan Shapiro\'s a senior reporter at the Australian Financial Review. While he writes about a range of subjects from banking to hedge funds to private equity, he\'s renown for stories that uncover dishonesty and the crafty schemes of listed companies—for which, he\'s won several awards. Our conversation begins with Jonathan telling the story of Blue Sky Alternative, a fund manager that came unstuck following the release of a short sellers research report. From there, we roll into a very detailed discussion about about Jonathan\'s investigative work on Big Un. Without saying too much, Big was a video marketing company listed on the Australian stock market and a top performer in 2017. But as you\'ll soon hear, Jonathan discovered much of it was smoke in mirrors... | ’d like you to meet part-time Bollywood DJ, full-time equities trader: Nishant Porbanderwalla. For the past 12-years and ever since leaving college, Nish has been a proprietary trader at Kershner Trading Group—KTG is a trading firm in Austin (Texas) founded by Andy Kershner, who appeared back on episode 128. Nish was very open in talking about the ups and downs he’s endured throughout his career, including actual PnL and the psychological states. He also tells an incredible story from trading the Flash Crash of August 2015—although it was only a very short moment in time, it’s a perfect example of what happens when experience meets opportunity. Additionally, Nish gives insight to his trading strategies (past and present), and you’ll pick up a few of his general trading thoughts for how to perform at a high level. |  After appearing on Chat With Traders last year for episode 156, Michael Katz returns: Mike’s a short-term equities trader and managing partner of proprietary trading firm Seven Points Capital. The purpose of doing this episode was to have a very specific and detailed discussion about how Mike traded ride share company Lyft on the first day of its IPO (Mar 29).

No recommendations given.  | Anthony is a proprietary futures trader from Sydney, with 10-years market experience. He\'s active—particularly during the night—in a range of products, such as; Australian and U.S. bonds, equity indices, currencies and a few commodities. While he\'s a click trader, Anthony is quite systematic with his processes and strategies—which are mostly trading spreads between correlated products. Naturally, we speak about many things during this episode, but one of the highlights was hearing about how Anthony got himself into a six-figure drawdown and was able to claw it back in just one-month. We spend quite a bit of time breaking it down. Anthony is also a budding podcaster, who hosts the show Minds of Motorsport. So, if you\'d like to hear from people in the world of motorsport, be sure to give it a listen! | It’s with great pleasure that I introduce to you, Stan Gluzman; an intraday equities trader at proprietary trading firm\xa0Seven Points Capital. Stan also heads up a small team of junior traders at one of the firms’ additional offices—outside of New York—in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We discuss Stan’s path to consistent profitability as a prop trader, and then we get into specifics about the various strategies that Stan has traded in recent years—including the actual strategies that he implements today. I also ask Stan to share details about the various forms of analysis (statistical, fundamental and technical) that he uses to identify his best trading opportunities each day. And if you like this episode, you should go back and listen to\xa0Mike Katz on episode 156.

But the Holy Spirit showed me there is something better than being easy—instead, I should say be obedient and be holy. As an easy adult who was an easy child, I am realizing that being easy has led to being a people-pleaser, being wounded and not saying anything, and avoiding all confrontation. My conviction is that we are called to be holy, which may look like standing up or speaking out! Where this week do you need to be holy instead of being easy? \xa0 \xa0 | Have you ever wanted to get to a certain goal, but it just takes so long that you are ready to give up?

Cinnamon used her expertise in Squarespace to help me optimize my site at the time. Our friendship has grown over the years, and we often are in contact. I love hearing her perspective as she considers herself to be a little bit different than a lot of others in her field. And I would agree and think she is different in the best ways.\xa0   When you look at a lot of creatives, especially on social media, there are certain things about them that kind of tend to be the same. Which has me thinking: Should you build a personal brand when you feel like you don’t quite fit that mold? Let’s hear what Cinnamon has to say!  | Since I quit my day job, the biggest struggle that I have had with a business owner has been time management. Before I left my 8-5, I remember thinking how much time it would feel like I would have, now that I could solely focus on my business. Fast forward a year later, and we all know that is not the case. As a business owner, your mind is constantly going a mile a minute, and there are always a million things to do. And that’s before you start factoring in things like daily distractions, people wanting to grab coffee or lunch, social media time suck, and a million other things that can pop up on the daily. Today I’m sharing the three things I’ve been doing lately to protect my calendar, and therefore my sanity, as I navigate being my own boss and trying to make sure I don’t go crazy trying to do it all.\xa0 |  Annie Otzen is a Getty Photographer and takes stock photography for Getty Images. She has incredible talent and has had some of her images published in the coolest places because of what she is doing with stock.\xa0   Annie has so many great insights into stock photography and creating passive income for your business. I just started last year with passive income, and it completely changed my business. It’s an incredible thing to do something one time and then continue to get paid for it every single month, and that is what Annie is doing with stock photography.  |  It's not a secret I spend a lot of time on Instagram - I love it! But in case you aren't on the app as much as I am, let's start from the beginning. What is an Instagram story? Simply put, they are stories that live for 24 hours and then go away. That is how they started, but things have changed and they have become much more. Ultimately, they give your people a little behind the scenes into what your life looks like.   There are definitely some best practices when it comes to using Instagram stories for your personal brand, and that's what we are talking about today!  | ", 'chan_desc': 'Take It Personally, hosted by professional branding photographer Maddie Peschong, shares advice every Tuesday to help you grow your personal brand to stand out from the noise and thrive, even in the most saturated markets.
