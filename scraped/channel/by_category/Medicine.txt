In this mini-episode of the podcast, Dr. Hyman speaks with longevity expert and bestselling author of, “Blue Zones,” Dan Buettner, about the commonalities amongst several geographic regions around the world where high percentages of centenarians are enjoying remarkably long, full lives. Specifically, Dan shares the pillars of all longevity diets in the world and how Americans can apply this information to their own diets..Dan Buettner is an explorer, National Geographic Fellow, award-winning journalist andproducer, and New York Times bestselling author. He discovered the five places in the world –dubbed Blue Zones – where people live the longest, healthiest lives. Buettner now works in partnership with municipal governments, large employers, and health insurance companies to implement Blue Zones Projects in communities, workplaces, and universities. Blue Zones Projects are well-being initiatives that apply lessons from the BlueZones to entire communities by focusing on changes to the local environment, public policy, and social networks. The program has dramatically improved the health of more than 5 million Americans to date. Buettner also holds three Guinness World Records in distance cycling.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Dan Buettner https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/DanBuettner | Think about how different our medical system would be if all doctors were required to have an extreme health crisis before practicing medicine. It’s through those toughest times with our own health that many of us turn to Functional Medicine, as we realize conventional care isn’t getting us what we need. But sometimes, being so involved in treating others’ diseases makes it difficult for doctors to even see our own symptoms for what they really are. This week’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy, Dr. Cynthia Li, is here to share her personal journey through autoimmunity and realizing her symptoms had deeper meaning.Dr. Li received her medical degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She’s practiced as an internist in many settings, including Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, San Francisco General Hospital, and St. Anthony Medical Clinic serving the homeless. She currently has a private practice in Berkeley, CA and recently published her first book which I highly recommend, Brave New Medicine: A Doctor\'s Unconventional Path to Healing Her Autoimmune Illness.This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by Thrive Market and by SomniFix.\xa0Thrive Market has made it so easy for me to stay healthy, even with my intense travel schedule.

This is because our gut is designed to help us digest food, absorb nutrients, keep invaders out, and even produce helpful compounds like the neurotransmitter serotonin, among so many other powerful functions. This is why the whole body will suffer when the gut is out of balance.In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Stanley Hazen about how the microbiome can influence disease risk and why this is an essential piece to the future of medicine. He also talks to Dr. David Perlmutter about how what we eat influences everything from our mood to our tiniest gut friends—microbes—and how well they function and fight off invaders.\xa0Dr. Stanley Hazen is both the chair of the Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine at the Lerner Research Institute and section head of Preventive Cardiology & Rehabilitation at the Heart and Vascular Institute of the Cleveland Clinic. He’s published more than 400 peer-reviewed articles and has over 50 patents from his pioneering discoveries in atherosclerosis and inflammatory disease. Dr. Hazen made the seminal discovery linking microbial pathways to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.Dr. David Perlmutter is a board-certified neurologist and four-time New York Times best selling author. He serves on the Board of Directors and is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition and as a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.

Dr. Perlmutter’s new book, “Brain Wash,” co-written with Austin Perlmutter, MD, will be published in January 2020.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full length conversation with Dr. Hazenhttps://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrStanleyHazenListen to Dr. Hyman’s full length conversation with Dr. Perlmutter:https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrDavidPerlmutter | Soil is the most important answer to climate change, and also one of the most underappreciated. Without soil, we have no food, and I don’t think I need to elaborate on how catastrophic that would be. The positive news is that we can work on our soil integrity right now to preserve it for many future generations to come—you might be surprised that using regeneratively raised cattle is part of that solution. There is still hope for our children and grandchildren to inherit a balanced and beautiful planet with abundant food production.\xa0Because we rely on soil for food production, big companies are starting to pay attention to the work that needs to be done to preserve it. My guest on this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy, Tom Newmark, is helping them understand what they can do and how to get involved in saving our soils. Tom was CEO of the dietary supplement brand New Chapter, which was acquired by Proctor & Gamble about seven years ago. Since that time Tom has focused on environmental activism with specific attention on regenerative agriculture. He is the co-owner of Finca Luna Nueva Lodge, an organic and biodynamic farm and ecolodge in the mountainous rainforest of Costa Rica that teaches regenerative agriculture. Tom is the co-founder and board chair of The Carbon Underground, co-founder of the Soil Carbon Initiative, and a founding member of the Regenerative Agriculture Initiative of California State University – Chico.This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by ButcherBox.

Fast food manufacturers and grocers lure us into convenient, heavily processed meals that take a toll on our health and our wallet. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Marco Canora and Ocean Robbins about reframing our relationship to cooking and how it can save us time and money, improve our health, and even combat food waste.As a chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author, Marco Canora promotes delicious, simple, and healthful food. In 2003, he opened Hearth in Manhattan, which has a positive two-star review from The New York Times and a prestigious “Outstanding Restaurant" nomination from the James Beard Foundation. In 2017 Marco won the James Beard Foundation award for Best Chef NYC. Marco is also the founder of Brodo, a popular to-go window serving coffee cups of hot, nourishing bone broths.\xa0Ocean Robbins is the author of 31-Day Food Revolution: Heal Your Body, Feel Great, & Transform Your World. He serves as CEO and co-founder of the Food Revolution Network—one of the largest communities of healthy eating advocates on the planet, with more than 500,000 members.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Marco Canora: https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/MarcoCanoraListen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Ocean Robbins: https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/OceanRobbins | Trauma comes in many forms, and it’s something we’re all going to face at one point or another. Though it might seem in the moment that we should push away negative feelings and pretend everything is fine, true healing can’t happen unless we open ourselves to our traumatic experiences and work through them. Despite what many of us in search of help have been told, this doesn’t necessarily need to involve years of therapy or countless medications—we already have tools existing within each of us to work through the emotional, mental, and physical effects of trauma and feel happier and healthier. I think you’ll be surprised just how accessible some of these solutions are.\xa0This week on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m joined by Dr. Jim Gordon to take a further look into healing trauma. He is one of the most extraordinary men I\'ve ever met and I’ve been lucky to call him a friend for 20 years. Dr. Gordon is the author of The Transformation: Discovering Wholeness and Healing After Trauma and is a Harvard educated psychiatrist and a world-renowned expert in using mind-body medicine to heal depression, anxiety, and psychological trauma. He has worked with traumatized children and families in Bosnia, Gaza, Haiti, post-9/11 New York, and Parkland, among many other areas across the world facing tragedy and trauma. Dr. Gordon also works with veterans and active-duty military to address PTSD.This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by Thrive Market.

Stem cells can also sense damaged cells and tissues and send signals that promote self-healing. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. William Li about the things that both enhance, and impair, our body’s regenerative abilities, including our diet. Dr. Li shares information on which foods have been scientifically proven to activate our body’s stem cells.William Li, MD, is a world-renowned physician, scientist, speaker, and author of Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself. He is best known for leading the Angiogenesis Foundation. His groundbreaking work has impacted more than 70 diseases including cancer, diabetes, blindness, heart disease, and obesity. His TED Talk, “Can We Eat to Starve Cancer?” has garnered more than 11 million views. An author of over 100 scientific publications in leading journals such as Science, the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, and more, Dr. Li has served on the faculties of Harvard, Tufts, and Dartmouth Medical School.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Dr. Li: https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrLi | Age is not the definitive factor it’s made out to be when it comes to our health. We can use our age as a baseline for tracking our health and longevity, but it isn’t stagnant. For example, certain types of testing can help us compare our biological age to our calendar age in order to tinker with our wellness routine and achieve the milestones we’re after. With the right steps, we can slow down and even sometimes reverse the aging process.When it comes to our biological age, or the measure of how well our body is actually functioning for whatever life stage we are in, there are many things that impact it. Diet, lifestyle patterns like exercise and sleep, and stress are all involved in forming our biological age, along with many other factors like blood sugar, inflammation, and genetics. This week on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m joined by Dr. David Sinclair to explore the topic of longevity and anti-aging and how he reduced his own internal age by more than 20 years. Dr. Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School, where he and his colleagues study longevity, aging, and how to slow its effects.\xa0This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by ButcherBox.

Yet, when we recently reflected on a number of conversations from The Doctor’s Farmacy, we couldn’t help but hear a common and hopeful message. In this mini-episode, we revisit four conversations Dr. Hyman has had with guests on this podcast, each with a common refrain: Progress is being made and it’s happening fast!\xa0Michael Pollan is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Cooked, Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, The Botany of Desire, and his latest book How to Change Your Mind, which is all about the new science of psychedelics. A longtime contributor to the New York Times Magazine, he also teaches writing at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley where he is the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism. In 2010, Time magazine named him one of the one hundred most influential people in the world.Dr. Hallberg is a Medical Director at Virta Health and a Fellow of the Aspen Institute’s Health Innovator Fellowship and a member of the Aspen Global Leadership Network. She is also the Medical Director and founder of the Medically Supervised Weight Loss Program at Indiana University Health Arnett and an adjunct Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine.

Dr. Hallberg is a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine, American Board of Obesity Medicine, and The American Board of Clinical Lipidology and is a Registered Exercise Physiologist by the ACSM. She is also a Fellow of the Obesity Medicine Association and The National Lipid Association.David Wallace-Wells is the deputy editor of New York magazine and the author of the international bestseller The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming, published in February 2019, which the New York Times called both “brilliant” and “the most terrifying book I have ever read.”Dr. Sonia Angell is a former Deputy Commissioner at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), where she oversaw the Division of Prevention and Primary Care.

That’s why in Functional Medicine we always take the gut into account, along with the rest of the body, when trying to understand a brain disease. Unfortunately, conventional medicine likes to look at each part of the body separately, which may be why doctors have a hard time effectively treating neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS. Knowing that the gut affects the brain and understanding the far-reaching role of the microbiome has led this week’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy to approach neurodegenerative conditions with a whole new perspective.\xa0Dr. Jay Lombard is an internationally acclaimed neurologist, author, and keynote speaker specializing in neuroimmunological conditions and medical mysteries. Dr. Lombard integrates biological, psychological, and existential components in his holistic treatment approach. Dr. Lombard’s clinical experience revealed an interesting pattern: one patient with ALS also had small intestine bacterial overgrowth, then another who had ulcerative colitis, another had Crohn’s, and so on. He started seeing the connection between these bacterial imbalances and Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, and the link to neurological symptoms.\xa0This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy\xa0is brought to you by Thrive Market.

Because the more I do that, I end up to to be like sticky paper where things are just happening and flying in.” (19:18) “A mood is not something that happens to us, it is the result of our thinking, our speech, the content and the information that we let into our lives, that's what creates our moods.” (26:57) “No need to have catastrophe and disaster and depression and depletion, be your inspiration.

But did you know that the pill also has a huge impact on your brain chemistry, behavior and ultimately how you experience the world? Dr. Sarah Hill is a leading researcher in evolutionary psychology who has become fascinated with the effects of birth control on our psychology and health.\xa0 After experiencing post-birth control syndrome first hand, Dr. Sarah realized that the pill had altered how her brain functioned and her experience as a human being. Since then Dr. Sarah has worked to understand the way the pill changes the brain and provide women context into what is going on with birth control so that they can make informed decisions about their health. On this episode we are digging into exactly how the birth control pill impacts your brain functioning, hormones, mood and outlook on life, examining why it has become commonplace for practitioners to prescribe birth control as a one-size-fits-all medical bandaid, and the potential harm that the birth control pill is having on women without them knowing it.\xa0 Hormonal birth control can influence everything from your zest and vibrancy for life, to who you are attracted to and your likelihood of depression or suicide. It is important for you to equip yourself with the knowledge you need to make a decision that is right for you and your health. Your brain, decisions, stress, and behavior are all impacted by the messages you are sending them, and birth control is a key message that you do not want to overlook.\xa0 Have you experienced a shift in your personality, motivation or overall outlook on life pre or post-birth control? Share your experience with the pill with us in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “It just all of a sudden hit me like a lightning bolt. The pill changes everything because it changes what the brain does.” (12:43) “Something like the birth control pill doesn't seem like a big deal because we only think about hormones in terms of how they influence things like endometrial lining proliferation or something like that. Without thinking about this as something that plays a key role in what my brain is doing in creating the experience of being me.” (15:45) “We need to be given the full picture of what the pill does to our bodies from head to toe, and especially our brain if we are going to be making informed decisions about our health.” (24:42) “I wish doctors and medical research would understand how important fertility regulation is to us because we do these things even though it's not good for us because of the fear.” (37:02) “If we are going to be making informed decisions about our health, we need to know what it is that our body is going to be doing, and who we are going to be. Because it changes what our brain is doing, and it changes who we are.” (43:46) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Dr. Sarah Hill Website This Is Your Brain on Birth Control by Dr. Sarah Hill Follow Dr. Sarah on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter EY 60: Dr. Jolene Brighten EY 93: Dr. Lisa Hendrickson-Jack Register for the EO Hormone Summit Here \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  Examining the conversation around the taxation and profitability of menstrual products Tips to get more involved in advocacy and how to commit to policy change Ways that you can get your legislators talking about the economics of menstruation How to embrace the political aspect of periods and remove the stigma Exploring the lack of access to menstruation products in America and on a global scale  \xa0 Episode Summary Did you know that there are women in the US right now who cannot afford or gain access to menstrual supplies? The passion to bring awareness to menstrual product accessibility for women and girls all over the world is one I share with today's guest, Jennifer Weiss-Wolf. A gender, politics and menstruation advocate, attorney and the architect of the US campaign to squash the tampon tax, Jennifer is taking her dedication and expertise to the policies and laws that we live our lives by.\xa0 Over a dozen states have taken action towards menstrual accessibility in the past four years since Jennifer started working on this issue, and 32 have taken steps to eliminate the tampon tax. Jennifer is moving the needle in policy and actually moving lawmakers to action through vocabulary, framework, tools, and most importantly, support from women like you.\xa0 Jennifer works to open up the conversation around the lack of access to menstrual products in the United States, and wants to ensure that menstruating does not pose an obstacle in people's lives regardless of their age, race, or social status. By putting the issues around menstruation in front of legislators in a way they can understand, Jennifer expresses her civic duty to get everyone fully engaged in the conversation.\xa0 It is time to change how menstruation exists in our public spheres and change the policy our government creates in order to accomplish global and locally appropriate solutions. Our current policies and laws do not reflect our wellbeing or our reality, and it is only through becoming involved in advocacy that you can be more represented in your legal structures and in turn push the issues you believe in into the limelight.\xa0 How do you work to normalize the discussion around menstruation and impact systemic change? Share how you feel about removing the stigma around periods in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “I really sort of turned my attention to where my interest lied and where my skills could be most useful, and that was really in thinking about how we change the policies and laws by which we live to better reflect and represent all of us.” (12:33) “It's not just a few unfortunates who can't afford these products, its that our entire systems are actually built and structured to not ensure equality and to not ensure equal opportunity for those who need it the most.” (16:16) “If anything about menstruation, access to products, access to safe products or otherwise, inhibited or kept people from doing so, well then it was our obligation to right that wrong.” (22:40) “Its been sort of extraordinarily high energy and really really exciting to be previewing and going public with these arguments that we have been toiling over for the past several years.” (33:06) “For the 5 years that I have been doing this, I have to say my mind has just kind of been on fire since all of this. It's just completely opened my eyes to an entire way of thinking and advocating and communicating and existing that is so much better than the 47 that lead up to it.” (40:48) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Periods Gone Public by Jennifer Weiss-Wolf Follow Jennifer on Twitter Tax Free.

And that really is the frontier right now.” (21:18) “It's not about how busy my practice is, it's not about how good of a surgeon I am or what the result is, but sometimes all it really takes is holding somebody's hand and telling her it is going to be okay.

First, while adrenal fatigue may not be real, your symptoms are. And it is important to get to the root cause of what is impacting your cortisol levels, even if it is not what you thought it was.\xa0 The creator of The Energy Blueprint, Ari has dedicated his life to studying the production of energy and helping educate others to optimize their mitochondrial function. An expert in chronic fatigue, mitochondrial function, detoxification and metabolism, Ari is here to paint a cohesive picture of what is going on inside the cells that are causing you to feel fatigued, and what you can do to stop and even reverse it.\xa0 If you are accustomed to burnout and think you just need to deal with it, Ari provides tips to tell you how you can overcome your fatigue and increase your energy levels naturally and sustainably. Energy is everything, and what is driving your energy is driving your cellular function, so it is crucial that you know what is going on.\xa0 When you connect the dots between adrenal fatigue, cortisol levels, misrepresentation, and unique symptoms, you can start to piece together a picture of your unique optimal functioning. Symptoms, cortisol levels, and hormonal imbalances can be tough to navigate, but with Ari’s simple Energy Blueprint you can enable your mitochondria to become more resilient and set yourself up for success. How does your level of energy change throughout the day? Have you considered looking at the root of your symptoms instead of just covering it up with the bandaid of adrenal fatigue? Share your experience with us in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “Fundamentally, conventional medicine is looking at sickness and sort of trying to study sickness as a path to health. And you don't get healthy by trying to undo sickness.” (12:57) “I basically just decided, you know what, I am going to do the most comprehensive review of the scientific literature on this topic that has ever been done, and then I am just going to communicate the objective facts of those findings.” (22:23) “There is absolutely, in this whole body of evidence, there is no real indication of any burnout of the adrenal glands or any actual inability to produce cortisol.” (26:06) “Fatigue is actually an intelligent symptom, it's adaptive, it’s part of our body's healing response. It becomes pathological when it's chronic, but it's important to understand fatigue as your body being stuck in a mode where it feels not safe enough to be in peacetime metabolism and energy production mode.” (35:38) “Most people know melatonin as a sleep hormone, but here is what they don't know. Melatonin is the most potent protector of your mitochondria in existence, it is the most powerful mitochondrial antioxidant known to man.” (44:51) \xa0 Resources Mentioned The Energy Blueprint The Energy Blueprint Podcast The Energy Blueprint Free Masterclass \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  The role personal responsibility plays in the self-care you do every day Tips to build daily healthy exercise and diet habits at home in 30 days How to use ‘flawsome’ and give yourself the grace to be less than perfect Ways to tune into your body and use resistance as your greatest teacher Doing a little something instead of all or nothing to find greater success  \xa0 Episode Summary The all or nothing mentality that so many of us have towards life and fitness is not healthy. This mentality is something that Bree Argetsinger, or The Betty Rocker, gave up subscribing to years ago.

You think well ‘I see the way these models look and I’m going to do what they’re doing because they look happy, they look beautiful, they're getting the validation’. And I was sold on a system that doesn't really exist. It's fake.” (9:33) “When you start to think about your body as your friends, and all of these amazing cells in your body, all of them are dedicated to the purpose of you every single day. You start to just recognize your own responsibility in loving and caring for this amazing body that you have.” (14:55) “I really think that the things that make us ‘ugly’, whatever our greatest wounds are, they are also our greatest gifts, they are the things that make us unique, and they are also the things that make you special.” (21:04) “We take the knowledge that we have and filter it through our own personal filter and thinking system, and we want to deliver it in a way that really meets someone where they are at at this moment, and create space for them to expand within it.” (31:54) “No matter where we are, we are shaped by the things that have come before us. And some of those things are negative, and some of those things are positive, but using the sort of method that I just described, you can take the best things from all of which you have been given, all of which you have experienced, and you are the creator of your own life.” (39:12) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Free 30-Day Make Fat Cry Challenge The Betty Rocker Website The Betty Rocker Blog Follow The Betty Rocker on Instagram EY 100: Dr. Mariza \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  Going on the journey to rediscover your true calling How stress and trauma can have a huge effect on people’s health The body’s ability to balance its natural lifeforce when it needs to heal The difference between situational trauma and developmental traumas and why the distinction matters How to listen to and trust the various parts of your inner-self What it takes to clear the trauma in your system so that the body can heal itself  \xa0 Episode Summary Each and every one of us is dealing with trauma. When trauma, no matter how severe, is left unattended it can spiral into all kinds of illness. Dr. Lissa Rankin has studied this connection from many different perspectives and understands how to address it to regain control over your health. Dr. Lissa Rankin is a New York Times best-selling author, a speaker, physician, mystic, creator of The Daily Flame, and founder of the Whole Health Medicine Institute. Passionate about what makes people optimally healthy and what predisposes them to illness, she discovered that connecting with your “Inner Pilot Light” is essential to optimal health, making your body ripe for miracles. Lissa takes us on her incredible journey into integrative medicine which combines her passions for science and spirituality. She has made it her mission to study and explore how trauma-induced stress makes us sick and how to heal from it. To that end, Lissa describes how our bodies’ natural ability to heal takes place when we address the underlying trauma that we’ve experienced and listen to all various inner-parts of ourselves that need to be heard in order to thrive. Have you taken steps to clear the trauma in your system? Let’s talk about it in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “Twelve years of learning to follow my inner pilot light has completely reorganized my entire life and my entire world-view.” [10:00] “More than ninety percent of doctor visits are related to stress and yet we’re not talking about where the stress comes from and most of it comes from trauma.” [12:58] “As long as the lifeforce is moving in the body, then the body’s wisdom or natural intelligence will know how to distribute that lifeforce to heal whatever might be getting out of whack.” [17:42] “I think we’re in the process of turning medicine upside down.” [44:51] \xa0 Resources Mentioned Find Dr. Lissa Rankin online at Inner Pilot Whole Health Medicine Institute The Anatomy of a Calling by Dr. Lissa Rankin MindBodyGreen Summit 2019 IFS Annual Conference Center for Self Leadership, IFS Advanced Integrative Therapy Institute, AIT Radical Remission by Kelly A.

That’s what I was diagnosed with a decade ago. Our adrenals are hormones produced in a set of glands near our kidneys. But here’s the deal, chronic fatigue doesn’t actually start there - it begins up in our limbic, or survival, brain. For those of you who’ve struggled with this type of chronic fatigue, today’s episode might just change your life. I’m taking a deep dive into the myths surrounding adrenal fatigue. I explain what it really is and what’s going on that makes you feel so tired all the time, and how you can heal from all the burnout.\xa0 Today I’m speaking from both personal and professional experience to explain what is known, not known, and incorrectly assumed about adrenal systems and adrenal fatigue. I discuss what triggers many of the common problems of cortisol imbalance and what you can do about it. You’re going to walk away from this episode with the knowledge to be more empowered about taking control of your energy. Do you have any systems to help cope with the stress and fatigue in your life? Let’s talk about it in the comments on the episode page! \xa0 Quotes “Without knowing what’s really going on we can’t actually focus on the appropriate area of concern in the body. If your adrenals are incorrectly getting blamed, then they are unfortunately getting misdiagnosed and could potentially be treated in some cases which could lead to bigger issues.” [5:07] “What we know now is that adrenal function isn’t actually impaired at all. It’s that our body and brain are regulating the cortisol response system based on how much stress we’re dealing with.” [15:16] “On any given day we can be triggered by perceived stress fifty plus times. Yikes! That’s a lot of stressors hitting our body on a constant daily basis.” [19:43] “Perceived stress is the one thing that we can really get control over and it’s also the one thing that when we don’t have control over can lead to a lot of gasoline on the inflammatory fire.” [24:53] \xa0 Resources Mentioned Top 10 Energy-Boosting Remedies The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Snyder Episode 120 with Dr. Carrie Jones Precision Analytical DUTCH Hormone Test The Role of Stress and the HPA Axis in Chronic Disease Management by Thomas G.

Prior to cholesterol adventures Dave was a senior software scientist and an engineer. He brings this “out of the box” thinking to the world of medicine and we are all better off for it.\xa0 He began a low-carb, high-fat diet in April 2015 and has since learned everything he could about it with special emphasis on cholesterol. He saw his own lipid numbers spike substantially after going on the diet and spotted a pattern in the lipid system that’s very similar to distributed objects in networks. He’s since learned quite a bit on the subject both through research and experimentation which has revealed some very powerful data.

He has a major interest in the preventative medicine and encourages his patients to lose weight before undergoing surgery. Although his speciality is surgery, Gary believes it is much better to help people avoid surgery by taking preventative measures, which often involves primarily altering the diet. He is an advocate of a Low Carbohydrate Healthy Fat (LCHF) lifestyle for the health benefits. He was “a fat kid” and has experienced ‘too many’ other health issues until changing his diet and lifestyle. He has concerns that as we get older the health systems will be under significant stress from financial and health burden aspects. It is simply unsustainable – a train crash in evolution. In recent years Gary has focussed on the role of diet in the development of diabetes, obesity and cancer. He has been speaking out internationally on the combined role of sugar, fructose, refined carbohydrates and polyunsaturated oils linking together to be behind inflammation and modern disease. Gary remains committed to understanding the central role of nutrition in everything ranging from our health issues to its role in influencing education, the environmental impact, economics, politics and belief systems. He has incurred the wrath of regulatory bodies for his stand on public health, but he and his wife, Belinda, remain active defending the benefits of low carb healthy fat living.

If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. On this episode we’re taking a look at your gut and the fermented foods that are claiming to increase your overall health. Fermented foods can be good for your intestines, but some fermented foods are actually harmful to your health in certain situations. Oftentimes the fermented foods that are being sold in grocery stores are not the same foods that are being studied in research, and that can make it very difficult to know which fermented foods you should incorporate into your diet. I’m joined today by Summer Bock, a microbiologist with a thorough background in the fermented world who trains fermentationists and coined the term ‘gut rebuilding’. We’re going deep into all things fermented, including the time Summer got into a bathtub full of fermented foods. She explains the history of food fermenting, which fermented foods you should avoid at the grocery store, and the value of incorporating fermented foods into your diet for improved overall health. If you have been struggling with your gut health and aren’t sure what to try next, be sure to listen to my conversation about fermented foods with Summer Bock. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [1:10] Today’s topic is fermented foods — which ones are best for your gut health, which ones should you avoid, and how they can help improve your overall health. [2:18] Introducing Summer Bock, who explains why certain ferments should be avoided depending on your health concerns. [4:02] Examining the authenticity of one of the hottest fermented food products on the market today — kefir. [6:53] What is a SCOBY, where did it come from and how does it affect food fermentation? [10:29] Lactic acid is a healthy natural microbial most commonly found in yogurt. [12:08] How does leaky gut react to ingesting fermented foods? [14:58] Summer explains multiple reasons why you will want to avoid kombucha when dealing with digestive issues. [19:18] GMOs and natural fermented foods — is it possible for a natural food be patented, marketed and sold in grocery stores? [21:23] Understanding how foods fit together from a historical standpoint and multiple ways that fermented foods interact with your bodily functions. [23:22] Will you get sick if you try fermenting foods at home? Consider the sugar content, alcoholic content and smell of homemade fermented foods before drinking anything. [26:58] An overview of Summer’s gut health, chronic illness and functional ferment pairings charts. [28:12] How to avoid the pitfalls of making your own ferments at home, the value of watching someone else make a ferment in person, and why you should expect to fail at your first attempt. [30:52] The journey that led Summer to her work with fermented foods started with severe environmental allergies and led her to selling sauerkraut from her home. [37:44] Summer’s fermenting experiences, from fermenting mushrooms, tempeh, and beans to bathing in sauerkraut brine. [45:12] Digestive impairment and amino acids — are you protein deficient?

If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re diving into one of the most misunderstood diagnoses in the medical field — Lyme disease.\xa0 Do you think you might have Lyme disease? If you’ve been experiencing symptoms that you haven’t been able to explain or are wondering if Lyme disease might be the diagnosis you’ve been waiting for, then you need to listen to my conversation with Dr. Tom Moorcroft.\xa0 Dr. Moorcroft is a world renowned expert on Lyme disease who practices osteopathic medicine and focuses his work on finding the true causes behind the symptoms of those who may be suffering from Lyme disease.\xa0 \xa0 In the first part of this episode Dr. Moorcroft will differentiate between patients who may not have Lyme disease but are experiencing it’s symptoms from those who will get the diagnosis and do need to seek further Lyme disease treatment.\xa0 He’ll answer some of the hard questions about the topic — can Lyme disease be solved? What is the number one symptom that points to Lyme disease over any other symptoms?\xa0 At what point in treatment can patients reasonably expect to see positive changes in their symptoms?\xa0 And what is the best approach to your health that will nearly guarantee a fighting chance for your body to heal from this disease?\xa0 Dr. Moorcroft has seen countless cases of Lyme disease, as well as too many misdiagnoses, in his work and shares many insights into the knowledge that makes him a clear authority on the topic. \xa0 In the second part of this episode I will follow up on the conversation I had with Dr. Moorcroft, including research and reference checks, a look at the likelihood of contracting Lyme disease in a non-endemic area, and a list of possible other diseases that your symptoms may indicate you are possibly dealing with instead. I’ve created a flowchart to help you think through the process of further pursuing or rejecting a Lyme disease diagnosis, and I am confident that you will have a greater understanding of the probability of being diagnosed with Lyme disease after listening to this conversation. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [1:10] Today’s topic is Lyme disease — it’s symptoms, causes, and too-often misunderstood diagnosis. [2:32] Introducing Tom Moorcroft, who differentiates patients who may not have Lyme disease but are experiencing it’s symptoms from those who will get the diagnosis and need to seek further Lyme disease treatment.\xa0 [8:05] Dr. Moorcroft explains the importance of prioritizing the multiple stresses that are affecting your health before you begin to treat for Lyme disease. [13:00] How likely is it for someone without classic exposure to Lyme disease to be diagnosed with it? [18:06] A look at accuracy and the CDC required time frame for Lyme disease testing and what that can mean for altering effective treatments. [22:03] Are chronic antimicrobial treatments helpful for potential Lyme disease patients? Dr. Moorcroft explains the effects of a chronic treatment approach and why antimicrobial herbals are even more effective for many of his patients. [27:33] At what point should a patient stop thinking they have Lyme disease based on test results and symptoms? Dr. Moorcroft shares his standard approach to treatment when there are questions marks in the diagnosis. [31:25] The danger of assuming that you have Lyme disease, and the importance of seeking out a proper diagnosis no matter what your symptoms are. [35:18] Wrapping up with Dr. Moorcroft, who shares his personal experience with battling Lyme disease and the three key changes he made to his lifestyle in order to let healing happen.\xa0 [38:00] Examining Lyme disease further — are the symptoms alone enough to qualify for a diagnosis of Lyme disease? [41:48] Follow up on the references that were discussed with Dr. Moorcroft regarding testing time frames, false negatives, and alternative testing options. [45:18] Ignoring a diagnosis altogether — how effective would antimicrobial treatments be for someone that is showing the symptoms of Lyme disease? [46:22] Dr. C examines the likelihood of being diagnosed with Lyme disease if you have the symptoms without a tick bite or a rash living in a non-endemic area and having received a false negative test result. [52:42] A walk through of the potential Lyme disease diagnosis flow chart. [54:50] What is the likelihood of having a co-infection along with Lyme disease and what would be the appropriate course of action? [55:39] Potential alternate diagnosis options for someone that has experienced Lyme disease symptoms for a long period of time but has not received the diagnosis. [59:25] Seeking treatment at your low point means that your reactions are almost guaranteed to make you feel better almost immediately. [1:03:54] Do you have a topic you’d like me to cover?

That’s just as bad not diagnosing Lyme in someone who clearly has it.” — Tom Moorcroft \xa0 “You have the power to make tons of changes in your life, with or without Lyme disease.” — Tom Moorcroft \xa0 “Your body can be willing to heal itself, but it’s your responsibility to provide it with the raw materials — the nutrition, the exercise, and the sleep — that’s required to heal.” — Tom Moorcroft \xa0 “You want to feel better, and I want you to feel better, but if you treat something that is not the real cause of your pain, you’re going to miss what is the real cause and stress out your body in ways that won’t be helpful.” — Dr. Christianson | Between the latest online fads and the crazy media headlines, it’s easier than ever to get confused about your health. If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re discussing lectins, the naturally occurring proteins that are found in most plants. Are they dangerous? Which ones are the most dangerous? What do you do about high lectin foods that are otherwise healthy? Lectins are a hot topic in today’s health conversations and the research seems to be both confusing and inconclusive. Joining me to break down this controversial topic is Dr. David Katz, author and founder of the Preventive Research Center. He has a strong background in public health and a solid understanding of how to weigh medical evidence accurately. He has joined me today to share his research-based opinions about the benefits and risks of keeping lectins in your diet. \xa0 In addition to our conversation about lectins we are going even deeper to look at the crucial importance of valuing research over opinion, the danger of allowing science to overcome common sense. We take a look at the benefits and risks of following current fad diets and the long-term implications of the clean meat movement. Dr. Katz also shares some insights into the books, initiatives and apps that he has developed to encourage greater health today. This conversation is about so much more than just lectins — it’s about the long-term effects of the health decisions that you make every day, and how you can know that you’re making the best decisions that will add years to your health and health to your years. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [:35] Today’s topic is lectins — exactly how dangerous they are and what you should do about them in your diet.\xa0 [1:55] Introducing David Katz, who offers an overview of lectins and where you can find them in your diet. [4:20] Looking at lectins with logic — research has proven that people who eat more legumes, fruits, vegetables, and grains have better health than those who don’t. [8:00] Lectin research and data that has been gathered has shown that lectins can bind red blood cells and slow the effects of cancer. [10:37] An overview of Dr. Katz’s new book The Truth About Food includes an in-depth look at the benefits and risks of lectins in your diet. [15:11] The importance of applying a fine lens filter when considering the benefit-to-risk ratio of any medical decision. [16:17] Dr. Katz’s five quantitative approaches to decision-making CARE — clinical applications of research evidence — include efficacy, safety, quality, what else is there for this condition? And patient preference. [20:12] Similarities between the Gundry lectin study and the parachute study and why you should be leery of both. [26:02] Why have food and nutrition succumbed to dogma and the domains of science? Consider the benefits reaped by big food, big pharma, big media, and big publishing companies. [32:12] The modern day threats to our hard-wired brains are coming at us in slow motion and with long-term effects. [34:50] What does the ketogenic diet have in common with cholera and a cocaine binge? They can all help you lose weight quickly with no regard to long-term health goals. [38:42] Natural science and the importance of being both responsible about the use of scientific evidence and responsive to patient needs when evidence is lacking. [40:51] Why the things that matter most will never be proven in RCTs, hierarchies of evidence, and how to understand what is true. [44:17] The usefulness of evidence threshold pathway mapping and the ultimate purpose that it serves. [46:15] Dr. Katz shares his opinion on the clean meat movement, from intake levels and sustainability to exploring meat alternatives. [49:47] What are the health effects of clean meat foods and what is the net environmental impact of producing synthetic meats? [51:23] Dr. Katz introduces Diet ID, a diet mapping app that captures the overall footprint and assessment of a diet. [55:29] Wrapping up the questions that we have discussed on this episode and the value of research that will give us the answers we need. [1:02:27] Do you have a topic you’d like me to cover? Contact me on Facebook or Instagram using #medicalmyths. | Between the latest online fads and the crazy media headlines, it’s easier than ever to get confused about your health. If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re going to wrap up our examination of current thyroid disease issues. Have you ever wondered if it is okay to take higher doses of thyroid medication, even if your blood tests say you’re getting too much? Many patients say that they don’t feel better until their hormone levels are much higher than is recommended. I’m joined today by Janie Bowthorpe, thyroid patient activist and author who feels it is important to disregard blood test results. Her own health was compromised when she developed thyroid disease and it wasn’t until she started dosing natural thyroid medication more accurately that she started to feel better. She has joined me to share her opinions on the best way to diagnose and treat thyroid disease, and to consider the many factors that affect thyroid health, including iron levels, cortisol problems, TSH levels, and adrenal problems. Janie is passionate about her calling and I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about her perspective and experiences as an advocate for thyroid patients.\xa0 \xa0 After the interview, I will follow-up on the key points of our conversation. I want you to consider the need for conducting high-quality studies and of the importance of understanding the many side effects and complications that may not be highlighted in patient-shared experiences. To do so, I will give you an overview of several studies regarding low TSH, each of which included a look at how low TSH levels can affect your body’s ability to manage free radicals, bone health, cardiovascular health, and total mortality rates. Once the facts are laid out, I will share my opinion on this important topic of thyroid disease and medication. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [:35] Today’s topic is the third of three segments on the topic of thyroid disease. [1:55] Introducing Janie Bowthorpe, who shares the health and medical experiences that led her to becoming a thyroid advocate. [5:23] The symptoms that led Janie to the diagnosis of thyroid disease only got worse over time, but she quickly she experienced a turnaround and stabilization once she started natural thyroid medication. [10:28] Janie’s calling to be an advocate for thyroid patients and a look at how her observations were reflected in large numbers of patients over time. [14:32] Defining ‘optimal doses’ in thyroid patients using dessicated thyroid means people feeling their best and staying that way. [20:27] Achieving optimal doses and identifying thyroid hormone resistance through patterns of groups of patients and genetic testing. [25:41] What are the concerns that come with TSH levels that are too low or too high? How do inadequate iron and cortisol problems play into these concerns? [30:43] Ferritin versus serum iron and considering the presence of inflammation and cortisol problems. [35:46] Are the benefits associated with TSH suppression worth the long-term health risks?\xa0 [39:40] Studies that have disregarded adrenal problems may not be as telling as patient-shared experiences. [43:54] Wrapping up with Janie Bowthorpe and her testimony of the importance of patients listening to other patients. [45:57] Should you ignore your TSH? Understanding your TSH as your pituitary gland telling your thyroid to work, and a look at what patients have experienced in trying to optimize it’s levels.\xa0 [48:47] My five criteria for reviewing evidence, and the importance of placing more weight on the evidence that is independent of the source it came from. [51:30] Understanding the treatment that thyroid patients have received from the medical community and a host of secondary problems that can contribute to feeling unwell despite thyroid stability. [54:08] What high-quality studies have been conducted to increase our understanding of what happens to people with low TSH levels? [59:02] Study results include redox pathways and the body’s antioxidant capacity, bone health as it relates to lumbar spine density and bone age, increase in inflammation, and increased mortality rates relative to decreasing TSH scores. [1:06:02] My recommendation for thyroid patients — based on the facts. [1:07:58] Do you have a topic you’d like me to cover?

If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re going to continue our examination of the link between soy and thyroid disease. I want you to consider the sum total of knowledge on this topic and the general scientific consensus of evidence from real human studies, not just the shocking results of one or two outlier studies. To help with the conversation I’m joined by Anthony Dissen, professor of public health at Stockton University. He is a nutritionist and is active in many non-profits in the cancer world, and is a scholar of plants and specifically soy. \xa0 Anthony offers an overview of the general misunderstandings about soy, how soy got its bad name, and why eating a meat-based diet does not equate to avoiding a plant-based diet. We talk about the dangers of eating any one food in excess and how the body works in healthy but non-intuitive ways. We take a look at the link between soy and GMOs, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and menopause, and discuss what ideal soy consumption amounts should look like for both omnivore and plant-based diets. Anthony’s shares his favorite way to eat soy, and offers two of his favorite quick recipes. I will then wrap up our conversation by sharing some of the findings that I’ve discovered in the years that I have spent studying soy and its effect on the health of the human body. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [:35] Today’s topic is the second of three segments on the correlation between soy and thyroid disease. [1:48] Introducing Anthony Dissen, who shares my perspective on the general misunderstanding from the medical community and the population at large about soy and its effect on the body’s overall health. [6:11] When did soy start to get such a bad name? [9:48] Eating a meat-based diet does not mean that you are avoiding a soy-based diet — consider what animals are fed before they are butchered. [11:28] What is in soy formula for infants, and how is it affecting child development? [14:28] Examining the link between soy and thyroid disease, including iodine deficiency, dietary goitrogens and autoimmune diseases. [18:42] The danger of eating any one food in excess is the same for soy, flaxseed, bok choy, mustard seeds or kale, because of their common goitrogenic properties. [25:08] Cooked or raw? How to enjoy your vegetables while minimizing goitrogenic properties. [26:00] GMOs and soy — understanding the difference between soy produced for animal and human consumption. [27:40] Parameters for normal soy consumption, healthy sea vegetables and safe iodine content. [32:45] Soy and breast cancer — are there benefits of soy for reducing risk of recurrent breast cancer, and what exactly are phytoestrogens doing to our bodies? [37:51] Soy and menopause — how does soy protect and maintain the health of an aging body? [42:22] Human studies that have proven that antinutrients are a non-issue with soy consumption. [45:55]\xa0 Anthony explains how increasing permeability could possibly be is a good thing. [49:02] What is the ideal amount of soy intake for a plant-based diet and an omnivore diet? [55:51] Is there any relevance between fermented and non-fermented soy? [58:15] The findings from my research on thyroid disease included three categories that I couldn’t explain away — soy formula with iodine, one study on siblings, and one study on hypothyroidism. [1:02:17] Wrapping up with Anthony — whether it’s soy food or not, any food that is being consumed in normal quantities can only be of benefit to your health.

If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re going to begin our examination of the link between soy and thyroid disease. As I have spent time deep in the research, my opinion of the correlation between the two has changed over the years. My goal for this three-episode series is to have conversations with people with strong views from both sides of the argument of the link between soy and thyroid disease. Each guest will present their perspectives on the topic and then afterward I will weigh out their evidence and discuss the results. \xa0 I’m first joined by Dr. Kaayla T. Daniel, PhD and author of The Whole Soy Story: The Dark Side to America’s Favorite Health Food. She shares her experience with studying soy and thyroid disease — from poor-quality research to studies that have been inconsistent in proving the effects of soy on the thyroid. Dr. Daniel highlights who is at greater risk for negative soy effects and also shares her top picks for soy in a healthy diet.\xa0 \xa0 After our conversation I will wrap up with my key takeaways, citational studies and a look at four main areas of health that can be affected by soy consumption — including breast cancer in menopausal women, perimenopausal symptoms, cardiovascular health, and bone density. The studies are conclusive and the evidence is clear, and you won’t want to miss the results I share on this first of three conversations about the highly important topic of thyroid disease and soy. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [:35] Today’s topic is the first of three segments on the correlation between soy and thyroid disease — and we’re looking at it from the angle of an anti-soy expert. [2:31] Introducing Dr. Kaayla Daniel, who shares her experiences with soy research and an overview of ayurvedic medicine and soy consumption in Asia. [7:05] A look at the numbers — how the correlation between cancer rates and soy consumption increases or decreases based on cancer type, how it affects symptoms of menopause, and its effect on cardiovascular health. [13:24] Dr. Daniel shares her findings about soy as it relates to thyroid health, it’s effects as a goitrogen, and a look at supporting research. [21:28] Studies that have been inconsistent in proving that soy does not have any effect on the thyroid often select humans that are not at risk for thyroid disease in the first place. [25:06] Understanding the iodine issues is not a simple, isolated factor to the soy issue, especially in people that already have health and thyroid problems. [29:15] Differentiating the effects of foreign xenobiotics (non-biologically derived estrogens) from plant phytoestrogens and how the body responds to each at different stages in the life cycle. [31:50] Dr. Daniel’s general health takeaways include understanding who is most at risk for negative soy effects, including vegans, menopausal women, and infants on soy-based formula.\xa0 [38:35] You may be surprised to hear that Dr. Daniel enjoys eating natto, tofu, and tempu, all of which she considers safest in moderation and when avoiding this list of highly processed soy foods. [44:25] A description of some of the best sources of soy, and what Dr. Daniel really thinks of the taste of natto. [48:25] Dr. Daniel’s work with debunking the dirty secrets of detoxification programs and one obvious reason that you can’t always trust studies at face value. [54:46] A look at the citational studies from my conversation with Dr. Daniel, including soy as a cause of cancer, soy affecting thyroid peroxidase, and the risks associated with feeding soy formula to infants. [1:00:17] Is there a drawback to avoiding soy? The evidence shows that soy may not simply be a neutral product to avoid but is actually beneficial to overall health. [1:01:29] Cardiovascular disease is the biggest killer of adult women, and it can be preventable in part by soy consumption. [1:04:02] Bone density and menopause studies show that soy consumption can have a positive effect on estrogen level status in females. [1:07:30] The breast cancer studies results that have shown that soy intake was a cause in lower risks of death or recurrence of cancer. [1:10:05] Large population studies results are conclusive — ‘soy supplementation has no effect on thyroid function’. [1:15:56] Do you have a topic you’d like me to cover?

If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re talking about the connection between breast implants and thyroid disease. Awareness of Breast Implant Illness (BII) is growing in the medical community, and today we’re going to answer some of the most pressing questions surrounding this topic. Who is at a greater risk for developing an illness after implants? Is implant removal the only solution for those with Hashimoto’s disease? If you already have implants what are your options? There are many questions that have yet to be answered on this topic, but that didn’t stop me from diving into the literature to find out all I could about this controversial topic to share with you on today’s podcast. \xa0 I’m joined by America’s holistic plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn, who performs up to 150 breast augmentation surgeries each year. We discuss the quality of research that is currently being conducted to help identify the correlation between breast augmentation and certain autoimmune diseases and what options are available to women who have already had implants. You’ll want to hear the advice that Dr. Youn gives to all women who are considering getting implants and why the one test that tells whether you will have implant complications may not be worth it’s $4,000 price tag. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [:33] Today’s topic is the connection between breast implants and thyroid disease. [1:55] Introducing Dr. Youn, who shares how his education and training taught him to view breast and thyroid disease issues. [3:51] An overview of the main confusion points around silicone breast implants, including the 1992 implant ban, FDA studies and subsequent ban lift in 2006, and the recent increase in stories from women suffering from illness and disease after undergoing silicone breast augmentation. [6:15] What questions are being researched in breast implant studies and who is funding these studies? Dr. Youn argues that the studies are not getting good answers because they’re not asking the right questions. [8:30] Studies that do support a connection between breast implants and illness, and a look at what Dr. Youn has seen in his own practice. [12:32] Dr. Youn’s recommendations to women who are prone to autoimmune diseases and are considering breast augmentation. [14:20] Have you already had breast implants? A look at the health risks versus benefits for removal of implants. [19:29] Understanding the correlation between ALCL cancer and textured or smooth silicone breast implants. [22:44] A look at the specific data surrounding Hashimoto's disease in relation to implants. [26:56] Is the silicon antibody test worth it’s $4,000 price tag? [29:10] The emotional aspect of breast implants and how it plays into making an educated, well-informed decision when considering implants. [33:26] The importance of educating yourself and making sure your decisions are backed by science, not emotion, in helping women make the right decision for their health.

If you want to make better decisions about your health today so you can feel better and live longer, you’ve come to the right place. \xa0 On this episode we’re talking about one of the most controversial topics in the medical field today — vaccines. Are vaccines safe and do you really need them to stay healthy? I’m joined by Dr. Max Cohen, naturopathic physician and passionate advocate for vaccines as an essential part of whole health natural care. Dr. Cohen has spent years studying the medical facts and dispelling the fiction behind vaccines.\xa0 Today we’re diving right into the controversy of vaccines and answering the hard questions that seem to be on everyone’s mind. What are vaccines made up of, and how exactly do they interact with the body’s immune system? Is there value in administering vaccines on an altered schedule? How effective is the flu shot? Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? Is there any danger associated with the HPV vaccine? \xa0 The information you will hear on this episode is designed to help educate you about vaccines so that you can act with confidence, and not with fear. Still, I am fully committed to sharing both sides of the story with you, and you may be surprised when you hear the vaccine-hesitant view of this conversation. On the second half of this podcast we will look at the vaccine controversy from the other side. Is speaking out against vaccines considered an exercise of freedom of speech? Does personal belief ever outweigh the common good of the public? I share experiences both from my own childhood and with vaccinating my own children, and explain how these experiences have helped to form the strong opinion that I have about vaccines today.\xa0 Join me as we consider both sides of this critical health debate — to educate yourself and to be inspired to act confidently on your knowledge. \xa0 Key Takeaways: [:35] Today’s topic is vaccines — are they safe? Do you really need them to stay healthy? A look at the facts on today’s podcast will help you make an informed decision about vaccinations. [2:20] Introducing Dr. Max Cohen, N. D., who shares his experience working with the development of the tuberculosis vaccine and the effect it has had on his career, his research, and his interactions with concerned patients. [7:30] A look at the controversy and history of vaccines shows that concerns over the safety of vaccines is nothing new, but that doesn’t make them any less safe than they have ever been. [9:47] Is there any health value in administering vaccines on an altered, spaced out schedule? Dr. Cohen explores the potential physical and mental side effects of delaying vaccines. [16:03] Are you wondering whether or not you should get a flu shot this year?\xa0 Consider these potential risks and side effects and weigh them against the benefits of this low-drama vaccine. [22:12] Vaccine reporting systems — who can file a report about a vaccine-related incident and what you can expect will happen after you do. [24:49] A look at the numbers — the risks of not getting a flu vaccination based on studies, complications, and annual deaths related to influenza. [30:30] Do MTHFR variations and other genetic polymorphisms increase the risk of a negative reaction to the flu vaccine? [34:55] High quality research has already answered our next question — the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Dr. Cohen details the studies and data that proves why. [39:41] Consider the transparency that has come with vaccines from the industry, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies that all stand to benefit from pushing potentially unsafe vaccines. [42:47] The truth about administering vaccines in increased frequencies from past generations and a look at concerns about autoimmune diseases and the effects of vaccines, including the HPV vaccine. [48:38] Understanding causation versus correlation — and why treatments administered reactively seem to work better than treatments that are administered proactively. [51:33] What exactly goes into a vaccine?\xa0 Addressing your fears about aluminum, formaldehyde, thimerosal, environmental toxins and preservatives. [1:01:02] Gathering medical information may be easier than ever, but that doesn’t mean that what you’re reading online is accurate or what is best for your health.\xa0 [1:07:26] Wrapping up and connecting with Dr. Cohen. [1:08:38] My experience with trying to find a vaccine-hesitant speaker, and the importance of preserving freedom of speech in the face of fear. [1:15:17] Understanding why personal choice does not outweigh the public good, especially in matters of communicable diseases. [1:21:37] Breaking vaccines down — how do vaccines work and which elements of a vaccine are actually working with the body’s immune system to protect the body against illnesses? [1:26:27] The considerations of overcoming fear, probability, causation and correlation when understanding the side effects of vaccines. [1:31:00] Bad things in tiny amounts are actually good for you — what do broccoli and vaccines have in common? [1:33:45] Do you have a topic you’d like me to cover?

She serves as the Director of the Fitshugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity, and is the PI on two HRSA-supported Health Workforce Research Centers, focusing on (1) emerging workforce issues and (2) health equity in health professions’ education, respectively.\xa0 Trained in medical anthropology and public health, she is an expert on qualitative and mixed methods research designs focusing on delivery system changes.\xa0 She has published over 50 peer-reviewed journal articles and has served as PI on over 30 research grants relating to health workforce policy. These include a background paper commissioned by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) for the new National Academies of Medicine Committee on Nursing 2020-2030, and a series of studies that were commissioned to inform the 2010 Institute of Medicine’s Future of Nursing report. She teaches Advanced Health Policy Analysis and Health Workforce Policy in the GW School of Public Health. HOST Alissa Brown, BSN, MSN, RN, FNE\xa0is a clinical nurse educator from the University of Utah Health. She has been working in the health care industry for almost 12 years, and started her nursing career as a med-surg bedside nurse on an Ortho, Trauma, and Surgical Specialty Unit. It was through that experience in the med-surg unit where she discovered a passion for education, and pursued a master’s degree. She is a lifelong learner, and\xa0loves to teach.\xa0 Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, she\'s not all work, and definitely enjoys play! She loves to travel, and tries to plan as many vacations each year as she can with family and friends. Alissa loves\xa0to read, listen to podcasts, and geek out to documentaries and crime shows on the weekends. She\'s a total fair-weather fan when it comes to Utes Football, but will cheer in all the right places,\xa0or\xa0get mad when her husband\xa0tells her to\xa0during a game. Alissa is looking\xa0forward to\xa0conversations together on this AMSN podcast! \xa0 | We are confronted by violence in the news daily but who imagined that violence would reach the bedside? Violence caused by patients and visitors is an international problem that continues to worsen in its frequency and severity.\xa0 In this episode, we talk to two advanced practice nurses who have led the charge in the Cleveland Clinic\'s response to violence in the workplace. GUESTS Dianna Copley, MSN, APRN, ACCNS-AG, CCRN serves as Clinical Nurse Specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio where she covers three high acuity Internal Medicine telemetry units. Since starting her nursing career at the Cleveland Clinic in 2009, she has served on a number of hospital committees and was involved in the development of a quality survey to explore nursing caregivers’ experience of workplace violence committed by patients and visitors. Catherine Skowronsky, MSN, RN, ACNS-BC, CMSRN is a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) for the Cleveland Clinic Health System. Catherine focuses on care of the medical patient with co-morbid behavioral health needs. Her role includes offering expert consultation on care planning, therapeutic communication and safety to the bedside nurse. This role requires her to act as a liaison between psychiatric and medical providers. She has written protocols to guide care of the patient who ingests foreign bodies and patients with substance use disorder. Catherine served as the medical-surgical adviser to develop national competencies for the medical-surgical nurse caring for the patient at risk for suicide. She is an experienced presenter and public speaker, often offering educational presentations within the health system and at local, national and international conferences. From 2011 through 2018 she traveled overseas to provide continuing education for the U.S Department of State. Skowronsky’s publishing experience entails authoring the manuscript “Close Observation of Medical Patients with Complex Conditions to Prevent Falls and Minimize the use of Patient Care Companions.” which was published in the Journal of Nursing Care Quality. She was a content reviewer for the AMSN Core Curriculum chapter on the respiratory system. Skowronsky is also the presenter of “But I’m not a Psych Nurse: Care of the psychiatric patient on the medical surgical unit”. HOST Chelsea Parker RN, BSN, CMSRN was born and raised in Newport News, Virginia. She attended the University of Virginia and graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing. Since then she has pursued geriatric and palliative care nursing and developed a love for general medicine, which is where her foundation for med-surg nursing was built. As a young nurse looking for ways to bridge engagement between generations of nurses, she is excited about what this podcast will mean for AMSN.\xa0 \xa0 | In this episode, we\'re "gabbing" about a unique and fun twist on how to create a positive and enhanced work environment with acclaimed speaker, award-winning humorist, and two-time cancer survivor Conor Cunneen. GUEST Conor Cunneen is a\xa0happily exiled Irishman who has been working on his Chicago accent for twenty years – with little success!\xa0He is an acclaimed speaker, educator and an\xa0award-winning\xa0humorist who combines wit and wisdom to provide powerful and memorable programs to help you get through the good days and the bad days.\xa0Conor\'s\xa0objective is to leave you with a spring in\xa0the\xa0step, a smile on\xa0the\xa0face, a beat in\xa0the\xa0heart AND\xa0memorable,\xa0implementable ideas to make your\xa0unit and patient experience even better.\xa0 As a two-time cancer survivor, this Irishman says a silent prayer every\xa0day for the\xa0med-surge professionals who helped him through thyroid and prostate cancer.\xa0\xa0He is delighted to bring the Gift of GAB\xa0(Goals, Attitude, Behavior)\xa0to\xa0the\xa0caring professionals\xa0at\xa0AMSN 2019.\xa0\xa0Based in the United States for 18 years, Conor is a very proud recipient of the President\'s Gold Medal for Volunteer Service for the work he does with job seekers. \xa0 \xa0 HOST Evie Harris, BSN, MA, RN, FNE lives and works in Baltimore, MD and has been\xa0an RN for 4 years, and is also a\xa0Forensic Nurse Examiner.\xa0She works on a busy med-surg\xa0unit in the roles of staff RN, Charge RN, unit education council representative,\xa0& preceptor.\xa0Evie has previous careers in management, teaching, & on-air radio co-producer/co-host.

The first of a three-parter investigating the cigarette-smoking link and causality, this episode looks at that early debate, which largely focused on environmental pollution. Along the way, we’re going to talk about toxic vapors -- and not Miasma theory, but the actual literal Great Smog of London in 1952 that killed over 10,000 people -- as well as the birth of the case-control study, Nazi attempts at tobacco control programs, and the rather prosaic beginnings of a debate that rages to this day.

This episode discusses the fascinating story of Nightingale’s legacy -- how modern nursing was born out of the horrors of war, medical theories about poisonous air, the outsize influence of the average man, the first graph in history, and how a woman who died over a century ago presciently foresaw some of the most important scientific and social issues in medicine that are still with us today.

It’s your private space. It’s restful, probably even peaceful sometimes, and hopefully happy. It can be a safe place to feel and even grieve. If you’re fortunate enough to have someone to share it with, it’s a place for communication, intimacy and excitement.Larry and I have our most important conversations in bed. Since he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s these conversations happen regularly. We talk, share triumphs of the day — sometimes big successes and sometimes simply a hilarious moment with our son. We complain, cry, say things we probably shouldn’t, unconsciously avoid saying some things we probably should. Sometimes we have sex (but we’ll talk about that a lot more in this week’s podcast).And we sleep.All the things that happen in our bed are the most important things for our relationship, and for our well-being. It makes sense to pay attention to it.That’s why Larry and I sought advice from nurse and sex health educator, Maureen McGrath.“This is new for you, Parkinson’s disease, and it is different for every patient,” she said.McGrath told us 70% to 80% of the couples she counsels are also dealing with medical conditions that impact intimacy in their relationship. We had a lot of questions.Do we have a bedroom that is conducive to sleep and wellness?“Sleep is critical.” McGrath said, “Make sure you don’t have a television in your room, or an iPad or bring a phone to bed. Dedicate your room to sleeping and/or sex.”Have we created a space that is as safe and nurturing as it was before Parkinsons entered our life?McGrath suggested, “Make your room an oasis.” We made plans to use our aromatherapy diffuser more frequently and make sure our bed is plush and comfortable for us both. Be sure to listen to snippets from our bed shopping excursion.Are we still affectionate with each other, even though nothing is as effortless as it used to be?“You have a need to be close, you have sexual desire, but you may have a little bit of fear around it,” she said. McGrath recommended not overthinking it, returning to what you know and making it a priority appointment in our life.By acknowledging Parkinson’s has changed how we sleep, connect, and show affection for each other, we are learning to look the PD elephant in the eye, smile at it and thrive on all levels.

They were quick to offer information on support groups and mailed a packet of brochures, handouts and relevant information that immediately made me feel less anxious and more informed. That is why each year my family raises money and walks in the Parkinson SuperWalk in Vancouver. This year we had a team of 12 walkers on our “When Life Gives You Parkinson’s” team and my 10-year-old son Henry went door to door in our neighbourhood to help raise funds. His efforts contributed $160 to our team.In 1990, a small group of volunteers in Toronto decided to walk up Yonge Street to raise awareness for Parkinson’s disease and they called it “SuperWalk” due to the long distance. This year, Parkinson Canada held more than 82 SuperWalks across Canada with 10,000 participants and exceeded its goal of raising more than $2.4 million. While that seems like a great amount of funding, Jon Collins, Associate Director of Events and Partnerships for Parkinson Canada says, “The reality is, with 25 Canadians diagnosed every day, with our population aging, and (the number of people with) Parkinson’s expected to double by 2031, we are anticipating growing needs.”Organizations like Parkinson Canada are privately funding, there are no government dollars, and they rely on individual donations to maintain their programs and advocacy.\xa0Parkinson’s IQ + You I want to thank the great people in Atlanta for their hospitality as the Michael J.

Since October 2018, there has been a global shortage of SINEMET®®®. This is the brand name version of levodopa-carbidopa, the gold-standard drug, used to treat Parkinson’s disease, which Merck packages and sells. It started with a supply shortage, which lead to a third-party manufacturer change. Anytime you change production of pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer has to re-ratify the entire production cycle. Merck now says SINEMET®IR®, Instant Release, will not be available until July 2020 and production has ceased altogether on the continuous release versions including SINEMET®CR 100/25 and 200/50.In this episode of the podcast, I talk to folks around the world who were taking SINEMET®to great effect only for it to be unavailable one day and replaced by a less effective, generic version of the drug.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration first approved SINEMET® in 1975. Nothing in the last 44-years comes as close to normalizing the lives of people with Parkinson’s as it does.David Ashford Jones was diagnosed with Parkinson’s at 40 years of age after more than a decade in marketing and sales for pharmaceutical companies. He says people with Parkinson’s easily notice the difference between the brand name version of SINEMET® and the generic. The difference between SINEMET® and the generic versions is not in the active ingredients, but in the absorption rate of the levodopa into the body in order to have an active effect on Parkinson’s symptoms.\xa0He offers this advice to other people with Parkinson’s, “If you can get a consistent version (of a generic), that minimizes the potential for that swapping of levels.” The goal for maximum effectiveness of any form of levodopa-carbidopa is to keep the gaps between peaks and valleys of levodopa in your body to a minimum.Merck has stated that there is not a shortage of levodopa-carbidopa in Canada, because 90% of the people with Parkinson’s are on generic versions. Worldwide, others have estimated 80% of people are on a generic, but Merck did not address the global supply even when requested. The reality is 10-20% of the people with Parkinson is who are taking SINEMET® amounts to somewhere between 700,000 and two million people worldwide. After Merck ceased production, it appears the generic drug suppliers could not ramp up production to meet the expanded hole in the market.\xa0Merck agreed to offer written responses to some of the questions from When Life Gives You Parkinson’s,WLGYP: Why is there a shortage [of SINEMET®]? Why couldn’t it be anticipated?MERCK: (...)\xa0It is important to note that there are no current shortages of either formulations of carbidopa-levodopa in Canada as various generic manufacturers have made them available to Canadian patients. Currently, approximately 90% of the market of levodopa-carbidopa in Canada is supplied by generic formulations. (Source: IQVIA: CompuScript June DM, 2019)Based on current demand, depletion of the current inventory of SINEMET®CR 100/25 MG is expected in September 2019. SINEMET®CR 200/50 MG is no longer available.Despite the availability of generic alternatives in Canada, Merck understands that the situation may be disruptive for patients and is working to identify solutions to ensure a more stable source of supply is available for the SINEMET®IR® formulation. Based on our current information, we are hopeful to be able to rely on a more stable source of supply for the SINEMET®(IR formulation). However, for the time being, the supply disruption for SINEMET®(IR formulation) will continue until mid-2020 in the Canadian market.Merck is committed to continue to provide regular updates on the situation to Health Canada and Parkinson’s Canada. For the most up to date information regarding SINEMET®supply availability Canadian patients can consult www.drugshortagescanada.ca.WLGYP: What are the differences differences between SINEMET® and generic formsMERCK: As defined by Health Authorities, a generic drug is a copy of a brand name drug. The generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand name drug: it contains the identical medicinal ingredients, in the same amounts and in a similar dosage form. Generic medications may have different non-medicinal ingredients than the brand name drug, but the company must show that these do not affect the safety, efficacy, or quality of the drug compared to the brand name drug.[i]Currently, approximately 90% of the market of levodopa-carbidopa in Canada is supplied by generic formulations. (Source: IQVIA: CompuScript June DM, 2019)WLGYP: What is the timeline for SINEMET®IR to be available in Canada, U.S., U.K, and around the world?MERCK: We expect that the supply disruption for SINEMET®IR will continue until mid-2020 in the Canadian market. Merck Canada Inc. remains committed to finding solutions to provide this product to Canadian patients as quickly as possible. The most up to date information regarding SINEMET®supply availability is regularly updated on www.drugshortagescanada.ca. It is important to note that currently, approximately 90% of the market of levodopa-carbidopa in Canada is supplied by generic formulations.

This Extra Dosage is about a young man and his family, using their passion for running, to help raise funds for Parkinson’s research.Anthony Kerkman, 32, lives in Pickerington, Ohio in an idyllic neighbourhood with sprawling manicured lawns, multi-tiered back decks, and driveways that are three cars wide.\xa0In September 2018, Anthony emailed me directly for the first time in his life.A month later, he emailed again. I was the one fighting back tears.Over the next 10 months, Anthony, Lesley and daughters Hannah, 15, and Sophia, 11, worked with the Michael J Fox Foundation and the Columbus Running Company to organize a family friendly 5k walk/run.Anthony met with city officials, fire chiefs, and school administrators. He filed for permits, ordered t-shirts, found sponsors and rallied his family and friends from all sides.I flew to Ohio for the August 24th Tremor Trot. Anthony, his family and I showed up before the sunrise to hang banners, greet volunteers and set up tables so his grandmas could run registration. Family friends staffed the water stations. It was a family affair from top to bottom. Even Hannah was instrumental in the event, she drew the very cool logo of an orange fox in sunglasses, running a race.Before too long the crowds arrived. I immediately recognized many faces in the crowd. It was a mix of childhood friends, fraternity brothers, and my parent’s friends for 60-some years. They were there to support Anthony and his efforts to raise money for Parkinson’s research as much as they were there to support me and my journey with PD. Anthony wasn’t surprised, “We are down here watching you do all this advocacy in Canada and we’re not in Canada. We’re here. This was something we could do to show our support.”By the time the whistle blew to start the 5k, 175 participants had signed up which far exceeded Anthony’s goal of 75. The event raise $8,000 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation, 100% of which will go directly to high-impact Parkinson’s research.What I have learned through Anthony’s efforts is that everyone can do something to help raise funds or awareness of Parkinson’s. I host a podcast, speak on radio and TV and host events. That is my super power, while running in 5ks for charity is Anthony and Lesley’s. Use what comes natural to you to help make a difference in the lives of people with Parkinson’s disease. Go ahead, take the first step.Parkinson’s IQ + You In the coming months, I will be traveling with the Michael J. Fox Foundation’s to host a series of live, free, day-long educational events called “Parkinson’s IQ + You.” We will be featuring highlights of each event in upcoming Extra Dosage episodes.

Fox FoundationSpotlight YOPD – The only Parkinson’s organization dedicated to raising awareness for Young Onset Parkinson’s disease.\xa0 | A year ago, I started the podcast When Life Gives You Parkinson’s. I had been diagnosed a year earlier, on August 17, 2017, with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease at the age of 45. I can feel the disease progressing.I update my co-host Niki Reitmayer on my symptoms. In the last six months, I continue to have trouble getting a good night’s sleep, I’m now battling day time fatigue. I have long stretches of numbness and pain from neuropathy in my feet, increased body pains, anxiety, hot flashes, and unplanned weight loss. Maybe most concerning for me is that my wife Rebecca has noticed my personality is changing.As I talk to others with Parkinson’s, “shift in personality” is not an uncommon observation. The spouses of BBC TV and radio writer, producer and comedian Paul Mayhew Archer, American Ninja Warrior Jimmy Choi and Amazing Race Canada winner Tim Hague all noticed personality shifts.\xa0Personality shifts in people with Parkinson’s can be triggered by many different things including; increased fears and loss of control of one’s life, medication side effects, depression, pain, anxiety, fatigue and missed or incorrect dosages of medication.Our partners at Parkinson Canada offer the following advice when a person with Parkinson’s begins demonstrating more aggressive behavior, which occurs more subtly in the initial years and is more pronounced in late stages of Parkinson’s especially when accompanies by dementia.Stay calm.Review the PD medication schedule to see if a dose has been missed or taken incorrectly.Give the person space to cool down. Try to leave about 5 feet between you.Ask what is troubling the person so that you can identify the cause of the emotion and behaviour. • Listen to the person. Resist arguing or being confrontational, but provide reassurance. For example, “I know it is really frustrating when you can’t control what is happening…”Speak slowly, and in a clear, confident, and reassuring voice. Raising your voice may escalate the situation.Redirect the person to focus away from the issue causing aggression. Offer to take a walk, or do a calming activity together.If your safety is threatened, leave the situation, and return after a few minutes.Thank you for listening.

Join him, his wife Rebecca and their son Henry as they share with you, and co-host Niki Reitmayer, the journey into what it’s like to live and work with the disease. Season 2 launches Wednesday September 4th. | This is a special bonus episode of When Life Gives You Parkinson’s which we are calling “Extra Dosage.” Full episodes of Season 2 of the podcast will be released every other Wednesday beginning in September 2019. \xa0If you were to imagine Michael J. Fox in your mind right now. You probably are picturing the guy from Back to the Future or The Good Wife. Think about when you’ve seen him interviewed on TVnews programs or when he testified before congress. Those uncontrolled, involuntary movements Michael J. Fox is known for are not symptoms of Parkinson’s. It’s called dyskinesia. It’s a reaction to long-term levodopa use. Yes, the gold standard drug treatment for Parkinson’s, when taken over a long period of time, will effectively treat some of your PD symptoms like tremor, slowness and stiffness, but cause you to move uncontrollably. The Michael J. Fox Foundation describes it as fidgeting, writhing, wriggling, head bobbing or body swaying. It is important to note that not everyone with Parkinson’s will develop this complication. It is more common with people who are diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease (YOPD) or under the age of 50. There was no guarantee I would experience dyskinesia. I didn’t particularly want it. And in the end, I didn’t really have a vote. \xa0\xa0After my family returned from World Parkinson Congress in Japan in mid-June, I was jet lagged and my med times and dosages were a bit out of whack. That’s when dyskinesia took hold. It had only ever really happened once before. About six months ago. I do sometimes sway and jerk a bit here and there, but I am a relative stranger to experiencing a full-on, dyskinesia episode. \xa0\xa0It was Saturday night, my family was at the dinner table and I started to sway and rock. Slowly at first and then gradually faster and more erratic. My head started to go to the right, my shoulder popped to the left, my neck jerked back and forth. And it repeated over and over again. \xa0About 5 minutes into the dyskinesia, I asked my wife Rebecca to record a video.The dyskinesia lasted 45 minutes. I posted the video on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. For friends and family who’ve not witnessed many physical symptoms of my Parkinson’s, this came as a shock. For people familiar with PD, my episode was rather mild.Two days later, I was at a manager’s off-site meeting with 18 of my colleagues and dyskinesia set in again. It lasted an hour. And then it happened a day later during my exercise class. I was doing a bear crawl and it was as if the bear was drunk. I couldn’t tell my feel what to do anymore. It lasted 30 minutes. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In this Extra Dosage episode, I turn to friends and fellow people with Parkinson’s who’ve been dealing with dyskinesia longer than I have. Becca Miller, 45, is a psychologist at a community mental health center in New Haven, Connecticut. She was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease six years ago. She began to have dyskinesia two years ago.\xa0 Jim Smerdon, 45, has been living in Vancouver, B.C., with Parkinson’s since 2007. His dyskinesia was so severe he opted for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery in 2014 in search of relief. I wanted to get them to answer some questions I had about dyskinesia and some that my friends and family posed to me after watching the video.Also in this Extra Dosage episode, the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) has announced a series of free, daylong, live events called “Parkinson’s IQ + You.” MJFF Deputy CEO Sohini Chowdhury joined the podcast to chat about it, “the goal is to create a forum where we can share information with Parkinson’s patients, family members, friends, all with the goal of empowering people with Parkinson’s and care\xa0 partners so they can optimally manage their disease and learn more about participating in research.”The “Parkinson’s IQ + You” series exciting for a number of reasons, but most relevant to me is that I have been asked to travel with the Michael J. Fox Foundation and be the host and moderator of these events across America. You can get more information at www.michaeljfox.org/PDIQ.There are other events I will be attending in the coming months that were mentioned in this episode.Saturday, August 15, 2019 – Join me at Tour de Fox Pacific Northwest in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia.

WPC is a global Parkinson's event, which is held every three years and it opens its doors to all members of the Parkinson's community, from neurologists and researchers to those living with the disease. \xa0\xa0\xa0The WPC wrapped up the fourth and final day by announcing Barcelona, Spain as the next destination for the World Parkinson Congress in 2022. In this episode of the pod, my wife Rebecca and I sit down with Amazing Race Canada Season One winner Tim Hauge and his wife Cheryl to talk about the gifts Parkinson’s have given our families.\xa0There’s also a roundtable discussion where participants of WPC2019 share thoughts on what they’ll take away after four days of meetings, workshops and socialization.\xa0Eli Pollard, Executive Director of World Parkinson Coalition which organizes the World Parkinson Congress gets the final word on the podcast declaring it quite a success with a few themes bubbling up to the surface. Families and Parkinson’s is really a hot topic and there were more kids of parents with Parkinson’s were at this WPC than ever before and for the first time actually participated as speakers in a workshop. The other notably theme was the rising interest in more programming geared towards the Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease (YOPD) contingent.\xa0\xa0Follow me, Larry Gifford\xa0Twitter:\xa0@ParkinsonsPodFacebook:\xa0Facebook.com/ParkinsonsPodInstagram:\xa0@parkinsonspodirtFor more info on the World Parkinson Congress head to www.WPC2019.orgFacebook: Facebook.com/WorldPDCongress/Twitter: @WorldPDCongressYouTube: WorldPDcongressInstagram: @worldpdcongressThank you to:Tim & Sheryl HaugeAndy Butler, partner in Parkinson’sVicki Dillon, person with Parkinson’sBenjamin Stetcher, https://tmrwedition.com/Anne Cohn Donnelly D.P.H., Michael J.

WPC is a global Parkinson's event, which is held every three years and it opens its doors to all members of the Parkinson's community, from neurologists and researchers to those living with the disease. \xa0\xa0Parkinson’s has often been described as an old, white man’s disease. The truth is Parkinson’s is not that exclusive of a club. In fact, three things are very clear in Kyoto as the WPC wraps up day three: young people, women and people of all colours are being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.During a roundtable discussion on this episode of the podcast, Jim Smerdon, a person with Parkinson’s from Vancouver, B.C., noticed how indiscriminate PD is on the first day. “My question to all of these researchers, and I’ve yet to receive a decent answer, is what does it mean to them that when you looked around at the opening ceremonies and there is such a diversity. This disease covers every ethnicity, every geography, every demographic, every age core, and almost appears equally.” \xa0A perfect example of just how diverse people with Parkinson’s can be. One of Omotola Thomas’ doctors in South Africa told her, “I think you have a form of Parkinsonism, but it’s hard for me to diagnose you with it because you are a young, black, female and this is an old, white man’s disease.” Thomas was born and raised in Nigeria. She lived in the United States, South Africa and now the United Kingdom. She began to have symptoms while in America at the age of 29. They took blood and ran every test they could think of, but because she the opposite of old, white and male Parkinson’s wasn’t initially considered. It took six years, seemingly endless tests, a move to South Africa and then to the U.K., before she was diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD) at the age of 35. \xa0The time has come for a new narrative around Parkinson’s. Perhaps it could begin with an update to the old, white man sketched by neurologist Sir William Richard Gowers in 1886 to illustrate some physical symptoms of PD. It appears in Wikipedia and anytime anyone Google’s Parkinson’s disease. Another suggestion, which was a Hot Topic in the morning session, is to begin to address the needs and differences that exist between woman and men with Parkinson’s. Thomas, and women like her, have a different Parkinson’s experience. For instance, their Levodopa-Carbidopa to control Parkinson’s symptoms only works about three weeks out of every four. “Men don’t tend to suffer the same hormonal fluctuations that we do. We have certain times of the month where our medications don’t work at all. And that is very difficult to deal with.” Thomas adds, “I don’t think that’s something you experience.” She’s right. I don’t.The frustrations concerning the old, white, male stereotypes are real. Treating PD the same way, with the same drugs, no matter your gender, age or ethnicity – let alone your dominate symptoms – leads to delayed diagnosis and to prescribing inadequate pharmaceuticals. A 2019 attitude and individualized approach to each person’s Parkinson’s is desperately needed. And the whispers of past WPC’s are becoming a roar that the PD community will soon be unable to ignore any longer.\xa0Also on this episode, kids and care partners play a prominent role in the topics and discussions at World Parkinson Congress.\xa0Follow me, Larry Gifford\xa0Twitter:\xa0@ParkinsonsPodFacebook:\xa0Facebook.com/ParkinsonsPodInstagram:\xa0@parkinsonspodirtFor more info on the World Parkinson Congress head to www.WPC2019.orgFacebook: Facebook.com/WorldPDCongress/Twitter: @WorldPDCongressYouTube: WorldPDcongressInstagram: @worldpdcongressThank you to:Omotola Thomas, person with Parkinson’s from United KingdomJim Smerdon, person with Parkinson’s from Vancouver, B.C.Andy McDowell, person with Parkinson’s from Auckland, New ZealandLily & Pearl McDowell, children of AndyArdrew Davenport, Board Member, Parkinson Society of British ColumbiaRebecca Gifford, partner in Parkinson’s from Vancouver, British Columbia | I am in Kyoto, Japan for the 5th World Parkinson Congress (WPC).

They married, had three kids, he was a doctor and she was a nurse. They lived a good life. Sometime in their 30’s, Joy noticed her husband started to smell different; more musky and unpleasant. She didn’t realize at the time she was smelling Parkinson’s. It was twelve years later, her husband was diagnosed at the age of 45. Over the years, while attending support groups and other functions she realized other people with Parkinson’s had a scent like her husband’s. Nearly two decades on, she began to ask why no one was using the smell of Parkinson’s as a bio marker.\xa0The answer? No one else seemed to have noticed.\xa0After testing her over and over again. Science won out. It turns out Joy can smell the over production of sebum. Her work is detailed on a poster at World Parkinson Congress titled “Parkinson’s smell levels, symptom management and empowerment; when Joy met Allison.” In this episode of When Life Gives You Parkinson’s, Milne and Allison Williams talk about how Joy’s ability to smell different levels of Parkinson’s has empowered Allison and improved her PD symptoms.\xa0Joy Milne also joins 50-year old Matt Eagles, who has had Parkinson’s since age 7, and Jonny Acheson who is three years passed diagnosis to chat about what they’ve learned at day two of the WPC. From patient advocacy, the importance of care partners and important discussions around compulsive behavior side effects of certain drugs to the absolute shock one gets when he first uses a Japanese toilet.Geneticist Matt Farrer of UBC and Yoshio Tsuboi, M.D., Ph.D. of Fukuoka University provide an interesting peek inside the complicated world of genetic research.
