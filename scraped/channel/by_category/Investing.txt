In her recent book, The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World, Gates shares enlightening data and personal stories from her work around the globe where she’s seen first-hand the power in challenging the status quo and dismantling pervasive gender inequities to advance society. Steve sat down with Melinda at The Executives’ Club of Chicago earlier this year to discuss why investing in women unlocks opportunity for all, her own struggles in finding her voice and achieving equality at home, as well as her lessons learned to incite lasting change.\xa0 | First, Steve addresses impeachment, Israel’s election, Iran’s pain caused by financial sanctions, Brexit and what’s up with the Federal reserve pumping money into banks?\xa0Then, in part two of this series, Blackstone Group Cofounder & CEO Stephen Schwarzman discusses the firm’s growth into a global behemoth including a paradigm-shifting investment deal made with China — the first time the country ever invested in a private company. The self-made billionaire also details the prescient call he almost didn’t make to the Treasury Secretary on the brink of the 2008 financial crisis. Also, hear about his philanthropic work through the Schwarzman Scholarship, akin to the Rhodes Scholarship, which brings an international cohort of students to Beijing. This is the final episode in a two-part conversation.Last, Steve’s “Read of the Week” consists of three articles: “Trump’s Fight With The ‘Globalists’” by Daniel Henninger, “Realities Of The Current Trade War” by Frank Hollenbeck and “The Limits Of Clean Energy” by Jason Hickel. | First up, Steve shares his thoughts on a bunch of economic numbers coming out including residential housing prices, consumer confidence index and durable goods numbers. He also speaks to the upcoming United Nations meeting and the United Kingdom Supreme Court.Then, with a personal net worth of over $18 billion dollars, venerable Wall Street titan and Blackstone Group\xa0Cofounder, Chair and CEO,\xa0Steve Schwarzman, has become the world’s most powerful financial leader. This hard-fought success is documented in his new book,\xa0What It Takes: Lessons In The Pursuit Of Excellence\xa0which details Schwarzman’s remarkable journey from not knowing the difference between a stock and a bond at his\xa0first Wall Street\xa0job\xa0to leading an investment firm that controls companies worth over $500 billion. One of the key takeaways? The person at the top of any organization should always be eager to learn—and\xa0to teach. Which is why he has created a uniquely successful culture at Blackstone\xa0aimed to help employees thrive.\xa0He’s also never hesitated to try to teach those who were ranked higher than him. For example, he told the\xa0dean of Harvard Business School during his time there that his organization was not well-run. In this episode, he shares with Steve his colorful path from working in his father’s local shop as a young boy to negotiating one of the biggest mergers in U.S. corporate history at the age of thirty. This is part one in a two-part conversation.\xa0Last, Steve\'s "Reads of the Week" are three articles. They are: “Antitrust Can’t Catch Big Tech” by Andy Kessler, "Don’t Ban Nontobacco Flavored ecigarettes. Adults are in more Danger than your Kids" by Sally Satel and ”Why Hasn’t Brexit Happened?" By Christopher Caldwell | First up, Steve shares his thoughts on the central banks and trade.Next, born to a struggling family in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Sol Trujillo, chairman of the Latino Donor Collaborative, has achieved great success. Across his career, he’s headed up major telecommunications companies in the U.S. and around the world. Trujillo points out the Latino community is starting more new businesses than any other group in this country and has incomes rising faster than the national average. As he tells Steve on the latest episode of “What’s Ahead,” Trujillo points out the economic growth potential for the Latino community and details the common-sense reforms that Trujillo says are needed in our immigration system to unlock the true potential of this community for the benefit of us all.Lastly, Steve\'s "Reads of the Week" are two pieces. The first is by Burton Folsom, "How The Myth Of The Robber Barons Began And Why It Persists" and the second is by Steve, himself, "Pelosi\'s \'Medicare For All\' Strategy Looks A lot Like A Big Wooden Horse". | First up, Steve speaks to a myriad of economic markers to look for this week, Boris Johnson, interest rates and noise about China.Then, accomplished economist, columnist and professor Mark Skousen calls for a new way to assess the health of the economy. While analysts traditionally look to gross domestic product (GDP) as the ultimate economic indicator, Skousen argues that its narrow focus obfuscates the real drivers of growth. Instead, he champions gross output (GO), which measures spending throughout the entire production process—not just the final output—as he believes it’s a far more comprehensive and accurate indicator of economic health. Hear Skousen dispel the popular Keynesian notion that consumer spending drives growth and why the U.S. may be on the path towards recession.Lastly, Steve’s Reads of the Weeks are two articles. The first is by Angelo Codevilla, “What’s Russia To Us?" And by Robert B. Zoellick, “The Trade Wars Winners Don’t Include Us.” | First up, Steve speaks to a myriad of topics including the upcoming Democratic debates, the White House battle with the Fed, why we should focus on export/import numbers instead of the trade deficit to determine global and national economic health and China’s talk about trade despite the crackdown in Hong Kong.Then, prominent investing veteran, Stephen Auth, chief investment officer for Federated Investors, discusses the universal truths he’s learned on his unconventional journey to enlightenment on Wall Street and beyond. From going temporarily blind on a missionary trip in Mexico to bringing lapsed Catholics back to their faith on the hectic New York City streets, Auth shares what he’s learned about perseverance in the face of suffering, embracing humility and his journey to becoming a more compassionate leader. Hear Auth’s insight on the future of Catholicism and why a modern, business-minded approach is what’s needed to reform this 2,000 year old institution.Lastly, Steve’s “Read Of The Week” are two articles. They are:\xa0My Childhood Schooling In the Soviet Union Was Better Than My Kids\' In U.S. Public Schools Today by Katya Sedgwick and Discriminating Against Religious Schools by Inez Feltscher Stepman. | First up, Steve speaks to an array of issues including the intensification of the conflict in Hong Kong, the Federal Reserve and consumer spending and confidence.Then, Philip Howard, author of the new blockbuster book Try Common Sense: Replacing the Failed Ideologies of Right and Left, sits down with Steve to explain why the never-ending avalanche of literally millions of usually-unnecessary, nitpicking rules from Washington and local governments, since the 1960s, is undermining our democracy.\xa0Americans rightly feel they have lost control over so much of their lives and that elections don’t make much difference. Both parties are at fault. Howard then lays out the exciting remedies to get our country back in the hands of We the People.\xa0Lastly, Steve’s “Reads of the Weeks” consist of four articles. They are: "A Hundred Year Treasury? " by the Wall Street Journal editorial board, "Argentina Needs The Dollar” by Mary Anastasia O’Grady, “Europe Does Not Exist” by Josef Joffe and Steve celebrates the 100th birthday of his late father, Malcolm Forbes, with his piece “A Matchless Man”. | First up, Steve speaks to a number of topics such as\xa0inverted yield rates which could mean a recession is coming, a great anecdote about his dad, Malcolm Forbes, Hong Kong and Iran continued tensions and upcoming financial reports including home sales and unemployment insurance claims.Then, recent stock market turmoil has investors asking: What’s the best path for fantastic—and sustainable—wealth creation? Prepare yourself for a happy shock! It’s not high-tech stocks—unless you can always pick winners like Facebook and avoid the countries busts. David Bahnsen, author of The Case for Dividend Growth, makes the remarkable case that a dividend-growth strategy is the best way to superb, long-term returns. And get this: the kind of volatility we see now can be an investor’s best friend. Bahnsen tells us what to look for to find these great stocks.Lastly, Steve’s “Read Of The Weeks” are three articles. They are:\xa0Top Secret Teens: The Highschoolers Recruited By The National Security Agency by Alex Marquardt, CNN, Europe Poised To Put Warning Labels On Jewish-Made Products by Adam Kredo and Nucor’s Founder Predicted Long Ago That Tariffs Would Kill The Steel Industry by Alan Golombok | First up, Steve speaks to pressing topics such as oil taking a hit, retail sales, Iran sanctions, continued trade tension with China and the growing strife between Japan and South Korea.Then, Matt Ridley, a journalist, member of the British House of Lords, and author of The Rational Optimist, argues that despite today’s constant influx of negative news, life is getting better at an accelerating rate. Ridley challenges popularly held beliefs about the current state of the world, citing that extreme poverty has been defeated, food production is more efficient than ever, humans are living longer, and warfare is actually on the decline. If there’s one thing the defiantly optimistic Ridley worries about, it’s too much bureaucracy which he sees as an attempt to curb trade and stifle innovation. Plus, hear Ridley’s thoughts on how climate change will actually improve society in the short term and why economic prosperity is even good for endangered animals and the environment.Last, Steve’s “Read of the Week” is two articles. The first is ‘Tickle’ Therapy Could Help Slow Ageing by The University of Leeds. The second is The Dumbest Concept Ever Just Might Win Wars by Jim Lacey. | First up, Steve warns about the dire social unrest in Hong Kong and the unrelenting trade tension with China.Then, John Catsimatidis arrived in America as a young Greek immigrant and started kindergarten not speaking a word of English. Now, he\'s a billionaire. Hear about his voracious entrepreneurial appetite that led him from making a dollar an hour working at a grocery store to building a supermarket empire. Then followed real estate investment, an oil refinery, a media company and more. His story is full of humor, smarts and insight into the beloved American “can-do” attitude.Lastly, Steve\'s "Read of the Week" is two articles. The first is by Nathan Lewis on Forbes.com called, "Stable Value Is Our Monetary Goal, Not Stable Prices." The second is by Gideon Rachman called, "Hong Kong Is A Flashpoint In The New Cold War."', 'chan_desc': 'In a disjointed and bewildering world, Steve Forbes engages today’s thought-leaders to give listeners a better grasp of what’s ahead.

If you are new to the show, go back and start with episode  289. Retirement Plan Live is a series within the show where we take live case studies with listeners and walk through their retirement dreams and then tackle their finances to see if they can make their dreams a reality. In this Retirement Plan Live, we have met Emma and she and her husband have been facing a difficult situation. On Thursday, October 10 we’ll have their live results meeting. We’ll walk through their ideal retirement and learn if their retirement plan can become a reality. Be sure to sign up for 6-Shot-Saturday on the homepage of RogerWhitney.com so that you can get the link to the live results webinar.\xa0 How do you move forward? Christopher McCluskey joins me from the Professional Christian Coaching Institute as we discuss how to move forward in hard times. When life deals us a big blow we can get stuck in one place. This is when we need to think about how we approach life rather than how we control it. In hard times, our mindset becomes our reality. That is where the battle is won or lost. There is a period of grief and we should embrace that grief. Grieving is good for you, and without healthy grieving first, you won’t move forward. Eventually, you need to wrestle through to accepting. That is when you grow.\xa0 Coping with a new reality Coping with a new reality is hard. But none of us truly knows when our last day will be so we need to adopt a mindset of living. Live like you are dying. We can all fritter away at our own lives and sometimes our new reality opens our eyes. Focus on what you can do rather than what you can’t do. And try to discover what is possible with your new life. Try not to give in to despair since we can always hope for something.\xa0 How does Emma navigate being the one left behind? Emma is in a tough space since she needs to be there to care for Luca, but she also needs to prepare for life alone. She is living a life in limbo. Her support network is both near and far with a brother traveling and a sister nearby. She also has good friends and great neighbors. Emma has managed by advocating for Luca and getting her own support. She understands the importance of self-care but it can be a challenge to work on that at times.\xa0 What would Emma like clarity on in her retirement plan? On October 10 we’ll have the live webinar with Emma and Luca where we go over their retirement plan. Make sure you’re signed up for 6-Shot Saturday to get the link for the webinar. It is important for Emma to have an agile retirement plan that covers the different scenarios in which she might see herself. She knows there is still plenty that could go wrong.\xa0 OUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE RETIREMENT ANSWER MAN HOT TOPIC SEGMENT  [4:12] Christopher McCluskey discusses how to move forward [11:25] How do you navigate being the one left behind?

You can think of the traditional form of social capital which includes your family, friends, your church community, and colleagues. This sort of social capital is there when you face hard times. The other type of social capital is the financial term which means any sort of money that is a guaranteed payment to you. Social Security is the most common example of social capital. A pension or an annuity are other types of social capital.\xa0 Do you plan to use human capital in your retirement? Another resource we consider in retirement planning is human capital. Human capital is you. Your ability to earn an income is your human capital. Many people choose to work part-time or take a pretirement so they can continue to earn money and still have the flexibility and time freedom that they are looking for from retirement. Flexibility is a key component of an agile retirement. Are you planning to use your human capital in retirement?\xa0 Do you have a net worth statement? Financial capital is what we traditionally think of using when we think of retirement. This is the money you have saved up. We can measure the money you have in a net worth statement. It is important to get organized so you can figure out what you have to work with and what the biggest risks are and you can plan what to do next. Emma has enjoyed taking the time to organize her information and ideas to help her see where they stand in their retirement plans. Have you organized your information so that you know where you stand?\xa0 OUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE RETIREMENT ANSWER MAN HOT TOPIC SEGMENT  [2:28] What resources do you have?

Resources Mentioned In This Episode Rock Retirement Club Roger’s YouTube Channel - Roger That BOOK -  Rock Retirement \xa0by Roger Whitney Work with Roger Roger’s Retirement Learning Center | Even when life throws you a curveball you still have to figure out how to move forward. This Retirement Plan Live series is a bit different than the previous ones. We are working with Emma and Luca who are dealing with an unexpected hitch in their retirement. On the last episode, we learned about their situation. On this episode, we’ll discuss their needs, wants, and wishes. And in the following episode, we’ll look at the numbers and discuss how they plan to pay for it all. Listen to this episode to hear how to move forward when life throws you a curveball. How to move forward with the 5 stages of grief There are different kinds of loss. Loss of a relationship, loss of a child, loss of a friend loss of trust, and loss of identity are just a few. Whenever we experience any kind of traumatic loss we experience grief. And everyone handles grief differently both outwardly and inwardly. There are 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. These stages aren’t necessarily linear and many people never reach the acceptance stage. Some people never move past their grief and they get stuck in one of the stages for the rest of their lives.\xa0 7 Tips that have helped me when dealing with grief  Lean into your feelings. Don’t wallow in your feelings but do allow yourself to feel your feelings. Act out safely. It’s ok to act out, you can rant and rage, but don't burn bridges or hurt others when acting out your emotions.\xa0 Don't be so hard on yourself. Give yourself grace. It's ok to have negative thoughts just don’t nurture them. Reach out. You're not an island your friends and family are there for you.\xa0 Try journaling. Even if you aren’t a journaling type of person, give it a try. Affirm that you are going to create a great life. You can still have a great life regardless of your situation. What can you do next? Think about how you can improve your situation  What are their base needs? Emma estimates that they need about $65,000 to cover their base needs excluding healthcare. Healthcare has been a big expense for them since the diagnosis. She estimates they spend about $12,000 per year on insurance, premiums run between $12-20,000 per year, and drugs are another $12,000. Thankfully they have always been savers and had money set aside. They also have a sinking fund for home repairs. At the moment they don’t spend much on entertainment but they will begin to travel soon. Sign up for 6-Shot Saturday to get all the updates on Retirement Plan Live 2019. Their wants and wishes Travel is a big part of their retirement dreams. They love camping and being outdoors and have bought a camper. They didn’t travel much in the past due to lack of free time, but now they have the time to do it. Emma estimates that they will probably spend $10,000 a year on travel. Some other wishes are home improvement projects, a fun sports car, and a garage to restore an old car. Make sure to listen to next week’s episode to find out how Emma and Luca plan to pay for all of their wants and wishes.\xa0 OUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE RETIREMENT ANSWER MAN HOT TOPIC SEGMENT  [2:05] What are the 5 stages of grief?

Even with the best-laid plans, things can go wrong Even for those of us who plan and plan and try to prepare for everything, things can go wrong. Life can throw us curveballs from out of nowhere. Your friends, your parents, your kids, your partner and even you can get sick. Death is another curveball that can derail your plans. Divorce, addiction, depression: these can all disrupt our best-laid plans. How do you rock retirement if you don’t even want to get out of bed? Over the next few episodes, we’ll be exploring how you can learn to change your plans to adapt to a new reality.\xa0 Who are Emma and Luca? Emma and Luca have been married for 40 years. She is turning 65 soon and he is 66. They envisioned their retirement to be a combination of work with a bit of flexibility. Travel was a big part of their retirement plans. They enjoy camping and are avid cyclists. Luca is a bit of a workhorse and could never imagine stopping work completely. They are good savers and their ideal retirement didn’t seem too far-fetched. But then one day Luca got sick.\xa0 What derailed their retirement plans? Luca has always been very healthy and was never one for doctors’ visits. But after he got sick and became jaundiced Emma convinced him it was time to see a doctor. Pancreatic cancer was the diagnosis. They didn’t realize it but their retirement plans had changed overnight. With his illness surgery and extensive chemotherapy would be necessary. And even if all went well there is still only a 10% 5-year survival rate. It took them both a while to realize that things would never be the same and their retirement plans would need to change drastically. How do they deal with all this? Luca tried returning to work briefly this year but it didn’t last long. Emma’s employer has been considerate of their situation and she has taken some time off as well. It is hard for a man who values work so much to suddenly stop working when he isn’t ready to. Your outlook can become very negative in this situation. They know they can’t go back and change the past so now they must consider what they can do next. They have to balance whether to spend or regret not spending. Emma knows that her retirement plans now must include 2 different versions. Find out what will happen with Emma and Luca by listening to this Retirement Plan Live.

We have been discussing you. Retirement is another giant life change that can be compared with ending school or beginning a career. This momentous occasion is a great time to give pause and think about who you really are. If you haven’t listened to the previous episodes in this series, you’ll want to go back and listen to episodes 285, 286, and 287. On this episode, you’ll learn 5 steps for creating your retirement identity.\xa0 Steps for creating your identity in retirement Retirement is a long time. You’re starting an entirely new step in life and walking away from the life you once had. This is a great time to think about who you really are and who you want to become. Here are steps you can take to help you create your new identity  Acknowledge who you currently are. What is your current identity? Reconnect with who you really are via self-examination. Discover what makes you tick. Examine the past and all the things you built up. Decide what to keep and what to let go. Begin to test. Play with new ideas and hobbies to discover which ones are a good fit. Choose. Lean into a new reality that revolves around your interests.\xa0 Enjoy the process. Don’t put pressure on yourself to choose, this isn't a race.\xa0  What are you going to be when you grow up?\xa0 We are asked from the youngest age, what are you going to be when you grow up? People have been focused on their career for so long that once they come to retirement they don’t really know what to do. If you have focused solely on your career then retirement will really be a challenge. It’s time to start focusing on the right things and becoming more self-aware. Get to know yourself better and find your passions so that you know what you want to do when work isn’t there anymore.\xa0 How can we become intentional about finding our passions? Most people aren’t proactive about discovering themselves. Life moves quickly and work, family, and other things get in the way of discovering who you really are. Think beyond money. What motivates you, what makes you tick? What are your drivers? Do you want to belong, to be valued, to be recognized? Start thinking about how you can lead the life that you really want. How do you build your tomorrow today? Once you discover what motivates you then you can start to fulfill yourself. Take some time to sit down and analyze your life. Use today to build your tomorrow. Think about how you want to fill your time. Doing the prework of understanding yourself will lead to a fulfilling retirement where you retire towards something, rather than away.\xa0 OUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE RETIREMENT ANSWER MAN HOT TOPIC SEGMENT  [3:49] A framework for navigating the new you in retirement  PRACTICAL PLANNING SEGMENT  [10:00] People don’t focus on the right things [18:49] What kind of framework can we use to become intentional about passions?

We continue our exploration of self-reinvention and self-discovery today as we have during this whole monthlong series. On this episode, you’ll learn an important step in the process of self-discovery, which is how to close the book on the past. Before you retire you will want to ask yourself who you really are and who you want to be in the coming years. I interview Skip Prichard, author of The Book of Mistakes, to learn tools we can use to help reinvent ourselves.

This treasure of a book is a call to action to lean in to do amazing things. The Book of Mistakes by Skip Prichard. You’ll hear more about this one in the Practical Planning segment. Necessary Endings by Dr. Henry Cloud. We all know that there are different seasons to life, but finding closure can be a challenge. This book will help you identify and navigate the difficult conversations and actions to help you close out seasons of your life.  How do we define success? The subtitle of Skip Prichard’s The Book of Mistakes is 9 Steps to Creating a Successful Future. But how do we define success in retirement? Making money is no longer a factor. What are other ways we can define success? Skip believes that success can be defined by the maximization of all of your God-given talents. He thinks the trickiest part of success is finding a balance between peace and aspiration at the same time. We’re not meant to be stagnant. We need to continue to aspire for more but still have peace in our lives.\xa0 What is your why?\xa0 There is so much you can do in retirement. You are no longer bound by the confines of work or family life. Now it’s time to work on your why. One idea is to take a year just to try new things. Learn an instrument, go to shows, look for the things that really drive you. This is your opportunity to design your life to your specifications. But before you do that you need to stop and reflect. Is this really where you want to go? The most important thing you can do in retirement is move toward something, not away from something.\xa0 How do you define yourself in retirement?\xa0 As a society, we have attached ourselves to our labels of what we do for work. But what do you do when you stop working? You don’t want to refer to yourself as a retired lawyer for the rest of yourself. Think about creating your own mission statement. What do you want to be known for? How do you achieve those things? It’s important to plan how you will go about achieving your goals and define the true you.\xa0 OUTLINE OF THIS EPISODE OF THE RETIREMENT ANSWER MAN HOT TOPIC SEGMENT  [1:58] A book list for the new you in retirement  PRACTICAL PLANNING SEGMENT  [10:55] Why did Skip choose to write The Book of Mistakes in parable form?

We continue with the ‘who are you in retirement’ series by learning how to connect with your authentic self using the Enneagram. Today we welcome Teresa McCloy from the Enneagram in Your Real Life podcast. Teresa is here to show you how the Enneagram can help you rediscover your authentic self. Teresa is an Enneagram expert that teaches people how to apply the Enneagram intentionally to create a better life. Listen to this episode to learn how to use the Enneagram to rediscover your authentic self. Do you have many low stakes casual friendships? Low stakes casual friendships are those relationships with people that we see in passing. Consider the barista from the coffee shop, your hairdresser or the waitress at your favorite restaurant. They are the people you know a little bit about but you wouldn’t call at 3 a.m. with a problem. A recent study was done on the importance of low stakes relationships in our lives. We need social attachments. We feel comfortable when we go places where we are known and recognized. As you create your deeper social network don’t forget the community around you. You never know where these casual friendships may lead How can the Enneagram help you discover your authentic self? The first step in rediscovering your authentic self is to do some self-examination. This will help you to create your identity in retirement You need to identify what drives you and gives you pleasure. There are plenty of personality assessments you can take like the DISC assessment or Meyers Briggs, but the Enneagram can be an even more powerful tool for self-discovery. The enneagram is different from the rest because it speaks more to the heart. It gives us insight into becoming our best selves by connecting the head, heart, and gut.\xa0 How can the Enneagram help you in retirement? When you retire you may be at the top of your game in whatever it is you do to earn money. But that area may not be where your authentic self lies. Retirement gives you another opportunity to reconnect with your true self. The Enneagram gives us insight into becoming our best self through these three centers: the head, the heart, and the gut. With this tool, you can reconnect with all three. The Enneagram gives you the language you can use to connect with others as well. It can also help give you grace and empathy to understand how to communicate with those around you.\xa0 How can the Enneagram help you connect with your spouse? The divorce rate for couples over 50 is at an all-time high. Once you and your spouse are home all day, every day you may have trouble connecting. Many people find that when they retire they no longer feel a connection to their significant other. The Enneagram can help you discover your authentic self but it can also give you an understanding of how you relate to others and understand that others communicate differently. It can give you the language to use with your spouse and help you have grace and empathy.

Retirement means making the life transition from a full-time career to full-time living on your own terms. Although this is exciting, it can also be scary. During this series, you’ll learn how to create a framework to do this successfully. Learn how to figure out your identity and who you want to become. Are you ready to redefine yourself in retirement? Listen to this episode of Retirement Answer Man to begin to make this huge transition in your life.\xa0 Who are you?\xa0 We get so wrapped up in our professional titles that now in retirement you have a void to fill. Not only do you have to figure out the logistics of money, healthcare, where you’re going to live, now you’ll have to figure out your identity. Some people can lose direction when they retire. They think about who they were rather than who they want to become. Creating an identity from a completely blank slate can be a challenge. People don’t do well with blank slates. We prefer multiple-choice questions and don’t have the skills required to choose from such a broad palette. Do you know who you are? Do you know who you want to become? Why did I shift the focus of this series from finding your purpose? I had originally planned for this month to be all about finding your purpose in retirement, but then Mike the listener had an objection. Mike feels that there is too much pressure in finding your purpose of retirement. You probably won’t solve the problem of world hunger. Retirement is like the start of college, it’s the beginning of another round of self-exploration. Unfortunately, the analogy ends there since college has a structure and pressure. A well-funded retirement is free of pressure and structure. How will you grow and change in the absence of pressure? How can you hack longevity? It used to be that you might get 10 years of retirement in to simply sit on the park bench. Nowadays ⅓ of your adult life consists of retirement. The pattern written by previous generations doesn’t hold up for this new generation of retirees. This new stage of life has to be reinvented. Just because you stopped working doesn’t mean that you stop everything. People are beginning to hack their longevity by identifying their interests early on in retirement. These interests will carry them for the years of their retirement.\xa0 Are you ready to redefine yourself in retirement? When you retire, you can’t just run away from work, you need something to run to. It's not the absence of work that people desire in retirement, it’s the flexibility. Before beginning your retirement it’s time to start thinking about who you really are. What’s your reason to get up in the morning? What will be your storyline? How can you use the skills you have accumulated over a lifetime and translate them into the new game of retirement?

We have had several listeners ask some great questions which will help clarify how annuities work. After diving deep into annuities during this 5-week long month, we can all look forward to the next series where you will learn how to figure out who you will be in retirement. But before that, listen to this episode to get all of your annuity questions answered.\xa0 Why can’t people just self-annuitize? Ryan asks: why don’t individuals self-annuitize by using the IRS required minimum distribution (RMD) tables. This way they can keep control of their assets with the additional benefit of being able to leave the assets as an inheritance.\xa0 This is actually a great idea and the idea that the IRS has behind the RMD. The primary difference between this example and an annuity is the risk factor. In an annuity, the risk has been removed in exchange for your loss of control of assets. So in this example, you would still maintain control of the assets but you would still need to factor in market risk and execution risk. Would you prefer to use your IRA in this way or get an annuity? Do RMD’s play a factor in annuities? Another listener is curious about the role that RMD’s play in annuities. Her husband recently bought an annuity and was told that he would have to begin the annuitization phase at age 70 ½ due to the RMD.\xa0 The reason that he has this stipulation is that he must have bought the annuity using tax-deferred assets. If you have other tax-deferred assets you could postpone the annuitization period as long as you are still taking the RMD from other sources. If you have bought an annuity, did you use pre-tax or post-tax assets? Why do insurance companies handle annuities, and how do they make money? Insurance companies handle annuities instead of banks or investment firms because they are pooling risk from a large group of individuals to spread the risk in a similar way as that of an insurance policy. But the insurance company makes money much like a bank. They collect money from thousands of individuals and then they are able to invest it and earn a larger percentage than that of their policy payout. It’s like you going and buying a cd. It is important to remember that an annuity shouldn’t be seen as an investment but rather as a pre-purchased pension.\xa0 What if you don’t want to know all the details surrounding annuities? One listener thinks that annuities sound like an excellent option for her retirement but she doesn’t want to know about the fees and charges. With an annuity, it is important not just to read but also understand the contract which is no easy task. The way the contracts are written could cause you to accidentally break the contract if you aren’t careful. If you aren’t looking to be swamped by details, a fixed annuity is much more straight forward than a variable annuity.\xa0 If you are considering an annuity you need to first think about your overall retirement strategy. Let the process drive decision making. Consider why you are interested in annuities. Are you looking to insure longevity risk, simplify your financial life, or buy a pension? Remember that you are not buying an investment. So what do you think of annuities? Do they seem like a good option for you?

So that’s what launched me into the mortgage space.”“If you’re gonna buy one offs, you can be picky about what you buy in terms of the equity profile of the deal that you’re buying. At our scale, we have to be ready to pretty much buy everything..”‘We’re at about 65% of the time, we are able to modify the loan, keep the loan, get it re-performing and sell it to an income fund or another cash flow buyer. Another 10 or 15% of the time we actually get a settlement..”“We’ve seen the quantity of deal flow has definitely diminished in the residential mortgage space in general. Most of that is first leads where most of the players have been, and margins have shrunk as price points have increased for mortgages in general.”“If 10% of our loans, at any given time, stop paying, all the metrics of our fund are set up such that the fund investors don’t miss a blip and our management don’t miss a blip.

He and his wife now own two properties and are saving aggressively towards retirement.Fun note, one of those properties is actually the home that his parents now live in.Listen and read below to hear his amazing journey.Episode Summary Ben grew up upper-middle class but then 2008 happened Both of his parents were realtors and the recession crushed them leaving them bankrupt His parents had no savings and the housing market crashed Looking back he saw some flags that they hadn\'t been saving One of those flags was being asked to help pay the mortgage as a teenager \xa0The problems his parents went through caused him to choose economics as a major Ben would end up graduating with about $30k in student debt This was\xa0 a rough go because he was having to use student lines of credit His parents\' income made him ineligible for financial aid or government student loans in Canada Ben would go on to miss some payments which took a toll on his credit Upon graduation, he couldn\'t find a good job because of the recession (2010) This drove him to going back and getting his masters degree Ben got roommates in a run-down apartment for $350 a month He tried to continue living the college lifestyle so he could pay off his debt Ben became debt-free in 2015 Then Ben talks to us about meeting his wife She was very risk-averse and investing scared her After tackling stocks they moved on to real estate Ben now has two properties and has done very well on both Fun note, his parents actually rent a property from him Ben\'s financial world is now off the charts and he\'s looking to help other That\'s what started his venture into blogging online via Medium That writing has now turned into a legitimate side hustle We then tackle Canadian investing vs American investingKey Takeaways Be prepared for the unthinkable: His parents were so used to their income and the stability of the housing market. When it crashed, they certainly weren\'t prepared. Your start doesn\'t define you: The thing that really jumps out in this episode is that his parents\' bankruptcy didn\'t mean Ben couldn\'t be successful. It actually benefited him through the motivation it gave him. Currency Matters: There was a really tangible discussion where Ben called out the tactics of someone in Canada investing and how it differs from the United States.Call to ActionWhether it is a parent, cousin, or just a friend.

Today Taylor has streamlined business and his life and ready to show you how.Listen and read below to hear his amazing journey.Episode Summary We welcome Taylor from FEAT Socks This business now makes millions annually From a young age, Taylor was fascinated about price arbitrage -- this is where you can buy something and sell it for a big markup Taylor doesn’t remember one moment that made him interested in money He was more focused on value even as a child Going into college he was only focused on a lucrative degree He got a coveted internship in banking Then realized how unhappy everyone in this business was That made him realize that entrepreneurship was going to be his path People were hard on him for dropping his coveted internship His first business venture was a marketplace for college kids It was called Market Loco and got over 500k hits in a month The infrastructure costs were too expensive, so it failed His next venture was making custom print t-shirts for frats / sororities He started door-to-door but did a huge cross-country spree It was really successful at the beginning and seemed too easy Then one of his orders got ruined by the manufacturer on a $7k order Taylor realized custom business was really tough Great quote – “There’s a million ways to get it wrong, and only one way to get it right” He meets his soon-to-be business partner his senior year His partner parker had done $1M+ in custom lacrosse jersey sales They brainstormed and settled on crazy socks as the next idea This would become FEAT Socks They sold $2k worth of socks out of a backpack on campus the first day Over their senior year they sold 20k pairs of socks They were making these by hand with a heat press Eventually they hired out college friends Imagine college kids in an unheated workspace, drinking and making socks They really grew their list through Instagram and Facebook Things really turned when they got their angel investor Overnight they get $250k as seed money and FEAT Socks is legit Then through some connections they get Aly Raisman as an influencer It was during the Olympics and she sells $500k worth of socks and FEAT Socks goes viral Originally, they were going to give away 50% of the company for $50k Instead they raised the $250k at a $1.5M evaluation Then we start talking about how the business got away from them At age 23 they are making millions, move to LA and hire 20 entry-level employees They get a 5k square foot warehouse all decked out Taylor and Parker get named to Forbes 30 under 30 and life seems perfect Then, their logistics company misses Christmas delivery dates for a ton of customers They also spiraled into depression and worked 16 hour days all week Taylor just broke down one day and took a one way to Thailand He saw these poor kids in the streets who were happy That moment made him really realize what was important They also realized they had $75k in overhead -- this caused them to let go of more than 75% of their workforce and to automate everything It was cheaper, better quality, and way less stressful FEAT is now very successful with only 1 hour of work per day for the founders With FEAT Socks running on its own, they started a marketing company Taylor actually has like three other businesses going on (serious entrepreneur!) He feels like he’s happy but always finding the balance Oh, | In today\'s episode, Cody and Justin are joined by Carl and Mindy Jensen from 1500 Days.This power couple is a staple in the financial independence space.We had a blast recording live at FinCon and can\'t wait for you to hear.Discover the origin of the 1500 day blog, the dinosaurs, and why Carl will never be a plumberListen and read below to get all the wisdom from Carl and Mindy.Episode Summary Carl discovered FIRE after having a bad day at work at age 37 He ended up setting a goal of retiring in 1500 days He met his goal at age 43 Mindy and Carl write over at 1500 days Mindy is also a co-host of the Bigger Pockets Money Podcast They live next to Mr. Money Mustache in Colorado After becoming friends they went in together in a co-working space We start unwrapping Carl and Mindy’s upbringing Carl’s parents weren’t very good with money He also was the first in his family to go to college Carl became a work-a-holic and a money hoarder He would wake up with nightmares about money and getting fired Mindy actually is the one who still works though She loves her job, which has nothing to do with her education Mindy and Carl had their kids before they discovered FIRE They were three and five years old Both kids are still in school With that, Mindy doesn’t miss valuable family time by working We then discuss how the kids perceive them as retired parents Mindy recalls growing up spending all Saturday going to garage sales She said her parents had money but didn’t let the kids know Carl recalls picking individual stocks when he first started working He doesn’t recommend this approach now but got lucky with it Mindy didn’t utilize the stock market until she got married But she did start investing in real estate right away Her first place was a $50k condo She sold it a little later for $75k We go back to hearing how Carl started his blog 1500 days It was based on the days left he had to work after discovering FIRE The blog was a way to keep him accountable Currently, they invest in real estate including a Maine trailer park They also do index funds, solo 401ks, and a syndicate deal They still do live in flips and are about to start a new one We then discuss the things they do for fun Carl’s favorite thing about retirement is the uncertainty The next big project they have is starting a brewery Mindy discusses not moving around even with no job holding them down Then we dial into the final three questions Trust us you won’t want to miss these Hint… Carl gets sprayed with feces\xa0Key Takeaways You may not change:\xa0Carl was addicted to working and staying busy.

You\'ll catch Chad now helping others through coaching and setting up local meetups.It\'s a unique angle so go listen and follow along with the summary below and make sure to check out the links at the bottom of the page.Episode Summary Chad first discovered financial importance from a Dave Ramsey book he stumbled across The parts about debt pay off really hit Chad He\'s still $20k in debt from college After high school, he just did some manual labor while he tried to figure out what to do for college He got half off tuition thanks to his dad\'s job at Ohio State After college, he couldn\'t land a job because it was 2009 and the recession was in full swing He didn\'t rack up any debt from college until he got his masters in 2015 While the job he had did some tuition reimbursement, it still cost him $25k in debt That along with a car and some other loans left him with over $40k worth of debt He continues at this job making under $11 per hour After he got his masters he went to try and get a promotion Unfortunately, they didn\'t give him any options After six years there he had maxed out at $13.25 an hour and decided to leave He landed a new job and almost doubled his income to just under $50k and in a role where he was more comfortable We asked why he staid at that first job so long unhappy and underpaid For Chad, it was just comfortable and easy but he finally had enough The discussion swapped to how he saves money on this lower-income The biggest thing for him was cooking at home It turned into a full-blown hobby instead of just a money saver He plans to be out of debt in 3-5 years His big goal is to retire before age 55 and hit that $1M mark Chad is also trying to build up side hustles including coaching and writing a book Then we discuss the "poverty-tax" and the importance of an emergency fundKey Takeaways Everyone can benefit from this journey:\xa0Chad began this journey on as little as $10.75 per hour and it\'s changed his life. Your velocity may be different but the impact is still extremely meaningful. We can always help: Some may look at Chad and not expect him to be helping someone with their finances but we take for granted the knowledge we can share with others. Don\'t settle for misery: Chad obviously stayed at his first job too long. After 6 years he was still underpaid and forced into positions he hated.

They start at the most traditional lifestyle route of a professional career and seeking homeownership. Then one day they realize the housing costs are simply out of control and they\'d rather retire instead.Three years later they quit their jobs and have been traveling year-round since then. They\'re keeping busy though with projects like their new book Quit Like a Millionaire.This will certainly be one of the most entertaining episodes we\'ve had to date so go listen now.Listen and follow along with the summary below and make sure to check out the links at the bottom of the page.Episode Summary Bryce wasn’t focused on saving money in college...beer took priority When they graduated they were just solely focused on saving for a home They lived in a modest apartment while chasing a home The house prices kept outpacing the housing Before they could find a home, they realized they’d saved $500k Then Bryce came up with the idea to ditch the house idea and retire instead Kristy saw the value in this after seeing a coworker collapse from stress They hit a million at the age of 31 We then dig into how they actually got the $500k in the first place Kristy credits the scarcity mindset she got from being raised in poverty in China They moved to a cheaper apartment, used public transportation, and reigned in their eating out splurges They weren’t naturally frugal at the start with Bryce dropping hundreds on booze and Kristy collecting high-end purses.\xa0 Kristy even got into unboxing videos for these purses Bryce then starts discussing the differences between how he and Kristy see things Kristy is much better at being frugal but was much less comfortable getting started with investing They really fill in each other\'s gaps to make the perfect financial independence duo Kristy said what helped get comfortable with investing was understanding how much she\'d lose to inflation in savings accounts Then Bryce starts covering their investment strategy and how they navigated the 2008 recession That strategy is a big cornerstone of their book which seeks to show how to handle every rough situation you may encounter Kristy covers how they started out with salaries in the $60k range but would get several raises along the way Their savings rates began around 50% and would get up to 72% before retiring Kristy then covers how to use a number centered approach to choosing your major in college Bryce and Kristy then start covering all the work they\'re doing now in retirement with the book and blog They credit being in a position where the focus didn\'t need to be money as their key to side hustle success Kristy then starts telling the backstory to how her video about millennials and money went viral At this point, we shift gears to understanding how they continue to travel the world year-round for under $40k per year They prefer Air BnB over a hotel for the kitchen and laundry access Then they discuss how they build a schedule when constantly traveling and some of the bumps to expect along the way Currently, they\'re staying in a location a little over a month but plan to start rotating between locations quarterly Those three-month stints will allow them to build real lasting relationshipsKey Takeaways Create your own trend:\xa0It was amazing to see them realize that they didn\'t just have to follow the path everyone else was following. Why buy a house if that house was going to anchor you to a job for decades. Handling the worst:\xa0Too often we only tell success stories and don\'t give enough focus on preparing for non-ideal scenarios. Kristy and Bryce nail this topic.

Military housing, insurance, investing and of course retirement.Listen and follow along with the summary below and make sure to check out the links at the bottom of the page.Episode Summary When she was in college she didn\'t have a lot of money Her parents were also draining on her finances some in college It was clear to her that she needed to get her finances together and started tackling finance books She ended up commissioning as an Air Force officer through the ROTC program She also got a scholarship but because it was a private school, it didn\'t cover everything When she graduated she had $20k in student debt, credit card debt and a car payment Both of her parents are entrepreneurs but aren\'t very good with money Upon graduation she got a new car and had a total of $42k in debt After four years in the military she was debt free Her degree was in political science but she ended up in a very different career field Now she\'s making great headway towards financial independence She loves her job and never wants to work for pay after she retires Then we discuss the flaw with just choosing a job you love We then discuss why it can be beneficial to live in a high cost of living city Mil dollar then starts breaking down exactly what she makes in the Air Force Justin and Mil dollar then break down common money mistakes military make The big ones include housing and comparing military to civilian pay Then we unravel the military 401k also known as the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) This includes some big changes coming to the TSP this year! Now the moment you\'ve been waiting for...retirement We go over both the traditional retirement and the new blended retirement system Military Dollar finished the episode with how she plans to travel the world with free flights in retirementKey Takeaways Military is a really solid FI path: Unfortunately people think the military is something people do because they didn\'t have any options. In reality it\'s full of some of the smartest people you\'ll ever meet and certainly one of the most sure fire ways to retire between 38-43. People will find an excuse: Military members often spend all of there housing allowance on a house even if they could get by just find spending\xa0 a third. The mentality doesn\'t make any sense but it\'s an easy excuse for sure.

Blog)Saving-Sherpa\xa0(Justin’s blog) | In today\'s episode, Cody and Justin are joined by Kim from The Frugal Engineers.Kim started nowhere near engineering and with no financial goals.A math professor and an intro to Dave Ramsey would turn her life and career choice completely around.Kim would eventually build a side hustle that would become her full-time job.That side hustle brought in more money than she ever made in traditional employment, allowed her to stay at home with her child, and even let her husband reduce to part-time work.Now both Kim and her husband are self-employed and working for joy instead of stressing about finances.Listen and follow along with the summary below and make sure to check out the links at the bottom of the page.Episode Summary Kim took a gap year after her junior year of college to work at Disney world She had been living off scholarships and didn’t really have to worry about income During that gap year, the scholarships ended She bought a car and racked up $10k in credit card debt\xa0 The main culprit was a guy she was dating who was already in a corporate job She kept trying to keep up with his spending along with the travel and eating out Kim ended up graduating with an engineering degree Engineering wasn’t on her radar until a math professor pushed her that way Her financial turnaround came after a friend introduced her to Dave Ramsey While she always understood the math she didn’t have a grasp on the psychological side From there she made a plan that included never taking on debt again In grad school, she’d meet her future husband who took her on a date to dollar tree Kim made a vow to pay off all her debt before they would get married It was on their debt payoff celebration that he proposed Then we dig into how she graduated from just Dave Ramsey teachings Now that she’s comfortable with credit cards, she fully embraces travel rewards Fast forward and they have a child and are just discovering the FIRE community After some quick math, they realized at age 29 they were only 6 years from retirement That plan was if nothing changed but Kim wanted to work from home Kim dual-hatted a side hustle with her job She built that up so much that she now works from home and reduce childcare costs After just two years she was making much more than her traditional work Inspired by Kim’s transition her husband started working for himself as a consultant Kim’s side job was hard to juggle with being a new mom at first After calculating things, they realized it was more profitable for her husband to go part-time and free up time for her and greatly increased their work-life balance Once they were completely location-agnostic they decided to leave Florida They tried Oregon for a while but it was too expensive Starting this year they started the journey of finding a place to put down roots They tried Tennessee, Alaska, Nevada but ultimately settled on Wyoming Wyoming has great tax benefits and access to skiing for their daughter Now the next thing they needed to tackle health insurance They tried standard heathlcare.gov plan with a high deductible Then they tried a health share program through Liberty These plans are interesting because they can be more selective of who they cover It was $450 per month for a family of three Kim would have to pay upfront for the bills and then file for reimbursement They struggled with timelines on reimbursement and lack of understanding from doctors After 6 months they went back to a standard plan that was over $900 per month Currently, they’re on a “short-term” health insurance plan It’s only $230 per month but comes with a high deductible and no HSA Then we shift to discussing the detailed steps of finding your FIRE home They made spreadsheets that would mimic their spending in a specific city They visited playgrounds, realtors, and the Wal-Mart Test | In today\'s episode, Cody and Justin are joined by Chris Mamula who is about

the 80-90k range each\xa0 From the start, they were saving ~50% of their income Making a move to a rural city would eventually really increase their income Interesting note that medical professionals can often earn more in small markets Chris did end up utilizing a financial advisor that was really taking advantage of him with fees They would go on to pay their house off in seven years and really start investing In 2012 they discovered they were going to have a child after not thinking it was possible Chris admits that he was a touch depressed at the idea of having a child It just seemed like all their financial plans were going to fall apart But just a few months later, he was all in after seeing that sonogram Around this time he discovers FIRE and starts really getting smart on investing He decided to start handling his own investments and how to restructure his $400k nest egg You can check out Chris’ full portfolio at his blog Can I Retire Yet That strategy has obviously worked as they got to retire a year ago Then Chris discusses how they would decide where to live in retirement They ended up landing at Ogden, Utah (skiing was big criteria) In reality, his wife was offered a remote job that allowed them to keep insurance with few hours and Chris got a book idea Chris had no idea what writing a book would entail but knew he wanted to do a series of interviews Being able to tie all those chapters into a cohesive story turned out to be a challenge The biggest thing he learned in the writing process was that designing a life you want is much more important than actually retiring He also calls out what a difference it can make to turn saving money into a fun competition versus it feeling like a chore Chris isn’t sure he’ll ever actually stop putting in work but certainly isn’t worried about pay Then we transition the discussion on how Chris is raising his young child in regards to money and educational pathKey Takeaways Saving fixes all: They didn\'t make a ton of money, they got cheated by advisors, they had a kid...but they retired early Mental is tougher than money:\xa0Several examples were covered about psychology and those mental hurdles are so much tougher than an equation Relief not retired:\xa0The main focus should be on building a life you love not simply retiring because that\'s where the happiness really comes fromCall to ActionChris has

Dustin is a podcaster, author, real-estate investing coach and a wildly successful real estate investor. Dustin’s journey into real estate began after getting laid off from a corporate office job. At that point he realized that he would never get wealthy working for someone else, so he began working hard toward being his own boss. A weekend real estate seminar on how to buy rental properties inspired Dustin to make his first real estate investment. The key to this seminar was investing for passive income, not appreciation. The rest is history. Now, years later, Dustin and his family live off of the passive income his properties produce and they travel the world together. \xa0 Highlights:  Not depending on anyone other than yourself to make money Setting up the real estate business FIRST, before buying property, i.e. hiring property managers and repairmen Getting business referrals and clients through networking events Why “location, location, location” is not always true in real estate Investing in the Midwest because it’s cheaper Working only 30 minutes a month Investing for passive income NOT appreciation Pricing your rents slightly below average Seller financing Buying a house on a credit card  \xa0 The Takeaway: When you’re investing in real estate for passive income rather than appreciation, you have fixed costs, which allows you to predict your profit every month. \xa0 Resources: Paybal.co/learn - We help millennials make money, save money and get out of debt. \xa0 Paychecks & Balances Website: https://paychecksandbalances.com/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/paybalances/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/paychecksandbalances/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/PayBalances \xa0 Dustin Heiner Website: https://www.masterpassiveincome.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MasterPassiveInc/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedustinheiner/ Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/masterpassiveincome \xa0 | Rich and Marcus recorded this weeks episode at #Fincon19, with their friends Julien and Kiersten, of Rich & Regular.

Julien and Kiersten are part of the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) and on today’s episode they discuss bridging money gaps with your partner, being obsessed with saving and setting unique financial goals based on a desired lifestyle. \xa0 Highlights:  The problem with using a credit card with no intention of paying off the purchase Super Saving – Saving 50% of your income and investing it Investing in taxable accounts that you can access before your 60’s Sticking to financial goals with the added expense of having children There’s no financial plan for the “average individual” because everyone’s life is so different Having friends over for food and drinks, instead of spending money going out Focusing on increasing income vs. focusing on cutting down on expenses  \xa0 Key Takeaway: There is no one-way to start saving and investing.

Diania is the creator of EconoMe. EconoME is a one-day conference aimed at reclaiming the American Dream. The American Dream started as an idea that every person had the right to pursue his or her own idea of happiness. EconoMe is about reclaiming that right!

It subscribes to a new American Dream that doesn’t necessarily include excessive material possessions, conveniences or money. \xa0 In today’s episode Diania talks about her journey into getting out of $30,000 of personal debt and what gave her the motivation to pay it off by aggressively saving 60% of her income.

It was this experience that kick started her savings account and her entrepreneurial drive. Some years later, after getting her college degree she began to see her female friends get paid less than their male counterparts and miss out on career opportunities because of being female. She knew she had to fight back. \xa0 In this episode Tori talks to us about her financial upbringing, her business, her financial philosophies and her passion for disrupting the current financial ecosystem that is overwhelmingly dominated by older, straight, white males. \xa0 Highlights:  Owning 15 vending machines by the end of high school Growing up with privilege Take that loose change to the bank, avoid Coinstar machines A crash course in marketing after landing a huge job outside of college Becoming a financial advocate for the underserved Landing a job when you don’t meet the requirements The relationship between privilege and money Getting ahead financially in a system that wasn’t built for you The guilt and shame surrounding money Priority based spending Automating your savings Not getting credit for your success  \xa0 Key Takeaway: A lot of the current financial guru’s aren’t in touch with the financial issues of the millennial generation.

We get it and understand the rationale argument. When IV is low, and option premiums are cheap, you can and should buy options because they are cheap right? Not so fast bargain-buyer. \xa0 This type of thought process and strategy, low IV option buying, has two major problems. And we don\'t use the word "major" lightly here. Each problem with option buying systems is so important that the probability of getting both problems right or solved is for all intensive purposes, impossible on a long timeline. Curious to know what these major issues are? Let\'s dive into today\'s show and find out. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show163 This was a long trade. Maybe not the longest trade we\'ve been involved in, but certainly one of the top ones as this short put option assignment lasted over 5 months. For most options traders looking to make a quick buck, this trade stretches their patience and conviction far beyond a reasonable level. Still, I think that today\'s case study is important to hear because it proves critical concepts to how we think about trading here at Option Alpha. And what better way to prove something than to show you how we managed the entire position, start to finish, with real money. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show162 It might seem that the markets are a game of price, and while that might be mostly true, what they are is really a game of emotions. With enough self-awareness, the "average" investor can do incredibly well. Better than many sophisticated investors. \xa0 There\'s so much to be said about controlling your emotions and recognizing biases that we could spend hours upon hours dissecting each one. I prefer a more optimized approach which is why I decided to do a podcast specifically on the top 8 biases that investors fall victim to. Once you learn to recognize them, you can then process the emotions behind the scenes so that it doesn\'t interfere with your trading. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show161 As many of our long-time listeners know, over the years I\'ve become increasingly protective and selective with the guests that I invite to come on the show. Truth be told, we get pitched weekly for people looking to expand their reach. Somethings it\'s just so off the wall and disconnected to trading that I have to laugh. But this isn\'t the case with today\'s guests which I\'m super excited to bring on for an interview. \xa0 Kevin Smith and Tavi Costa both generously gave their time to join me for an incredible look inside their philosophy and macro models at Crescat Capital, a hedge fund based in Denver Colorado. This is an episode you won\'t want to miss. In fact, I encourage you to listen to it at least twice to make sure you pick up on all the little details you might have skipped the first time around. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show160 Newest platform updates. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show159 This podcast is a long-time coming but one that needed to be done because we get a lot of questions from newbie traders about how to build an options portfolio with a small amount of starting capital. And while we openly suggest that you really start trading with at least $5,000 or more, as you\'ll hear me say a bunch in this show, we realize that a good majority of new traders want to start with less.\xa0That\'s why in today\'s show we\'ll play "pretend" and assume you absolutely want to start trading with just $3,000. \xa0 Inside I\'ll walk through my though process on building out a portfolio that gives you the highest possible chance of success. We\'ll cover everything from position sizing, ticker selection, strategies to use, what ranges or targets for setting them up, profit taking and stop losses, and much more. The concepts we\'ll cover are applicable to any portfolio size so don\'t think or one second that this show is just for small account traders. If you trade a larger account size you can also pick up a lot of great nuggets of information. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show158 Somewhere, possibly from another planet, this notion of trading options with a high probability of success transformed into a subconscious greed for 100% probability of success trades. And if you think that this mentality doesn\'t exist in the modern market we are in, you should see the emails we get at Option Alpha on a weekly basis. The truth is that you are going to have losing trades, a lot of them over the course of your career. Sometimes they\'ll come in groups and bunches that make you question everything you are doing or the strategy/system you are choosing to use. But, the first step on your road to elevating yourself is to ask yourself, "Can I trust the process?". | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show157 A couple of weeks ago I was reading the story of the three little pigs to my daughters. And for some reason, I couldn\'t help but think about the untold story of the three little pigs who traded options? Yes, it\'s true, many people don\'t know this but the three little pigs were actually given a large chunk of money from their mother and each decided to trade wildly different options portfolios when they set out on their own. In today\'s podcast, I\'ll walk through each of the different portfolios they used and how volatility and variance can impact long-term performance and why it\'s important that we know the story of the three little pigs that traded options. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show156 Many of our members understand the best times to trade options (i.e. higher IV setups when option premiums are expensive), but should we avoid trading during other market situations? Today\'s podcast walks through the four general market situations I avoid aggressively trading in and explain why each type requires that you either sit on the sidelines or dramatically scale back your position size. | Show notes: http://optionalpha.com/show155 Everyone loves a good options trading checklist right? Well, here are the 7 questions you should ask yourself before you put on an options trade. Answer each one over the next week and you\'ll build a strong habit that will keep your positions and portfolio in check before you put your hard earned money at risk.', 'chan_desc': 'We are on a mission to help you make smarter investments and trades – it’s just that simple.

He discusses bottom-up value investing, and developing a powerful respect for the effect of cycles. When it came to evaluating companies, he took issue with traditional DCF analysis, and focused more on using DCF as a tool to provide guide posts to probabilities of various outcomes. Next, Meb asks Dan to walk through the Extreme Value portfolio. Dan discusses there are 17 names with average days held of 1100, reflecting his thinking about equity as “permanent capital.” He covers names like Altius Minerals, Starbucks, and Dollar General. Dan also touches on his thinking behind the sell decision.

The conversation shifts into the current deal environment, and competing for allocations for deals. Alex provides an example of seeing an opportunity and fighting for an allocation. He also describes how his initial optimism about an investment correlates with the results in ensuing years. Meb then asks Alex about AI and the opportunity there. Alex describes his firm’s bullishness on AI, and why he thinks AI isn’t going to take over as many jobs as we think it will right now. Alex then gets into AI deployment doing one of four things; segmentation, optimization, anomaly detection, and recognizing objects. Commercial AI systems are being built to automate a process or make a prediction about the future.

Meb then asks about the beginning of Tom’s angel investing career. Tom walks through the progression of angel investing with a partner to launching his own fund, and how important it is to build a network. Next, the pair dive into AngelList, syndicates, and how easy it has become to invest in startups. Tom dives further into venture, with an example of a fallacy that it is a zero-sum game. He describes technology driven disruption resulting in a democratization process where more and more companies taking their share of the market as a result. Meb then asks Tom to explain his thought process on investing. Tom emphasizes his focus on macro. He then discusses a theme he’s been investing in, America losing its supremacy and how to fix that. He shares that he finds ethically run technology companies that are trying to “ladder up” the “trapped class” in America are looking very interesting. Tom then spends some time talking about some portfolio investments. He walks through Grove Collaborative, already America’s largest independent brand for home and personal care, and the clear vision that the co-founder and CEO explained to him. Tom describes the vision being so obvious, he just had to go with it. He follows up with LogDNA, and Jumbotail.

Meb and professor Harvey begin the conversation with professor Harvey’s 1986 dissertation on the yield curve, and his finding that when the yield curve inverts, it precedes a recession. His indicator has yet to provide a false signal. He goes on to explain the model, what it really tells us, and the implications as we move late into the summer of 2019. Professor Harvey then gets into what an inverted yield curve means for growth, and a study he did that describes the performance of various asset classes before and after yield curve inversions. He follows up with some background on the Duke CFO survey, and the predictive power it has in foreshadowing recession. As of a recent observation, 85% of respondents believe a recession will begin in 2020 or 2021. The conversation shifts, and professor Harvey gets into some thoughts on cryptocurrency, and the research that went into the creation of his course on Blockchain. Next, professor Harvey explains blunders in factor investing, from data mining, to investors not taking correlation of factors into consideration. As the conversation winds down, professor Harvey discusses what he’s thinking about in his research these days, and disruptions he sees coming in finance.

The same holds true in a bear market. In fact, the next serious market crash could be the best thing to happen to your investment portfolio. | In this episode we\'re going to talk about the simple math behind the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early). How do you even start to think about how much money you\'ll need when you\'re ready to retire? The good thing is, it\'s easier to figure out than you might think. Plus, Rob talks about his new book, which is now available on pre-order. | In this episode, Rob discusses the process of buying a home (he just bought one!) But how should he (and you) keep track of important documents? Rob created a shared spreadsheet that you can use to keep track of everything important related to his home. | In this episode, Rob gets theoretical: How much control do we actually have over our financial situation? Rob tackles the issue, and dives into the Latte Factor - the idea that if you stop buying your cup of coffee at Starbucks you\'ll end up with a million dollars in 40 years. Is that true, or does it rest on unrealistic assumptions? | In this episode, Rob talks about his plan to generate a million dollars in wealth through cash back rewards. He tries to strike a balance between maximizing cash rewards while maintaining simplicity by using just one credit card. He walks us through which cards he\'s using, discusses Ebates, and shares his wisdom on earning cash back. | In this episode, Rob talks about investment fees and whether they really matter. Are fees important, or are the returns what we should be focusing on? Rob also takes a detour to discuss the Secure Act - a piece of legislation that would make changes to retirement accounts. Find out how it would affect you if it passes. | In this podcast, Rob takes a deep dive into what you get when you pay high advisory fees. He\xa0compares the Fidelity Freedom 2050 target retirement fund with the similar Vanguard 2050 retirement fund. He ends off with\xa0three questions to ask yourself before you leave an expensive managed investment fund:  Is my advisor’s strategy truly adding value to my portfolio? Am I comfortable having all my money in just three or four funds?\xa0 How will I handle it when my portfolio underperforms?\xa0  | In this episode, Rob talks about Health Savings Accounts. He calls them "one of the best tax-advantaged accounts" you could have - he tells us why he has one and why you should too. Oh, and if you want to watch it on Youtube, the the podcast has a video new format - check it out! | In this episode, Rob discusses Balance Transfer Credit Cards. What are they, what aren\'t they. How to use them, how not to use them. Trick, traps. And everything else you should think about when you consider applying for a balance transfer credit card. He also answers some listener questions about the latest Flywheel episode and more. | In this episode, Rob answers listener questions about REIT funds and the Smart Beta. He also discusses the Flywheel, which describes investing as difficult to get started but easy thereafter.

She purchased a large 5th wheel to flip and sell for profit. They didn\'t do enough research and got a deal but it wasn\'t ideal for selling."Our frugality didn\'t serve us well in that purchase." Next time they\'d spend more money to get something newer, that needed less work. Or not even spend more, just start smaller. She also learned she\'s not good with her hands.Jill: Back when she was planning to get married they wanted to do it quickly to save money and have less time to make expensive decisions. She found this amazing dress online that inspired her to look for a knockoff dress.She found a dressmaker in China who promised to make the same dress for $100. She said if it didn\'t work she\'d just wear her sister\'s dress. The dress came in the mail in a large envelope and turned out to look nothing like what it looked like online... and then realized she didn\'t want to wear her sister\'s dress.At the last minute she had to buy an off the rack dress for $400 and spend $400 on alterations because it was so last minute.Got your own frugal fail?

Your savings rate is dependent upon how much you take home each year and how much you can live onThe goal is to get your annual investment growth large enough for you to live on, and then...you’re financially independent!The most important thing to note is that cutting your spending rate is much more powerful than increasing your income. The reason is that every permanent drop in your spending has a double effect:It increases the amount of money you have left over to save each monthIt permanently decreases the amount you’ll need every month for the rest of your lifeMore from the Internet:This article from Choose FI outlines a beginners guide to financial independence; what it entails, and how to achieve it.What Jen+Jill have to say:Savings rate - FI/RE recommends 50% rather than traditional 15%Travel rewards *link episodeInvestment philosophy: Broad based, low cost index fund VTSAX(article compares vanguard&fidelity)Side Hustles *link updatesGet 1% better - “dont need to eat the whole elephant todayLower living expenses *link episodeEliminate debtEmployer accountsBILL OF THE WEEK - Thanks Marin from Maryland for sharing your bill about paying down debt and only having your mortgage bill left!

Am I running away from something?Work isn\'t bad! Especially if you don\'t hate what you do!How will retiring early change my life for better or worse?Am I sacrificing too much to retire early?Be careful about living in the future as you may end up sacrificing the presentWhat will I do after I retire early? Am I running towards something?Have I gained enough perspective from those who’ve already retired?How will you plan for the variables of life?Frugal Friends Book Club:This month’s frugal book club book is The Minimalist Home by Joshua Becker!If you want a free copy, leave us a review on iTunes or Stitcher, screenshot the review and send it to frugalfriendspodcast@gmail.com.

But then she found herself in student loan, credit card, and auto loan debt. Listen to how she paid off $50k and now is on her way to financial freedom and independence. Along her financial journey, Josie discovered her passion for financial freedom and independence. She became a blogger with the mission to inspire the latino community to improve their finances and live a minimalist life. Now that they are debt free, Josie and her husband are focused on financial planning, saving, and securing their family’s future.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0  \xa0 The day has finally arrived! The Money Launch Club (the membership community to help you reach Financial Freedom & Independence) doors are now open! Join us here MoneyLaunchClub.com\xa0before the doors close again in a few days! \xa0 More About Josie Espinoza Current location (city)\xa0 Porterville, CA Profession Teacher Josie we are excited to share your story with the Journey to Launch community. Before we dive into your journey, can you tell Journeyers more about yourself?\xa0 I was born in Mexico, and I am the youngest of 9. I was the first one to get a college degree, but 3 of my older siblings own successful businesses in Mexico. My parents brought me to California when I was 8 years old along with two of my siblings. They have been farm workers ever since, picking different types of fruit depending on the season here in the Central Valley, California. \xa0I never went to a babysitter because my parents would take me to work with them on the weekends, school holidays and summers. My first paycheck was from picking grapes one summer. Even though it wasn\'t easy working in the fields, I still didn\'t value money. My mom would always say "Money is made to be spent," and that\'s the mindset I grew up with. In college I had two jobs, bought a car, got my first credit cards, spent all my money, and didn\'t save a dime. \xa0In about 2014, I came across the snowball debt payoff method on Pinterest which then led me to find Dave Ramsey. I started tracking my debt and tried to pay it off but wasn\'t really focused.\xa0 Fast forward to July 2018, we got home from a summer trip and had no money because our credit cards were maxed out and my next paycheck wasn\'t coming for another three weeks. Those three weeks without money were my rock bottom. \xa0It was then that I really focused on my finances. We made our finances a priority, we made a budget and stuck with it. Every morning I take a few minutes to check our budget and remind my husband what our goal for the day. For example, sometimes we had a no spend day, no coffee, sell one item, or spend less than $10 goal. I started listening to finance podcasts instead of music and reading every finance book I could get my hands on. \xa0Then, I started following the Debt Free Community on Instagram and joined financial independence (FI) groups on Facebook. I also sold a lot of stuff that I wasn’t using which led me to become an aspiring minimalist. Currently, we are working on saving 3 months of our expenses in our emergency fund. We have paid off the majority of our debt and only have our mortgage left. We know our financial independence (FI) number and have a plan.\xa0 We are still spenders but only spend our weekly allowance. I’m fortunate that my husband and I are on the same page when it comes to our finance\xa0 goals and we hold each other accountable. Thanks to the Journey to Launch Podcast and the Money Launch Club I felt financially stable enough to take a risk and resign from a job that was affecting my mental health. I wish I would have known everything about finance when I started working.\xa0 I started a blog and an instagram page “Minimalisa Todo” which means minimize everything. My goal is to share my journey as I minimize my financial stress, my clutter at home and my weight. It is in Spanish because I want to inspire the Spanish speaking community. Wow what a journey. Josie what advice would you share with other Journeyers still on the journey to reach their goals?\xa0 First I would say, write everything down, track your progress, and celebrate the small wins.\xa0 I am a very impatient person and seeing a visual of where I started and how far I’ve come gave me motivation to keep going. I also like to celebrate the small wins, things like not buying a coffee in the morning, eating lunch from home three days in a row. My celebrations were always within the budget and sometimes it was silly things like a happy dance or a high five from my husband. Josie, what else motivates you? What\'s your "Why," or the reason you are pursuing Financial Freedom & Financial Independence?\xa0 The freedom to spend time with my daughter and my husband is my why. My husband is a truck driver and is always on the road. I want us to spend more time together. One of our crazy goals is for my daughter and I to join him on the road and visit every state where he makes deliveries and gets paid. That’s an awesome goal. Josie, what\'s something you want to improve or change to help you reach your goals?\xa0 As a family we are working on eating at home. I am also transitioning to a new job and I started my masters to be able to increase my income. What are some things you are doing to help move forward on your journey ?\xa0 I am still selling things I don\'t use. I also do audits and secret shopping gigs to earn extra income. I have several apps on my phone that earn me money with little effort. We are tracking every penny that comes in and out of our accounts.\xa0 So, Josie have you had any wins since joining the Money Launch Club?\xa0 Since joining the Money Launch Club, I have paid off my debt (minus my mortgage). I also\xa0 made more informed changes to my retirement account after one of the classes. The FI course opened my eyes to the reality of our situation. I like that I was able to play with the number and see how\xa0 different habits today could impact my future. What do you enjoy most about the Money Launch Club?\xa0 I really enjoy the speakers in the Money Launch Club, especially when we are able to ask our questions. I like how it is not very formal and is a welcoming environment. What’s something you were surprised to learn on your journey? Everything I know about finance I have found free on the internet. My hairdresser once told me, "In this technology era, not\xa0 knowing is no longer an excuse." I feel that there are so many free resources on the internet that anyone can change their finances with a little effort.

More About Cassandra Henry Current location (city) Bronx, New York What\'s your profession? Teacher Cassandra we are glad to have you share your story with Journeyers today. Before we dive into your journey, please tell us more about yourself. My name is Cassandra Henry and I am a powerful, vulnerable and responsible leader. I am 25 years old and a first generation Dominican pursuing a life of abundance. I started my financial independence journey the summer of 2017, after being introduced to Dave Ramsey\'s 7 Baby Steps and the personal finance podcast, Bigger Pockets Money. I have since increased my income by an extra $10,000, learned the importance of budgeting, and now understand what it means to have an abundant mindset when it comes to money. I am currently on the road to paying off more than $25,000 in student loans. Although there have been many ups and downs, the journey has been worth it. Cassandra what advice would you give other Journeyers who are also on the journey to reach their goals? Invest in yourself! This journey of financial independence has helped me recognize my own worth and realize that I deserve to invest in the goals that I have for myself. Seeking opportunities to grow your network, attending webinars, or even meet-ups that focus on reaching financial independence has definitely helped me get closer to reaching my financial goals. If you want to reach financial independence, it\'s best to be on the journey in a community with others instead of on your own. Cassandra what\'s your "Why?" What motivates you to pursue Financial Freedom & Financial Independence? My “Why” is my family. When I was little, my father always reminded me about the importance of saving. Whether it be for clothes or traveling, he would always pull my mother, my sisters and me aside and we would count all of the money we saved together as a family. When he passed away three years ago, I felt unprepared and overwhelmed by the financial responsibilities that had to be addressed. At the time, I was the only breadwinner of the family and although my father taught me how to save, he never taught me how to budget. I realized in order to make sure my family and I don\'t end up homeless I have to be more aware of my money and where it\'s going. As the years passed, I developed a desire to reach financial independence to not only provide stability for my mother but also to begin a legacy of wealth within my family. Cassandra what a powerful story. What\'s something you want to improve or do to help you reach your goals?\xa0 I want to improve on creating better habits when it comes to maintaining a positive money mindset. When I don\'t reach a financial goal that I have for myself, I take it pretty hard. I have been trying to surround myself with positive people to help ameliorate the disempowering mindset I get whenever I come across a money issue. Mindset is key to staying positive and building wealth. Cassandra can you share some things you are doing to help move forward on your journey? First off, I have increased my income by $10,000 with side hustles. My journey has reignited my passion for entrepreneurship, and I am in the process of developing a plan for my own business. Also,\xa0 I increased my network of influencers.\xa0 One important thing I continue to do is educate myself about\xa0 financial independence by reading books and listening to several personal finance and motivational podcasts. As a result of what I am doing, my family and friends are also learning the importance of managing money. It’s nice when you get family and friends involved in your journey. Have you had any “wins” since joining the Money Launch Club? How has the Money Launch Club helped you achieve those goals? * Yes, I have. For example, I\xa0 increased my number of side hustles. After reading Financial Freedom with the Money Launch Club, I began to apply for more side jobs. I now have three side hustles: Online Teacher for VIP kid, after school program assistant, and a tutor.\xa0 I also created an online bank account for my emergency fund. The Money Launch Club has exposed me to so many different avenues I can take to increase my money. I was able to learn about online bank accounts through conversations in the Money Launch Club. Sounds like you’ve gotten a lot out of being in the Money Launch Club. What do you enjoy most about it? * I have appreciated the opportunity to have Money Launch Club meetups, book clubs, and the speakers!

His resume includes acting as Duty Editor for Reuters, the BBC and Sky News. Ten years ago, while reporting in Argentina, Williams came across evidence in a local archive that changed the way he looked at historical reporting. Nazi war criminals, potentially including Adolf Hitler, used clandestine international routes to flee defeated Germany for safe haven in Argentina and other South American countries. Using these archives, eye-witness reports and other local histories, Williams published the book, Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler. Despite the rigor in his journalism and his adherence to facts and evidence, the international community has largely ignored him.

In fact, I\'ll be speaking at his Raising Money Summit in Denver this weekend. www.RealWealthShow.com For tickets to the Raising Money Summit in Denver this weekend go to: https://www.westword.com/event/raising-money-summit-2019-general-admission-11339043 \xa0 |   Many tech experts are predicting big changes with the new 5G cellular signal. They say 5G will make data connections instantaneous, and will revolutionize many up-and-coming technologies including driverless cars, remote healthcare, emergency services, augmented reality, and many more.  Exactly what is 5G? Why are so many people predicting a major transformation? And how will it impact our lifestyles and real estate in particular? Our guest today, Samantha Radocchia, is an emerging Tech and Innovation Expert with Singularity University and\xa0 Author of Bitcoin Pizza: The No Bullshit Guide to Blockchain.  In this interview, she will share:  A user-friendly definition of 5G. Why so many people are predicting a major 5G tech transformation. How it will impact our lifestyles with 10 real-world examples. How it will Impact real estate, in particular. The 5G roll-out timeline, which is already underway. When we should jump in and buy a 5G phone. The downside and obstacles to 5G.  www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0   | I’m excited for today’s interview with the one and only Ken McElroy. Ken has experienced massive success in the real estate, with over 10,000 doors and over $750 million investment dollars in his projects. He’s the author of best-selling books: "The ABC’s of Real Estate Investing," "The Advanced Guide to Real Estate Investing," "The ABC’s of Property Management," and his most recent title, "The Sleeping Giant," on entrepreneurship. www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0 | August has been a volatile month for the global economy and for stock investors. Nearly every news channel is screaming that a recession is around the corner, and some European investors are accepting negative returns for bonds. Should real estate investors be panicking? Should we be mining for gold? Today\'s guest has been predicting a financial reckoning for some time now. He has been recently associated as the voice of doom and gloom, but I think he\'s really pointing out the inevitable — that people can\'t go into debt forever and expect a positive outcome. www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0 |   I\'m not a very good golfer, and I\'m even worse at Topgolf because there\'s an audience and alcohol involved. But I am excited to introduce today\'s guest, who came up with the wild idea of turning a\xa0 high rise bar into a driving range. It\'s the epitome of cool, and has been quite a success.  This interview was done live at Singularity University\'s Global Summit in San Francisco last month. You may have heard about Singularity through it\'s famous founders, Peter Diamandis and Ray Kurzweil. SU is located in the Silicon Valley and it\'s not only a business incubator, it\'s a global community that uses cutting edge "exponential" technologies to tackle the world’s biggest challenges.  I am happy to have as our guest today the Executive Chairman of Singularity University. Erik Anderson. Erik is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of WestRiver Group (WRG) since 2002. WRG is a collaboration of leading investment firms providing integrated capital solutions to the global innovation economy.\xa0 Anderson is also the Executive Chairman of Topgolf Entertainment Group, a global sports entertainment company. In this role, he has received numerous honors, including the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award.\xa0 In 2018 and 2017 he was honored by Goldman Sachs as one of their Top 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs. In 2018 he was ranked by Golf Inc.as the No. 3 most powerful person in the golf industry after being ranked No. 8 the previous year. Anderson is Vice-Chairman of ONEHOPE, a cause-centric consumer brand and technology company, most commonly known for their award-winning wine and world-class vineyard in Napa, Calif. Additionally,Anderson is the founder of America’s Foundation for Chess, currently serving 160,000 children in the United States with its First Move curriculum. \xa0 \xa0 www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0 \xa0   |    Today we\'re going to talk about how one of our Real Wealth Network employees is living the dream of "real wealth" on a budget. 10 years ago we put out an ad on Craigslist for a receptionist. It was 2009, smack dab in the middle of the Global Financial Crisis. Not too many real estate companies were hiring at that time, but Real Wealth Network was booming.  The unemployment rate was massive, so we had thousands of applicants for the receptionist position. I was so overwhelmed I just asked people to show up at our next event to meet in person. Only 3 people showed up and Maggie Pike was one of them. She has been with us ever since in many roles, from receptionist, to event planner, to my assistant, to Director of our Real Wealth Academy, and now as our Director of Syndications.  And, as of Saturday, she is now Mrs. McKinnie. Maggie and her new husband Marc are building a real estate portfolio while living their dream of traveling the world. They are such an inspiration, I decided to interview them for this week\'s Real Wealth Show. Enjoy! \xa0 www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0    \xa0  \xa0 | Buying your first rental property may seem like a monumental task. You have to work outside your comfort zone, to try something new and learn as you go. It\'s even more difficult if your first properties are out-of-state.  So what does it take to pull the trigger on a plan to buy rentals many miles from where you live? How do you manage your properties if you don\'t live nearby? How do you protect yourself from bad tenants? How do you deal with local issues like storms and flooding? What kind of insurance and back-up reserves should you have for unexpected events?  Our guest today is based in California. He took took the leap and has become a long-distance landlord with properties in four different markets. He\'s here to share his story and some of the things that he\'s learned. It\'s a great way to help potential investors make that first move, so let\'s find out how it\'s going for Alek Mukherji and his portfolio of single-family rentals. www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0 | What were you doing during the 2008 financial meltdown? Perhaps you weren\'t invested in real estate so you weren\'t affected. Or maybe you got started buying real estate right after the crash and took advantage of record low home prices due to all the foreclosures. Or maybe you got hit hard like millions of Americans, handing the keys to your property back to the bank. Either way, it\'s important that we don\'t forget what happened just 10 years ago. Just like me, today\'s guest was in mortgage lending during the financial crisis. She had helped her family invest in homes in her own name and when they couldn’t pay during the crisis she was hit really hard, and just like me, she learned some tough lessons. But after the crisis she became a realtor because she knew how to do short sales and she became very successful at that. During this time she was helping her relatives Craig and Arlene Turner invest in a duplex in Stockton, and they told her to listen to the Real Wealth Show. Now, she’s been investing her realtor income through Real Wealth Network for the past four years and has learned a lot of lessons but considers it all a blessing. So let\'s find out the ups and down of her journey. www.RealWealthShow.com \xa0 |  At the beginning of the year, Real Wealth Network’s Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Rich Fettke, led us through the process of creating a “Success Plan” for focused investors.

William R. White was most recently chairman of the Economic and Development Review Committee at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from 2009 to 2018. He is famous for having flagged the wild behavior in debt markets before the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. He began his career in 1969 as an economist working at the Bank of England. In 1972 he joined the Bank of Canada where he spent 22 years and was appointed Deputy Governor in September 1988. In 1994, he joined the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and served as its Economic Adviser and Head of the Monetary and Economic Department from May 1995 to June 2008.\xa0 In their conversation, Demetri and Dr. White discuss a wide range of topics focused primarily on the global financial system. Their conversation begins with a focus on the state of the current system, including a discussion about the consequences of regulatory reform (both intended and unintended), as well as endogenous transformation to the system brought about by independent changes in the behavior of banks and other financial participants. Most of the conversation dealing with possible changes to the International Monetary and Financial System happen during the Episode Overtime, including a discussion about central bank-issued cryptocurrencies, private sector digital money like Libra, and Bitcoin. The overtime also includes a lengthy discussion about government policy in the face of climate change, and how this relates to the politics of monetary policy. William White has spent five decades as a central banker and international financial policymaker, and we are fortunate beneficiaries of the wisdom that he has accrued during these many years.\xa0 Additional topics discussed during the episode include post-crisis reform, market architecture, currency wars, negative interest rates, the Chinese renminbi, causes for inflation, Japanification, the ‘Global Ring of Fire,’ and much more.

Michael is also chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor at the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, where he has spearheaded research projects that employ blockchain technology to achieve social impact goals. Michael Casey’s breadth of experience as a financial journalist for Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal, as well as his time spent stationed overseas in Thailand and Argentina, provide him with a unique perspective on the ‘problem of trust’ and what he calls ‘the Internet’s original sin.’ The latter is a reference to the observation that the inventors of packet switching and the basic Web protocols did, according to Casey, “a masterful job figuring how to move information seamlessly across a distributed network. What they didn’t do was resolve the problem of trust.” “On the one hand,” writes the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board, “the distribution of public information was disintermediated, which put all centralized providers of that information, especially newspapers and other media outlets, under intense business pressure from blogs and other new information competitors. But on the other, all valuable information – particularly money itself, an especially valuable form of information – was still intermediated by trusted third parties.” This intersection between money, communication, and trust serves as the basis for Demetri and Michael’s conversation during this episode. The two discuss Shoshana Zuboff’s work on Surveillance Capitalism, the loss of faith in financial institutions and central banks (including recent actions by the Federal Open Market Committee and the intervention by the Fed in the overnight Repo market), and how cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology aims to reinstill this lost faith by resolving the problem of trust. The overtime to this week’s episode is an exhaustive exploration of the forces driving cryptocurrency adoption around the globe, the cultural impetus behind these forces, and the financial imperatives fueling Bitcoin\'s ascent as truly global money.

This is the go-to-episode for anyone looking to understand the public ledger and why Fortune 100 companies like IBM, Deutsche Telekom, Boeing, and others have joined Hedera\'s Governing Council. As a seed investor in Hedera Hashgraph, Demetri’s involvement with the public ledger goes back to September 2017, when he first invited Leemon Baird onto Hidden Forces to discuss the  Hashgraph Whitepaper. Weeks later, Demetri put on an event at the Assemblage NoMad where Mance Harmon joined a panel alongside two other members of the executive team. The panel explored the innovation of Hashgraph consensus, specifically virtual voting and gossip-about-gossip. On March 13th, 2018, Leemon and Mance announced the launch of Hedera Hashgraph at an event in New York City, and on August 1st, 2018, news of the ledger’s  $6 Billion valuation was made public. Six months later, Hedera announced the  initial group of Governing Council Members, and six months after this IBM, Tata Communications, FIS, and Boeing were announced as having joined Hedera’s Governing Council as well. Two years since Leemon Baird first appeared on Hidden Forces to share the news about Hashgraph, Hedera has finally gone public. Open Access also marks the beginning of Hedera’s strategic 15-year coin distribution, with HBAR tokens beginning to be released on exchanges in the US and Asia. This recording is meant to be the go-to-episode for anyone looking to understand Hedera Hashgraph DLT and the functions of the Hedera Governing Council. Demetri also references a back-and-forth on Twitter between him, Hedera’s technical lead, and a number of Hedera skeptics resulting from a  medium post by writer and blockchain enthusiast Eric Wall. Hedera’s technical lead, Paul Madsen,  responded with his own posts. Demetri has encouraged anyone interested in learning more about Hedera Hashgraph to engage with the team through their Telegram channel, as well as on Twitter.

Dr. Borio heads the Monetary and Economic Department at the Bank for International Settlements and has written extensively about some of the longer-term, structural forces bedeviling policymakers since the early 2000s.\xa0 More recently, the Federal Reserve held its annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Fed Chairman Jay Powell delivered a speech titled, “Challenges for Monetary Policy,” in which he addresses “three longer run questions” bedeviling policymakers. In the speech, Powell breaks up the post-war history of central banking into three distinct eras: 1950–1982, 1983–2009, and 2010—. The day before Jay Powell’s speech, on August 22nd, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, published a series of tweets\xa0where he conducted a similar retrospective analysis of central bank policy going back to the stagflationary period of the 1970s. According to Larry Summers, “the high inflation and high-interest rates of the 1970s generated a revolution in macroeconomic thinking, policy, and institutions,” while the “low inflation, low-interest rates and stagnation of the last decade…deserves at least an equal response.” Further, Summers writes, “the financial crisis had roots in bubbles and excessive leverage caused by efforts to maintain demand after the 2001 recession,” which suggests that perhaps, the maniacal focus on inflation amplified by the experience of the stagflationary nineteen-seventies blinded central banks and policymakers to a build-up in financial risks exacerbated by keeping interest rates “too low for too long” during the 1990’s and early 2000’s.\xa0\xa0\xa0 The conversation you’re about to hear was recorded on Monday, August 19th, several days before the publication of Jay Powell’s speech, as well as Larry Summers’ tweets. Some of the key questions we attempt to answer during this discussion are: “What’s driving the slow growth environment that we are in?” “Are rates low because central banks are keeping them low, or are rates low because central banks, encouraged by a prolonged period of disinflation, kept interest rates chronically below the ‘natural rate’ for too long, thus encouraging the growth of asset price fueled credit bubbles that have turned central banks from being stewards of the expansion to now being managers of the contraction?”\xa0 Demetri and Claudio also explore the different eras highlighted in Chairman Powell’s speech, search for the origins of inflation targeting as a policy objective, question the efficacy of neutral rate targeting, and consider some of the possible consequences that could arise from an economic model that has increasingly come to rely upon debt financing in order to grow. In the overtime, Demetri asks Dr. Claudio Borio questions about the BIS 2019 Annual report, with a keen focus on some of the more immediate risks facing the global economy.

There are two parts to this story that we explore during this conversation. The first deals with Hong Kong – specifically, its political and economic future as an independent territory of mainland China. The second deals with China itself – specifically, its political and financial stability as the most leveraged economy at scale, in the world.\xa0 The events in Hong Kong over the last several months – exacerbated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s determination to push through the Extradition bill despite mounting opposition – have created a terrifying sense of crisis and disorder in the city. Videos of police beatings and retaliatory violence by protestors, as well as satellite images of what appear to be armored personnel carriers and other vehicles belonging to China’s paramilitary People’s Armed Police, have created an ominous sense of foreboding in the city. "One country, two systems," might be the fault line upon which the tectonic forces shaping China’s political and economic development are colliding, creating mountains of civil unrest among Hong Kongers. At what point do the political tremors in Hong Kong become civic earthquakes capable of shattering the fragile peace between these two irreconcilable systems? Will open society prevail in Hong Kong, or will China do whatever it takes in order to reassert control over the former British colony? In the second part of this conversation, David Webb shares his insights from his decades of experience studying the Chinese economy and investing in Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. Those insights include a discussion about China’s overleveraged banking system, an overvalued RMB, and a system of Ponzi financing for Chinese companies listed on non-mainland exchanges. David Webb also contests a thesis famously put forward by hedge fund manager Kyle Bass about the precarious position of Hong Kong’s currency and the risk of decoupling with the US dollar. Additional topics include a new “tech cold war,” China’s propaganda battle, the US-China trade war, and much, much more.\xa0 There is no overtime to this week’s episode on account of some technical constraints. Instead, we have made the transcript to this conversation available to Overtime subscribers, which will be published in the next day or two. You can gain access to the transcript, as well as a copy of the rundown to this week’s episode directly through our Patreon page.\xa0 Producer & Host: Demetri Kofinas Editor & Engineer: Stylianos Nicolaou Subscribe & Support the Podcast at http://patreon.com/hiddenforces Join the conversation on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter at @hiddenforcespod | In Episode 97 of Hidden Forces, Demetri Kofinas speaks with Nic Carter, co-founder of both the VC fund Castle Island Ventures, as well as the research and data analytics company Coinmetrics.io. Nic also has a master’s degree in philosophy, and the two spend much of the overtime applying that discipline to bitcoin by examining the works of people like Friedrich Nietzsche and his philosophy around essence, John Rawls and his veil of ignorance, as well as applying a strain of utilitarian thought to questions of money and society. This conversation with Nic Carter is an attempt to understand Bitcoin as more than just the sum of its parts. One of the lessons that Demetri has taken away from his continued research into Bitcoin through the works of people like Nick Szabo, Paul Sztorc, and others, is that trying to measure the cryptocurrency against existing systems or conventions is almost always counterproductive. This is likely because Bitcoin is more than just money or a payments network. Bitcoin is a movement. Within it exists a competent community of intellectuals who are actively engaged in what often feels like a grand project to remake society. This comes across in the seriousness with which Bitcoiners apply themselves. This is true whether we are talking about the engineers working on enhancements to the base layer or whether we’re talking about those contributing intellectually to debates about governance, economics, and ethics. In this sense, Bitcoin is not what most of us think it is, and even what we think it is, is constantly changing. Bitcoin’s resilience and adaptability, as both a store of value, but also as a diverse community of people who are coming to the cryptocurrency from different backgrounds and with differing motivations suggests that there is much more going on here than just naïve speculation.\xa0 As Nic Carter points out during this conversation, Bitcoin is a “subversive idea.” Bitcoin is an experiment in social organization that doesn’t play by the rules of the state or by the conventions of modern society. The momentum behind this movement is likely to grow, especially if governments validate the concerns of its proponents with further debt monetization or preferential bailouts in the event of another global financial downturn. In short, Bitcoin is not going away, and it is incumbent upon all of us to understand the message that it is here to deliver.

The inspiration for this conversation derives from a theme captured in William Strauss and Neil Howe\'s Generational Theory, also known as the Fourth Turning, where the authors describe a four-stage cycle of social moods associated with recurring generational archetypes, which they call "turnings.” These include: "The High", "The Awakening", "The Unraveling," and "The Crisis." The question we explore in this conversation is: “are we at the fourth turning, and if so, what does this mean for the type of change we can expect to see in the coming decades?”\xa0 All of this leads to a discussion about digital currency in a multi-polar world where the power of governments to maintain the global order is diminished and where corporations and the private sector may gain an opening to provide alternative forms of money in support of global trade and commerce. Where does bitcoin fit in this world? What about alternative protocols and currencies? Will governments even allow them? Can they stop them or will they welcome them and does this point the way towards a path that will lead inexorably towards truly global money? As always, subscribers to our Hidden Forces Patreon page can access the overtime to this week’s episode, which includes a continuation of our conversation about digital currencies, but also a discussion about central bank policy at the Fed, the ECB, and the BOJ, as well as a discussion about economic indicators and what Raoul relies on most for his own projections about where we are in the business cycle.

This episode also includes a series of in-depth discussions about the long legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, identitarian narratives, three-body problems, the challenge of making accurate predictions, and ‘The Great Bitcoin Epic.\' Ben Hunt’s background and career path have been anything but ordinary. He received his Ph.D. in Political Science from Harvard, co-founded multiple tech companies, and managed his own billion-dollar hedge fund. When he isn’t busy writing about market narratives or indeterminant models, you can find him tending to his horses, gathering a fresh basket of eggs, or engaging in other chores on his family farm in Connecticut. The main themes from Epsilon Theory that we focus on in this conversation include the three-body problem, as well as Ben Hunt’s writings on narrative and the power that comes from shaping how people think about the world. This leads to a variety of discussions about various market phenomena, including a unique, thoughtful, and illuminating conversation on bitcoin – its culture, the narrative of bitcoin, how that narrative emerged, how it has evolved, and how it informs the price of bitcoin.\xa0Below are time codes for this episode: 06:45 How Markets Changed After March 2009 10:33 The Story that Changed the World in the Summer of 2012 12:24 No Fundamentals for Markets Anymore 15:54 The Three-Body Problem 27:02 Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Behavior 32:14 Turning Capital Markets into Political Utilities 34:45 Origins of Fed Communication 39:04 Forward Guidance and the Loss of Market Resilience 40:40 Informational Feedback at the Fed 43:50 Inflation vs. Deflation Narrative 46:26 The Role of Central Banks 49:11 Bear, Lehman, and the Banking Mafia 53:19 Shitcoin US Dollars 58:15 Facebook Libra and Censorship Embracing Coins 1:05:59 The New Bitcoin Narrative\xa0 1:08:01 Comparing Development Models for the Internet and Crypto 1:09:16 Culture of Bitcoin: Tech vs. Finance 1:14:13 Loss of Faith in Government \xa0 Producer & Host: Demetri Kofinas Editor & Engineer: Stylianos Nicolaou Subscribe & Support the Podcast at http://patreon.com/hiddenforces Join the conversation on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter at @hiddenforcespod', 'chan_desc': 'Demetri Kofinas interviews some of the most brilliant minds in science, technology, finance, politics, and culture as he uncovers the underlying forces driving the most powerful changes we see in the world.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/cb/e1/e0/cbe1e072-1600-8313-a81b-b7d9a7c52ffc/mza_6923871940200705817.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-02-12'}}

The answer may be to not focus on the goal at all, but instead to create a system to reach that goal.\xa0 Today on Debt Free in 30, I want to explain why, in most cases, systems are better than goals.\xa0 | In over 20 years of helping Canadians eliminate their debt, I've yet to hear a single client say they chose to have debt problems. Debt accumulates over time and then it becomes an even bigger problem when you lose your job, become ill or get divorced. But for many of my clients, despite knowing that the cause of their money troubles was beyond their control, they still blamed themselves for their financial woes.\xa0 So, how does one overcome self-blame to achieve debt relief? On today’s special rebroadcast episode we talk with Shannon Lee Simmons, author of Living Debt-Free: The No-Shame, No-Blame Guide to Getting Rid of Your Debt about how negative feelings towards debt can create more debt and strategies that can put you in the right direction when dealing with your debt. | When used correctly, a credit card is a helpful tool to build your credit history, and it's a safer than carrying cash. However, when mismanaged, a credit card can quickly become one of the most expensive borrowing options, leading to serious debt trouble. For many of our clients, credit card debt is the second biggest debt they carry. To help you avoid the common pitfalls that come with owning a credit card, on this special rebroadcast episode I talk with Diane Cunha, one of our certified credit counsellors. She shares tips for using credit wisely to avoid debt problems.\xa0 We discuss billing cycles, due dates and grace periods, and we have 8 tips for avoiding credit card debt. | It’s August, and we are rebroadcasting our most downloaded episodes of the last year, with a new introduction, and this one has opera! How do you stay on top of your finances when your income differs from one month to the next? Chris Enns is an opera-singer and a fee-only financial planner specializing in helping people who work in creative careers organize their sporadic salaries. He understands first-hand the struggles of applying traditional financial advice to a non-traditional cash-flow. Today Chris outlines his approach for managing cash-flow when you have variable or intermittent income. Chris explains that many people in the creative world avoid thinking about money because they believe they are just bad at it; they just don't get it so they think managing their finances is something they can't do. As 'money misfits' they don't feel they are part of the financial conversation. The terminology around money is foreign so they don't connect with the language. On today’s show Chris explains how creative people, or anyone with variable income, can manage their money. | A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the equity in your house. A HELOC is often presented as a great borrowing tool because unlike with credit cards or unsecured loans, you have access to a large amount of revolving cash at a lower interest rate. But what you probably don't know is that your bank can change the borrowing terms on your HELOC whenever they want. On today's special rebroadcast, we talk with Scott Terrio and he shares why you need to think twice before signing up for a home equity line of credit.\xa0", 'chan_desc': "Each week Doug Hoyes talks to industry experts about debt, money, and personal finance.

Frank has some excellent questions that Justin & I do our best to answer, even though we disagree on several of our answers: Should Frank get a 30-year or 20-year mortgage? Should he "buy down" the points in order to get a lower interest rate? Will a new roof increase the appraisal value? (the answer to this will surprise you) What is our current outlook on the market?

Knowledge pays. Putting a plan into motion that allows for you to take full advantage of what the market offers, while not happening overnight, is completely possible! I welcome back long time member, Micah, to update us on his journey in the world of trading. He first appeared on the show three years ago, so needless to say, much has happened in his journey since then. Micah is absolutely tearing it up and serves as a great source of motivation and inspiration in regards to what is possible with hard work and dedication. If you’re in need of some inspiration, then look no further. Let’s go! | I’m pretty sure this week’s guest is a long lost brother. When it comes to hustling and finding ways to make money in order to obtain a larger scale goal, Leon (better known as “Blew” in the community) is a monster. Those who enjoy making excuses for everything in life won’t enjoy Leon and his story, but if you are looking for some motivation and inspiration as you continue to grind in your goals, you’re going to love him. Leon works a full time job, so like many of you, his big goal is to best fit trading into his personal work schedule. If you are someone who wants to trade but also have a full time job, Leon has several insights and strategies that you can potentially use in your situation. He’s a man who doesn’t offer up excuses, but simply grinds things out, and this is what it’s all about. Let’s get to it! | One of the most dreaded rules in all of the markets: the pattern day trader rule (“PDT”). A classic example of government regulations thinking they are helping but in all actuality, creating a massive hassle for people. It is what it is, but there is some good news when it comes to this common issue. We welcome back “Reboot” (chatroom alias) to update us on his journey. A large part of his new journey has been escaping and working around the PDT rule. He takes us through all the adjustments and realizations he has made in order to place himself on a pathway to profitability that works for his account size, personal time schedule and overall goals. If you are someone who has a smaller trading account, then there will for sure be some nuggets of wisdom you will walk away with, so let’s get to it! | Those who succeed diversify. In many cases, people hear the word “diversify” and automatically think about diversifying their stock portfolio. This is certainly important and something you should be doing; however, there is also diversification of income streams. The more directions of income you can create for yourself, the more freedom you will experience. As a business owner, our guest Christopher understands this and is currently grinding away to use trading as another source of income. I was certainly inspired by his journey so far (especially as someone who lives in another country) and I’m confident you will be too. It’s time to get out there and focus on multiple streams of income. | Consistency is the magic pill to trading success and this episode’s guest has found that pill. Long time community member, best known as RDTrader12 (“RD”), has gone through many ups and downs in his journey. He’s shared many of them on previous appearances on the show, but now he’s back to give us an update on where he currently is on his journey. Not only do the markets shift, but so does life in general. Because of this, RD had to do some reworking of trade strategies he uses in order to best fit his life. Overall, RD is a shining example of what is possible when you find and establish consistency within your trading. Him and I go down several interesting rabbit holes of topic, so buckle up… it’s going to be a valuable ride! | I love bringing back previous guests to get updated on their journey. In this episode, Carl (who is very active in the chatroom) comes back to talk trading and share all the new developments in his trading. One of the great things about Carl is his willingness to be an open book of transparency. He shares with us a trade that resulted in a $100,000 plus loss and how it helped to shape and mold his current strategy. Fast forwarding to present day, Carl is seeing some great success due to the time and effort of narrowing down a strategy that works for him. He discovered the unique strategy from other members of the community, but as it should be (and needs to be), he fine tuned it to fit into his personal risk tolerance. We talk about that and much more, so let’s go! | Trading is a massive mind game puzzle that must be figured out in order to establish long term consistency. The first piece of the puzzle is becoming self-aware. If you are not able to do this, then all else will crumble around you. My guest from the community, Lisa, is a great example of what the journey of becoming self-aware looks like. I really enjoyed her perspective on things and how she was totally honest with the mistakes she made and her regrets. I respect here for locking her ego away and shooting straight (pun intended) with me about the things she wish she wouldn’t have done. This is definitely an opportunity to learn (free of charge) from someone else’s mistakes and regrets so you can keep yourself focused on the things that actually matter. So, let’s get to it! | I’m all for physical labor. Sure, it is something you cannot do forever, but if you’re willing to do it while you are able, it’s a great way to give any longer term goals a jumpstart. I realize most people would love to just start sitting in a comfy office chair and never break a sweat, yet still make money, but the reality is, the odds are against that happening. My guest, Marty, is someone who I have nothing but respect for. He is someone who is doing whatever it takes to accomplish his big picture goal of becoming a consistent trader. In fact, in his daily work he is putting himself into situations that many people are not willing to do, which I find extremely inspiring. I know the saying is way overused, but it applies here perfectly… the saying: where there is a will, there is a way. Marty has a will and he’s definitely putting that to use to find a way. | I’m flying solo in this week’s episode as I wanted to focus solely on an issue that I see constantly arising for traders. The business of trading presents a constant struggle of both mind and strategy, but when you are new to the markets, this struggle can feel like climbing Mt. Everest. Thanks to a recent article that is grounded in science and research, we are given some extremely practical insights into why trading can be such a challenge when you are first getting started. I’ll be honest, it was nice to be able to say, “Hey, this is not my opinion, but rather what research has discovered” when explaining how it all pertains to trading. If you find yourself struggling as a trader and not being able to quite reach the consistency that you want, then there are several items in this podcast that will open your eyes and point you in the right direction. Let’s go! | One of the most revealing questions a newer trader can ask is: but WHY? This shows someone’s desire to want to be more than a blind sheep trader. With all due respect, if you believe the markets are as easy as “following hot stock tips”, then your current status is that of a blind sheep. No worries! I started off the same way and it can be corrected, but Step #1 is first just acknowledging you’re a blind sheep. My guest, Aaron, is still pretty new to the community, but he’s taking all the right steps to put himself in the best possible position to succeed. The other things I really like about Aaron is his ability to take “hard” feedback and not get all offended or triggered. Too many times people hear something a bit on the hard side and get all offended, but in Aaron’s case, he took the feedback as it was intended and rolled with it as any adult and serious trader would. I really enjoyed my time with Aaron and I’m sure you will to, so let’s get to it!', 'chan_desc': 'Thanks for checking out the ClayTrader Stock Trading Reality Podcast.

This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “Why sell a put instead of buy a call?” And I think the answer to this question is actually relatively straightforward, though I’m going to be making a lot of generalities in this podcast. There’s a lot of differences and nuances in different option expiration timelines and strike prices that you would use for the selling of a put or the buying of a call, so again, I’m just talking in generalities here, but the reason that you would sell a put option instead of a call option, number one, is that the put option as an option selling position has an implied volatility premium edge already baked into the contract. It’s this idea that we continue to talk about here at Option Alpha which is that implied volatility at the time that you enter a contract is typically overstated long-term. And so, when you’re selling options, you immediately have a pricing advantage compared to an option buying strategy. Even if they are relatively the same payoff diagram, but one is buying options, one is selling options, you would have a little bit more of an edge to the option selling side. When it comes to buying a call option, I think the biggest downside to buying a call option is that you have to get both the direction of the stock right and the magnitude of the move or the magnitude of the move in implied volatility right in order to profit and I think that’s really, really hard to do. When you setup a put option and you’re selling a put option especially one that’s close to at the money or out of the money, you have a high probability trade in your favor, you don’t have to get the direction totally right. In fact, you can be wrong in the direction and the stock can actually fall. As long it doesn’t fall below your strike price, then you still could make money on the trade. I think to me, it comes down to this idea that when we reduce our upside potential as we would do if we sold a put option, we immediately get a higher probability of success, more likely outcome of a profitable trade and this is hard for people to sometimes grasp because what they look for is they look for these trades that have low risk and high reward, but what they don’t factor in is the low probability of success that those trades have on an ongoing basis. Again, just talking in generalities here, but hopefully this helps out. As always, if you guys have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “Can you sell and buy a stock the same day?” The simple answer to this question is yes. You can sell and buy a stock in the same day. That would be what’s referred to as a day trade. Day trades happen in the exact same day. A lot of people actually think that day trades happen over the course of a couple of days, but that’s not actually the real definition of a day trade as it relates to how brokers are going to see you. When you actually buy and sell stock the same day, you make a day trade. You just have to be aware of the different pattern day trading rules that many brokers have and pattern day trading rules are basically rules setup in place to make sure that people who are day trading, who are making trades in and out of a security the same day have enough capital to withstand the fluctuations in the market and the liquidity to cover positions if they go bad. Again, the answer to this question is yes. You can buy and sell stock the same day, but that might flag you as a pattern day trader. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s just something that lets the brokers know that you are a day trader and that you should have enough capital usually around $25,000 in your account to continue day trading on an ongoing basis. Hopefully this helps out. As always, if you guys have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, I want to talk about why I’ve been lately referring to myself as a volatility spread trader because I do think that option sellers are volatility spread traders and this actually comes about because I’ve said this time and time again, but I have a really, really tough time trying to explain to people what I do when they ask. I’m not a teacher. I don’t work for the government. I’m not a police officer, right? It’s very easy for people to usually explain what they do to people, but when people ask me around town or if I’m in some social setting and people ask me what I do, it’s very hard for me to explain what I do. I just trade options. But lately, I’ve kind of thrown them through a loop and I talk about being a volatility spread trader and I thought this was interesting because I was trying to explain to somebody the other day outside of a wedding what we try to do at Option Alpha, like what is our edge, what are we trying to do and ultimately, it’s just this. It’s just trying to capture a spread between different volatility prices basically, the implied volatility price and then the realized volatility that happens closer to expiration. I think as option sellers, that’s really what we do. That could be our title if you will, is volatility spread traders. We’re trying to trade the spread between two opposing price structures and trying to make a profit with the differential between them or the margin between them. This would be no different than a house flipper who buys a house at a low price and fixes it up and sells it at a higher price or would be different than any other business that buys something and their cost of goods and cost of input is lower than what they can sell it for at a profit. It’s just a margin. It’s just the spread that we’re trying to capture and in this case, I think as option sellers, we have to realize that our true and real edge still lies in volatility, the pricing of volatility and the differential between what’s implied, what people think is going to happen right now and what actually happens when we get closer to expiration and the markets kind of play out their situation. I think it’s interesting, so let me know if you guys like this or not. Anyways, until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “When can you sell a long straddle?” The basis for this question comes from a member who basically asked, “If I have a long straddle position that’s already on where they bought a call option and a put option at the same strike price, same expiration date, when can I sell out of that position, remove the position from my account, take profits or take losses or basically just exit the position altogether?” And the answer to this question is you can sell it back at anytime. You can sell a long straddle back to the market at any time up until the day that it stops trading which is basically right at the expiration date. Now, again, a lot of people get confused here because they’re trading both a European or American-style option contracts which only deal with the actual settlement of the option contract, but it has nothing to do with the fact that you can trade those contracts in the open market. Since all those contracts are tradable, you can just simply sell back your long straddle. If you have a profit or if you have a loss or you just want to exit the position, you can sell it back in the open market and remove the position by just simply reversing the original entry trade. And so, in this case, what you would do is you would sell the call option and sell the put option that you have at the same strike, at the same expiration date and close the position. Hopefully this helps out. As always, if you guys have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “What are the types of options?” Option contracts come in a couple of different types. It’s actually really not that complicated to understand once you get down into the terminology. But there’s basically two main types of option contracts and then there’s two varieties on top of that. That’s what I would call them, is notorieties within those two option contracts. The two main types are call options and put options. Call options give the option buyer the right, but of course, never the obligation to purchase the underlying shares or asset at a predetermined strike price in the future by a specified day which is usually referred to as the expiration date. This is as opposed to put option contracts which gives the option buyer the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset or shares at a predetermined price, the strike price by a specified date in the future, again, the expiration date. The only difference here between call options and put options is what they’re actually doing at expiration. If you buy a call option, you have the right, but not the obligation to buy stock. If you buy a put option, you have the right, but not the obligation to sell stock. And again, this is both at a predetermined price often referred to as the strike price at which you strike a deal with the other party and a specified date which again, is the expiration date of these contracts. Now, within just these two contracts, you have two kind of varieties if you will and those are European-style and American-style option contracts. Now, most of the contracts that you’ll be trading especially if you trade equity index or equity contracts, are going to be American-style options which means that they can be exercised at any time before expiration. This is important to understand because it doesn’t necessarily mean that you will be exercised if your option contract goes in the money. It just means that the option contracts can be exercised if you so choose as the option buyer or you should understand this on the other side if you’re an option seller, that the buyer on the other side could if they so choose, exercise their option contract which basically means they’re converting the option from a contract into physical shares. They’re choosing to make the conversion before expiration. That’s what happens in what’s called American-style option contracts. Those are going to be your ETF, your stocks, basically most of your traditional options trading. The other side of it is what’s called European-style. European-style option contracts can only be exercised at expiration and this means that the conversion of actually physically converting an option contract into underlying stock whether it’s long or short, can only happen at the expiration date. Now, this is usually going to happen with index style options or in many cases, futures style options or commodity style options where that conversion actually just happens at expiration. The risk of assignment is basically none until you get to the actual expiration date. Now, again, this is all just regards to conversion of the option contract. What is more important is to understand that at any point, both European and American-style options can be traded and sold and bought in the open market. If you feel like you're running a position that has a high risk of assignment or if you’re worried about assignment, then you can just simply buy back or sell back your position to the open market and close the position. Again, what I’m talking about here with European versus American-style settlement is just what actually happens when somebody decides to convert the option contract into underlying shares. Hopefully this is a good little overview. Hopefully we did it well in less than four minutes basically. But again, there’s two types of options, calls and puts and then two kind of varieties on top of that which are European and American-style settlement options. It’s a good idea to understand the basics of all of these. Again, you can dive deeper into these in our options basic course right here on Option Alpha and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “How is premium of an option calculated?” The premium of an option contract is the price at which the option contract trades for and this is the price at which people will either buy or sell the contract to one another in the open market. Now, option contract’s premiums are basically comprised of two underlying pricing components and I’ll just talk about these two because we dive deeper into these inside of our free training and tracks on Option Alpha, so if you want to deep dive on this, you can definitely check those out. But the two components of an options price are intrinsic value and extrinsic value and these are basically the easiest way that you can understand how the option price is derived or how it’s calculated. The intrinsic value basically answers the question, “How much value does the contract have if it were to be exercised immediately?” For a call option contract, it would have intrinsic value if the strike price is below where the stock is trading right now and for a put option contract, it would have intrinsic value if the strike price is above where the stock is trading right now. And so, these contracts have intrinsic value. They have in the money value right now because if it was to be exercised immediately, you could generate a profit by converting the option contract to shares and then selling or buying the shares in the open market at the current price. The second component of an option’s price is what’s called extrinsic value. It’s all of the things that happen beyond today, all the way to expiration. I think of intrinsic value as things that are happening in the money right now and extrinsic value is all external things that are happening in the future. Extrinsic value is comprised of things like time decay, volatility, interest rate exposure, etcetera, etcetera. And so, these are all things that have a variable degree of fluctuation on the option contract’s price depending on how the market moves, how implied volatility moves up or down, how close we are to expiration and how fast we’re approaching expiration, how volatile interest rates are in the future, etcetera, etcetera. And so, as a result, these two components brought together create the option premium. Naturally, you can see that as option prices change, it’s potentially the result of many different things moving at the same time, the underlying stock price changing, volatility expectations for implied volatility changing, the days until expiration shortening or interest rate changes on the very long end of the pricing model starting to change in future. All of those things can have an impact on how an option price fluctuates during the day. Again, if you want to dive deep into this, we do have a course on it right here at Option Alpha. It’s our options pricing course and we really kind of dive deep into each of these components, so you understand it, but on the broad base, broad scale, that’s really how an option premium is calculated with the intrinsic plus the extrinsic value smashed together. Hopefully this helps out. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “How do you write a put option?” Writing or selling a put option contract is actually pretty easy. The first thing you have to do is you have to make sure that you’re with a broker that allows for this to be done in your account. Typically, that means that you have to be doing it in a margin account. You can’t sell a naked put option or write a naked put option in an IRA or a retirement account. But if you are in a regular margin trading account and you wanted to sell a put option, all you simply need to do is find the expiration period that you want to sell the option in and choose the strike price of the put option that you want to sell and after that, it’s basically very simple. You create the order to actually sell that option contract and collect the additional premium that comes in from selling that contract. In exchange, you’re going to be putting up what’s called margin. And so, margin is just basically a way to start to cover some of the risk associated with the account and with that trade that you’re making and that’s a way for the broker to know that you have enough capital to back up this trade in case things do move against you, in this case with a put option, in case the stock actually moves down against your position. Put options are a great way to trade stock. It’s a wonderful stock replacement strategy for many people. It’s a very easy one that they can use as they start transitioning over to options trading, but again, it’s actually very easy to do in your account if you have the right broker approval level and you’re trading in the right account type. Hopefully this helps out. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “Is investing in options a good idea?” And so, this kind of dovetails on yesterday’s podcast, but of course, investing in options is a really good idea. In fact, that’s why we’re here. That’s the whole mission of Option Alpha, is to help more people understand not only what options trading is, but how they can invest in options trading. Not just day trade options because that’s not what we’re about. We’re about investing in options as a business, as a source of income moving forward, as a source of capital and wealth preservation and capital appreciation for your portfolio because options trading is a very profitable way to invest in the market and it’s definitely more profitable than using stocks from a capital perspective, from a return perspective, from a volatility perspective as long as you know how to use option contracts appropriately and to control the risk. I think one of the key things for me about options trading that I always try to tell people right out of the gate when I talk about what I do or what we do here at Option Alpha is that options trading gives you a lot more flexibility in when you can make money in the market environment. You see, most people are always just assuming that you can only make money if stocks or positions, whatever they have, bonds, real estate, REITs, whenever goes up in price. That’s what they’re accustomed to. That’s what they’re conditioned to understand. They have to buy at a low priced and they have to sell at a high price and there’s basically nothing in between. Bull markets are good. Bear markets are absolutely terrible because you can’t make money in those environments. What we try to teach people obviously is that in options trading, you can create an option payoff diagram that makes money in whatever environment you think might be coming next. Do you think that the market’s going to go up? Do you think it’s going to go down? Do you think it’s going to stay range bound? Do you not even know where it’s going to go, but you think it’s going to go really high or really low very quickly? You can build option strategies that basically allow you to profit from these market environment expectations in multiple directions, not just in a one-directional move higher in the underlying shares. That is very powerful because what it could do for many people is take a potential 50% drawdown that they would’ve had in stocks and reduce it to a 20% drawdown. Now, they still might lose money in a strategy, but taking a 20% haircut versus a 50% haircut is something I would do any day of the week because it would allow you to then re-grow your capital from a much higher level and that’s some of the stuff that I think options trading can do for people. I think it can help both with higher returns when things are really good and I think it can help with lowering drawdowns when things get really hairy and things get very volatile in the markets. That to me is really what this thing is all about. It’s not free risk. It doesn’t come without a little bit of pain and a little bit of volatility and drawdowns in your account. There’s no free lunch here, but it will give you I think a lot more choices, a lot more options (no pun intended) on how you can invest your money. Hopefully this helps out. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again at Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “Are options more profitable than stocks?” The answer to this question is of course, 100% yes. Options trading is more profitable than stock trading if and only if you know how to manage the risk that’s associated with options trading. Where most people completely fail in options trading is that they don’t understand or they don’t know how to manage the risk associated with a leveraged contract like an option contract. Remember, options contracts are leveraged derivatives on the underlying shares of stock. That means that they might seem very cheap and very small in price, but the leverage that they carry means that they have a massive amount of risk if you do not position size and spread your account out appropriately. And this is what we try to do here at Option Alpha, is make sure that people understand the risk that are associated with options trading, not just all the upside benefits because what we find in back-testing and what other people have found, the CBOE, AQR and a hundred other different resources out there, is that options trading when used effectively is way more profitable, reduces volatility, reduces drawdowns, moves our P&Ls compared to underlying stock trading. The problem is always just how do you manage the leverage and the risk associated with contracts. What we try to tell people to do is generally do a couple of things. You keep your position sizes really small, you have a lot of uncorrelated liquid ticker symbols and then you keep a lot of cash on hand or you use some sort of hedging strategy. You do those general things as well as using an option selling strategy, you’ll probably be okay. There’s obviously a little bit more to it than that and that’s where our free courses come in, but I think that’s really the gist of what you should do. When you see people typically blow up their account, it’s probably because they over-allocated, they were trading one or a few symbols or they didn’t have enough cash on hand, so every position that they had was maxed out and they had no cash to basically fall back on. Hopefully this helps out. Again, this is an easy one for us because obviously, we’re big time into options trading. If options were not as profitable as stocks, maybe our name would be Stock Alpha, but it’s not. It’s Option Alpha because options are way more profitable than stocks if you know how to use them right. Hopefully this helps out. As always, if you guys have any questions, let me know and until next time, happy trading. | Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from Option Alpha and welcome back to the daily call. Today, we’re going to answer the question, “What is the best options trading strategy?” Well, surprise, surprise, there is no best options trading strategy. If you clicked on this or if you thought you’re going to listen to this and we were going to tell you that there’s a unicorn option strategy that works in all environments, in all time periods, in all market situations, then you would be dead wrong because there isn’t, because option strategies are dynamic by nature. They are a trade-off between risk and reward and that means that not all people are willing to accept the same risk in order to achieve the same reward. Right there, we know that there’s a lot of different strategies that are going to work differently for different folks just based on the risk profile and how the option strategy might work moving forward. What we can tell you though is that what you should look for in options trading strategy is a broad perimeter stability with the results. You should not be looking for things that are the absolute best in one particular testing period because that randomly could’ve been just the best by the time that you end that back-testing period. This is why we often tell people especially inside the Option Alpha community that we never necessarily go after the strategy that made the most money or had the highest return because that particular data point, that particular time period when we ended the strategy testing could’ve just been a fluke that one strategy rose to the top for that microsecond of a time period. What we are generally looking for is broad-based perimeter stability. We are looking for things that generally work across lots of time periods, lots of different underlying tickers, lots of different market scenarios. What we find is that generally, selling options works across many different time periods, many different environments and that goes for selling credit spreads, selling single options, selling straddles and strangles and iron butterflies. We find that generally, it works to be an option seller. We also find generally that it works to have wider wings or to take on more risk as an options trader when you can control it with position size. That generally works out better than if you were to trade strategies that had more narrow wings or had smaller spreads. Again, that doesn’t mean that one or the other is necessarily good or bad. They both generally make money, but we’ve generally found in testing and back-testing that wider spreads, wider wings returns higher values, more consistent cash flow, more stable P&Ls and so, that’s what we go after. Now, in every environment, there’s going to be something that works a little bit better. When implied volatility is high versus low, there might be a strategy that works just a little bit better than in other and this is where you start to tilt what you do, but you don’t do a 360. Maybe in some environments, you sell the 30 Delta options and in some environments, you sell the 50 Delta options. But you’re still selling options. You’re still building the same general strategy. You’re just tweaking or tilting how you go about using that strategy based on the market fundamentals or the market underlying environment. Again, the answer here is that there is no unicorn strategy for trading. What everyone should be looking for is broad-based perimeter stability with option trades. You should not be looking for something that works right now in this environment or even over the past 10 or five years of a back-testing period because it could be that that top strategy just randomly fell to the top or that a strategy that was top two randomly fell to the top two during that perfect environment when you ended the strategy testing. You should be looking for stuff that has broad-based stability, that has great P&Ls, great metrics over a long period of time in different asset classes and ticker symbols. That I think you will find is a much easier way to trade and definitely much less stressful moving forward. Hopefully this helps out.

Thus, the dividend amount payable is also impacted by variations in the inflation rate, as it is based upon the principal value of the bond. It may fluctuate up or down. Repayment at maturity is guaranteed by the U.S. government and may be adjusted for inflation to become the greater of the original face amount at issuance or that face amount plus an adjustment for inflation.A bond ladder, depending on the types and amount of securities within the ladder, may not ensure adequate diversification of your investment portfolio.

On August 14 (one month ago) the Dow was below 25,500.  At press time this week, the Dow is at 27,200, so nearly a 2,000 point recovery in one month (and back to the market level we were at before the re-provocation of the trade war leaving July and entering August).

She believes that you can make money as a beginning blogger, even when you don't have much of a portfolio. Diana explains that it's more about how you tell your story and how you paint your brand, rather than the numbers. Tell brands your plan for the future and how you plan to be the go-to source for your city or country. Start with writing reviews for hotels and use this as a starting story/portfolio.3 - The value of blogging coursesBoth Diana and Julie agree that blogging courses help kickstart blogging growth because of all the new information you learn.

The first thing Emily talks about is how they took baby steps - they didn't make much money in the first 2 years of blogging. Now, they make most of the money from selling ad space on their blog to ad companies like Mediavine. They focus on SEO, social media and user intent to help their articles rank on Google. They now make $6,500 per month just from their blog.2 - The day to day of a travel bloggerEmily and Berty spend half their time travelling, half their time working. When they're travelling, it's very intense and consists of several day hikes, a lot of photography and exploring. They then get home, rest for a few days and curate all the content. At home they work a 9 to 5, but on their own time. They work on their blog and any other projects they have going on with clients.3 - The secret factor to blogger successEmily believes the secret factor to blogger success is loving what you blog about. The first couple of years the blog won't make any money, so you need to be willing to blog for free at first. This can get frustrating and difficult if you're only doing it for the money.

She decided to go into the flower business since she saw that it was a product that worked well, and that could get her away from sexism in the workplace as well as add value to the community.2 - How Emily kickstarted her flower businessEmily's flower business is her way to be part of her community and solve a problem using farm land. She didn't have many resources when she started, so she started a farm on a small land while she was still working as a journalist. Most people did not take her seriously, but she kept working on her business and had enough money to recirculate through the company. She now has 5 employees and sells hundreds of thousands of flowers every year.3 - How she manages her money and her future goalsThe positive aspect of working as a journalist is that Emily was used to not making much money. She told herself that she could always wait tables if her business didn't work out. She had $10,000 saved up and inherited another $10,000. With that, she was able to kickstart her business and take it each day at a time. She was responsible with her money, and knew that quitting her job would not mean losing all her savings immediately.Questions? Like or dislike? Leave us a comment!Want to support the podcast?

What introversion really means The turning point of his career Starting his FI journey His current mindset with regards to FI How having a child changed his path to FIEnjoy this chat with Drew, and please subscribe to us in iTunes if you enjoyed it!Show notes and links from today's episode Blog: FI Introvert Drew on Twitter Book: Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop TalkingKey takeaways from our chat with Drew1 - Why introverts have a larger desire for FIDrew notes that most of the big FI bloggers in the community are introverts. He says that the reason for this is because the desire for freedom as an introvert is much greater than for extroverts. Introverts want to be free from office small talk, from sales meetings and from feeling controlled by other people - so the need to quit their job is much more urgent.2 - How Drew used his introversion to improve his careerGrowing up as an introvert, Drew wasn't able to understand why he was different from others. People thought he was a terrible co worker and that he was arrogant. At the end of the day he had little energy and disliked his day to day work. After reading 'Quiet' by Susan Cain, he understood that he was an introvert and that he could use this to understand his limits and plan his day in advance. He was able to give more time to himself and have his own schedule - this boosted his career, his confidence and personal relationships.3 - Mindset as a FI goalDrew and his family have $1 million in investment assets. They just had a son and Drew enjoys his career, so the family isn't planning on retiring early any time soon. They've decided that their FI goal is a mindset, not a number. Once they reach the mindset of spending more time at home and living in a lower cost of living area, then they will consider themselves officially FI.Questions? Like or dislike?

As they reach FI, they're planning on spending even less. Thanks to their real estate properties, they're pretty much already there. The income they get every month more than covers their expenses (making over $72,000 per year) and with that money they're planning on living comfortably without working.2 - Their real estate strategyThey currently own 10 units, having bought their first one in 2017. They buy triplexes and duplexes, and their first one was with a 25% deposit down and a 30 year mortgage. They invested in an excellent area and are now enjoy the 2% rule (where they make nearly 2% of the property every month). They set aside 10% for maintenance and 10% for property management, and so far it's been going pretty smoothly.3 - What it's like leaving their jobsThey're going through all the paperwork to finally leave their jobs and go travel. Their strategy is to first take a leave of absence from work - but with no plan of ever returning! They're moving abroad to Europe, specifically Cyprus and will have the freedom to do whatever they want.

There was (and still is) a high demand for English teachers and they quickly found well paid jobs with comfortable housing and schedules. This was their first step into the direction of working while travelling. They then quit their jobs and went on a 14 month travelling trip. When they got back to working, they decided to find a sustainable way to work and travel at the same time. This involved freelance writing, a travel blog and teaching ESL online.2 - How VIPKid worksVIPKid is a platform for native English speakers to teach English to kids in China. Teachers earn up to $22 per hour, and control their own teaching schedule. Depending on the timezone, teachers can choose to teach in evenings or early mornings, as well as full time on weekends. Rachel makes it clear that it's not a hard gig; lesson plans are made by the company, along with teacher's notes and questions to ask the student. VIPKid is certainly a legit and working side hustles for those who enjoy teaching.3 - Managing a schedule as an online English teacherThe biggest hurdle when teaching online and travelling at the same time is being in the right environment. Rachel and Sasha need to book Airbnbs in advance and make sure they have good internet and a quiet environment. Rachel adapts her schedule to teach certain hours during the day, and then work on other projects or do some travelling in her free time.

She explains that the key to making the travels as comfortable as possible was getting a puppy, not an adult dog, so she could train her early on to the van life. Since getting her puppy, Sydney's travelled all around the US and hasn't had any issues with her dog. She only goes where her dog can go, and has learnt how to deal with the smells that come with living in a small space with a dog. 🐶2 - Building up the perfect vanSydney has experience building up two vans for road tripping round the US. In the first van the materials cost around $8,000, and she had a family friend who was able to help with the fixing up. Her current and second van cost her $16,000 of material plus labour. Her monthly bills are around $2,000 per month, and she feels she has larger control on her spending. Depending on how much she makes that month, she can decide to slow down and travel less.3 - How Sydney makes money onlineSydney started blogging when she first started road tripping in the first van she was sharing with her partner. She blogs about van life and uses affiliate marketing, and also does some freelance web design to make money. All her skills are self taught and she attributes her success to her sheer determination to make full time van life possible.Questions? Like or dislike?

She started because she saw it as a fun outlet of creativity. She attributes her success to being very hands on, to her constant learning through Youtube and her genuine passion and interest. She made her own content and made sure to make friends with other artists, which completely immersed her into the world of food photography. Her Youtube channel also gave her exposure to a whole new set of audience, food bloggers and Youtubers, which further grew her business.2 - Having a financial cushion.Joanie was the sole breadwinner of a 2 children family when she decided to leave her job. With 9 months of expenses in the bank, she decided to focus on one thing only: getting her food photography business of the ground. Her and her husband also got serious about budgeting and knowing their numbers. They also refinanced their house in order to have more options, flexibility and less stress. This helped her focus on her food photography business and it's what gives her the huge amount of flexibility and freedom she has now.3 - Building passive income from a creative businessJoanie started off with her recipe blog, but this eventually branched into a Youtube channel, food photography coaching and consulting, as well as workshops and online courses. This has been her move towards increasing her passive income and away from exchanging time for money. Through large 500 people workshops and courses she also feels she'll be able to educate people on a deeper level and will be building a much more scalable business.

With the right mix of problem-solving tools, goal setting, determination and inspiring attitude, Dominique and his team believes that even the worst cases of credit, debt, and financial ruin can be resolved.  \xa0  His motto “Finances can be fun!” stands for his long-held conviction that becoming rich is a lifestyle choice that one has to learn to enjoy. Just like living with a healthier diet and exercise is difficult, but rewarding, improving your financial lifestyle can be just as fun in a productive and fulfilling way. He believes in the fact that “personal finance is personal” and that each case should be handled individually, respecting the uniqueness and different needs of clients to help them conquer the success they deserve. He treats all of his clients as if I’m providing the advice to his daughter. So, if I wouldn’t advise his daughter Olivia to take action, he wouldn’t tell you.

TREF provides access to an SEC-regulated & qualified platform to pool our resources in a transparent way. This allows the people an opportunity to finance urban redevelopment in our neighborhoods and combat the displacement of longtime residents and the destruction of our rich culture. Learn more about the current gentrification cycle by reviewing the Tulsa Real Estate Overview. In 2012, President Obama signed the Jobs Act that made this all possible and it was this legislation that eventually opened up real estate investment crowdfunding to non-accredited investors giving average Americans the ability to pool funds as a way to raise capital. TREF’s mission is to purchase quality real estate projects in distressed neighborhoods, fix them up to sell or buy and hold as rentals providing its investors with an 8% preferred return and 50% share in the profits.While TREF is the first Black-owned SEC-regulated investment fund, this is not the first time that our people have been self-sustaining. On June 1, 1921, the thriving Black Wall Street community in Tulsa, Oklahoma was destroyed. Today, 97 years later, we plan to rebuild ourselves through the Tulsa Real Estate Fund named in honor of that legacy.

The march toward commission-free trading has been happening in slow motion for decades, ever since the 1970\'s.My take on it is this - it\'s terrific news for investors, as it lowers the cost of being an investor and gaining access to markets. But is it a "game changer"? I don\'t think so. It\'s also important to note the link between market valuations and the ease of access. On a secular basis, US stocks have been valued higher as the average fund fee, commission fee and other costs have fallen.

Paradigmatic shifts in the business landscape, known as inflection points, can either create new, entrepreneurial opportunities (see Amazon and Netflix) or they can lead to devastating consequences (e.g., Blockbuster and Toys R Us). Only those leaders who can “see around corners”–that is, spot the disruptive inflection points developing before they hit–are poised to succeed in this market. Columbia Business School Professor and corporate consultant Rita McGrath contends that inflection points, though they may seem sudden, are not random. Every seemingly overnight shift is the final stage of a process that has been subtly building for some time. Armed with the right strategies and tools, smart businesses can see these inflection points coming and use them to gain a competitive advantage. Seeing Around Corners is the first hands-on guide to anticipating, understanding, and capitalizing on the inflection points shaping the marketplace. McGrath is a globally recognized expert on strategy, innovation, and growth with an emphasis on corporate entrepreneurship. A long-time member of the Columbia Business School faculty, she is recognized consistently as one of the top 10 management thinkers. McGrath’s best-selling book The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast as Your Business was recognized by Strategy+Business as the #1 business book of 2013. She is also a co-author of MarketBusters: 40 Strategic Moves that Drive Exceptional Business Growth (2005) and The Entrepreneurial Mindset (2000). | A T. Boone Pickens Memory with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio. | Want to deliver a pitch or presentation that grabs your audience’s ever-shrinking attention span? Ditch the colorful slides and catchy language. And follow one simple rule: Convey only what needs to be said, clearly and concisely, in three minutes or less. That’s the 3-Minute Rule. Brant Pinvidic and Michael Covel dig into the rule. Hollywood producer Brant Pinvidic has sold more than three hundred TV shows and movies, run a TV network, and helmed one of the largest production companies in the world with smash hits like The Biggest Loser and Bar Rescue. In his nearly twenty years of experience, he’s developed a simple, straightforward system that’s helped hundreds—from Fortune 100 CEOs to PTA presidents—use top-level Hollywood storytelling techniques to simplify their messages and say less to get more. Pinvidic proves that anyone can deliver a great pitch, for any idea, in any situation, so your audience not only remembers your message but can pass it on to their friends and colleagues. You’ll see how his methods work in a wide range of situations—from presenting investment opportunities in a biotech startup to pitching sponsorship deals for major sports stadiums, and more. | JetBlue Chairman Joel Peterson and Michael talk through the playbook for establishing and maintaining a culture of trust that breaks down the operational silos and CYA mentality that plague many organizations. Trust is the glue that holds an organization together. It turns deflection into transparency, suspicion into empowerment, and conflict into creativity. With it, a tiny company like John Deere grew into a worldwide leader. Without it, a giant corporation like Enron toppled. How does it feel to work for a firm where leaders and colleagues trust one another? Freed from micromanagement and rivalry, every employee contributes his or her best. Risk-taking and innovation become the norm. And, as Peterson notes, “When a company has a reputation for fair dealing, its costs drop: Trust cuts the time spent second-guessing and lawyering.” With The 10 Laws of Trust Expanded Edition in hand, you’ll be able to plant the seeds of trust—and reap the rewards of reputation, profits, and success. This fully expanded edition includes a powerful self-assessment tool for organizations to evaluate their culture of trust and discover areas for improvement. Peterson has also added rich new case studies and chapters on the theme of betrayal, including how to manage and guard against it. Biography: Joel Peterson is the chairman of JetBlue Airways and the founding partner of Peterson Partners, a Salt Lake City-based investment management firm. Joel is on the faculty at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University and has been since 1992. After three careers, four decades of marriage and seven kids, and demanding roles as CFO, CEO, chairman, lead director, adjunct professor, founder, author, entrepreneur and investor, Joel is often sought as a mentor and coach by leaders and aspiring leaders. | Paul Gulino believes in Hitchcock’s adage that “films are made on paper.” Although students may obsess about a film’s look, all of the visual elements, he says, function to enhance the story. And that, ultimately, comes from the mind of the screenwriter. In spite of the fact that there seems to be a screenwriter behind every corner (in California, at least), screenwriting is something of a lost art, Gulino maintains, having seen hundreds of flat screenplays as a story analyst for Showtime Entertainment. Honing his own skills through writing for the theater and practicing the craft as taught by Frank Daniel and Milos Forman, Gulino secured an agent with William Morris on the basis of his thesis script. With that “real world” confirmation in hand, Gulino went on to write and see produced features, plays and comedy sketches. Screenwriting, he says, isn’t a craft you can learn from a book. “The best way is to learn from someone who knows the craft, so you can see how theories can be applied to your own work.” There must be something to that. Or at least it’s worked for screenwriter Paul Gulino. Paul and Michael go on the film-making journey! | What\'s Old Is New with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio. | Is the American system of colleges and universities designed to protect the privileged and leave everyone else behind? Or can a college education today provide real opportunity to young people seeking to improve their station in life? The Years That Matter Most tells the stories of students trying to find their way, with hope, joy, and frustration, through the application process and into college. Drawing on new research, the book reveals how the landscape of higher education has shifted in recent decades and exposes the hidden truths of how the system works and whom it works for. And it introduces us to the people who really make higher education go: admissions directors trying to balance the class and balance the budget, College Board officials scrambling to defend the SAT in the face of mounting evidence that it favors the wealthy, researchers working to unlock the mysteries of the college-student brain, and educators trying to transform potential dropouts into successful graduates. With insight, humor, and passion, Paul Tough takes readers on a journey from Ivy League seminar rooms to community college welding shops, from giant public flagship universities to tiny experimental storefront colleges. Whether you are facing your own decision about college or simply care about the American promise of social mobility, The Years That Matter Most will change the way you think—not just about higher education, but about the nation itself. | This Trend Stuff Won\'t Die with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio. | An unconventional business book for the rebels and misfits--the Rare Breeds--who don\'t fit the traditional mold, offering an approach that\'s anything but business as usual. What if your biggest weaknesses are actually your greatest strengths? Sunny Bonnell and Ashleigh Hansberger, award-winning brand consultants and founders of Motto, bring their wisdom and insights to this radical "outside the box" business guide written specifically for the mavericks, oddballs, and visionaries they call Rare Breeds. While most advice guides encourage you to change your inherent characteristics to get the job, get the promotion, get the client, Bonnell and Hansberger identify a different approach: instead of trying to conform, march to the beat of your own drum. By following your own path, you\'ll find your success. They know this approach works based on their own experience. When these iconoclastic thinkers behind the company acclaimed by the Chicago Tribune and Forbes started their company, they didn\'t follow the rules of most leadership books and business school courses. "Instead of doing everything people told us we should be doing--be transactional, be conservative, be nice--we did the opposite. Instead of burying our innate vices--obsessive perfectionism, rebelliousness, weirdness--we made them our selling points." The result: a flourishing company that is the model for an entirely new approach to success. Rare Breeds don\'t get what they want by adapting to the conventional rules: instead, they use the traits often considered shortcomings as tools for creation and growth. Combining examples and practical tools, Bonnell and Hansberger identify seven vices-turned-virtues--Rebellious, Audacious, Obsessed, Hot-Blooded, Weird, Hypnotic, Emotional--to help disruptors and trailblazers discover their inner Rare Breed and tap into them to realize their full potential in work and life. Sunny Bonnell and Ashleigh Hansberger are the award-winning founders of Motto, one of the top branding and digital agencies for rule breakers and game changers. They’ve been featured on CBS News and Fox Business and in Entrepreneur, American Express, Chicago Tribune, Forbes, Inc., Huffington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and elsewhere. | The World Doesn\'t Care About You with Michael Covel on Trend Following Radio.', 'chan_desc': 'Bestselling author Michael Covel is the host of Trend Following Radio with 8+ million listens.

Don’t be. Do not believe for one second that it’s too late and there’d be too much competition. And don’t think a market downturn is a bad time to start. Actually, it can be a really great time to get started; but you need to take action. | My new book is finally here: REI Secrets–Daily Nuggets of Real Estate Investing Wisdom. The book is a compilation of short pieces from Joe’s podcasts that are meant to be inspirational and educational. Joe is charging only shipping and handling and selling it only via his website. He wants the book to go to his friends that are his listeners… people like you. | The Transaction Engineer, Eddie Raymond, is my guest today. Listen and find out why he has that name. Eddie lives in Atlanta and has been working in real estate since 2005.He took a chance and quit his job before he made his first deal. Eddie had to decide whether to attend 5 days of real estate training or keep a job driving forklifts. Quitting was the right thing to do. He’s never looked back.Eddie lost big in the last recession. Afterward, he began pursuing the abundant short sales that were available. Now he’s working virtually exclusively on wholesale lease options.He can’t believe how much money people have to put down on a house even though they cannot qualify for a bank loan. Eddie uses that angle in his marketing with the phrase, ‘no bank needed.’Eddie generally gets $10,000 to $15,000 for down payment. For tenant buyers who have less to put down, he may set the monthly rent a little higher. Home values are between $180,000 and $400,000.Homeowners are usually glad to hear from Eddie because they aren’t even aware that a lease option is possible. He skiptraces people advertising FSBOs and rentals and gets in touch using ringless text.Eddie always makes 3 types of offers on a property. He writes up a cash offer, lease option, and owner financing. That way the seller continues to feel in control of the sales process.With lease options, the tenant-buyer is in charge of maintenance and repairs. They have 7 days to get an inspection or otherwise assess the house’s condition. Once 7 days passes, it’s theirs to manage. | I teach people interested in pre-foreclosures to go in and offer cash. Frans Calderon answered a call I put out on social media to find people doing lease options who might want to appear on my show.When I learned what Frans does in the pre-foreclosure space, I jumped at the opportunity to interview him. His approach is so totally contrary to my thinking that I had to have him explain.Frans is originally from Colombia, and now lives in Charleston, SC, which he loves. He was a police officer in his home country… a dangerous job. In 2003, he read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and got the message that it was time to make a change.The message was financial freedom. At one point, the book suggested making a list of assets. Frans made a list of his and realized he had no financial assets, only his belongings like clothes and furniture.He purchased his first property in 2009. The process was a bit strange, but you’ll hear how the strangeness benefited Frans. He rented the house out for 2 years; then moved into it himself.He got a HELOC on that house and used the proceeds to buy more. He also continued learning about real estate and started practicing new strategies like subject to, lease options and wholesaling.Frans spent 10 years working at Boeing in Charleston area while he continued to buy properties to rehab and rent. Two years ago, when his passive income equaled his salary, he quit his job.He estimates his strategy is 60% flips, some holds and some lease options. Frans has found that networking pays off… so much so that he is now president of a new Charleston REIA.Frans recently met a seller who was very near foreclosure. She was a single mother and sick; a woman that had hit a real rough patch. Frans wanted to keep her from ruining her credit.It took $20,000 to reinstate her loan. Frans had a retail buyer who wanted to buy from him, but had a credit issue because he was a self-employed house painter. This is the model tenant buyer for a sandwich lease option.That buyer met Frans to see the house. He wanted to buy the house before Frans put it on the market. Even though he had no credit, the buyer was able to put $40,000 down on the house.Since the buyer knows people in construction, the home has been remodeled and looks great. He and his family are very happy there. Frans made a good profit while doing good for the seller and the buyer. | Chris Kleewein has been a real estate investor for a long time. His first buy was a duplex in which he lived in one side and rented out the other. Chris lives in St. Louis and once shared an office with me.Chris worked for a while in the corporate world, but always knew he wanted to be in real estate. He remembers watching Carlton Sheets in an infomercial when he was in high school.Chris is a big believer in partnering with other investors and mentoring people who are starting out. He works with a few students at a time in St. Louis, and regularly partners with his students on deals... | I met Ryan Enk a couple of years ago at an internet conference. He’s been doing lease options and that’s what we’ll talk about today. He lives in New Orleans on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.Ryan was a teacher there when Hurricane Katrina came through. He knew he needed to do something else to make more money for his growing family that now includes 5 boys... | This will be a short episode… think of an ‘In My Car’ podcast. I’m actually in my car anyway. But really, this is a brief intro for a Q&A video on YouTube about Z-Code, my new course.Z-Code teaches students how to find leads on Zillow, which means finding truly motivated leads. Why would anyone list property there if they weren’t ready to sell?.. | I’m happy to be introducing my new course, Z-Code. This is the 2 nd podcast about it and we will address another question we’ve received from students who’ve already taken this exciting marketing class.Z-Code teaches how to find leads on Zillow. It’s easy to get leads and Zillow leads are free. You’ll have a steady supply of leads to market to and follow up with, so you’d better be closing some deals... | I worked with a few friends to develop a simple marketing course called the Z-Code. The Z-Code teaches students how to find leads on Zillow, and Zillow leads are free leads, right? Some students have already taken the course and are very enthusiastic about what they learned.Z-Code questions… what are they? They’re questions that have been asked by students who’ve taken the course. You’ll hear some of the questions over the next few podcast episodes... | Today’s podcast is my attempt to help you get prepared for the market changes that are coming. I went to Los Angeles last night to speak about lease options and am driving home from the airport now.The reason this is coming up now is I had time to talk some of the investors at the Los Angeles event.

In this case at least 8%, which is more than the 6% annual average in the S&P 500 since 2015.It\'s not just about earnings growth, however. Investment-grade balance sheets, higher return on equity, high margins, and stocks that didn\'t lose material value during the Great Recession are additional factors that go into Lott\'s screen. Right now he has a list of "about 100 names" that he considers "best in class" and an additional list of 200 second-tier stocks.The critical decision is choosing an entry point for investing. Here Lott tracks prices to identify when stocks trade cheaply "to their typical trading patterns." He ranks the 100 names on a daily basis using "four or five metrics" and then does more fundamental work "to figure out if this is something I want to own."Right now, Lott sees markets "kind of at an inflection point" where there could soon be a shift from growth back to value stocks. One of his favorite ideas right now is Wabtec Corp. (WAB), a manufacturer of locomotives and locomotive parts that recently acquired GE Transportation.

"I export fundamentals for thousands of global stocks, then I rank these stocks in several metrics simultaneously, using a computer program." The metrics are determined by the strategy -- Heeg has seven that are based on academic research.A simple metric that has improved results is to filter stocks by liquidity.

"What that basically means is I\'m not going to choose the cheapest operator in the space," he says. "I\'m probably going to pay up for the best of breed operator, even though they might trade at a premium valuation to peers."One common mistake investors make is to rely on valuation metrics for a margin of safety. A complete investment thesis focuses on the bigger picture, says Lin. "It\'s not the valuation that tends to ruin an investment thesis, it\'s really everything else -- bad management, high debt, bad financial results." Focusing on the best of breed operators is a good place to start.Topics covered:2:00 minute mark - Description of investment strategy3:15 - How do you choose investments?5:00 - Current view of the market6:00 - Other than valuation, what separates low from high quality?9:30 - Concerns about market/portfolio14:30 - What gives you confidence about your approach?16:00 - Favorite idea (SPG)29:30 - Probably of a Facebook breakup (FB)30:00 - Bullish on Amazon (AMZN)35:00 - Change of heart on Alibaba (BABA) | Alpha Gen Capital joins the Marketplace Roundtable podcast to discuss his approach to investing in closed-end funds, as plays out on his Marketplace service, Yield Hunting.

She's also a Columbian through and through as she holds a BA from Columbia College and an MBA from Columbia Business School. Jenny is a member of the advisory board of the Heilbrunn Center for Graham & Dodd Investing and a great mentor to me. While working towards her MBA, Jenny joined the first cohort of students to take the value investing class offered by Bruce Greenwald. After being introduced to value investing, it became clear to Jenny that to be successful she needed to develop a skill set that would allow her to assess businesses, independent of conventional wisdom. To gain that perspective, she first went to work for McKinsey & Company. After leaving McKinsey, Jenny worked alongside investing legend Bob Bruce, before ultimately co-founding her firm. On this episode, Jenny and I discuss her studies at Columbia Business School as a student in the first cohort of the value investing class, her early career with value investing legends, how Summit Street was started, how Jenny developed her investment philosophy, her approach to data analysis, the impact of the growth of the passive investing industry on active managers, and so much more! \xa0\xa0 Key Topics:\xa0  The events program for the Heilbrunn Center during the 2019/2020 academic year (1:03) Why you should sign up for the center’s email newsletter (6:15) Jenny’s experience as a student in the first cohort of the value investing class (8:26) The structure of the first value investing class (10:20) Why Jenny decided to work for McKinsey instead of in investing (11:33) How Jenny’s background in psychology helps her as a value investor (12:56) The impact of Jenny’s time at McKinsey (13:28) Summit Street’s investment philosophy (15:42) How business’ operational efficiency contributes to investors’ downside projection (16:37) Bob Bruce’s pitch to Jenny (17:23) The importance of being able to read financials and let the numbers tell you a story (19:20) Bob Bruce’s advice on building up your knowledge about select companies (21:12) The opportunities and crises in the late 1990s market (22:25) The parallels between the investment landscape of the 1990s and now (24:19) The qualities that Jenny believes sets value investors apart from others (25:37) Why Jenny thinks being a good value investor starts with a certain type of person (27:23) How Summit Street was launched (28:32) The evolving focus of Summit Street (29:13) Jenny’s approach to data analysis and searching for investment ideas (32:47) Jenny’s perspective on the changing significance of classic value metrics (34:41) How Jenny use cash flow as a valuation metric to avoid value traps (37:29) Why you should focus on the numbers in assessing the management team of a potential investment (42:26) “Every stock that we buy has something working against it” (44:23) Why Jenny considers leverage and return on invested capital as critical quality measurements (46:17) Summit Street’s qualitative and quantitative valuation methodology (49:25) Summit Street’s research and evaluation process for potential investments (52:53) Why models are so useful for testing your assumptions (55:36) Jenny’s approach to exiting a position (58:59) The importance of using guardrails to force investment discipline (1:02:35) Jenny’s opinion on the growth of passive investing and its effect on the practice of value investing (1:05:29) Why Jenny believes that the fee race to the bottom for exchange-traded fund (ETF) products are not necessarily good for investors (1:09:25) The façade of diversity being offered by ETFs (1:10:45) The opportunities created by ETFs for active managers by ETFs (1:16:11) And much more!\xa0  \xa0 Mentioned in this Episode:  Meredith Trivedi, Managing Director, Heilbrunn Center for Graham and Dodd Investing The Heilbrunn Center for Graham & Dodd Investing Events Summit Street Capital Management Benjamin Graham and David L.

We’re talking about the 5x5x5 Student Investment Fund and having a deep discussion about some of the specific stocks in the portfolio. The concept for the 5x5x5 fund came out of Tom’s concern that conventional investment funds for students offered limited learning potential due to their short-term nature and was made possible by a generous gift given by him and his wife, Georgina. The 5x5x5 fund is run by the students of the Value Investing course at Columbia Business School, with ideas being submitted by the students each year. Students then have the opportunity to connect value-oriented investment theories to real-world practice as they participate in the management of the fund. Importantly, they are also connected with alumni and are afforded valuable networking opportunities. At the end of five years, the inflation-adjusted original amount is invested back into the fund and any other gains will be used to support scholarships for traditionally under-represented members of the class. On this episode, Tom, Jeff, Mike, and I discuss how the 5x5x5 Student Investment Fund got started, how this fund differs from student funds at other schools, what goes into the investment decisions, how participation in the fund benefits students, why some of this year’s investments were selected, and so much more! \xa0 Key Topics:  The 5x5x5 nature of the student value investing fund (2:24) The multiple benefits to be derived from the fund (3:29) How 5x5x5 will become self-funding (4:01) The investment selection process (4:34) Why Tom is proud of the tough questions raised by students (5:28) Why it’s so important to monitor how your original thesis is playing out (5:46) Some of the notable investments in the history of the portfolio (6:07) How student participation in the fund can lead to important networking opportunities (6:50) A deep dive into some of the companies in the fund (8:30) Why Tom is excited about the poor performance of the international stocks in the portfolio (11:01) The five stocks that made it into the portfolio this year (13:15) Jeff’s pitch for adding Booking Holdings to the 5x5x5 portfolio (14:09) The business model and competitive advantages of Booking Holdings (15:19) How Booking Holdings differentiates itself from Expedia (19:24) What Booking Holdings is investing its free cash flow into (21:45) Why Jeff chose to pitch Booking Holdings (22:57) Jeff’s analysis of Booking Holdings’ valuation (24:53) What you can learn by comparing where an industry is in relation to GDP (26:08) The growth potential of Booking Holdings’ Airbnb-type listings (30:24) Mike’s pitch for adding Becle, S.A.B. de C.V.

", 'chan_desc': 'Value investing is more than an investment strategy — it’s a fundamental way of thinking about finance. Value investing was developed in the 1920s at Columbia Business School by professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, MS ’21. The authors of the classic text, Security Analysis, Graham and Dodd were the very pioneers of their field and their security analysis principles provided the first rational basis for investment decisions. Despite the vast and volatile changes in the economy and securities markets during the last several decades, value investing has proven to be the most successful money management strategy ever developed. Value investors’ success over the second half of the twentieth century proved not only the validity of the value approach, but its preeminence over even the most widely taught and practiced modern investment theory, which was developed in the 1950s and ’60s and remains dominant even today.Our mission today is to promote the study and practice of Graham & Dodd’s original investing principles and to improve investing with world-class education, research, and practitioner-academic dialogue. In this podcast you will hear from some of the world’s greatest investors, their views on the investment management industry, how they developed their investment process and how they see the field changing over time.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/e6/19/44/e61944e3-57fa-e823-b5ab-7a9effd57252/mza_5038515483560324637.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-16'}}

Gene is a senior meteorologist and the VP of marketing at HazardCall. HazardCall is a system developed for manufactured homes wherein any community can give their residents alerts and notifications that help them make decisions about approaching impactful weather events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and ice storms among others. Gene explains how and why HazardCall came into fruition and discusses the value in their messaging system that comes from procuring their services. Gene also provides a step by step illustration of HazardCall’s system and how it works. Kevin and Gene also talk about pricing, extra features, and other details about HazardCall. Quotes: “One of the biggest challenges of course, is telling people what to do when there’s an emergency and where they should go and that they should even have a plan.” “When your phone rings at 2 in the morning, you’re likely going to pay attention to that and we got urgent messaging that tells them there’s a storm threat but it also gives them instructions on what they should do.” “If the community manager finds out from the local emergency officials or from the power company that the power will be back on at such a time, we can type out that message on their phone and all the residents who were displaced would get that.” “It doesn’t happen everyday so we’re not calling everyday but when those things are happening in your neighborhood, when the phone rings then we’ll get your attention and hopefully that will incite and send you to take the safety action that you need. Each unit, so to speak, can have up to two numbers assigned to it.” “The biggest challenge a home community owner will have will be collecting resident information. But once you do that and put it into the system, you know maintaining this is fairly easy to do and we help you every step of the way..” Discussed in this Episode:   5:40 What is Hazard Call?   13:06 The messaging system and weather alerts   18:57 Gene explains how their system works [see link to presentation slides]   23:21 Pricing   26:36 Gene talks about “PR insurance” and other system features    RESOURCES:  View Career Opportunities at Sunrise Capital by visiting\xa0Careers.SunriseCapitalInvestors.com Check out our company and our partnership opportunities by visiting\xa0SunriseCapitalInvestors.com Would you like to partner with us on future MHP deals, call 844-CASH-FLW to learn more or\xa0click here\xa0to schedule a time on our calendar.

Host Kevin Bupp is joined by Jethro van Aardt, the Director of Operations at Sunrise Capital Investors, and they break down the many moving parts and processes of due diligence--from kick off to title transfer. Due diligence is one of the most critical aspects to master when diving into the niche of mobile home park investing. It has its own unique set of nuances and to be aware of, as well as opportunities and usual skeletons in the closet to watch out for. Quotes: "Due diligence process, it\'s a pretty thorough process and a lot of sellers often get intimidated by it. They\'re worried that you\'re going to uncover something and it\'s going to completely throw the deal out so they get kind of secretive, which is pretty strange. It\'s counter-intuitive."\xa0 "The offsite phase is critical. We need to know that we have the exact information. For example, simple things like the exact address of the property, the exact pad count, how many homes are abandoned, how many homes are resident-owned, how many homes are rented by tenants, etc etc. So it\'s verifying a lot of information." "DD is really just a long checklist and it\'s following that checklist and obviously you start off with the most critical things and, if you can get through those critical things from the top to the bottom, then you reassess and understand do you move forward or not."\xa0 "Sometimes these places look really nice from the outside. When you get inside, they\'re in really bad shape. You need to understand the quality of the resident base. If anybody is prepared to live on the floors, you know that person\'s not paying the rent and they\'re probably going to skip the town in the middle of the night." \xa0"Unfortunately that\'s one of the painful things sometimes is that you can do all that prep work and offsite, think that you\'ve covered everything but there\'s still going to be skeletons and that\'s why the onsite is so crucial."

Erik also shares a couple of stories from his experiences in the mobile home park industry. Quotes: "Definitely the new buyers are far more aggressive. I don\'t know if that\'s a good thing or not but it seems like they\'re really willing to pay all those cap rates and maybe buy in an area that doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense."\xa0\u2028  "I think a lot of it is the supply side is so small right now for anything that\'s out on the market that people just tend to gobble up whatever they can find."\u2028  "It seems like it\'s a little more accepted now on the park-owned homes side, especially on the newer homes--the older homes is still kinda hit or miss--but the newer homes it seems like if they can\'t get them sold, they\'re willing to rent now."\u2028  "We also look at it from a rental side. If the rents are exactly the same but one tenant\'s got to pay 150, one tenant\'s got to pay 40 in addition to rent, you have to consider that especially if there\'s vacant sites in those parks." "You got to buy a couple of parks on your own first before the brokers are going to even consider you. Get your track record kind of in order before you start reaching out there."\xa0 Discussed in this Episode:   New people in the industry: Trends and experiences   Appraising homes and risk assessment   Case study on utilities   Trends with market rents   Noteworthy stories on the field   RESOURCES:  View Career Opportunities at Sunrise Capital by visiting\xa0Careers.SunriseCapitalInvestors.com Check out our company and our partnership opportunities by visiting\xa0SunriseCapitalInvestors.com Would you like to partner with us on future MHP deals, call 844-CASH-FLW to learn more or\xa0click here\xa0to schedule a time on our calendar.

"Our manufactured housing community, because you\'ve got so much stability because it costs so much for a resident to take his home and move it to another park (I mean it could be in excess of $7000), they\'re not just going to move down the road like in the multifamily property."\u2028 "If you\'ve got a tier 2 loan on the property and you want to do a supplemental, you would get tier 2 pricing on the supplemental, basically."\u2028 "Their regulator, the FHFA, basically restricts the amount of business the two agencies can do and they call it cap or uncapped business.

Matt also goes into fine detail about recent successful projects and how his company manages all the different asset classes they handle from across the US.  Quotes: "In my hunt for finding deals that would yield the best cash flow, I kinda came across mobile home parks and self-storage as the key assets that I wanted to focus on since those properties yielded the highest free cash flow out of all commercial real estate classes that I came across and underwrote."\u2028 "These opportunities are available to all of us. You\'ve got to dig--especially now you\'ve got to dig even harder--and then you\'ve got to have the wherewithal to recognize that there is that untapped, hidden value." "Once you\'ve added value and you\'ve maximized that value, it\'s time to look to exit." "Through the years, we\'ve been kicked down the street and that\'s the only way I think we\'ve learned and we\'ve learned from our mistakes and as a result we\'ve implemented some of these strategies that has made us successful managers of mobile home communities."

Chuck gives us an insider\'s view of the biggest changes in the industry since the recession. He also shares his views on trends and risks that are the shaping the future of mobile homes. Quotes: "So what happened sort of in the 2000\'s all the way up to today is people, owners started to have them figure out how to sell homes in their communities, finance them, do all that. So owners have had to become more than just property owners. They\'ve had to become retailers, lenders, things like that." "If you\'re not built to dig up the dirt and put in the roads, you\'re not comfortable doing that, the same thing goes back to the smaller homes. I don\'t think the industry is built for that yet." "The question is with these different trends, what does my market want?" "The ideal thing is you got a community, trying to sell homes, you open the rentals, get your property filled out with whatever methods you can, and then try to turn those rentals into owners. And from zero, that would be the model that I would say." "I think there is some risk in increasing interest rates. I don\'t know that it\'s impending... people thought it was going to go up and then it didn\'t."

Quotes "That\'s what it boils down to. That\'s why you want to choose your broker first. You also want to be sure that you\'ve got the right person servicing you." "Like everything in life, you get brokers that are small, they don\'t have access to products that the big corporates would have." “But generally, I\'d say about between 800 and a thousand pads is when you really could start seeing some great pricing efficiencies and really the brokers would start getting excited. Anything smaller than that, you know, it\'s going to be difficult to get the brokers excited because it takes a lot of work on their side too." "Guys would never do this product if they felt that their clients were at risk or the entire industry was at risk." "Insurance is a complex product.

Mr. Mezyk then describes the risks and advantages of CLOs, the reasons for the growth in the sector’s popularity with investors, the historical default and recovery rates of CLOs (including in the credit crisis of 2008-2009 and the energy-sector downturn in 2015) and how he analyzes CLOs and CLO collateral managers in order to invest in these securities. Among further topics, Mr. Mezyk describes how the CLO market has evolved, more than doubling in size since the credit crisis and the growth of “covenant-lite” loans with their lessened protections for investors to make up 80% of the | DoubleLine Capital portfolio manager Brendt Stallings joins DoubleLine Deputy Chief Investment Officer Jeffrey Sherman and portfolio manager Samuel Lau for a broad discussion of the U.S. equity market on The Sherman Show. Much of their discussion centers on the prospects for forward-looking, long-term returns based on the Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (CAPE®) ratio devised by Dr. Robert Shiller; the ratio’s use as a tool in making allocation decisions; the calculation of the ratio; and critiques of the CAPE® ratio as well as Mr. Stallings’ critiques of those critiques. Among other topics, the discussion also covers the divergence between the U.S. stock market versus stock markets outside the U.S., the durability of business-cycle theory in the face of the longest U.S. economic expansion post-World War II and valuing equities in a “bizarro world” of negative interest rates. This segment of The Sherman Show was recorded August 26, 2019.Guest Speaker Bio | Gad Levanon, Ph.D., The Conference Board’s chief economist for North America, joins DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Sherman and Sam Lau to discuss his work in forecasting the U.S. economy and his new research on labor markets. In 2014, Dr. Levanon issued a report from The Conference Board warning of a looming labor shortage in the U.S. That report, which was met with skepticism in many corners, proved to be prescient with the unemployment rate falling over the subsequent five years to its lowest level in half a century. Among new research initiatives led by Dr. Levanon, The Conference Board has been collecting, classifying and analyzing job-opening ads from every job board in the U.S., creating a real-time data set to spot labor trends. Job openings, which he explains serve as a leading indicator of employment, have been declining for several months. Within the corporate sector, he sees an acceleration in labor costs eroding the bottom line of businesses. So far, these pressures have not resulte | Anthony Scaramucci brings his trademark color and candor to The Sherman Show in a conversation recorded with DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Sherman and Samuel Lau May 9, 2019 during Mr. Scaramucci’s SALT conference in Las Vegas. Scaramucci shares his views of politics from his time as a donor in 2008 to then-presidential candidate Barack Obama as well as a supporter of the Trump campaign in 2016 and of course his famous and short-lived service as White House Director of Communications under President Donald Trump. While describing Washington as “a gold-plated hot tub without a drain” which has left America’s working class in desperate straits, Mr. Scaramucci believes America’s long-term strategic problems are “totally fixable.” The Mooch discusses how successful people who are targeted for personal destruction by the politico-media establishment can turn the tables on the “gold-plated hot tub” and go on to greater success.

In a July 18, 2019 conversation with Sherman Show co-hosts Jeffrey Sherman and Sam Lau, Mr. Hsu describes his career analyzing, trading and managing portfolios in structured products, which began in 2002 on the mortgage-backed securities team led by DoubleLine founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach. He discusses his work in a wide array of structured products, including Agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. The latter can range from traditional securitizations of auto and student loans to securitized products created to finance traditional infrastructure such as transportation and shipping to next-generati | In a conversation recorded July 2, 2019 for The Sherman Show, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach, Deputy Chief Investment Officer Jeffrey Sherman and portfolio manager Samuel Lau, among other topics, cover the roller-coaster ride in the equity markets, rising odds of a U.S. recession, the knock-on effects of China-related supply-chain disruptions, how to interpret the Treasury yield curve and the dangers and popularity of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal.Guest Speaker Bio | In a discussion on July 1, 2019, Jeffrey Sherman, deputy chief investment officer of DoubleLine, and portfolio managers Jeff Mayberry and Sam Lau conduct their mid-year review of the financial markets, including the return of “central bankers back in charge,” Treasuries seemingly priced for recession amid U.S. stocks at all-time highs and concerning signs in purchasing managers and sentiment indicators. “It kind of feels like we’re being driven by the global forces today,” Sherman says. “We look at the U.S. economic data, and … the numbers are still pretty positive…. Our recession indicators, there’s a couple of them yellow, there’s a couple that are red, that say recession, but all of the ones that are red are actually yield curve-related, which can be fixed by the Fed. Perhaps that’s what some of the markets are thinking.” Sherman also perceives a turning point in the form of a “drastic” change in inflation expectations at the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting on March 20. Sher | Nancy Davis, founder, managing partner and chief investment officer of Quadratic Capital Management, discussed May 9, 2019 on The Sherman Show her philosophy toward options trading, Quadratic’s plan to democratize the markets by giving investors more choices better access to interest-rate volatility and, among other topics, where she thinks investing opportunities lie in the options market. Ms. Davis began her career at Goldman Sachs where she rose to become head of credit, derivatives and over-the-counter trading. Before launching Quadratic in 2013, she served as a portfolio manager at Highbridge where she managed $500 million of capital in a derivatives-only portfolio. She later served in a senior executive role at AllianceBernstein.Guest Speaker Bio | Last year on The Sherman Show, Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and Director of Intelligence at Quill Intelligence, discussed her optimism in Jerome Powell’s leadership at the Federal Reserve. In her return recorded May 7, the author of the best-selling book FED UP explains why she’s disbanded the Powell Fan Club. In a conversation with DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Sherman and Sam Lau, Ms. DiMartino Booth also covers among other topics how the post-Halloween junk-credit paralysis “dominoed” into the “Christmas Eve bloodbath,” obsolescent monetary policy tools in the U.S., the even-worse fiscal and monetary basket case in Europe, and a manufacturing slowdown in the U.S. which belies otherwise rosy economic news and explains rising layoffs year-over-year.Guest Speaker Bio | In this episode of The Sherman Show, David Zervos, Ph.D., Chief Market Strategist for Jefferies LLC and Chief Investment Officer for the Global Macro Division of Jefferies Investment Advisers, LLC, describes how his academic path mutated to macroeconomics from electrical engineering, his stints in the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, and ultimately making his way into the private sector, including hedge funds and sell-side firms before matriculating at Jefferies. Then Mr. Zervos and DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Sherman and Samuel Lau dive into a discussion of managing money through financial crises, his insider’s view at the Fed during the crafting of Quantitative Easing to avoid another Great Depression, unconventional monetary policy becoming conventional, why he disbelieves Phillips Curve theory, his evolving views on inflation and risk parity among other topics.Guest Speaker Bio', 'chan_desc': 'DoubleLine, The Sherman Show', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/6a/17/33/6a1733a6-bad7-ccc1-4f4e-3c996ec19d62/mza_4101643009443805394.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-04-17'}}

He likes the stock as it trades below its previous deal price, and likes the underlying business as well. We discuss those elements, the risks to parent company BBX Capital's bid, and, because we couldn't resist, how this fits into Joel Greenblatt's investing philosophy. | Through three episodes to this point on Joel Greenblatt's You Can Be A Stock Market Genius, Mike and I have discussed what we like about his famous special situation investing strategies, and what doesn't work. We've also shared our enthusiasm for the light touch he applies to his writing, and the way he doesn't appear to take himself too seriously. Chapters 7 and 8 bring that feeling home. Chapter 7 because it shares how Greenblatt advises his readers to do the actual research, and one component is to borrow ideas from other investors. It's an obvious concept when you think about it, but it also suggests a touch of humility that plays out throughout the book. We look at Greenblatt's sources and favorite books to understand the rest of the book better. Then, Chapter 8 is the shortest chapter, and it underlines Greenblatt's entire philosophy as I understand it. Basically, investing and growing your money can give you time and options later on. When active vs. passive remains a hotly contested topic, and when nobody is satisfied with even a 10+ year bull market, it's worth remembering that you should invest if you enjoy it, and the goal is to buy you time to do the things you want to do with the people you want to do them with, and nothing more or less. We discuss the philosophy and the minutiae on our concluding episode about Greenblatt's book. Topics Covered  3:40 minute mark - The highlights of Chapter 7 8:40 - Coattail riding in today's market 18:40 - Thoughts about sources listed in the book and their relevance 22 years later. 21:00 - Reviewing Greenblatt's favorite books 27:00 - The philosophy: money is time. Do we buy? 35:30 - Final dad jokes and notes from the book.  | Investors looking for value stock investing opportunities with catalysts ahead will be interested in Jorge Robles' perspective on UK low-cost gym operator Gym Group. The company has a reasonable competitive position, a misunderstood path to profitability, and an attractive free cash flow yield. Mike and Jorge explore the catalysts to realize the stock's value, competition within the industry, the impact of private equity ownership on companies, and the role Brexit might play in weightlifter behavior. | Chapters 5 and 6 of You Can Be A Stock Market Genius find our hero and author, Joel Greenblatt, walking on the wild side, as he looks at bankruptcies, LEAPs, restructurings, and other 'odder' corners of the market. Bankruptcies and similar topics in these chapters share some of the classic special situation traits of spin-offs and the like, but they also extend to a messier area of the market. So what holds together? We discuss that as well as some of the lessons Greenblatt drops in these chapters. | We continue our discussion of Joel Greenblatt's classic book, You Can Be A Stock Market Genius, with a focus on chapters 3 and 4.Chapters 3 and 4 of the book are the ones everyone remembers, especially re: spin-offs. The principles Greenblatt lays out - shareholder mismatch, the opportunity to find overlooked ideas, the chance to do close reading - all seem to be relevant today, and yet spin-offs don't seem to be as attractive a category. We break that down as well as risk arbitrage and merger securities. | We are big fans of Joel Greenblatt and his book, You Can Be A Stock Market Genius. We decided to break it down to see how it applies to today’s market, what key lessons are, what the best quotes from the book are, and our favorite Joel Greenblatt dad jokes. We start with chapters 1 and two, which lay out Greenblatt's mindset for investing. Topics Covered  3:30 minute mark - Breaking Down Chapter 1 - The Greenblatt Mantra 7:30 - The individual investor advantage 14:30 - The efficiency of the markets 17:45 - Chapter 2 and the persistence of Greenblatt's approach 24:30 - Different investing styles for the individual investor 28:30 - Whither the value factor? 35:30 - Key quotes and jokes  | Bluegreen Vacations (BXG) is a timeshare developer in a curious situation - its majority owner pulled a bid for the minority of the company due to a since resolved lawsuit, but the shares trade well below the previous offer. Timeshares draw their own questions, and the market has been more volatile since the bid was pulled. We discuss the idea and what that could mean for shareholders and special situations investors going forward. Topics covered:  5:00 minute mark - Overview of the busted merger arbitrage story. 8:45 - The timeshare industry and the underlying ups and downs therein 16:30 - Working down the income statement 20:00 - Breaking the Bass Pro Shops lawsuit down 23:00 - Manhattan club, time shares in NYC 31:30 - How does sales operation of a time share work? 33:30 - Time share business model and why does BBX Capital need to pay a big premium?

All of the happy hour ladies have worked traditional nine-to-five jobs and started their own businesses. Today we discuss, as we discuss all things, honestly the pros and cons of both career choices and whether or not we could go back to a nine-to-five job after being entrepreneurs.

Hitha joins me today to share her personal entrepreneur journey through three businesses and why she loves investing in other founders.

She joins me to share her entrepreneurial journey and how we can all have more fulfilling and meaningful dating lives.

Today is the last Friday of the month and my regular listeners know that on the last Friday of the month, I host the happy hour on the podcast where I gather great friends with me to drink cheap drinks and talk about money topics. It's not only the last Friday of the month, but the last Friday, in my opinion, of summer time and as I gave myself some summer vacation to air replays, I also gave the happy hour ladies a month off as well. This week I’m re-airing the episode we recorded around home ownership. This is honestly one of my all-time favorite episodes because I think there was so much great information shared and it was a truly honest dive into the pros and cons of home ownership and why we support it or not.

The primary pieces, or the outline of the puzzle, include budgeting, expense management, saving, credit management, debt management, investing, insurance or risk management, and income management. At the Financial Gym, we help our clients figure out all of these pieces and where they fit into the puzzle, and, while I think they’re all equally important, I think the investing piece is typically the last one people figure out. Either they haven’t gotten to a point where they’re saving enough to make investing a priority, they’re afraid to start, or they don’t know where to go to learn more about it. That’s why I’m excited to have Amanda from the Dumpster Dog Blog and Invested Development, to talk more about investing and the amazing resource she’s created to help you get started, or get more comfortable with, the investing piece of your financial health puzzle.

Until next time, take care!! | In my seven years of helping people get financially healthy, a common emotion I’ve seen from clients is anxiety. We have clients avoid their first sessions with us, avoid quarterly reviews, or avoid their trainers totally, because of the anxiety their financial situation brings up in them. In fact, this episode was inspired by a long-term client of the Gym, who asked her trainer if I could do a show around financial anxiety. Despite the fact she is experiencing great success around her money, she can’t kick the anxiety it brings her. Today I invited my friend, Amanda Clayman, Financial Therapist and Financial Wellness Advocate for Prudential, to discuss the topic of financial anxiety, including how common it is and how we can manage it in our lives. This is a really important topic for everyone and I hope it helps a lot of people out there.  For more information, visit the show notes at http://financially-blonde.com/financial-anxiety-with-amanda-clayman | At the Financial Gym, we call the first time our clients meet with their financial trainers, and share all of their financial details, the financially naked session. It’s typically a meeting where a lot of clients start out anxious and honestly a number of people avoid joining the financial gym out of the fear and shame they have around their money situation and I want to tell you that no matter what your situation you shouldn’t feel that way. The only reason you could possibly feel like that is if you’re not willing to do anything about changing your money situation. To help anyone out there who may be feeling bad about their financial situation, today, I’m going to let you know you’re not alone. Today, I’m sharing with you my financial situation ALL of the numbers and all of the details. As I said on the show, I have been just about all of our clients at some point in my adult life and you’re about to find out why. Joining me to hear all the dirt is one of my all time favorite trainers at the gym, Joy.

In this episode, we cover:   How did you get Brad Feld on early on?  How did you stay true to your vision when you were getting asked early on by entrepreneurs to feature them on the podcast? (you mentioned this in episode 10, w/Brad Feld)  If you were starting TFR again, in 2019, what would you do differently?  Why the podcast format vs blogging vs. ... ?  When did you know that the podcast was "working" ... bringing deal flow or whatever you thought was a strong signal that things were clicking for your audience?  What surprised you once the podcast got "big"? Anything unexpected on the positive or negative side?  How did the podcast tie into your recent fundraising process? Where did it help, and did it hurt or cause any issues, too?  How did the podcast tie into your recent fundraising process? Where did it help, and did it hurt or cause any issues, too?  Do you measure deal flow that is podcast related, and how much of your deal flow is it? How many completed investments came from the TFR community?  I have heard from multiple Angel List employees re: Angel List syndicates that it\'s very hard to get people to back a deal unless the deal has a lead like Sequoia or KPCB or another top firm attached to it. Has that been true for your syndications? If no, why?  What benefits did you see by using Angel List syndicates platform so early on? For those thinking of starting up a syndicate now, how has the game changed?  How do you find and vet interns for your fund? Or how do they find you?  Are there any processes at your fund that you think work REALLY well, and what are they? How do you execute them?

In this episode, we cover:  What is Aaron Levie like to work for? Backstory and path to Acceleprise When you started Acceleprise a lot of folks told you not to -- the world doesn\'t need another accelerator. Why did you proceed? Why an Accelerator and not a traditional VC fund? Check size then and now? The biggest criticism of accelerators that I\'m hearing from investors is that accelerators admit companies that need a lot of help and can\'t figure things out on their own -- and those are not the companies that one wants to invest in. What\'s your response to these folks? You\'ve mentioned your interest in working w/ founders that have a "willingness to sell." How specifically do you develop the sell-skills of founders that are willing but green w/regards to sales. What are some the best demand-gen techniques that you use? Talk to us about how you think through pricing models and strategies at early-stage SaaS businesses. ACV initial vs. expansion rev opportunity Lemkin.. TAM... initial traction in SOM/Beachhead niche market is most important. Any company that gets traction here can find a $1B market. Agree, disagree? We talk a lot, on this show, about either why SF is the best place to build a company or why any place but SF is the best place to build a company. You\'ve done both -- Objectively, can you break down the biggest advantages to building in the valley vs. the advantages to building outside? Let\'s talk a bit about pedigree -- most investors have simple heuristics here. If the founder didn\'t study at a Stanford/Ivy level institution... pass. If the founder didn\'t work for a FAANG tech company or fast-growing private tech company... pass. At New Stack, we like to say we\'re in the business of exceptions (deals that have all the right ingredients for success -- except these optics of provenance). Michael, where do you stand on pedigree and how do you define it? What percentage of the companies in the cohort to you invest in at completion? In terms of measuring success -- what key metric do you measure that you\'re most proud of? Over the past few years, what trends or major changes have you seen with regards to SaaS that founders and investors should be aware of? Tech-enabled services - a real trend or not? Venture fundable? There has been some recent issues in the Tech space with employee options -- what have you witnessed and what would you like to see change?  \xa0 To listen more, please visit\xa0http://fullratchet.net/podcast-episodes/\xa0for all of our other episodes.

In this episode, we cover:  When Marc and Ben first reached out to you about joining A16Z, you hesitated. Why? "When Marc and Ben first started A16Z, they described a founder\'s leadership capability as "egomaniacal"... what do you think they mean by that and do you share this belief? What are the key factors in determining if venture is appropriate for the new business and its founder? How should one decide how much to raise? Scenario I\'ve heard all too often... founder goes out to raise their next round, they\'ve more than doubled the business, hit major milestones but the offers are less than double that of the last round. Scott, can you talk us through the valuation mistakes you most often encounter? Founder has started fundraising... the first step is to get their foot in the door. Talk us through the right and wrong way to get a meeting. You mention the 5 pitch essentials in the book - can you talk us through each? We\'ve done an episode with Brad Feld where we went into detail on the Term Sheet... both Economics and Governance. I don\'t want to cover each term today but first, related to Economics, what\'s different now about the Economics terms or the negotiation than what you saw maybe five years ago? Same question for Governance, what has changed and what are the key terms in focus? Do you have any guidelines on how much of their business founders should sell in any given round? So the next topic, we\'ve all seen before, assuming you\'ve been doing this long enough, but a founder is struggling to raise, has little capital left, and is scrambling to get creative. What are some of the more common mistakes and outcomes you see in this scenario? Why should entrepreneurs care who the LPs are behind the VC fund that\'s investing? We could spend hours discussing boards... any key items you\'d like to highlight w/regards to boards? Talk us through the acquisition process? IPO process?

In this episode, we cover:  Backstory/ Path to Venture Talk about the 14 years you spent with Comcast Ventures -- what you learned and why you left? What lead to founding Touchdown Ventures? At Touchdown, you partner with leading corporations to manage the complete venture lifecycle from entity formation to investment management…Can you dive into the thesis/focus of the firm? Why would a founder choose corporate VC funding over institutional funding? I was reading through the “Risky Business” blog on the Touchdown website and found some pretty interesting articles…specifically one that talks about “the most overlooked skill in Corporate venture" being deal management…that it “requires more effort than all other activities combined”…why is deal management so challenging? Why do you think CVC’s funding has historically been more inconsistent than institutional venture funds? Why are corporations willing to take minority stakes in startups? As Fred Wilson said on CVC—“You want the asset? Buy it.” Is there a risk to founders of taking investment from a large corporate that can "look under the hood" and reverse-engineer the tech or exploit the IP? Is the core objective of a CVC financial return or is it more of a strategy play? (i.e. market insight, actively trying to grow certain sectors) How does the mindset of a CVC change in a bear market, especially compared to institutional VC? How does follow-on funding work in corporate VC? If the corporate has a poor financial year, does a lower funding allocation affect follow-on allotment for winners? The firm was recognized by Global Corporate Venturing for having both established and managed the most corporate venture funds to date… At the industry level corp VC has peaked in funding in recent years. Why do you think corp VC has grown to this level and why did you raise the number of funds that you did? One of the articles on the Risky Business blog talks about fraud detection with reference to Fyre Festival and Theranos…Talk about some red flags that an opportunity may be a fraud and what you should do if those red flags are present?  \xa0 To listen more, please visit\xa0http://fullratchet.net/podcast-episodes/\xa0for all of our other episodes.

It is one of the biggest hurdles of anyone trying to get financially free.\xa0 As our guest Ryan Craig points out, the U.S. student loan debt total is at $1.5 TRILLION dollars. This debt was incurred mostly by students who believed the dream that college would help them get a “good job”, only to find that the “good jobs” wanted employees with a different set of skills. How do we fix this problem and how do we prevent the next generation of college-bound students from falling into the trap? Give them alternatives. That’s what Ryan Craig is all about. Ryan argues that now is the time to give cheaper and more targeted options for people, throughout their careers, whether they are high school students or experienced workers looking to advance their career. \xa0 WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS EPISODE  What is causing the student loan crisis? How much should we be saving for college?
