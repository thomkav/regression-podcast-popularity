A few schools featured were Boise State, UCF and BYU. What makes this article confusing is that they grouped BYU as a group of 5 which is inaccurate. This is a silly, fantasy land article. The only thing correct about this article is that BYU has a tough schedule. | Do you know who Paul Krause is? It’s ok if you don’t. Scott will tell you. We are talking about quarterbacks today in our weekly observations from the pocket. An article caught Scott’s eye about the declining interception rate in the NFL, which is surprising because pass attempts have increased dramatically. We talk about those records that are just untouchable...but most are made to be broken. | Jamal Williams, a former BYU and current Green Bay Packers running back was carted off the field after a pretty serious head injury. There were two instances in that single game where players were carted off the field. Scott talks about how hard it is for a team to move on during a game when one of their own is seriously injured. Scott tells a personal story of a scary moment from his career.\xa0 | Scott and his producer had an interesting conversation about why some years he can’t stop watching the NFL with absolutely no interest in college football. And other years it is the exact opposite. His producer agreed. It just depends on the year for both of them. They can’t be the only ones who feel that way? Right? Scott tries to figure out why his interest oscillates. He thinks it depends on whether or not his teams have a good team. | Jacob Easson of Washington looks good and will look even better as his season, coached by Chris Petersen, comes to a close. Speaking of college quarterbacks...How does USC’s third guy, Matt Fink, beat #10 Utah and their high caliber defense. Moving onto the NFL. Baker Mayfield is overrated. He can't stay in the pocket. That spurs a conversation about what makes quarterbacks rise to the next level.\xa0 | Scott Mitchell, former NFL quarterback, is giving a list of the NFL teams he thinks will work out their growing pains. He is also telling you which teams you should just give up on and wait until next year, or the year after that. Some fans who shouldn’t give up? The Bills, the Bears. Some fans who should give up? The Redskins.\xa0\xa0 | Steve Young recently compared the NFL to the NBA with players demanding trades or waivers. Scott agrees, but says this is not new territory. Look at when Steve Young or John Elway got drafted. While Antonio Brown is deplorable for other reasons, requesting trades is the least of it. Scott also wants to ask Steve Young if he has ever played for a bad team...FYI it sucks! | Ben Rothlisberger, the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers is having season ending elbow surgery while the New Orleans Saints starter Drew Brees is out for weeks with a torn ligament. Scott wonders if this is the beginning of the next Tom Brady. If you remember - Tom Brady only got playing time when Drew Bledsoe got injured. Teddy Bridgewater will go in for Drew Brees. The Steelers situation is a big question mark. Another starter, Eli Manning of the New York Giants may also be getting replaced… but not because of injury. | The state of California has passed a bill that would allow college athletes to make money for their likeness. The bill only needs a signature from the Governor. Scott Mitchell doesn’t always agree with California but he does on this one. This is the beginning of change for the NCAA and for good measure. The NCAA has gotten away with too much for too long. But in all honesty, players are already getting paid and getting perks, just not legally.\xa0 | Here’s what you need to know about the NFL according to a former NFL quarterback Scott Mitchell. There can be major adjustments made from week to week unless you are just really bad. So...bad news for the Dolphins. In other quarterback news - Tom Brady still has it and Patrick Mahomes has yet to show any weakness.\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Helmets Off is hosted by former NFL and University of Utah football quarterback and reality TV star, Scott Mitchell.
