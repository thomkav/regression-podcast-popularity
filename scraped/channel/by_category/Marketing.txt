Before you know it, that notebook will be filled with notes of inspiration!\xa0 Leverage your skill sets Do you ever find yourself wondering if all this ecommerce brand building will really be worth it?

You\'ll want to pay extra close attention to this exciting and special episode coming to you on the heels of Brand Accelerator Live!\xa0 Setting the stage\xa0 If you\'ve been part of the TAS community for very long, you know that Scott has quite the compelling story. From his days working construction with his father to his early days selling on Ebay - Scott\'s story has been anything but boring. Through all of Scott\'s successes and challenges - one thing stood out from all the rest - family. Scott\'s family was the motivator that got him into and then later out of the construction business. He wanted to provide for his family, and he wanted to spend time with his family - these two things are at odds with each other - right? Wrong! Scott soon created a path that would allow him to spend time with his family and provide a comfortable life for them at the same time.\xa0 Growing in confidence While Scott knew he was a competent construction worker - he realized that he did not want to spend 60 hours or more at the job site each week. Scott\'s skill set he built while working with his father was the key to give Scott the confidence he needed to go out on a limb and try something new. Something new started as a photography business that Scott created with his wife, Lisa. The company grew for a while and then Scott discovered new opportunities to make an income that would provide for his family - ecommerce.\xa0 The Amazon Guy As many of you know - Scott learned the ins and outs of the ecommerce world over several years of retail arbitrage and selling on Amazon and Ebay. Before long, Scott decided to take the insights and lessons he learned from his own experience and offer them to the rest of the ecommerce industry. After several years of The Amazing Seller podcast, Scott became known as "The Amazon Guy." While Scott is proud of the work he\'s done with TAS - he started to kind of chafe against getting pegged as "The Amazon Guy." He knew that his story had so much more potential to impact people beyond the scope of the ecommerce industry.\xa0 The next chapter\xa0 All of the backstory and building has come to this - the big reveal! Listening to the audio, you really get the sense that Scott is BEYOND excited to share this news and the next chapter with the TAS community.\xa0 Scott is now an AUTHOR!

I used to be OBSESSED with how many people were following me, and I used to give it more attention than how much I was profiting. Seems backwards right? As a business owner, why obsess more over how many followers you have vs. how much money you’re making?   Thankfully, things are different now. I’m no longer concerned with how many people are following me, instead I’m concerned with the depth of my relationship with my following. Because while followers does not equal sales, the depth of my relationship with my following makes sales a hell of a lot easier.   I’ve narrowed down what I believe is the best way to grow your Instagram following in 2019 (because yes, the platforms are always changing, so keep up).

We all want to show up authentically on Instagram, but when does personal become too personal? Today's episode I go in depth about a situation that got me wondering about what “the line” is.   People always ask me, “What’s appropriate to share and what’s not?” The answer is, it strongly depends on your brand. In my case, I have a personal brand where I am the name & face of my brand, so it’s important for me to build a real relationship with my followers.\xa0I don’t have to share anything about my personal live, but I do because it will bring me closer to my audience.\xa0   Remember real relationships don’t come from only showing the “highlight reel”. Real relationships come from shared memories and experiences, vulnerability and TRUST.   In this week’s episode I share:\xa0\xa0    why being with childhood friends reminded me of the shame I felt when graduating high school what it’s really like working while traveling the nitty gritty of what’s going on behind-the-scenes of the business, the new hire we just made (woohoo, welcome to the team Stacy) how I’m prepping for the upcoming launch of Project Storyline!\xa0   | Over the past few years, I have shifted my focus from growing my following, to converting my followers into clients. And I’m proud to say we've made more money in the last six months than I ever had in any year of my business beforehand.\xa0 I look at people who are just getting started and their obsession with followers. Back then, I wish someone had told me, “You’ve got it all backwards. Let’s shine a light on what you *really* need to be focusing on.” That’s exactly why we recorded this episode. Amanda is such an great person to have this conversation with. She's excellent at lead generation and conversational selling.\xa0  She has made $40,000 in the Instagram DM’s alone. She's made half a million dollars with only one landing page.\xa0 She made $1 million before they even had 5,000 email subscribers.\xa0  I wish that eight years ago I could have listened to this episode because it would've been a GAME CHANGER. It's an inside look into how to hack profitability by knowing how to deliver *exactly* what they need. Because that's what's going to bring you massive profitability. |  In this episode I share how to know the difference between the moments you need to hustle and power through any resistance, and the moments you need to step away from your computer and get some fresh air.

This attorney-turned-entrepreneur pioneered the form of corporate licensing that makes such products possible and wildly successful. Stone made his first foray into the world of licensing with the launch of his company, Beanstalk, in the mid-1990s. The firm quickly became the go-to resource for prominent brands like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and AT&T—all corporations that were eager to expand their reach into different product categories and strengthen their relationships with consumers. In 2018, Stone and his company were responsible for generating over $7 billion in retail sales of licensed product. While he stepped down as the CEO a few years ago, Stone still serves as the chairman of Beanstalk and is committed to innovation in this industry. Check out this interview to learn more about the ins and outs of licensing and to hear about Stone’s experience writing his book The Power of Licensing: Harnessing Brand Equity.  Key Takeaways  Why Stone switched lanes from practicing law to pioneering brand licensing The uncharted territory Stone noticed, and how it led to the launch of Beanstalk The necessary components for successful corporate brand licensing How Beanstalk became the go-to resource for prominent brands An explanation of why Febreeze is a better candidate for expansion via licensing than Citibank Handing over the reins of a business that was responsible for over $7 billion in sales in 2018 Why Stone decided to stick with his existing niche instead of starting multiple new businesses Stone’s honest warning for aspiring entrepreneurs  | Cannabis King How Matt Morgan, a misfit from Montana, took the booming marijuana industry by storm. A typical life was not in the cards for Matt Morgan. Fortunately, he found an atypical career. Growing up, he was fired from every traditional job he ever had, and when he tried college, he lasted just 10 days before dropping out. Next, Morgan became an electrician apprentice at the age of 19, still hoping to find a career path that he might enjoy. But like his previous ventures, this too was short-lived and he resigned  after a year. Having always possessed an entrepreneurial flair, Morgan did find quick success as a realtor, which would lead him in a roundabout way to the world of legalized marijuana. Finally, it was in the Wild West of the cannabis boom where Morgan found his home. Within a three-and-a-half year period, Morgan would become one of the most recognizable leaders in the cannabis industry. He is the founder of multiple cannabis companies, such as Bloom Dispensaries and Reef Dispensaries, with the latter becoming the first in the world to hit a $100 million revenue run rate. In 2018, Morgan was named one of the most influential people in cannabis by High Times. But as we all know, the highs are so often preceded by lows, and had there not been an financial crisis in 2008, he may have never entered the business in the first place. Taste of Entrepreneurship Growing up in Missoula, Montana, Morgan had a hard time finding his niche in the working world, but he did find one thing that he was quite good at, which ended up being a gateway drug to starting his own business—real estate. “ really opened up my eyes to entrepreneurship,” Morgan says. “Running your own business. You know, basically, eat what you kill. It’s totally up to you, whether you’re going to survive or not. That’s the type of environment that I thrive in.” And thrive he did. By the time he hit 22, Morgan became the managing partner of his own real estate company. By early 2008, he had begun to take notice that prospective homebuyers were reaching out to him with very specific guidelines on the type of home they wanted to purchase. Not only were they asking for roughly the same amount of land, they were all specifically requesting that each home have a shop out back — a detached garage or external structure that could be used as a hobby space. And if it didn’t have a shop, he didn’t have a deal. This left Morgan perplexed. He had met most of their demands, and more times than not a deal fell through because of this one caveat. This finally left him to ask himself, “what’s so important about these shops?” At the time, Montana’s legal cannabis industry had just started to boom, and people wanted in with a place to grow. This was an industry that Morgan was not in tune with at the time, but he started to pay attention to. Then the financial crisis of 2008 hit and Morgan’s real estate business was dead in its tracks. He needed a new play. Despite his youth, Morgan was old enough to have seen one tech boom and one housing boom, and had an itch that he may be in the presence of the next gold rush. “All these crazy people talking about this marijuana stuff, there must be something to it,” Morgan says. “So I started digging into it.” One day, after months of research, it became clear to him that marijuana was going to be the next big boom. “That day I went and found a light and a warehouse and I was damned if I wasn’t going to grow some marijuana, “ Morgan says. Growing Pains With the exception of spending some time on his grandparent’s farm, Morgan wasn’t that experienced in horticulture. He knew the basics of how to grow some crops, but after looking around at the competition, he felt he could succeed in marijuana. “How hard could this be?” Morgan says. “There’s a bunch of hippies in tie-dye with hoop houses out in the wilderness growing, you know, grade-A cannabis. I’m sure I can figure it out.” He didn’t. At least not at first. Morgan set up a small operation in his garage, and after about 15 failed attempts, he finally found a grow system that worked. Then in 2009, he teamed up with another grower in Montana and they opened a state-of-the-art, 15,000-square-foot cultivation facility, one of the largest in the state at the time. This new abundance of space gave them a controlled environment to grow a significant harvest of plants. Within Montana’s medicinal marijuana caregiver program, as long as you had a patient card, you were legally allowed to grow six plants per patient that you were a caregiver for. With Morgan’s patient list growing to over 500, he was legally growing over 15,000 plants. Not bad for a guy who didn’t know much about the business just one year prior. But just as quickly as he had struck gold, a new law would bring things grinding to a halt. Next Stop: Arizona Per Morgan, in 2009 Missoula’s population was over 65,000 people and the city was home to over 60 dispensaries. That equates to around one dispensary for every thousand people. In short, that’s a lot of dispensaries. The state began to worry that the new industry was growing too quickly. So to help slow it down, Montana had an emergency legislative session and reversed its laws so that a caregiver could now only have three patients total. Instead of having 15,000 plants, Morgan was suddenly only allowed to have 18 plants total. Once again, Morgan was stopped dead in his tracks. Feeling the cons outweighed the pros of running the facility in violation of the new laws, he shut down his operation in 2010. Having tasted the fruits of his labor, he turned his focus elsewhere. He immediately began to look around the country for states with more favorable marijuana laws so he could scale a business. “I knew I had the skills sets at that point, I just needed the right vehicle and platform to do so,” Morgan says. Arizona ended up offering that platform. The Grand Canyon State was about to roll out an extremely favorable and innovative program that was to be the first of its kind, and Morgan wanted to be a part of it. Morgan says the state’s population was also substantially larger than Montana’s, and it was going to allow a permit holder to have unlimited plants, unlimited square footage to grow, and unlimited weight in product. He felt like it was a “dream” and couldn’t wait to head south. “I literally packed up all my stuff into my Chevy Silverado and I drove down to Arizona within that week,” Morgan says. “And literally, probably the best decision I’ve ever made. I was 25 years old.” Upon his arrival, Morgan opened up a chain of hydroponics stores to help gain a foothold in the area and to network with the locals as he waited for the new laws to roll out. While doing so, he befriended the son of a senator who would become key in helping him land one of the state’s limited marijuana licenses. (Morgan chooses not to divulge the senator’s name during our interview.) “These licenses were looked at as a valuable asset,” Morgan says. “There’s no way these guys are giving some kid from Montana one of these licenses that could end up being worth, you know, millions of dollars.” His chances may have been slim, but a senator’s chances were very good. After agreeing to terms, Morgan says he and the senator’s son partnered up and convinced the senator to put his name on the application. Soon thereafter, the two won a Sedona license through a lottery system and within four weeks after that, they purchased a Phoenix license on terms from its winner for $450,000. With two licenses under their belt, Bloom Dispensaries was well underway. Like Morgan’s real estate business, Bloom took off, and in under a year grew to 100 employees and was generating $1 million in revenue a month. Everyone came calling. By 2013, Bloom was drawing national attention and was destroying its competition. This led to private equity firms and wealthy families to reach out to Morgan for advice and potential opportunities. “People were starting to look at marijuana,” Morgan says. “It was still kind of in the shadows, but it was starting to come to the light.” Due to Morgan’s knowledge in the space and Bloom’s exponential growth, companies wanted to replicate his success and learn his secrets. However, Morgan says one such wealthy family, worth billions, wanted to do more than talk. They wanted Morgan and offered to purchase Bloom in order to get him. However, after negotiations between the family and Bloom’s investors fell through, the family extended a proposal to only Morgan for him to come and launch their new venture. Realizing a good opportunity when he saw it, Morgan accepted their offer. As for Bloom, he divested his shares and gave the company to his partner in order to remain on good terms. Now armed with over $100 million in capital from his new partners, Reef Dispensaries was born. And its growth was on a whole other level. “I came out of the cannon like a cannonball,” Morgan says. Reef quickly expanded to 200,000 square feet of cultivation, had two extraction laboratories, and six retail dispensaries, with one of them becoming the busiest dispensary in the world. And to top it off, Reef became the first cannabis company in the world to hit a $100 million run rate. Despite the success Morgan was able to create at Reef, he says tensions began to grow between him and his partners. After months of disagreements, Morgan resigned as CEO of the company in November 2017, forcing a buyout and shocking the cannabis industry. The Next Frontier Morgan’s next major move took some time to develop. Much like the beginnings of Bloom, an entrepreneur reached out to Morgan about a potential partnership. However this time, the individual challenged Morgan to look at the other chemical compounds in the cannabis plant other than THC, and to research how they were being used in the healthcare space. After spending close to a year discussing healthcare and the science on how to use cannabinoids, the two of them founded Oneqor Technologies. “It’s really a hybrid of a biotech pharma company that’s leaning heavily on cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, excluding THC, the psychoactive one,” Morgan says. After spending 10 years in the THC business, Morgan says he was becoming bored with the industry. Oneqor presents something new and exciting for him, plus he’s able to operate it almost like any other typical business. Working in a business that doesn’t deal with THC is a whole new frontier, and one with barely any restrictions. And without the restrictions, Morgan’s ambitions grew. On top of helping brands such as GNC create private label CBD products, Morgan wants Oneqor to revolutionize the market. He hopes to dominate the cannabinoid industry in the same way Intel did with computers by becoming the secondary brand. “If you see a product and you know it has cannabinoids in it, I don’t want it to say CBD inside,” Morgan says. “I want it to say Oneqor inside.” Matt Morgan’s Playbook for Building a Business In a span of less than 10 years, Matt Morgan became a leader in the cannabis industry by creating Bloom Dispensaries and Reef Dispensaries, along with his new venture Oneqor Technologies. After some early growing pains, Morgan came up with his own playbook on how to grow a successful business. Believe In Something Many founders, especially first-time entrepreneurs, tend to look at only the financial aspect of creating a business, rather than if it’s something they actually want to do. Other times, people may start a company because they feel that the idea might be a fun thing to do. Morgan believes, that although the financial upside is something to consider, you must also believe in the product and have passion for it if you’re looking to build a company. Otherwise, you may lose interest and not do the things needed to succeed. “You shouldn’t pick something you want to do because you think it’s cool,” Morgan says. “You should pick something you do because you believe in it and you see a lot of upside potential. Or else, what are you doing it for?” Look at the CEO Morgan credits much of his early success to the teams he’s built. From building a C-suite team to hiring the employees for his stores, he believes that everyone is important. And to find those right employees, it starts at the top with the CEO. That means either looking within yourself if you’re the CEO, or by sitting down with your leader and asking them what their core values are. Skill sets are important, but if your employees don’t share the same values, the culture won’t work. “You want to hire people that have the same core values as you, because you can’t teach people core values,” Morgan says. “They’re born with that…or their environment, whatever it may be. You can teach people anything, but you can’t teach them that.” Be Uncomfortable Another trait that Morgan says led to his success is the ability to go outside his comfort zone. He used to be a nervous wreck, he says, but wanted to rid himself of that anxiety. So beginning from the age of 20 until he was 28, he put himself in uncomfortable situations daily in order to grow as a person. This not only helped in his everyday life, but also as a professional and leader. It helped him with everything from speaking in front of 10,000 people to raising capital for his businesses. In order to succeed, you must be willing to put yourself in uncomfortable situations and get to the point where you’re calm and collected in every situation. “Human beings have a defense mechanism and they don’t like getting out of their comfort zone,” Morgan says. “You don’t know what to say, what to do, how to operate. But that’s really your biggest growth potential as a human being, is outside of your comfort zone.” Maintain Focus Among the Chaos Founding your own startup can come with lots of unexpected surprises. Especially within an emerging field such as the cannabis industry, things can become chaotic as the rules are still being established. Unfortunately, there will be a lot of chaos around you, a lot of drama, and a lot of arguing. But the only thing you can do is figure out how to control your reaction to it and always remain focused on your goals. Find what makes you relaxed and focused, and master it. “One thing that has really helped me with that is meditating,” Morgan says. “It’s really helped me, you know, keep my concentration, collect my thoughts. … There’s not really anything that can rock me mentally.” Interview by Nathan Chan, feature article reprinted from Foundr Magazine, by Nick Allen  Key Takeaways  A look into Morgan’s struggles to fit into the traditional working world How real estate became the gateway drug to entrepreneurship The impact of the financial crisis of 2008, and how it led Morgan into the cannabis industry From 15 failed attempts at growing marijuana to a patient list of over 500 How a change in Montana’s laws sent Morgan’s business to Arizona The political relationships that helped the launch of Bloom Dispensaries How Bloom Dispensaries reached $1 million in revenue and dominated the cannabis industry Why Morgan decided to sell Bloom and launch Reef Dispensaries with new partners Growing Reef Dispensaries to become the first cannabis company to hit a $100 million run rate Behind Morgan’s decision to quit as Reef Dispensaries’ CEO and his next step with OneQor  | Figuring It Out Why Marie Forleo walked away from Wall Street to help people build lives they love. Marie Forleo was on the brink of the American dream. After graduating as valedictorian from Seton Hall University, making her the first in her family to graduate from college, she’d landed her first post-grad job on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Her peers were millionaires, and she was on track to become one, too. But that dream came crashing down after a panic attack halfway through a workday left her sobbing in the pews of the nearest church. Just six months into her job, the little voice in her head was telling her that she was on the wrong path, and she knew she had to make a change. Of course, she was petrified by the idea of leaving her job behind (especially with the mountain of debt that came with the pursuit of the American dream), and she didn’t know if she’d ever find something that would truly fulfill her. Determined to figure it out, Forleo eventually made her way to a new career path that would not only bring her happiness, but would also enrich the lives of many others experiencing their own difficulties. Today, Forleo inspires millions through her work as a life coach. She has over 578,000 YouTube subscribers on her award-winning channel, MarieTV, with over 49 million views spanning 195 countries. She’s also ushered 55,000 students through her eight-week marketing school for business owners called B-School. She’s even been interviewed by Oprah herself. And now, Forleo’s got a new book coming out, Everything Is Figureoutable, in which she unpacks the life lessons that she considers to be the secrets to her own success. While coaching wasn’t her next, or even her next-next career choice after leaving Wall Street in the dust, by trusting her gut, advice from her parents, and the tiny voice of truth in her head, she found her way there eventually and built a life she loved. Struggling to Start When she was younger, Forleo dreamed of becoming a Disney animator or a fashion designer. But amid her disillusion with the job on Wall Street, all she could think was, “What else am I going to do?” With her head spinning and stomach performing an intricate gymnastics routine, she called her dad. She was horrified by the idea of disappointing him, but didn’t know what else to do. “I was quite broken,” she says. She told her dad about how unfulfilled her coworkers seemed, her growing fear that she would end up like them, and her unmet desire to do something that brought joy to herself and others.\xa0 After baring her soul, Forleo nervously waited for her dad’s response. What he said would shape the course of her entire life. He reminded her that she would be working for the next 40 years or more of her life, and she needed to spend that valuable time doing something she loved. She quit her job two weeks later. But as little voices in our heads often do, Forleo’s told her just enough to get her out the door, but didn’t offer much insight on what she should do next. She loved design, but was also fascinated by business, so she decided to give the world of magazine publishing a go. Through a temp agency, she got an ad sales assistant position at Gourmet magazine. Forleo loved her boss and publisher, and, with a desk conveniently located right next to the test kitchen, she believed she had finally found her niche. But six months in, the voices of doubt took up their chorus once again. “I couldn’t deny the fact that I didn’t want to be there,” she says. Forleo wondered whether a more creative role in the magazine industry would quiet the voices, so she snagged a job on the editorial team of Mademoiselle. Sure enough, when she reached that six-month hurdle, the voices told her that, once again, it was time to move on. Discouraged, frustrated, and afraid for her future, Forleo wondered if there was just something wrong with her. Why couldn’t she find any work that made her truly happy? A Calling for Coaching The profession of life coaching wasn’t something most college graduates in the 1990s considered or even knew existed. In fact, Thomas Leonard, who is commonly called the father of the profession, only began his work in the 1980s. So when Forleo stumbled across an article about life coaching in the early 2000s, it was as if she was uncovering a buried treasure. “When I read this article, I swear to you, it was like the clouds parted and cherubs came out and they were shooting little sunbeams into my chest,” she says. At just 23, Forleo questioned whether she had anything to offer as a coach, but she says something about it just felt right. So she enrolled immediately in a three-year, part-time training program. When the six-month wall that had diverted her path so many times arrived, she pushed through it like tissue paper. And for the last two decades, Forleo’s “move along” voices have been silent. In 2001, she launched her first weekly newsletter, called Magical Moments, which attracted a modest following. Slowly, but steadily, her reach grew. Forleo attributes much of her success to her tremendous patience, calling herself “a worker bee.” Her skills and audience grew, and she launched new, ever-evolving platforms. As the 2000s rolled into the 2010s, Forleo launched B-School, her online course on marketing for business owners, as well as her wildly successful YouTube channel, MarieTV. But her journey wasn’t all unicorns and balloons. She encountered moments of failure (like the time she tried to build a custom coaching platform without a lick of relevant tech expertise), but each one taught her a valuable lesson. “I realized the power of positive quitting,” she says. “I think there’s a big distinction between giving up and moving on.” She also learned the principal of, as she puts it, “simplifying to amplify.” As Forleo began to draw international attention for the work she was doing, she felt the pressure to create more, attend more, and give more. Pulled in so many directions, the beginnings of burnout set in and she felt she wasn’t giving her best to her flourishing business. “Having a really successful, thriving business is not just about the money,” she says, emphasizing each word. “How does your team operate? How do they feel showing up to work every day? How do you, as the founder, feel? Are you so stressed out that you want to run away and hate that you even started this thing?” So in 2013, she decided to scale back and focus instead on the things that enabled her to make the most impact. She says she killed over a million dollars in revenue with a snap of her fingers. But the flood of creativity and renewed sense of direction that followed laid the groundwork for her to rapidly recuperate that amount and much more. So when others tell her that she should be investing more time in a particular platform or conference or trend that she feels will take her off track, she has no problem saying no. “I’m not out there to chase things,” she says. “I’m not going after vanity metrics. I give no shits about any of that. The metrics that matter to me are the lives I can impact, the profitability of the company, the difference I can make through our philanthropic endeavors, and am I actually enjoying my life.” She also knows who to listen to when considering what to add to her business—her customers. “The feedback, the iteration, the constantly making it better is how you get to something that’s legendary,” she says. “And I think folks don’t have the patience or the ability to focus over time and the desire to make something extraordinary, and that’s why we have so much mediocre.” Forleo says that the Customer Happiness department is the largest chunk of her 30-member team because they are committed to responding to every single email received. So, for example, when she noticed an influx of emails from MarieTV viewers lamenting that they most enjoyed listening to her show in the car as they drove but hated running up their data, she created a podcast to solve the problem. And if anything is clearly evident, it’s that Forleo is, to her core, a committed problem solver, a trait she attributes to her enterprising mother. Sharing Her Secret to Success Forleo’s mom, the child of two alcoholic parents from the projects of north New Jersey, “learned by necessity how to stretch a dollar bill around the block like five times.” She was always looking for ways to save money, so if something was broken and the price for a professional to fix it was too steep, she would fix it herself. From a leaky roof to cracked bathroom tiles, lack of experience or a college degree didn’t keep Forleo’s mother from tackling even the most complicated projects. One day, Forleo found her mom hard at work fixing her favorite radio, a Tropicana orange with a red and white straw for an antenna. Staring at the fully disassembled radio, amazed, Forleo asked her mom how she planned to put it back together again. Her mom told her that nothing is too complicated if you just jump in and get to work, because “everything is figureoutable.” That conviction lodged itself deep in Forleo’s heart, and it carried her through everything life threw at her, from difficult relationships to launching her own business. So when the time came to write her second book, she knew she had to share this principle with the world. In Everything Is Figureoutable, which comes out this month, Forleo builds on three simple rules:  \xa0 \xa0 All problems (or dreams) are figureoutable. \xa0 \xa0 If a problem isn’t figureoutable, it’s not a problem. It’s a fact of life. \xa0 \xa0 You may not care enough to solve this particular problem or reach this particular dream, and that’s OK. Find something you really do care about, and go back to Rule #1.  While these principles can be used in every aspect of life, Forleo feels they are particularly applicable to entrepreneurship, a career path she feels is often “over-glammed.” She says that being an entrepreneur is a lot harder than it looks because it’s all about suffering in the short term to reach long-term goals, and sometimes that period of suffering can feel neverending. “I think we all really feel stuck in our lives from time to time, but if you do embed this belief that everything really is figureoutable, it gives you this energy to get up and go again,” she says. Forleo also insists that the ability to change direction is essential for a business owner. “To survive as an entrepreneur, you have to be incredibly nimble and flexible and to keep evolving yourself,” she says. “Otherwise, you’ll get left in the dust.” And she advises any founders who are living in fear or doubt about their business or career path to pull out a trusty journal and write it all down. “We, just as humans, underestimate the value of writing things out and writing things down,” she says. “When it comes to feeling stuck—when it comes to feeling fear, which can stop many of us—we allow it to stay amorphous and kind of shapeless like a boogeyman in our head, rather than being concrete and specific about it on the page.” Forleo’s particular brand of down-to-earth optimism has inspired millions, and, through her new book, she is excited by a new opportunity to share a piece of how she achieved her dreams. As Forleo’s business continues to grow, expand and evolve, one thing has remained ever constant: the belief that her audience can fashion a life they love, just like she did. Because, after all, everything is figureoutable.

Dave Gilboa could not stop asking himself that question. After leaving his $700 pair of eyeglasses on an airplane while returning from Southeast Asia, he could not wrap his head around why a technology that was so archaic could cost him more than his iPhone. Within his first weeks as an MBA student at the Wharton School of Business, he repeatedly brought this question up among some of his new peers. Gilboa, along with fellow students Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, and Jeff Raider, had all shared in the pain of losing or breaking glasses and had all agreed: the high markup made no sense. Inspired by Gilboa’s pricey misfortune, the four of them founded Warby Parker. Now led by co-CEOs Gilboa and Blumenthal, the billion-dollar empire with 2,000 employees is revolutionizing the prescription glasses industry by selling stylish eyewear online at affordable prices. The New York City-based company is also on a mission to combat the global problem of impaired vision through its charitable Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. Since the company’s start, the program has distributed over 5 million pairs of glasses to those in need by donating a pair of glasses for every one sold. But long before they could build an ecommerce giant, the team would first have to learn how to even build a website. A Moment of Clarity Prior to going to Wharton, all four co-founders had already spent some considerable time in the workforce. This allowed for each of them to gain valuable real-world experience, and it helped guide them to understanding if they had an actual problem to solve and a business to move forward with. However, it was Blumenthal’s experience while running the nonprofit VisionSpring that would become crucial to the early concept of Warby Parker. During his time with the company, they trained low-income women in the developing world to start their own businesses. Participants were to take their new skillsets back to their rural communities and administer vision screenings and sell glasses. But it was something else Blumenthal had witnessed that would have a lasting impression on him. “I had been to the factories,” Blumenthal says. “Here I was producing glasses for people who were making less than four dollars a day, but 10 feet away were factories that were producing…the $700 pair of glasses Dave had. So we knew something was awry.” A light bulb went off and the classmates soon pulled together $120,000 and went to work on developing Warby Parker in 2008. The problem they wanted to solve: How can we make glasses we want, but at a low cost? Eager to launch, but more focused on preparation and planning, the founders began sketching out all the main aspects of the company. With limited funding, they knew they’d have to really refine and plan each facet of their business before revealing it to the public. Their first steps were to design glasses that they’d want to wear and then find a manufacturer who could produce them for less, starting with Blumenthal’s connections. The next step would be trying to figure out how to sell their glasses directly to the consumer. The answer was simple. “This magical thing called the internet,” Blumenthal says. The founders all knew that ecommerce was an innovation they wanted to take advantage of for their direct-to-consumer brand. Had they come up with this idea 10 years prior, the company may not have gone any further than an idea. With a brick-and-mortar store requiring a lease, utilities, and other costs, they knew it would be hard to make their new dream a reality with limited capital. “If we did , we would have one location that we might be able to attract some local customers, but with the power of the internet, we were able to all of a sudden, launch a store to the entire US,” Gilboa says. But there was a small problem. None of them knew how to build an online store, nor did they understand the many other details that came with creating an online shopping experience. “We started talking to friends on how you build a website,” Blumenthal says. “And then we started visiting a bunch of websites that we would normally already go to. But now with a critical eye, we were understanding, okay, what’s the shopping flow?” Over the next year and a half, the four of them kept chipping away at all the details of Warby Parker. Nothing got overlooked. They spent countless hours going over the vision and mission of the company, and worked on all the brand architecture of what they wanted their company to be. In addition, the group constantly sought out feedback from friends and professors. Could something like this work? One glaring concern that kept surfacing was whether or not a person would actually buy a pair of glasses online. With fit being so important, it would be hard for a person to gauge on a computer screen if a pair of glasses would fit their face and feel comfortable. This forced them to reconsider their business model, and ever the problem solvers, the home try-on program was born. Breaking new ground, Warby Parker would allow a customer to select five pairs of glasses from the website and then ship them free of charge, allowing five days to test out the frames. This was a major ecommerce innovation that would get them past the biggest challenge facing the business’s core premise. But there was one other challenge that would prove nearly impossible to overcome—agreeing on a name. Thank You, Jack Prior to Warby Parker’s launch, brands had already started to emerge that were selling glasses online. Customers were able to purchase glasses from sites such as 39DollarGlasses.com and FramesDirect.com, but they were sacrificing other elements, such as quality and customer service, for their lower prices. The founders wanted to take a different approach with their company. They wanted to launch a fashion brand that not only offered great quality, prices, and service, but also one that made the world a better place. The company vision was clear and ambitious. But they could not come up with a name. “We wanted kind of a proper name and didn’t think Gilboa-Blumenthal, our last names, really rolled off the tongue,” Gilboa says. They sought out inspiration and ideas from historical authors and artists. People who represented the brand ideals that they were trying to carry out. One author that stood out to them was Jack Kerouac, the novelist and poet who was a pioneer of the beat generation. Coincidentally, the New York Public Library was holding an exhibit one afternoon with some of Kerouac’s private diaries and journals. Seeking inspiration, Gilboa made a visit to the exhibit and stumbled upon some of Kerouac’s unpublished works, finding some interesting character names. Two jumped off the page: Warby Pepper and Zagg Parker. “So I took those back and the four of us were discussing,” Gilboa says. “We all loved those names and were debating, do we pick one of those, and we decided to combine the two and make it our own. And the URL happened to be available for nine bucks.” After six months of debating and with over 2,000 names rejected, Warby Parker came to life. Getting Noticed The challenge for any new brand is figuring out how to gain exposure. With a small marketing budget, the co-founders had to be strategic about finding a cost-effective way to maximize their exposure in such a competitive industry. Realizing glasses are an accessory and that the fashion industry was an insider’s game, the team hired a fashion publicist to help set up meetings with editors and writers at major publications. In February of 2010, WarbyParker.com officially went live. Within days of launching the website, they were featured in GQ, where they were dubbed “the Netflix of eyewear.” Soon after, another profile appeared in Vogue. From there, things went viral. “We ended up hitting our first year’s sales targets in three weeks,” Blumenthal says. “Sold out of our top 15 styles in four weeks and it was just complete mayhem.” Soon, they found themselves sold out of all their inventory with a waitlist of over 20,000 new customers. Warby Parker was an overnight success, a year and a half in the making. Onward & Upward Today, Warby Parker is  valued at over $1 billion and has cemented its place among the top glasses retailers in the world. Even after they made it to the big time, however, the team kept innovating.  In 2013, Gilboa and Blumenthal began to expand their brand with more storefronts, having now opened close to 100 stores in the US and Canada. And within some of those stores, they’ve begun to employ their own optometrists where states allow it. On the technology side, they’ve found new ways to cater to the customer. Within the Warby Parker app, any customer with an iPhone X can now virtually try on any one of their frames. In addition, they’ve made a move into telemedicine by allowing eligible customers to take eye exams from their phones, allowing a licensed doctor to write them a prescription remotely. But no matter how large the company becomes, the team’s underlying values remain the same: they do whatever it takes to make customers happy. 3 Tips for Standing Out From the Crowd When Neil Blumenthal, Dave Gilboa, Andrew Hunt, and Jeff Raider founded Warby Parker in 2010, they knew it wouldn’t be easy. But with the right planning, execution, and maybe some good luck, they felt they could make the world a little better, one pair of glasses at a time. The founding team knew that in order to get any attention in the noisy fashion industry, they had to be different and they had to stand out. Here are Blumenthal and Gilboa’s tips for helping your new startup gain exposure.  Be Novel  From the beginning, the founders knew that it would be hard to get any immediate attention in the fashion industry without the help of insiders. They knew their service and product would be different from any other retailer before them, but if no one knew who they were, it wouldn’t matter. So the team hired a fashion publicist to get them meetings with top fashion publications. By being able to tell their story directly to their target audience, and through a medium that their audience trusted, it was a giant step in the right direction. And since Warby Parker was so different from its competitors, once it got on the insider crowd’s radar, it wasn’t hard for them to draw media attention. “There was a bunch of things that we were doing that were novel,” Blumenthal says. “Selling glasses online, in 2010, was pretty novel. Having this home try-on program was really novel. Providing a pair of glasses for every pair we sell, was really novel. Charging $95 instead of $500 was really novel. So they really wanted to write about us.” In today’s startup world, it’s never been more crowded and harder to stand out. Be different with your concept and separate yourself from the fray.  Don’t Get Distracted\xa0  Although WarbyParker.com went live in February of 2010, the four co-founders spent over a year and a half focusing on their company’s mission, product, and business model. And after they found success, staying focused became an even more important priority. “We got some advice early on that if you’re walking down a path towards a giant pot of gold, you shouldn’t stop to get distracted by any shiny little coin that you see along the way,” Gilboa says. It would have been easy for Warby Parker to launch dozens of different products or to expand into new markets for monetary gain. However, that would’ve brought about great distractions that could have pulled them from their main goal, which is to solve their customers’ problems by offering them quality products and experiences. “We’ve just seen so many businesses that have failed due to lack of focus,” Gilboa says. “But it’s rare that you’ll see a business that fails for being too focused.” Remember the problems your business is trying to solve and stay focused on it. By always learning and iterating, you’re working towards providing the best service possible for your customers.  Above All Else, Make the Customer Happy  From the very beginning, the Warby Parker team knew they had to keep their customers happy. They understood that they had to not only provide a great product, but also provide superb customer service. In the beginning, all four co-founders were directly in touch with their customers. They each replied to customer emails and even set up an 800 number that would be sent to their personal cell phones until someone picked up. They were willing to do anything to make sure the customer was always satisfied. “Do whatever it takes to make customers happy and make them feel good,” Blumenthal says. “Smile, personal notes, whatever it takes.” Interview by Nathan Chan, feature article reprinted from Foundr Magazine, by Nick Allen  Key Takeaways  How losing a pair of $700 glasses led Blumenthal and Gilboa, along with fellow MBA students Andrew Hunt and Jeff Raider, to identify a major business problem How Blumenthal’s experience of running a nonprofit informed the early stages of Warby Parker A look into the 1.5 year process of bringing the co-founders’ business idea to life Why the team decided to merge eyewear and ecommerce The process of familiarizing themselves with the world of online shopping and websites How the name Warby Parker came to be, and why it took brainstorming over 2,000 names to get there The team’s cost-effective approach to marketing and launching the website How powerful press placement led to a sold-out inventory and a waitlist of over 20,000 new customers within weeks What’s in store (literally) for the future of Warby Parker The single piece of advice Gilboa and Blumenthal received that helped them be successful, and how other entrepreneurs can apply it to their own business  | Success On Demand\xa0 How Printful co-founder Davis Siksnans rose to the top by helping entrepreneurs custom print and ship products with greater speed and ease.\xa0\xa0 Davis Siksnans’ motto as an entrepreneur has always been, “If you can’t find it, build it.” It’s led him to some fascinating and quirky pursuits, from building a business that sells customized friendship bracelets to launching an ecommerce store that creates motivational posters for startups.\xa0 Having spent much of his career working at a startup incubator, coming up with ideas and helping to bring them into reality, much of Siksnans’ expertise has involved smoothing out and speeding up that business-building experience. He’s especially excelled at improving the fulfillment process, allowing businesses to whip up clever ecommerce product ideas and then ship them out to eager customers in a heartbeat.\xa0 While not all of his ventures took off, they were critical stepping stones to Siksnans building his most successful business yet—Printful. This leading drop-shipping, fulfillment, and printing business has mastered the process of creating on-demand ecommerce products. As a result, Printful has grown exponentially since its launch six years ago and now has a 500-person team across the U.S., Mexico, and Europe.\xa0 Survival of the Fittest Long before his days as Printful’s CEO and co-founder, Siksnans always knew he would end up doing something in tech. Fascinated by technology from a young age, he taught himself to code, saved up his allowance to purchase his first computer, and built custom websites for his friends and neighbors. In the process, he realized he had a knack for turning ideas into businesses.\xa0 So it came as no surprise when Siksnans secured his first job as an IT administrator with Draugiem Group, a startup incubator and one of the most exciting technology companies to work for in his home country of Latvia.\xa0 Over the course of 15 years, Draugiem Group funded over 100 business ideas. Today, only 12 of these businesses remain, which is the nature of entrepreneurship, Siksnans says. What makes Draugiem’s model unique is that it doesn’t source ideas from outsiders—only from its own founders and employees. This means that everyone at the company has the opportunity to come up with the next big idea. “At Draugiem, if you do good work and gather trust, you’re given more opportunities to step up in your career,” Siksnans says. “I was given the chance to work on business ideas based on the fact that the founders thought I was doing a good job.” Timing was also on Siksnans’ side, as Draugiem Group was just starting to focus on the US market for the first time. He had previously completed an exchange program in the United States for one year and was familiar with the market, so Siksnans officially began his career as an entrepreneur. Take Your Vitamins After experimenting with a variety of ideas under the banner of Draugiem Group, Siksnans hit gold with Startup Vitamins, a company that sells, no not vitamins, but motivational posters.\xa0 Siksnans and his team initially came up with the concept when they moved into a new office space that had ample wall space and wanted to put up some posters. But they couldn’t find any designs they liked. That’s when his motto of, “If we can’t find it, let’s build it” came into play, and Siksnans decided to launch a Shopify store to meet this need.\xa0 Initially, the Shopify store sold posters with motivational sayings such as “Life is short. Don’t be lazy.” He and his team started off with one printer in the Los Angeles home of one of the founders, which made it convenient to produce posters on-demand and was also low-cost.\xa0 After seeing promising growth, Siksnans decided to expand by taking on the biggest category in ecommerce—apparel. He liked selling posters because they could be easily printed on demand and didn’t require inventory. He wanted to replicate that model with apparel, so Startup Vitamins started working with a fulfillment partner that could produce on-demand products.\xa0 This turned out to be a horrible experience. The fulfillment partner’s website was clunky; it took one-to-two weeks to fulfill orders; the quality of products was subpar; and there was no public API—no way to automate the orders that were coming into Startup Vitamins.\xa0 That got Siksnans thinking. Testing Theories Siksnans realized that there was a significant gap when it came to services that could produce on-demand and high-quality products at a reasonable speed. He also recognized the lack of a powerful API that could integrate with ecommerce platforms like Etsy, Shopify, and Storenvy. He decided to test this theory, and that’s how the idea for Printful came to life. The key difference was that, with such an API, his company could allow clients to automatically receive and process orders for their online business instead of serving as the middleman. “When we launched Printful in 2013, we didn’t even own the domain printful.com because we didn’t know if this idea was going to work or not," Siksnans says. "Maybe it would fail and we would have to refocus. We used Startup Vitamins’ mailing list as our first marketing channel to push out Printful’s services because our customers overlapped—startups that were likely to be open to using print-on-demand in their respective niches." Printful found product-market fit immediately. Its combination of drop shipping (when an ecommerce store purchases inventory from a third party and has it shipped directly to the consumer) with a custom print API and other services made it easy for anybody to sell posters, t-shirts, canvases, and other merchandise, seamlessly. As a result, Printful made around $800 in revenue in its first month, then $1,600 the next, and the business only kept growing from there. In under six months, Printful had become larger than Startup Vitamins.\xa0 Lessons on Scaling Since its launch, Printful has seen impressive growth. The company now has a team of more than 500, locations in four geographies, 6.83 million orders fulfilled to date, and $540 million in products sold by its customers.\xa0 Of course, with growth comes growing pains, which Siksnans says has been one of the toughest aspects of his job. He has turned to certain resources to help him navigate the challenges around scaling. “I recommend the book Scaling Up by Verne Harnish," Siksnans says. "Whenever I see a person in management struggling with growing pains, I give them this book and discuss it with them. It contains so many great practices and tactics, and it shows that this is a normal process that many companies have dealt with."\xa0 Siksnans also emphasizes the importance of collaborating across cultures. At Printful, they make a point of educating team members about cultural differences. The company also invests in resources to make sure its employees have the opportunity to travel between Latvia and the United States to conduct knowledge and culture transfers.\xa0 While it’s important to acknowledge the differences among Printful’s various locations, Siksnans believes it’s critical to maintain a thread of consistency throughout every employee’s experience.\xa0 He once sat in on an onboarding process for an employee in Riga, Latvia and noticed it lacked many of the helpful components found in the US process, so he connected both HR departments to make sure they were added. That’s why Siksnans stays involved in all of Printful’s HR processes—from running new hire trainings for employees once a month to being involved in the recruiting process. Looking Forward Siksnans has several thoughtful predictions for the future of the print-on-demand and drop-shipping industry.\xa0 For starters, he envisions decreased reliance on advertising. As Facebook ads become more expensive over time, Siksnans believes it will become increasingly important to build microbrands. This means becoming less reliant on advertisements and turning more to influencers, who have powerful audiences on social media and promote products organically to their user bases.\xa0 Siksnans also anticipates potential policy changes around shipping. Consumers are already demanding faster shipping speeds as companies like Amazon set a new standard. He’s keeping an eye on what happens with the Universal Postal Union, the UN agency that coordinates postal policies among different nations. They’re experiencing many issues, for example, the fact that it’s cheaper to ship a mug from China to New York than it is to ship a mug within New York. As a result, some countries are already taking steps to limit the influx of cheap drop-shipped goods coming from other countries.\xa0 Finally, Siksnans is focused on understanding ecommerce algorithms. A growing base of users is leaning into newer marketplaces such as Etsy, which have less advanced ranking algorithms to figure out than sources like Amazon or Facebook advertisements. As a result, Siksnans is noticing a lot of people finding success by learning the ins and outs of various internet marketplaces. Regardless of which direction the market goes, Siksnans believes Printful is well positioned to continue growing. All of this success came as a result of him identifying a need and deciding to go for it—a mindset he believes all founders should emulate.\xa0 “I have a lot of people asking me when is the right time to start,” Siksnans says. “There’s no right time when someone is ready to start anything new. You will never feel ready, so just start now.”\xa0 Davis Siksnans’ 4 Tips on Scaling Company Culture  Hire people who love to learn. Siksnans picked up this concept from the book How to Castrate a Bull by Dave Hitz. The basic premise is that your business won’t scale if your team won’t scale with it. That’s why it’s critical to look for employees who are eager to learn because they’ll be more willing to grow with the company and embrace the changes that come with it.\xa0 Stay aligned with your values. Initiative, integrity, and experimentation. These are Printful’s company values, and Siksnans ensures they’re embedded into the DNA of the organization. He does this by weaving the values into the onboarding process, making sure they’re conveyed across every location, and working with managers to help them embody the company culture.\xa0 Prioritize culture fit. While it may be tempting to hire the most qualified candidate, Siksnans recommends putting culture fit first. “Don’t hire people who don’t embody your culture. I’ve had interviews with managers who met the professional criteria but weren’t a culture fit. It almost hurts to pass on those candidates, but I believe it’s more important to find someone who fits on a cultural level than on a professional level,” Siksnans says. Encourage cross-team collaboration. It’s easy for holes to emerge in cross-team communication as a company scales. That’s why Printful has a process of having new hires meet with people outside of their own department to ask questions about their roles. For instance, a new marketer might meet with the finance department to learn more about their day-to-day functions. This is a helpful practice to break down barriers and improve intra-team collaboration.\xa0  \xa0 Interview by Nathan Chan, feature article reprinted from Foundr Magazine, by Sophia Lee  Key Takeaways  How his first job as an IT administrator at startup incubator Draugiem Group nurtured his entrepreneurial spirit How the motto of “if you can’t find, build it” led to Siksnans’ first successful business idea, Startup Vitamins Why ecommerce and the on-demand model were appealing to Siksnans How a bad experience with a fulfillment partner led to the launch of Printful The savvy marketing tactics used to test product-market fit for Printful The six-year journey to becoming a 500+ person team across four global locations Which books Siksnans recommend for startups experience growing pains The top lessons learned on scaling company culture Why it’s important to collaborate across multiple cultures and offices Siksnans’ thoughts on the future of the print-on-demand and drop shipping industry  | Where Data Meets Denim How Revolve founders Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas, a duo with backgrounds in finance and engineering, used data to take the fashion world by storm. You would think that finance, computer engineering, and fashion have nothing in common. But Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas, the founders of the wildly popular online clothing company Revolve, would beg to differ. It’s true that when they first met each other at a software startup, they never thought fashion was in their cards. After all, Mente was a finance guy and Karanikolas was a computer engineer. They weren’t exactly cozying up to the catwalk. And yet, a series of unfortunate events led Mente and Karanikolas to the retail business, which ended up yielding quite the fortunate outcome—together, they built a billion-dollar business that serves as inspiration for any entrepreneur looking to get into the online apparel game. Using their respective strengths in analytics and number crunching, they developed a hunch that there was a gap in the market when it came to places young, millennial women could buy fashion brands online. Their hunch proved to be correct. From there, it was Revolve\'s famously prescient marketing strategy — in particular, the company\'s influencer marketing — that set them apart from other online clothing brands coming onto the market. "We had first-mover advantage and recognized power of social early on. We’re been working with influencers before they were even called influencers — before instagram even existed," Karanikolas says. With their near-perfect product-market fit and the love of influencers like Chrissy Teigen, Chanel Iman, and Jessica Alba, the California-based company has grown from being a small online store to an iconic billion-dollar business. Challenging the Mainstream Mente and Karanikolas were both working at the software startup NextStrat when the dotcom bubble burst, kicking off a recession that eventually led to the company’s collapse. That’s when the duo started to brainstorm ideas for a new venture. They knew they made a great team and had a feeling they could achieve big things together, it was simply a matter of finding the right opportunity. Given their math and engineering backgrounds, they approached the research process of finding that new endeavor in a very methodical way. Ecommerce was on the rise, and after digging into keyword search data, they noticed there was growing interest around online apparel. There were other attractive aspects of the apparel business too, such as the fact that it promised high gross margins and was a relatively untouched market in the late 90s and early 2000s. “There were a lot of questions about whether apparel made sense online at that time,” Karanikolas says. “But any time there’s a new space, that means there’s room for innovation. We recognized that online represented a wealth of opportunities, and it was just a matter of figuring how this new medium worked for apparel and how to make it appealing for consumers.” It didn’t take them long. From Denim to Dominance Mente and Karanikolas launched Revolve in 2003 with $50,000 of their own savings. That meant carefully watching cash flow was extremely important, which forced the duo to be highly disciplined about how they made decisions. Even early on, they leaned heavily on data to inform what products to sell. The core of their business model was to sell clothing from other brands, start with existing numbers, and then test and iterate as they identified what worked and what didn’t. For instance, they initially assumed denim would be one of the hardest types of clothing to sell online, since fit is so important and there are lots of size variations. Through data analysis, however, they discovered that people actually did shop for jeans online and even returned them less frequently than other clothing categories. So for the first year or two of running Revolve, denim made up a majority of their business, which led to their first wave of success with the company. They also weren’t afraid to go against the grain in how they ran an online store. When they realized the inherent risk that came with buying online due to fit issues, they instituted a policy of free shipping and returns. Mente and Karanikolas also quickly recognized the importance of having big, high-quality photos of their apparel—so they kicked standard web guidelines to the curb and covered their site with beautiful images, even if it meant it took a little longer to load. “There were all sorts of different ways we approached retail and online fashion that ended up working out really well for us,” Mente says. “Eventually, we came to understand the creative and aesthetic side of things more and become expert in areas we weren’t before. That piece took us many years to develop, and it wasn’t easy because it didn’t leverage our initial core strengths. But building that expertise on top of our existing strengths helped us become really powerful.” Struggling to Survive Mente and Karanikolas’ journey wasn’t without difficult times. They were still self funded when the Great Recession hit in 2008. Demand plummeted, and they saw that competitors were responding with extreme discounts, which made it challenging to make money. Despite the fact that they were fighting for their lives, Mente and Karanikolas agree that this period actually led to incredible personal and professional growth. It also showed them they had the right company culture and people to get them through these challenging times. The duo recalls one particular memory with fondness. Since Revolve also had to offer discounts to make sales during the recession, they had to ship a massive volume of product to remain profitable. During this time, every single employee voluntarily came out to the warehouse on weekends to help get all the products out on time. That’s when Karanikolas and Mente knew they would survive and come out on the other side as a stronger company. Standing Out Revolve is now a major player in an incredibly competitive online apparel market. But Mente and Karanikolas aren’t worried because they’ve come to deeply understand one of the most important lessons in marketing: You’ve got to stand out from the noise. The way they do this is by leaning into the authenticity of their brand. Everything, from the events they host to the people they work with, is saturated with a genuine desire to grow relationships with consumers. It has never been about trying to outspend their competitors. This type of commitment to their consumers is also what led the founders to start Revolve’s own line of clothing back in 2010. Through data and conversations with their audience, they knew that there were products they either didn’t have a big enough selection of, or weren’t stocking fast enough. They realized they had the ability to provide a better product and have since launched an array of new clothing lines to meet the different needs of their customers. Next Level of Growth Karanikolas and Mente are optimistic about the future of Revolve. “There are more opportunities today than ever, and we’re the best positioned we’ve ever been in the history of our company. We’re trying to build one of the biggest fashion and apparel companies out there,” Karanikolas says. The duo plan to continue focusing on their core business of building a better experience for their target consumers, youthful women in 20s-30s looking for premium fashion. They’re passionate about getting better at everything they do, from improving their data to creating better products. Thoughts of further international expansion are top of mind for the founders as well, given that more than 40% of their social media following is international. When it comes to the secret of success, the duo say there isn’t one—it’s simply about putting in the hard work, grit, and perseverance. “There’s so much chance involved in the short term, but if you keep making the right steps, over the long run you’ll go in the direction you want, even though there are periods of time where it feels like things aren’t working for you,” Karanikolas says. “It’s a lot of hard work, but it’s going to be more rewarding than anything you’ve ever done.” Mente agrees and leaves aspiring entrepreneurs with an additional piece of wisdom. “Hard work and dedication are 100% important, but another aspect is to take care of yourself and your life,” he says. “Your physical, mental, friendships, and relationships are all important as well. When you’re living well, you’re thinking clearly, healthier, and more productive over the long run. You need to recharge and have some balance in your life. It’s something I’m still trying to learn.” 3 Tips to Build a Powerful Consumer Brand, From Michael Mente & Mike Karanikolas  Define core principles. It’s important to clearly identify which principles drive your brand—make sure those values are authentic to your organization and aren’t just an imitation of other organizations. From there, all decisions should map back to these principles to ensure the brand is consistent. Understand the landscape. You have to know who you’re competing against so you can figure out how to spread your message more broadly in the market. This also means figuring out who your primary consumers are and where they’re spending their time, as well as discovering your own message that’s positioned well and unique enough to mean something, but not so niche that your target audience is too small. Be consistent, but don’t be afraid to be flexible. “Know what you stand for and make sure you’re consistent in communicating that message. What you stand for has to make sense for the consumer segment you’re targeting in comparison to the competitive space,” Karanikolas says. However, he also says that it’s okay to refine your brand message. “We actually have consistently used data to refine our brand message. In other words, what are consumers responding to? There are things we knew from the start but also evolved as we learned from data.”  Interview by Nathan Chan, feature article reprinted from Foundr Magazine, by Sophia Lee  Key Takeaways  How Mente and Karanikolas’ paths crossed while working at a software startup How the dotcom bubble led the duo to start brainstorming new ventures How their backgrounds in finance and engineering helped them decide on an online apparel business The launch of Revolve, with $14,000 out of pocket Why every business decision was driven by data The duo’s breakthrough with denim How Revolve survived (and thrived) through the Great Recession in 2008 Mente and Karanikolas’ recommendations on standing out in a crowded market How Revolve changed the game of influencer marketing The importance of knowing your consumers, not outspending your competitors The future of Revolve’s global presence  | In business, everyone wants to win.

Raegan Moya-Jones was an Aussie in New York City, pregnant with her first daughter, and she couldn’t find the right baby blanket. Every Australian mother from time immemorial had swaddled her baby in a cotton muslin blanket, and Moya-Jones wanted to do the same. But no matter where she looked, she couldn’t find one. Rather than simply becoming frustrated by the futile search, she had an idea. “I figured that all Aussie parents couldn’t have it wrong, and if I introduced it to American parents, they’d feel the same way,” she says. “Luckily for me, my hunch was right!” Moya-Jones went on to found the successful baby product company aden + anais (partly named for her first daughter), publish a book about her journey, and launch a second business all while raising four daughters. Even when success turned sour, as it so often can in the entrepreneurial world, she didn’t let that stop her. Moya-Jones has weathered the heartbreaking end of a partnership and gut-wrenching business betrayals, becoming stronger, wiser, and more successful for it. A Rocky Start In 1997, Moya-Jones moved from Australia to New York, after her Chilean boyfriend landed a new job. She was partway through an MBA, but put it on hold to be with the man who is now her husband. Without a visa, she struggled to find work, but eventually managed to land a position at the Australian consulate. Through connections she built there, she moved into a job at a conference company and then into a position as a sales executive with The Economist, where she worked for over a decade. It was when she learned she was expecting her first child in 2003 that she began that fateful search for the perfect swaddle. For three years, she toyed with the idea of starting that business. As a first-time entrepreneur, she had to learn everything from product design to manufacturing, but in 2006, she set out to launch her brand. While she may not have had a completed MBA under her belt, she had years of experience in sales, a degree of common sense she felt she could truly rely on and, above all else, the drive to work as hard as it took. “I really am a huge believer that common sense and work ethic are the two keys to building a successful business. They’re the two most important things,” she says. “At the end of the day, it’s how much work you’re prepared to put in to be successful. I could never, ever have estimated how much work had to go into building a business from scratch.” For the next three years, Moya-Jones would work her day job, then return home to spend quality time with her family (which now included three daughters). But once the bedtime rituals were complete, she burned the midnight oil building her business, from 8:30 p.m. until 3:30 a.m. “It was pretty brutal,” she says. But the odd hours she kept weren\'t the only tough part from the early stages of aden + anais. Moya-Jones launched her business with her friend Claudia Schwartz, and for the first few years, they worked together flawlessly. They initially invested $15,000 each into the company to build a basic Yahoo website, design a logo, and make their first manufacturing order. They anticipated the investment would last them six to 12 months. The money ran out after eight weeks. They each invested another $30,000, but at this point, Moya-Jones had run through her savings. Timing is everything, and it wasn’t on their side. “We were starting out during the worst recession since the Great Depression, so it wasn’t really good timing in terms of having access to capital and people wanting to loan us money,” she says. So Claudia made an additional investment that Moya-Jones was unable to match, and once they asked Claudia’s father-in-law to grant them a $200,000 loan, Moya-Jones says she noticed a bubble of resentment growing. “I think the disparity in what I could contribute financially to what Claudia could was one of the biggest catalysts for the partnership dissolving,” she says. Moya-Jones says she found three other women to buy out Claudia’s 49% share in the business, and in 2008, the partnership ended. Off Like a Rocket Although Moya-Jones was struggling through the personal blow of saying goodbye to a friend, aden + anais was steadily growing into a healthy, flourishing business. “It was a rocketship in the early stages, for sure,” she says. The muslin blankets were an instant hit, and thanks to 20 years of sales experience, she was well equipped to get the products to those who wanted them most. Moya-Jones loaded up taxis with samples of her product and went door to door sharing it with every store that might be interested. “That’s where definitely my sales experience came in handy because I was extremely comfortable with that part of the business,” she says. In the early 2000s, brick-and-mortar stores still reigned supreme, so she wasn\'t yet focused on the ecommerce side of the business. She also chose to build relationships with existing retailers, rather than launching into fraught competition with them. “We didn’t want to piss off the retailers by competing against them with our own website and sales and everything,” she says. “Then, Amazon entered the picture, and of course, all bets were off at that point.” Meanwhile, Moya-Jones was still balancing her company with her day job. She didn’t want to cause financial strain on her family, which would eventually grow to four daughters, and she didn’t want to put added pressure on her business to perform. “It was my conscious decision to choose sleep deprivation over any kind of financial pressure on my family and on the business in the early stages,” she says. But the years of toil took their toll. “There were definitely times when my hair was falling out,” she admits. She still believed in her business, though, so she powered through the strain, set a goal for when she would leave her day job, and waited for the right moment to arrive. “Statistically, only 2% of all women-owned businesses ever break a million dollars in revenue,” she says. “I knew it was a pretty stretch goal, and so I sort of said, ‘Well, if I can get to a million in revenue, then I’m prepared to dive fully into aden + anais and quit my day job and give it a really good go,’ which is what I did.” In 2009, Moya-Jones went full time with the company. But even though her business was a success, she still needed additional investments to keep the business alive. She borrowed money from just about anyone who would lend it to her for nearly a year and a half after the dissolution of her partnership. “Initially, it was friends and family, and then it was friends of friends, and then once we got to the point where it was just obvious that we were never going to be able to scale doing it that way, that’s when I went out and looked for investment money,” she says. Although the business had traction, Moya-Jones says that she struggled to find investors. But in 2010, her first investor came aboard. That investment led to aden + anais’ first year of $10 million in revenue. A Dark Day and a New Dawn With the acquisition of another business in 2016, aden + anais pushed past the $100 million mark. But even as Moya-Jones’ success continued to blossom, disaster loomed on the horizon. In 2013, the first investors in the business departed, and their parting piece of advice to Moya-Jones was to bring in another private equity firm to share the load. They could never have known what this would mean for the company’s future. The new firm bought the majority share of aden + anais, which would lead to an internal struggle for the future of the business. “That’s when the whole thing started to go downhill for me,” she says. “We did not agree on the way forward. I don’t think they really understood me. This is the whole Stanford, Harvard, Yale backgrounds coming up against the crazy, opinionated Australian girl who has no education on a piece of paper to show. We just didn’t see eye-to-eye on very much at all. It was sort of the beginning of the end to tell you the truth.” Outspoken about her disagreements as she saw her beloved company moving in a direction she didn’t support, Moya-Jones was informed in 2016 that she was being moved from the position of CEO. “My story is actually way more common than I think people realize,” she says. After a string of failed replacements, a new CEO finally stuck, and in 2018, Moya-Jones was fired from her own company. “It was a pretty awful time,” she says. But the new firm had the controlling interest in the company, so they were well within their rights to show her the door. And it wasn’t as though Moya-Jones had planned to run the company forever. The luster of serving as CEO of a massive business had already started to fade for her, and she missed the rush of innovation. “Once you get up to the $60, $70, $80 million dollar mark, you just become the person that all you’re dealing with is shit every day,” she says. “The fun stuff everybody else is handling. The only time you’re really needed is when it’s too hard for somebody else or they don’t want to make the decision and deal with it.” But she still wishes she would never have sold the majority share, at least until she was prepared to exit on her own terms instead of being forced out as CEO. “I’m grateful in that I ended up making a very nice amount of money from aden + anais, but it’s definitely bittersweet. If I could do it all over again, I would do it differently.” To this day, she is still the single largest individual shareowner in aden + anais. But her story wasn’t over. In fact, a publisher soon approached Moya-Jones and asked her to share, well, what it takes. While she was initially hesitant because, as she says, until the business reached about $50 million in revenue, she was operating largely on common sense, she decided to move forward with the book when the publisher said they didn’t want a conventional outline of what it took to become successful. They just wanted her story. “To say I’m the antithesis of the MBA-educated business mind is an understatement,” she says. And in her book, What It Takes: How I Built a $100 Million Business Against the Odds, she shares just how she did it and hopes she inspires others to do the same. She believes that anyone could follow in her footsteps without any kind of training or prior experience, as long as they are willing to put in the work. And being asked to leave aden + anais didn’t keep the tenacious Moya-Jones down for long. Today, she is elbow-deep in a brand new business that has taken her “from babies to booze.” In June 2018, she co-founded the moonshine company Saint Luna Spirits. “We wanted to create a high-end moonshine that was served in five-star restaurants and the best cocktail bars out there,” she says. The business has already won gold and silver medals at spirit competitions, and after only a few weeks on the market, the label already appears in renowned establishments across New York, such as Jean-Georges and Employees Only. “It’s super fun to be back in the trenches building something and creating,” Moya-Jones says. And no matter what she does or where she goes next, by weathering the storms of her first business, Moya-Jones has proven unequivocally that she has what it takes. Raegan Moya-Jones Tips for Entrepreneurs Through successes and trials, Raegan Moya-Jones has build up an extensive bank of knowledge when it comes to launching and shepherding businesses, and these are some of the tips she shares with every entrepreneur she meets.  Use Common Sense  “Not all people have common sense, but what I’m trying to say is you don’t need to be an expert in really anything, I believe, to start and build a successful business.” \xa0  Think Twice Before Selling  “Never, ever sell the controlling interest of your company if you’re still passionately involved in it and dedicated to it.” Unless you are looking to exit a company for good, Moya-Jones recommends that founders think twice before relinquishing control, even for a nice payout. \xa0  Stay True to Yourself  “Everyone’s going to have an opinion. There will always be the people who want to come in once you’re successful to change the way you do things.” Moya-Jones reminds founders to trust their instincts and remain true to the things that help them launch and grow their business, even if others disagree.

Jasmine Shea is the founder of Your Dinner Is Planned, the easiest and most affordable way to cook healthy dinners for your family. Her thriving online membership brings brand-new, healthy recipes to its members each week, along with organized and portioned grocery checklists, and much more. Jasmine is very active on Instagram, and right now she is doing her launches on that platform. She’s been launching quarterly, where the doors have been open for 3 days, and then she builds a waitlist for her membership. Very recently she closed the cart on a $1 trial where new members get access to her content for 7 days, and she signed up 218 new members, with an impressive 74% of those people staying on for full payment after the 7-day trial.\xa0 Jasmine’s launches have been consistent, as last quarter she saw 206 new members join, but her top priority now is getting new members and seeing a significant increase in these numbers the next time she launches. We also talk about some other priorities for her, including how she wants to enhance her customer experience, and further improve her already strong retention numbers (and lifetime customer value). As you’ll hear, there is a lot that Jasmine is doing right at the moment, and she really knows her numbers. I’m going to be recommending some strategies that she can try that will help her reach her goals faster though, including a new way that she can launch monthly, instead of quarterly, without the launch process taking up all of her time and being stressful and overwhelming. At the end of the episode I detail the next steps for Jasmine, and she’s already working on integrating the strategies that we talk about here. She’s an action taker, and I have no doubt that she’ll continue to test and tweak her strategies, and the results will follow. My hope is that you too can gain valuable insights for your next launch from this strategy session! Before we start the show, I’ve got something to ask. At this time we have over 500 5-Star ratings and reviews on Apple Podcasts, which is great, but I’ve set a goal to get 750 of them by the end of Q3, Sept 30th, 2019, which is just a few short days away. If you’ve gotten value from this podcast, I’d really appreciate you subscribing and leaving an honest rating and review. Take a screenshot, share it on your Instagram Stories and tag me, @rickmulready. When we hit the 750 ratings and reviews, I’ll be raffling off a book bundle of my top 10 business and mindset books for one lucky winner. If you’ve already left a rating and review, just take a screenshot and tag me on Instagram, and you’ll be eligible to win as well! Want to win a 30-minute strategy session with me?

On the Show Today You’ll Learn:  A breakdown of Jasmine’s current numbers, including the churn rate for her membership, her average lifetime customer value, and how she looks at deciding on an ad budget to acquire new customers Why she switched to the $1 trial launch using Instagram, after previously running Facebook ads to cold traffic How Jasmine’s content to members is currently delivered, and a breakdown of her Instagram strategy and pre-launch phases A video strategy that I recommend where she can use what she already has created to leverage Facebook and Instagram targeting What offers Jasmine could use for her re-targeting ads A rundown of her ideal customer, “Katie”, and some additional ways that I think she can reach her (including lookalike audiences she can create and ways to test different audience sizes)  What a simplified monthly launch strategy could look for Jasmine and how I think it could help her achieve her vision for the company and her brand  Which audience I feel Jasmine should start focusing at this time, and the next steps for her to take - with deadlines!  | Welcome to another Quick Tip episode! This is where I share a quick tip with you each week that’s related to Facebook ads or online marketing or just general growing your business tips. Today’s quick tip is about Facebook’s Attribution Window and why it’s important. Let’s jump into it... Links & Resources Mentioned: https://rickmulready.com/training http://rickmulready.com/accelerator \xa0 | Facebook and Instagram ads aren’t difficult, but with so much talk about them being overwhelming and scary, I wanted to record this episode for everyone who thinks that they are “hard.”  I can speak from experience and say that once you get over this fear, it will allow you to gain traction and scale your business so much more quickly, like it did for my business when I started years ago.\xa0 What I’m seeing is that people either aren’t even trying to use Facebook and Instagram ads, or they’re giving up on them too soon, but trust me, they do work if you’re patient and you allow the algorithms to do what they’re supposed to do! As you’ll hear in this episode, it’s the people who are willing to try running ads and constantly test them (and then test them some more) who are going to win… What I am doing today is taking the mystery out of what makes successful Facebook and Instagram ads, and this is an episode that you’ll definitely want to go through more than once. Dive in, apply the strategies that I share, take action and start testing, because Facebook and Instagram ads really aren’t “hard!” Before we start the show, I’ve got something to ask.

This is where I share a quick tip with you each week that’s related to Facebook ads or online marketing or just general growing your business tips. Today’s quick tip is about what Facebook and Instagram ads stats to focus on when troubleshooting.\xa0 Let’s jump into it... Links & Resources Mentioned: https://rickmulready.com/accelerator https://rickmulready.com/training | My guest for this episode is Lianne Kim, who’s a member of my current Accelerator Mastermind and has appeared on The Art of Paid Traffic before. I had no idea where this conversation with Lianne was going to go, and I wasn’t even sure if I’d be using it for the podcast, but it was just too good not to share with all of you today. Lianne is a business coach who primarily serves mama entrepreneurs through her coaching programs and online membership community, Mamas & Co, which now has over 300 members (and growing). As you’ll hear in this episode, I met Lianne at one of my live events in May 2018 and I’ve had the honor of coaching her for a little over a year now. Whenever we have a group call I’m always so excited to hear how Lianne is going to show up, because she always comes with a positive attitude and that mindset shows in the results she achieves. It wasn’t always that way though, and Lianne is very open about the doubts and fears that she’s experienced along her journey as a business owner, including a time recently where she was expecting to fail even before tickets went on sale for her event, MamaCon. The big difference now is that Lianne is able to recognize these thought patterns within minutes, and she changes them before taking action from a better place, and not from one of fear. Lianne has come so far and now has a thriving multi-6-figure business, although it’s not just about the money for her. It’s really about having as big an impact as possible, and to do that, Lianne has had to get out of her comfort zone and learn to become the CEO and leader of her growing business.

On the Show Today You’ll Learn:  The tactical issue she thought she had last year, versus the bigger issue that was really at play The “a ha” moment that helped Lianne beat perfectionism (and her upper limit), and the mantra she uses to keep moving forward each day How she knew that she had to get support and the right team in place, as well as simplify her business and offerings The way Lianne’s “baking in the fun into the journey” and is working towards what success means to her Her thoughts on why entrepreneurs set monetary goals and the reframe she uses to judge how well her business is doing The process of define the roles for each of Lianne’s team members, her big plans to go global and how she’s now showing up – in a BIG way  | Welcome to another Quick Tip episode!\xa0 This is where I share a quick tip with you each week that’s related to Facebook ads or online marketing or just general growing your business tips.

Why am I sharing this? Well to be honest, this funnel hasn’t been performing anywhere near where I want it to be.

In this episode you’ll be seeing exactly what has been going on in my funnel, including what’s working well and what areas can be improved on, as well as all the stats and the steps I’m taking to make my funnel more effective.

Bo has one of the most unique back stories of any guest we’ve had on the show. After college, he was drafted by the Houston Oilers and played safety for them before a premature knee injury ended his career. After the NFL, Bo aspired to become the best stage performer of his time and spent time personally mentoring under Al Pacino before writing and starring in his one-man Broadway show, Runt of the Litter. In his third and current act, he's focused his energy on helping others both craft and tell their own stories from stage and is now a highly sought out speaker and coach. He dives into all of this and more in his soon-to-be-released book, There's No Plan B for Your A-Game, which we discuss in today’s conversation. Today, I’m honored to have him on the podcast to talk about how he's mastered the art of performance, what makes his presentation so compelling no matter how many times I’ve seen it, and how financial advisors can tell their story and make their own speaking engagements more effective on every level. \xa0 FREE OFFER  Get a FREE Autographed Copy of Bo Eason’s Book, There's No Plan B for Your A-Game: Be the Best in the World at What You Do Pre-Launch bonuses if you purchase 5 or more copies of Bo's new book.\xa0  Visit\xa0BradleyJohnson.com/62\xa0to see how you can claim your offer!\xa0 \xa0 SHOW NOTES To get access to today's show notes, including free offer, transcript, and links to all the resources mentioned, visit BradleyJohnson.com/62 | In today’s conversation, I grab some time with Carl Richards.

Carl and his work have also been featured on Oprah.com, and Forbes.com and he frequently keynotes at financial planning conferences around the world.

In celebration of Father’s Day, I appeared on the Generation.Mom podcast. Their podcast rarely features fathers as guests, so it was an honor to talk to Lara and Jenn about how to prioritize parenthood and where to start. Like many fathers, I felt underprepared when my first child was born. As my kids got older, I worked hard to find the right balance between being a parent, a partner, and a business leader. In today’s podcast, we talk about the importance of date nights, how to stop policing (and start empowering) your children, and the unique connection that fathers have with their kids. If you’re a parent or parent to be, it’s a must-listen. \xa0 FREE OFFER Get a FREE Copy of Jim Sheils' Book, The Family Board Meeting.\xa0Visit\xa0BradleyJohnson.com/59\xa0for the full details!\xa0 \xa0 SHOW NOTES To get access to today's show notes, including free offer, transcript, and links to all the resources mentioned, visit\xa0BradleyJohnson.com/58 \xa0 SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST Never miss an episode of The Elite Advisor Blueprint!

David is one of America’s most trusted financial experts and bestselling financial authors of our time and previously appeared on Episode 21 for those of you that missed it. Today, we discuss the journey behind his new book The Latte Factor, which has already become an international bestseller. David shares his story of a dinner with Paulo Coehlo, author of The Alchemist and one of my favorites, that led to him finally writing this story after putting it off for over 10 years and why this story is so different from his previous 9 NYTimes Bestsellers. We also get into why it’s so important for financial advisors to get in front of millennial clients right now, the power of buying your children shares of stock in their favorite companies, key factors that allow financial advisors to sell their firms for huge multiples, and why growth doesn’t have to mean less freedom. I think it will be clear after this conversation that David isn’t just some talking head who only sells books, but really knows our industry at a deep level. \xa0 FREE OFFER Get a FREE Copy of David’s Book, The Latte Factor: Why You Don't Have to Be Rich to Live Rich.

Pat is a presentation coach and the head speaking trainer for Advance Your Reach, where he’s coached some of the best speakers in the world, including New York Times bestselling authors, 6 former Olympians, and pastors you see on TV every Sunday. We first connected through Advance Your Reach founder Pete Vargas. Pete invited me to what I would call the American Idol of speaking, where I saw Pat coaching speakers and literally tweaking their presentations on demand. I instantly knew Pat could help many of you advisors out there giving live seminars better connect with your audience, which in turn means more appointments on the calendar. We then invited Pat to our largest event of the year where he preceded to crush at such a level that we decided to make him one of our trainers… so in this conversation you are not only going to get some incredible ideas to grow your business, but also a sneak peak inside one of Advisors Excel’s flagship trainings. Our conversation today gets to the heart of the simple things you can do to make your presentations and speaking events more effective: the importance of storytelling, how to avoid drowning your audience in data, and what you need to do to get audience members excited about working with you before your final pitch. If you’re looking to up your conversions and schedule more appointments, you’re going to want to put this episode on repeat as many of our clients have doubled and even tripled their conversion ratios after a coaching session with Pat. \xa0 FREE OFFER  Get Pat Quinn’s FREE Report “11 Presentation Requirements for Success” Apply to attend The Catalyst LIVE event (expenses covered for qualified advisors)  \xa0 SHOW NOTES To get access to today's show notes, including free offer, transcript, and links to all the resources mentioned, visit\xa0BradleyJohnson.com/57 | Today I’m throwing in a bonus episode as this is a guest appearance I had on The Adviser Gap Podcast. It’s hosted by James Mousley and Sean Banks from, as they say, “across the pond” over in the UK. I continue to be blown away by the power and reach of podcasting as I connected with the two of them after they gave a few of my episodes a listen over in the UK. They’ve created their podcast to address the lack of training out there to help paraplanners bridge the gap into a true financial planning role. This is a common problem in the US as well, as from my experience, most successful advisors were simply educated by the school of “hard knocks” and oftentimes have simply outlasted and out-marketed their competition. So with that in mind, I thought it would be helpful to share this episode for both those paraplanners out there looking to make the transition to client-facing financial advisors, as well as those CEOs and Founders looking for a training track to develop and add new advisors to the team. I hope you find this episode helpful and for those firms out there facing this problem, be sure to search for The Adviser Gap podcast out there and give them a subscribe as James and Sean will be addressing this topic on each and every show! \xa0 FREE OFFER  Apply to attend The Catalyst LIVE event (expenses covered for qualified advisors).

Most of what we cover today is on Hal’s latest book The Miracle Equation: The Two Decisions That Move Your Biggest Goals from Possible, to Probable, to Inevitable, which is officially live for purchase today. I’ve already read through, highlighted, and dogeared my pre-release copy and I’m looking forward to sharing Hal’s insights in this conversation.

Please support them; we couldn't do it without their help! This week: Salesforce Marketing Cloud Emma \xa0 Respond to Customer Reviews! Did you know that reviews that mention good customer service are 15 times more likely to be a 5-star review than a 1-star review? The problem is that so many businesses are focused on perfecting their product and ‘brand identity’ that customer service is often put on the back burner.

This week: Salesforce Marketing Cloud Emma Full Episode Details When most people think about creative minds, they recall world-renown artists, novelists, architects and so on. However, what you might not realize is that social pros are creatives too. It takes a lot of creative thinking to produce and publish great posts and come up with effective marketing strategies that can propel a brand’s growth. But, can creativity be taught? Or, is it something that only the Leonardo da Vinci’s and Steven Spielberg’s of the world are born with? Jill Paider is an award-winning photographer and creative director. She has published 21 books and believes that inspiration fuels creativity. The only problem is that if you are a creative, inspiration isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. You have to learn how to spark inspiration to keep doing the work that you love. You can’t wake up one morning and procrastinate because you weren’t feeling inspired. You’ve got to train your brain to fire on the cylinders and keep the creative juices flowing no matter what.

Huge thanks to our amazing sponsors for helping us make this happen. Please support them; we couldn't do it without their help! This week: Salesforce Marketing Cloud Emma \xa0 Building a Number One Brand on Social Influencer marketing has definitely made its mark on social. But, as with most things in life, there’s a right and wrong way to do influencer marketing. Many businesses make the mistake of pursuing influencers just because they have a large following, but that doesn’t always mean that they can add real value to your business. According to Greg Hounslow, the Emerging Media Manager at WestJet, you should also consider the content output an influencer provides and whether it can actually help drive your brand and ROI forward. WestJet is the number one airline on social media, winning multiple awards for their strategy and performance. Other brands in the airline industry struggle to rival their success and their secret is simple – rather than stick to the same strategy year after year, they’ve continued to evolve alongside social media. In This Episode:  07:17 – How the social programme at WestJet is organized 11:56 – How WestJet’s team expectations have shifted over the last five years 15:00 – The benefits of evaluating organic reach through fan engagement and evaluating paid from a revenue generation perspective 17:06 – How WestJet’s content strategy has evolved 20:37 – How the customer care team responds to negative feedback 29:22 – Greg predicts the future of chatbots 34:40 – When influencer marketing works and when it doesn’t  Resources  Get the new State of Marketing report for free from Salesforce here.

Please support them; we couldn't do it without their help! This week: Salesforce Marketing Cloud\xa0 Emma \xa0 Social is no longer a free marketing tool\xa0 There was a time when social could be used as free marketing. The only price you had to pay for some engagement was time and maybe a little bit of luck. However, putting the same message on multiple platforms and hoping for the best isn’t going to cut it anymore. Paid social is arguably the most effective way for brands to expand the reach of their content. Instead of saturating your audience with content, you need to consider targeting the right audiences, at the right time and on the right social platform. Jen Hartmann, the Public Relations and Social Media Manager at John Deere, agrees that social is no longer the free marketing tool it used to be. As you can imagine, it was a challenge for her and the social team to transform the corporate strategy of a business that has been in the game for 180 years.\xa0 Tune in to find out how paid social helped John Deere target their specific audience with the right message at the right time and how to make it work as part of a much larger marketing communications program. In This Episode:\xa0  08:25 – How to work with multiple social media stakeholders from different countries 13:07 – How to know when you’re one of the best social brands in the world 16:46 – How to balance the content you share with your audience 21:25 – How brands can insert themselves into conversations on social without being tagged or invited 26:58 – Why brands should stop looking at social as free marketing and start seeing the benefits of paid social 31:31 – An insight into John Deere’s influencer marketing strategy  Resources\xa0  Get the new State of Marketing report for free from Salesforce here.

In this episode I chat with Greg Mercer from Jungle Scout where Greg and I share tips and Amazon Q4 strategies to help you succeed.\xa0 Listen to this Amazon FBA Podcast!   [powerpress] Maximizing your Holiday Sales - Amazon Q4 Tips with Greg Mercer EP140 If you want to have a wildly successful Q4 selling on Amazon then you need to have a strategy and a plan to maximize sales and profit. Amazon just gets bigger and better every year and this Q4 selling season will no doubt be the biggest ever. The opportunity for Amazon sellers to absolutely crush it and make tons of money is all right in front of us. In this episode I am joined by Greg Mercer from Jungle Scout where we break down and share important Amazon Q4 Tips and strategies to help you maximize sales and profit.\xa0 IMPORTANT DATES:\xa0  Black Friday - November 29th Cyber Monday - December 2nd November 6 - for Black Friday and Cyber Monday December 3 - for the holiday gift-giving season\xa0  \xa0 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM PODCAST\xa0 \xa0 GET SMART WITH INVENTORY\xa0 One of the most important components of having a successful Q4 is to have a strategy around your inventory. You need to find a fine balance of having the right inventory in order to maximize profits. If Amazon sellers have too much inventory stored at Amazon FBA then you will eat up all your profits with the sky high storage fees that Amazon charges in Q4. If you don\'t have enough then you could run out of stock in the middle of the madness and lose out on sales and profit as well which is no fun.\xa0  Analyze your products historical sales data to determine how much inventory you will need to be comfortably in stock  If this is a new product then analyze your competitions historical sales data   Consider storing your inventory at an off-sight warehouse and then drip feeding it into Amazon FBA as needed.\xa0  Or store inventory at your house if possible and drip feed into Amazon FBA as needed    OTHER KEY POINTS  If you have a gift-able item then consider optimizing your listing to highlight that.\xa0\xa0  Add pictures to showcase your item in a holiday setting Consider adding video to highlight that your item makes a great gift for the holidays\xa0 Update your sales copy to highlight that it makes a great gift   Tighten up your Amazon PPC ads campaigns NOW  Consider increasing your PPC spend during key times during Q4 Expand your campaigns and cast a wider net\xa0   Make sure you are running coupons and appropriate promotions as customers are deal shopping Build your own email list or Many Chat audience to drive traffic to your offers Raise your prices if your competition runs out of stock so you can maximize profits Increased sales and traffic on Amazon usually stays strong well into January and February\xa0 Make sure to place your inventory orders at the end of December to ensure orders are completed before suppliers shut down for Chinese New Year  Having success in Q4 on Amazon is all about preparation. Put the work in now and reap the rewards later. When you use a platform like Amazon FBA they will take care of the heavy lifting for you. So after you get done listening to this podcast I would recommend you sit down in silence and sketch out a plan of attack. Then immediately take action on one of those action points to build momentum.\xa0 To your Q4 success!\xa0 \xa0  GREG MERCER - JUNGLE SCOUT  Greg Mercer is and Amazon seller and the founder of Jungle Scout.

[powerpress] How to Turn a Hobby Into a Booming Business w/David Hirschkop - EP139 \xa0 In this episode I am joined by Dave Hirschkop from Dave\'s Gourmet. Dave took an idea and passion he had and turned it into a successful thriving business. In this podcast Dave will reveal his story about how get first got started and the lessons he has learned along the way as an entrepreneur and business owner. His brand and company Dave\'s Gourmet has been featured on major media platforms such as The Food Network, The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Here are some key business takeaways that Dave shares with the listeners:  DEMAND IS EVERYTHING - If you have a great idea for a product or service then you have to make sure their is actual demand for it in the market. You can easily use platforms like Amazon to launch new products that you can test in the market to get valuable feedback. You should always seek valuable feedback from your audience and customers to help you improve your product. SEEK HAPPINESS - While having an aggressive business strategy is important to maximize sales and profit you may realize that your happiness and sanity are more important. Sometimes you may want to trust your guy and take your business in a direction that you find more fulfilling instead of always stressing about making more money. OUTSOURCING - Hire experts wherever you can to help you run and maintain your business. Spend time doing the tasks that you are good but try to outsource or hire people to manage tasks you don\'t want to do. Try not to be the jack of all trades when help and experts are easily accessible. Essentially don\'t be the bottle neck in your own business. For your online business and e-commerce needs consider hiring from the Jungle Market or  Freeeup.com.

In this episode I talk with Bradley Sutton of Helium 10 where we discuss actionable hacks and strategies to help you drive clicks, sales and conversions to help you level up your Amazon FBA business.\xa0 Listen to this Amazon FBA Podcast!   [powerpress] Hacks and Strategies to Explode Your Amazon FBA Business EP 137 \xa0 In our podcast today I wanted to deliver some simple and actionable tactics that you can use to drive conversions and sales with. I am joined by the one and only Bradley Sutton of Helium 10 where Bradley drops some absolute golden nuggets that sellers can use and implement immediately. I would advise you to listen to this episode and conversation more than once in case you feel you missed anything. Inside Bradley and I discuss the current state of Amazon as well as increasing conversions, improving keywords, product research techniques and launching products successfully on Amazon.\xa0 CURRENT STATE OF AMAZON FBA Amazon is becoming more and more competitive over the years but there is still tons of opportunity for new sellers as well as experienced sellers to grow and build their Amazon FBA business. Once you have established yourself on the Amazon FBA USA market it may be time to expand out to Amazon Germany, UK and Japan or other markets. Also consider emerging platforms such as Walmart, Jet or other competing sites. I personally recommend that if you are building your brand you should also setup a Shopify site to expand your reach and net.\xa0 CONVERSIONS AND SALES  Use a site like Pickfu.com to test our different images for your listing. As a marketer you may think you know what images will work best for your listings but the best route is to get audience feedback. Images are everything on Amazon. When you have the best image that gets the most attention and clicks from customers you will most likely connect on more sales.\xa0 To convert on more sales you need to make sure your listing is speaking directly to your customers. You need to dive into your competitors and your own product reviews to fully understand how your customers talk and the lingo and keywords that they are using. This will allow you to better optimize the copy and keywords that you use in the listing. You will also better understand how to position and create your products images once you understand exactly how customers are using the product.  Use a tool like Helium 10 to help you extract the review data to make things easier.\xa0  LAUNCHING PRODUCTS ON AMAZON FBA Every product is going to be different on how you approach the launching process. More competitive products will require you drive more giveaways or sales to particular keywords to start getting ranked. When you use tools like Helium 10 your will see exactly how many sales you need to connect on for a specific keyword before Amazon will start ranking you for it.\xa0  Use PPC as part of your launch strategy and keep your PPC running after the launch is over. Focus in on relevant long tail keywords when you have more competitive products. Build and email list or Many Chat list to launch products to.\xa0 Use a launch service if you need some extra juice to get ranked. It\'s important that you be very mindful and careful of Amazon\'s TOS and rules in regards to these services.\xa0 Use custom URL\'s to get extra ranking power when driving traffic. See Helium 10\'s gems page.\xa0  Bradley mentioned a few launch services to explore: Check out Rebate Key and\xa0  Rank Bell.\xa0  It\'s important to note that if you do a launch and get to page one for your keywords that their is no guarantee that you will stay ranked on page one. Ultimately the market will speak and if your product or listing is not worthy of being ranked on page one yet for the keywords you are targeting then consider keywords with less competition.\xa0\xa0 PRODUCT RESEARCH There are tons and tons of product opportunities everywhere on Amazon FBA. Don\'t let anyone tell you otherwise. If certain products are hard to compete with on Amazon FBA in the USA then consider other markets around the world or ever other platforms.\xa0 Don\'t become overly reliant on tools to make decisions for you. As great as some of the tools like Helium 10 are we as sellers still need to use our heads and try to find the opportunities in front of us. the tools will give us the data and it\'s our job to recognize and see things other sellers missed. The key is to remember to give the market what it\'s wants. Don\'t reinvent the wheel.\xa0 \xa0 WANNA TRY HELIUM 10?  Helium 10 is wickedly powerful and I recommend you take their tools out for a test drive if you haven\'t already.

In this episode I talk with 8 figure Amazon seller Scott Needham of Buyboxer about the current state of selling on Amazon FBA.\xa0 Listen to this Amazon FBA Podcast!   [powerpress] Inside the Mind of an 8-Figure Amazon Seller w/Scott Needham EP136 In this latest podcast episode I am joined by Scott Needham the CTO of Buyboxer. Buyboxer manages the largest assortment of skus on Amazon FBA and has done over $250 million in sales over the years. They currently have a catalog of 70,000 plus skus in their catalog and they also work with brands and businesses to help them grow on Amazon. Check out this podcast episode where I talk with Scott about the current state of Amazon. Scott will also share valuable insight on product research as well as using coupons to drive sales and conversion. Scott will also talk about the importance of filing for reimbursement claims with Amazon for missing and damaged inventory.\xa0 \xa0  \xa0 THE STATE OF AMAZON  While Amazon continues to grow and expand over the globe it\'s a platform that is attracting thousands of new sellers every single year. More sellers than ever are creating thriving 6, 7, and 8 figure plus businesses utilizing the Amazon FBA platform. Just recently Amazon reported that nearly 150,000 Amazon sellers surpassed $100,000 in sales. While competition may be heating up there still is plenty of opportunity for new sellers coming to the platform.\xa0 \xa0 AMAZON PRODUCT RESEARCH\xa0 \xa0 Don\'t over-complicate your product research. Keep things simple by selling product that are currently in demand or have an emerging demand as trends start and grow. Using tools like Jungle Scout or Keepa can help you identify these product and trends. There is a lot of opportunity to sell premium versions of products on Amazon. While most sellers and Chinese suppliers tend to have lower quality products focused on value buyers you can carve out your piece of the market by positioning yourself as premium. When you do this you can charge more as long as you have a high quality product with premium packaging and a top notch experience.\xa0 \xa0 Consider exploring the grocery niche for lots of future growth opportunities. \xa0 Data is great and can help with your product research but sometimes too much data can be counter productive. It\'s also important that you develop skills as an Amazon seller to be able to identify market opportunities without having to use tools all the time. You should be able to evaluate a current market and determine what the current market is asking for based on customer feedback, reviews and research.\xa0 \xa0 As Scott mentioned it\'s certainly worth looking into new and emerging trends in the market. If you jump on trends early you can establish yourself as the leader early on Amazon. Using tools like Google Trends or just recognizing social trends may prove to be valuable.\xa0 \xa0 AMAZON COUPONS \xa0 If you want to boost conversions and sales on your products then experiment with Amazon coupons. Most Amazon sellers aren\'t using these right now so the opportunity is golden to capitalize off of it. Coupons will help your click through rate as the visual green badge that Amazon displays is very eye catching. Also if you have slow moving inventory consider running coupons along with PPC to drive sales or liquidate inventory.\xa0 \xa0 REIMBURSEMENTS\xa0 \xa0 If you have been selling on Amazon for any period of time then chances are Amazon owes you money for missing, lost or damaged inventory. You could be owed thousands of dollars back from Amazon so it\'s important you dive into your reports on a regular basis. If you don\'t have the time or the patience to do this then hire a virtual assistant from the Jungle Market to assist with this process. You could also hire a service to assist with this as well. Consider using Scott\'s service Valence and see how much you are owed in reimbursements.\xa0 \xa0  \xa0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \xa0 CONNECT WITH SCOTT NEEDHAM\xa0 \xa0   Scott\'s Podcast - The Smartest Amazon Seller Reimbursement Service - Valence Services\xa0 Account Services + Brand Management - BuyBoxer\xa0 Follow Scott Needham on Instagram\xa0  JUNGLE SCOUT CONTEST GIVEAWAY!\xa0  Want to get entered to win a license for a Jungle Scout chrome extension?

[powerpress] How To Have Success Selling on Amazon FBA Internationally EP 135 \xa0 If you want to scale and grow your business then you have probably thought about expanding globally on Amazon. If you have products that are selling well on Amazon FBA in the US market then it may be time to take your business overseas. While trying to grow your business by selling on Amazon FBA internationally may be exciting it does come with it\'s own set of challenges. In this episode I am joined by Jana Jana Krekic of YLT-Translations where we talk about translating your existing listings over to new languages and markets.\xa0 Here are the key insights and messages discussed in the podcast:  Consider expanding into the German Amazon marketplace as it is large and growing.\xa0 Make sure you fully understand the culture and the market you are entering. You should do keyword research for each market that you are going to be selling into Do not hire translators from Fiverr or use services like or similar to Google translate\xa0 Hire and work with listing translators that understand the market, culture, e-commerce and Amazon Products and markets that might be considered "saturated" on Amazon US might sell very well in new and emerging markets around the world  If you have already expanded into international markets and are wondering why your products and listings aren\'t selling as well as you thought it could be because you have a poorly translated listing. Your sales copy may not be formatted for the market and the people of that market. You may also be using the incorrect keywords for that product in that specific market. It\'s important again that you do unique keyword research for each market. This will all lead to betting search results on Amazon which of course can lead to more clicks and sales.\xa0 If you are thinking of selling on Amazon FBA internationally then you need to work with people that understand the market you are entering. You need someone that can translate your listings and do the proper keyword research to increase your chances of success in the new markets.\xa0 \xa0 Check out and reach out to Jana Krekic of YLT Translations.

[powerpress] 6 Tips to Crush Amazon Listing Hijackers and Counterfeiters - EP133 If you\'ve been selling on Amazon long enough then you surely have experience in dealing with Amazon listing hijackers. You\'ve worked hard building your listing over time and for some other seller to be able to latch onto your success is terribly frustrating. Sometimes these sellers will even steal your buy box and take your sales. Many of these Amazon listing hijackers tend to be counterfeit sellers which makes matters even worse. These counterfeit sellers are total losers in my opinion. Over the years I have used some of the tips I am about to share with you here to help you prevent and combat these hijackers.\xa0 The key to successfully avoiding Amazon listing hijackers altogether is to not become an easy target. Most hijackers and counterfeiters will look for the listings that are "low hanging fruit" and easy to jump on and mess with.\xa0 PREVENTION TIPS \xa0 1.\xa0 BUNDLE YOUR PRODUCTS - If you bundle your product with another product you make it really difficult for another seller to come on to hijack your listing. They will simply go find easier targets. You can try to bundle your product with an accessory or related product. You can also try to include some sort of e-book or training guide as part of the offer. Any products that I have bundled never have any hijackers. They simply go on to other easier targets.\xa0 2. BRANDING AND LOGOS - Make sure you brand your products with your custom logo. Also consider upgrading to custom packaging that also has your logo on it. Make sure you showcase your product and packaging in at least one of your product images. Also if you include any sort of insert card with the product make sure you show that in one of the product images. If you are only selling your product as "generic" then you are opening up yourself up to a hoard of hijackers.\xa0 3. ENROLL IN AMAZON BRAND REGISTRY - Once you enroll your brand and products into Brand Registry then you will have access to counterfeit tools such as Amazon Transparency and Amazon Project Zero. These tools help you prevent and combat hijackers and counterfeit sellers. Yes you need a valid trademark to gain access to Brand Registry but it\'s worth the effort. You can apply for one by going to USPTO.GOV or by using a trademark service such as Trademark Engine.\xa0 Want to know more about Amazon Transparency? - Check out a recent podcast I did here:  Amazon Transparency Program - First Thoughts EP106   AFTER HIJACKERS ARE ALREADY ON \xa0 4. SEND A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER - Once you notice a Amazon listing hijacker you should send them a message or email through Amazon telling them to remove themselves from your listing. This will remove about 70% of the hijackers. I personally would send a follow up message as well to show them that I am serious and will take action against them accordingly.\xa0 5. DO A TEST BUY - After you send your messages to the sellers I would buy the item from the hijacker and have it quickly sent to you. You want to see exactly what they are selling. Once the package arrives simply inspect what they sent. If it\'s a counterfeit item then take pictures of it and make notes of what is different about it compared to what you send the customers. Then file a claim with Amazon and upload your images from the test buy. Amazon should act and remove them from your listing within time.\xa0 If you have access to Amazon Project Zero you don\'t need to file a report with Amazon. You can simply remove them yourself. How cool is that? 6. SETUP HIJACKER ALERTS - For an extra layer of protection you should consider setting up Amazon listing hijacker alerts. You can be notified immediately once you have unwanted hijackers. Then you can take action right away. If you have Helium 10 then you have access to this hijacker alerts tool and should have it set up.

In this episode we share simple and actionable Amazon pricing strategies that you can implement today to make more money!\xa0 Listen to this Amazon FBA Podcast!   [powerpress] Pricing Strategies Every Amazon Seller Should be Using Right Now w/Paulina Masson Are you using the correct Amazon pricing strategies to maximize sales and profit? I have found that most sellers tend to guess how to price their products. If you are guessing and don\'t have a strategy then you could be leaving a lot of money on the table. Sometimes small tweaks can have dramatic effects on how shoppers view your products which could lead to increased sales and profit.\xa0 On this episode I am joined by Paulina Masson of Shopkeeper.com where she breaks down some effective Amazon pricing strategies that every seller needs to be using. Paulina is an Amazon seller herself and has lots of knowledge around the psychology of pricing and how it effects buying behaviors.\xa0 EPISODE BREAKDOWN \xa0 Have A Clear Plan Before you even have your product made you should determine what type of buyer you are going to price and market your product to. You should have already evaluated the current market on Amazon to determine your potential pricing strategy. As an example if you notice that there are no "luxury" offers available on the market for a product then you could fill that void by creating a higher quality product in which you can charge higher prices.\xa0 You also should be studying the historical pricing of all the top competitors to get a feel for what the other sellers have been charging. You can use a tool like Jungle Scout to see this information.\xa0 Determine Your Buyer There are essentially 3 different main buckets of customers on Amazon. You have budget shoppers, value shoppers and luxury seekers. You should be evaluating the current marketplace to see where your competition fits in. If everyone is competing on having the lowest price then you may have opportunities to raise your prices to appeal to value or luxury shoppers.\xa0\xa0  Budget Shoppers - they are mainly looking for the lowest priced products and aren\'t to concerned with quality.\xa0 Value Shoppers - They are seeking a mix of value and quality. They won\'t just seek to find the cheapest option available.\xa0 Luxury Shoppers - They want a premium product with all the "bells and whistles" and they will be willing to spend a lot to get it.\xa0  Price Endings Matter Most products you see in retail end with the price of $0.99. We know that buying something for $12.99 looks like a much better deal than charging $13.00. Even though it\'s only a $0.01 difference. While using a price ending is ok you may want to consider using other odd number endings such as $0.97 or $0.95. Those price endings will get the customers attention as they are quickly scanning the sales page. Try to avoid even endings such as $0.92 or $0.94. Also if you are a selling luxury item then consider using a $0.00 ending. So instead of charging $34.99 simply charge $35.00. As with anything you should split test these price endings to determine which gets the most clicks and conversions.\xa0  Use odd price endings such as .99, .97, .95 Avoid even price endings such as .92, .94 Use .00 endings for luxury items\xa0 Split test to determine what sells the best for your items  Amazon Coupons To drive clicks and more sales consider running coupons on your listings. The green banner will stand out as customers are scanning Amazon and it will catch their attention. A lot of sellers are not using coupons currently so you can really stand out. You can then experiment with using "percentage off" or "dollar off" coupons. Make sure to keep your coupons simple and easy for the customer to calculate. If you make the customer think too much they will get confused and move on to the next product.\xa0 \xa0 What About Bundling? Once you have been selling a product for a while you should look at your sales reports to determine if bundling makes sense. If you notice that customer are often buying 2 or more of that product then you can create a variation and offer the customer more quantity options. You can then give the customer a better deal per unit if they buy more however you will usually save money in FBA fees when you ship out the bundled option.\xa0 Free Shipping? While a huge amount of Amazon customers are Prime members who automatically get free shipping there still are millions of shoppers that are non-prime. For them to receive free shipping they currently need to spend $25 or more. This is important to know when selling a product in that price range. If you are priced in the $20-$24.99 range then simple increase your price to something like $25.97 so that purchase no qualifies for free shipping. You will convert more non-prime customer with this type of pricing.\xa0 Business Pricing? If you aren\'t enrolled into Amazon Business yet then you should do that immediately. It should be free to enroll into and by doing so you can have access to business pricing for your products. You can set different quantity discount options right inside of your seller central dashboard. By doing so you will attract lots of business buyers and start generating extra sales by default. You will then be able to see your sales generated from business customers. Don\'t worry if you don\'t have business related products. It doesn\'t matter.\xa0  SPECIAL OFFER FOR YOU  GET A 6 MONTHS FREE TRIAL OF SHOPKEEPER!\xa0 Simply visit Shopkeeper.com and open the chat bubble and enter code "STINGRAY180" to get 6 months FREE!\xa0  Track your sales Track your inventory\xa0 Know your profit breakdown Use data to make business decisions\xa0   \xa0 \xa0 Not a member of the Facebook Mastermind group yet?

[powerpress] My 3 Step Formula for a $1,000,000 Business - Amazon FBA Recently I was at SellerCon in Las Vegas and I was listening to a presentation given by Ryan Danial Moran. Ryan was talking about how Amazon FBA has changed a lot over the years and that we as business owners need to think differently about our business and brands. Tactics that worked just a few years ago no longer work anymore. Ryan specified that we as business owners need to become real entrepreneurs and build real brands that we can grow and scale on and off of Amazon. We have the power and the tools to create real brands that are making money and making a difference in the world.\xa0 In this podcast I break down my 3 step formula for creating successful brand and how you can get to your first $1,000,000 in sales. You will see that once you build a real audience around your brand and products that achieving your sales goals will be easy. The focus should be on building real assets that you can control such as e-mail lists, ManyChat audiences, and social media assets. If you build valuable assets that are engaged with your brand and content then you won\'t be so reliant on the changes that frequently happen on Amazon FBA.\xa0 THE FORMULA TO $1 MILLION  Find a niche and a specific customer to serve Build your audience + Launch 3-5 related products Your brand X-Factor\xa0  Now if you are just starting out selling online and on Amazon FBA then the thought of hitting $1 million is sales for the year may seem unattainable.

Also browse Amazon categories for ideas.\xa0 Make sure the niche is thriving and has lots of demand Build a customer avatar for your target customer  Age, Sex, Education, Interests, Hobbies, etc... What does your customer care about?\xa0 Where do they hang out online?\xa0 What problems are they facing?\xa0   Design your business, brand and products around solving your customers problems  \xa0 STEP 2 - BUILD YOUR AUDIENCE + LAUNCH 3-5 PRODUCTS\xa0  Research and identify your first core product Start building and growing your audience and lists Start posting enraging content on social media\xa0 Invest $5-$10 per day on Facebook ads to grow your platform and audience Start building your email list and ManyChat audience\xa0 Include your new and growing audience in on your products development\xa0 Build excitement for your upcoming product launch Launch your product to your new "tribe" and use Amazon PPC Get tunnel vision on getting your product ranked to page 1 on Amazon Ask your "tribe" for testimonials of your brand and product  Share these as pieces of content\xa0   Use product inserts to build a VIP customer list\xa0  Repeat the process for product # 2\xa0 Repeat the process for products 3-5  Start using other larger influencers audiences to launch products with Continue spending money every day on content and Facebook ads to grow your audience\xa0 Become obsessed with your customers product/brand experience and journey\xa0  STEP 3 - YOUR BRANDS X-FACTOR  Why does your brand exist?

Also, take a moment to take my new quiz ‘What’s Stopping you Business’ Visibility’ http://onlineboutiquesource.com/quiz | I had to take a break in our schedule just share this message with you guys because it is so important to the way I see many of us showing up or not showing up in our businesses. Especially for small businesses that are looking to be brand influencers, digital marketing agencies, and thought leaders in our niches. At the recent BET Awards Famous Movie Producer, Director, Mogul Tyler Perry made a profound speech about how and why he has taken the route he has in his rise to fame and what he would encourage everyone trying to do something different to do. Here’s the clip is you missed it:  https://www.bet.com/video/betawards/2019/acceptance-speeches/tyler-perry-ultimate-icon-award.html Tyler urged us all to own our stuff, make our own way, and in his words “build your own table”. But here’s the thing, the next day as everyone was celebrating and sharing this message; they were doing the exact opposite of what Tyler told us, instead of making our own table many people quickly rushed and took a seat at his. In this episode, I talk about why this is such a problematic epidemic for business owners and how we can start using Tyler’s message to grow our business and like he said build our own table.

Federal, state, and local governments all have various funding that is designated specifically to work certified small businesses and the unfortunate truth is many of us are missing out on it. These government contracts can be a great stream of income. And an opportunity to grow small\xa0business ideas for women. In this episode, we talk with Adrianne M.

The bakery is near the front, where you’re met with the comforting aroma of fresh bread. The dairy is in the back, so you have to walk through the whole store just to buy milk. The candy is by the register, a tempting and effective upsell. \xa0This is not by accident – in fact, there are professionals who get paid a lot of money to map your journey through the store in a way that gets you to buy more stuff. The psychology of profit has been of interest to owners of grocery stores and supermarkets since, like, forever. So why wouldn’t we apply the same principles to online stores? That’s where Erin Alexander comes in. Founder of Alexander Design Co. and our very own SOS coach, Erin specializes in website and conversion design for e-commerce businesses.  When it comes to web design, this gal’s been thinking 10 steps ahead the whole time. She sat down with me to discuss the common mistakes she sees on jewelry designer’s websites – and how to fix them | I am constantly blown away by the resilience and creativity from the designers in our community. Twyla Dill is one radiant example. While living in Turkey, Twyla learned how to make Oya, a delicate lace crocheted from thread. With plenty of inspiration, but no background in jewelry, she set to work creating pieces that blended the Turkish lace technique with a modern aesthetic. Eventually, Twyla Dill Designs was born. In April of 2019, Twyla’s second year in business, her mom passed away after years of battling Multiple Sclerosis. Needless to say, it was a tragic loss for Twyla and her family. Balancing business and grief is no easy feat, but Twyla navigated it with grace and was even able to increase her sales from the year before. She sat down with me this week to share how she did it. | We both know that selling at shows can be back-breaking work, m’dear. And it doesn’t get easier as you get older… trust me. Plus, what would happen to your biz if you had to take a break and couldn’t attend shows? Would it still function and make money while you were away? When I quit my day job to focus on building a business full-time, it was a real struggle. It was impossible for me to walk away because I did not set myself up for success. I realized that I had just created a new job for myself, not a business. Here’s the difference:  A job requires you to be constantly working to generate revenue A business generates revenue on an ongoing basis, even when you’re not actively working.  If you’re relying on live shows for your primary source of income, I hate to be the one to tell you but… you have a job. Don’t get me wrong, shows aren’t all bad when you leverage them right. But I don’t want you to be dependent on one stream of revenue. So, if you’re feeling stuck in the trunk show grind and sacrificing too many weekends, maybe it’s time to re-evaluate your strategy… And I have just the thing to help you – let’s make a live show pros and cons list! | What makes a jewelry designer successful? Is it talent? Hard work? Luck? Not even close! If being talented and working hard was all it takes to make it in the jewelry biz… most jewelry designers would be successful. In-demand designers succeed because they know what to do, ditch, and delegate to scale sales and work on their business. This is much easier said than done! You might catch yourself thinking, “No one else can do what I do.” But… that’s just not true m’dear! Like many designers, I didn’t want to let go of production when my business started taking off. My mind changed when I got a really big order from a wholesale customer that I just could not fill by myself. I hired a local jewelry arts student to come in and help with production. After that – there was no turning back. This an inevitable part of scaling a business. But as your business grows and you find yourself running short on time every day, how exactly do you figure out what to do, ditch, and delegate? That’s what I’ll be talking about today. | Are you struggling to come up with content ideas for your brand? I’m here to help… When someone buys from you, it’s your chance to build a relationship and gain a loyal customer. Content is an empowering way to do that – and it can be repurposed over and over! I know, I know… You (like many designers) are probably thinking “I don’t know what to write! I don’t know how to write! What do I do?!” Okay, take a deep breath. Making content is actually pretty simple once you get the hang of it! But I get why it’s so intimidating! When I was starting out, the thought of making content felt so daunting. I thought, “Do I really need this?” The answer is a big fat YES! And here’s why… | Ever wonder how you’re supposed to convert people who land on your website into actual paying customers? There’s so much talk about getting more website traffic, but there’s a big piece missing in this convo! Most people who land on your website aren’t just going to immediately buy from you! You actually need a strategy to capture that cold traffic and turn the right people into customers. Maybe you already know where this is headed… you might be aware that building a list is your next step. But do you actually know HOW to build -an email list for your jewelry e-commerce business? If you have a million people landing on your site each day but no one is purchasing, what’s the point?? During our “Best Of” series, we’ve been going back through the episodes from the Thrive by Design Podcast that have had the most downloads ever. In our last episode, we covered getting traffic to your site. But now the question is, what do you actually do with that traffic? Well, I’m here to tell you – an email list is your absolute #1 tool for capturing traffic and turning those leads into sales. If you know you’re ready to dive deep on this topic, go ahead and listen to the full episode, How to Build an Email List for Your Jewelry E-Commerce Business on the Thrive By Design Podcast to learn all 27 ways to build your list! But for now, let’s get started with a few of my favorites and things you need to know before you start… | Slowly but surely, summer is winding down… In our industry, the summer season is often one of plans and strategy. With the busy holidays ahead, I’m gonna guess you’ve been thinking about how to ramp up your sales this year. Especially your online sales! Far too many designers fall into the trap of thinking that making online sales is all about traffic. But that’s just one little piece of the puzzle! See, it's NOT about just random traffic. It's about the right kind of traffic. I’m talking about getting those DREAM customers onto your site. Not just anyone who stumbles there. Getting consistent sales in the e-commerce space means having a conversion strategy that works. A way to lead the right people to visit your site, and then lead them naturally into the next step in your sales conversation. So today we’re doing a throwback as a part of our “Best Of Series,” to episode 84 of the Thrive By Design Podcast – The #1 Way to Get More Traffic to Your Jewelry Website. | For most designers, making a $100,000 salary is what it will take for you to quit your job or achieve your goals. I hear it all the time. “Tracy, I want to make $100,000 a year. What does it really take?” The truth is, it’s… complicated. Someone who is bringing $1 million in revenue still might not be able to take home $100,000 if their business isn't run like a well-oiled machine. At the same time, a smart business owner bringing in $250,000 could still take home that $100K if they do it right. People like you and I, we’re idea generators. Seeing our visions come to life is what really drives us. Finances, profitability, break-even points, margins… Those aren’t the things that come naturally to us. But it can be learned! You don’t have to sacrifice your creative passion to be a smart business owner. When you really hone your visionary and leadership skills, you will be blown away by what you can accomplish. When I started my first company, Tracy Matthews Design Inc., I was NOT approaching my business like a visionary. That’s totally changed. Instead of CEO, I call myself the Chief Visionary Officer. That has a better ring to it, don’t you think? So how did I go from being a hopeful hobbyist with no business experience to the CVO of Flourish and Thrive Academy? It started with a simple goal to transform my jewelry business so I could take home $100,000 a year.

Dr. Shannon explains how the stories are easy to hear if you stop running away from stress and resistance. "The doors open when your belief changes..." At 30:13, I\'m sharing the story in my head that was holding my business back. Plus we talk about how our thoughts happen before our emotions and the thoughts we are repeating over and over again become our beliefs that get stored in our subconscious.

Wouldn’t it be great if you were a part of an influencer community that empowers you as you pursue your passion and turn it into a business? Let’s find out in today’s episode as we explore the power of an influencer community with Style Collective’s Annie Spano. “We’re just trying to make a difference in the world through our craft and our passion.” Style Collective is an influencer community for women to connect, grow, and learn how to be successful bloggers and entrepreneurs. Prior to starting Style Collective, Annie had been in a toxic work situation in her corporate job after she had graduated from her MBA and realized she needed to get out. She felt the need to be around other people that were positive and inspiring. She also needed to be where she could be a leader and empower women. She started her blog in October 2015 and did some consulting through it for a local boutique. She began to know other fashion bloggers that were starting at the same time and she connected with these women on a deeper level. She became best friends with some of them and she started a Facebook group for all of them to connect with each other, to share tips and ideas with each other, and encourage each other. Through that, Annie saw the power of an influencer community. Now, Annie connects women from all over the world through community and empowers them to do what they love through leadership and influencer education. Annie is the host of the Becoming Fearless Podcast, blogs at anniespano.com, and is a public speaker. “My tribe is influencers because they’re the same as me.” Check out the show notes Join the Zero to Influence Bootcamp waitlist Download your FREE guide:\xa06 Tools YouTubers Use to Get Thousands of Video Views Don\'t forget to join the Beauty and the Vlog Facebook group for collaborations, YouTube advice, support and more!

What are the odds of making money as an influencer? How can you become successful at it? I am so excited for today’s episode because not only will we unlock the answers to these questions, but we’ll also talk about mindfulness, meditation, and positivity with our guest, Jessica Nazarali. Jessica knew from an early age that personal development would be part of her life’s work. However, it wasn’t until she started a passion project – a blog and health food store in 2011 - that Jessica’s dream came to fruition. “At the end of the day you just really need to believe in yourself and what you’re doing.” After hitting it big with $7,000 in revenue during her 7th month of blog coaching and consulting, Jessica quit her job and went full time in her business. During the first year, she did a lot of one-on-one coaching, one-on-one consulting, and then she started creating products. Now, she has a flagship program, Business Mastery, that’s all about business building skills including how to sign consistent clients for coaches, consultants, and service-based entrepreneurs. She also has a coaching certification program, Coaching Mastery, and a personal development and mindset-based program, Personal Mastery. “Content is so important and it’s how you stand out.” Today, Jessica has managed to successfully combine her business with her desire to help people. Her It Girl Academy and It Girl Radio podcast provide guidance and coaching to women from different walks of life, all over the world. “It’s really important that you stay motivated and you stay inspired, so you keep on going and you don’t give up.”\xa0 Check out the show notes Join the Zero to Influence Bootcamp waitlist Download your FREE guide:\xa06 Tools YouTubers Use to Get Thousands of Video Views Don\'t forget to join the Beauty and the Vlog Facebook group for collaborations, YouTube advice, support and more!

However, having a YouTube channel is not exclusively for extroverts. If you have passion and knowledge to share, then what you actually have is the magic formula to become popular on YouTube!  One such popular YouTube influencer is Silvia Reis, who goes by the name ellebangs in her YouTube channel. She\'s a popular hair guru and a Redken trained hairstylist living in San Francisco who shares professional DIY tips about hair color, cut, and styling to help people get their dream hair while saving some money at the salon. "Consistency gets people attracted." Shy and reserved, Silvia\'s personality doesn\'t quite fit the mold of a typical YouTube influencer. However, because she\'s passionate about sharing her knowledge about hair, she started her channel with her husband about four years ago to teach people some of the things she learned herself going through cosmetology school and working at various salons in the Bay Area. She loves everything hair and makeup and thought YouTube would be a good way to engage with other like-minded people. Currently, Silvia has almost half a million YouTube subscribers and 49 million video views. "The audience I have, I want it to be super genuine." So, remember, you don\'t have to reinvent yourself in front of the camera and suddenly become super bubbly and super outgoing to become popular on YouTube. Stay true to yourself and people will embrace you for who you are! "Don\'t try to be something you think people want."

It’s not an easy decision to make, and achieving success on YouTube is certainly no easy feat. However, for fitness influencer, Amanda Bucci, making that transition was empowering! "I wanted people to take some piece of value out of it at the end of the day." Amanda Bucci made that transition and began having the time of her life! She was absolutely loving what she did, helping people with fitness through her videos that she was uploading at least five times per week! With her bikini competition series called “That Prep Life,” her YouTube channel subscribers went from 6k to 100k in only 6 months. "Getting noticed comes from doing videos that potentially could go viral." Growing up in Rhode Island, Amanda had no idea having a YouTube channel, and being a YouTuber, was even a thing. When she did finally get started on YouTube, it was by sharing her fitness journey, educating her audience, and gaining fast exposure in the fitness industry. "I like to make sure I get a good mix of informational versus vlog videos." Amanda has now branched out to start her own podcast and showing others how to grow their own personal brands. She is passionate about fitness, business, and self-development and wants to help ignite the fire of millions by sharing her knowledge and leading by example.

Just like Kimbyrleigha, a successful YouTube channel can afford you numerous opportunities that will eventually lead you to financial success. "I would not venture off into things that I wasn\'t passionate about." When Kimbyrleigha started her YouTube channel back in 2015, she was not only juggling a corporate job but also raising a 3-year-old daughter as a single mom. Even with all of that, she had no intention of making it as just a hobby. Kimbyrleigha wanted to make being a YouTube creator her new career. Through her boyfriend, Kimbyrleigha learned about affiliate marketing and began researching it. Now, she\'s affiliated with about 100 companies and approximately 80% of her income is from affiliates. "You probably need to get on trends because those things are going to catapult you." Kimbyrleigha always wanted to be an entrepreneur and she has been afforded that opportunity m among others, through doing YouTube. However, according to Kimbyrleigha, the opportunity to become a voice that people listen to has been the greatest opportunity so far.

"You have to be really thankful if you even have the bravery to do YouTube." After a tough breakup with her ex, Kimbyrleigha was looking for a change of scenery and a fresh start when she moved from Florida to Los Angeles in 2012. As a single mom to a one-year-old daughter, she struggled to find a job despite having graduated from law school, until she eventually landed one in corporate America where she busted her butt every day for three years. With no other creative outlet, she started posting videos on YouTube in 2015 with the secret hope that she could make enough money to one day quit her day job. It was one of the best decisions she ever made. After only less than a year, Kimbyrleigha was able to make a breakthrough and now has nearly 100,000 subscribers,4.5 million video views, and is fulfilling her dreams.

Luckily, my guest today can help provide some great tips for how to start a good YouTube channel!

However, when she found herself in a "massively toxic" relationship, she decided to leave Toronto and pursue a career in Los Angeles. Shan had used YouTube to promote her book and had built her channel to around 20,000 subscribers so, after her fourth failed pilot (for MTV, no less), she decided to become a Certified Sexologist and take her YouTube channel more seriously.

This last launch was one of the most successful launches our team has done. We onboarded almost a hundred new clients, and it was extremely profitable for us. However, one of the things we make sure we do every time, good or bad, we bring together everyone involved and debrief.\xa0 \xa0 In this week’s episode, I’m breaking down WHY it’s so important to debrief after a launch. It doesn’t matter if you had a successful launch or one that completely flopped. You need to take some time, get together with your team, and go through some critical things in order to make your next launch successful.\xa0 \xa0 We talk so much about the launching process, and I realized we don’t talk about the debrief enough! It’s even something we are adding to the Unstoppable Entrepreneur Program in 2020.

The ability to articulate what makes your program different is critical for your success. \xa0 You don’t need to shove more things into the program to make it stand out.

How can I make a ten-year-long vision happen in six months? Now, whether or not this happens, what it does is allow you to start thinking about the bigger picture.

As I go through and re-reading it, I realized that not much as changed. Back in 2013, when I started my business, I discovered very quickly there was a disconnect. People were telling me they wanted to accomplish specific goals, but they were NOT doing the actions to achieve them.\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, I\'m breaking down how to turn your dreams from invisible to VISIBLE! I\'m taking you back to basics in this episode. One of the most significant changes that have happened in those five years is everything has gone digital.\xa0 \xa0 One of the biggest game-changers for any business owner is getting a whiteboard, putting it in your office and just writing things down. This is the disconnect CEOs are having. They see the finish line, but they don\'t understand the steps to get there. In this episode, I\'m walking you through WHY this is so valuable and how you can get one-on-one time with ME to overlook each step of your million dollar profit plan.\xa0   TRIBE OF UNSTOPPABLES: www.kellyroachcoaching.com/community INSTAGRAM\xa0 www.instagram.com/kellyroachofficial   | Online business owner?

Anyone who is anyone told you that you have to get as many people on your list as possible. However, the only problem is that email open rates are a rapid decline. People are less and less interested in hearing from you or anyone via email. \xa0 I\'m not saying by any means saying you should stop using email marketing or stop growing your list.

Today I\'m going to talk a bit about Tom Brady who some consider being the best Quarterback of all time in American football. Tom Brady decided to pursue football in college (he was good in multiple sports, but LOVED football). He went to Michigan in 1999. He didn\'t look at the top quarterbacks in 1999 and say, "I\'ll never be as good as Bret Farve, Troy Aikman, or Steve Young. Instead, he pursued football and used those quarterbacks as inspiration. You may not be as good as someone, you may actually be better - because you can learn from their history. When Your Podcast Is Stuck Today we are going to talk about getting your show unstuck. Here is a typical podcast that I run into on a regular basis. Maybe this sounds like you:  Podcasting for five months Averaging about 54 downloads per episode Looking to grow your audience (we all area) Looking to make some money with your podcast  It\'s hard to monetize a show with 50 downloads per episode. Many people don\'t realize that you\'re lucky if you get 5% of your audience to take action. That means three people will take action (if we round up). Finding Motivation to Keep Going You started your podcast cause you love your subject, and you want to talk about your subject, podcasting sounded fun, and you jumped in. Scenario: You and your cousin love to talk about your favorite TV show. You start a weekly podcast and you talk about your favorite TV show. Conclusion: This podcast is successful. You wanted to talk to your cousin about your favorite TV show with your cousin and you are. Now you want to earn some income. You changed your\xa0why. Try this: Go to an episode from three months ago and measure how many downloads you got in the first week. Then measure how many downloads you received from one of your latest episodes. I did this for someone at Libsyn and his numbers were up 20%. You Changed Your Why Now you are stuck with a podcast about a TV show that is trying to make money. I said in my previous episode about making money with your podcast that the #1 BEST way to make money with your podcast is to have a product to sell your audience. You don\'t have one of those. The second best way is through affiliate marketing. Aside from DVD\'s of the show, there may not be a ton of products related to the show that you can promote and earn a commission on the sale. This leads you to crowdfunding with a\xa0 tool like Patreon. Patreon says you might get 5% (that\'s three people in your case) and the average donation is $7 so you might end up with $21 for the month. That should pay your monthly media hosting bill. At least your not losing money to enjoy your hobby. If you move to a platform that offers dynamic ad insertion (where you earn .0017 cents per download) you would earn an extra thirty four cents per month. Did You Make a Mistake? Some might say you didn\'t plan enough. You didn\'t think through your podcast enough, and I\'m not sure you agree with that. You started your podcast and I run into people on a regular basis who have been planning their podcast for YEARS. The six quarterbacks drafted before Brady combined to start 191 games and throw 246 touchdowns. Brady has won 201 games in his career — including four Super Bowls — and thrown 450 touchdowns ... and counting. The Beatles were formed in 1960 (Harrison, Lennon, McCartney have been together since 1958). In 1962 they got a manager to make them a bit more professional, and a music producer to help shape their sound. They didn\'t have their famed appearance on the Ed Sullivan TV show until 1964. That means it took four to six years of practicing their craft, going through some lineup changes (Pete Best, Stuart Sutcliffe, Norman Chapman, Tommy Moore, and Jimmie Nicol). They were a bit like the band Spinal Tap when it came to drummers. Keep in mind that not everyone liked the Beatles Decca Records rejected the band with the comment "Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein." So it\'s OK if not everyone likes you. Who and Why? I\'ve talked about knowing who your audience is a lot of this website, as well as knowing your why. These are the two most important questions you need to answer. If someone had said I want to start a podcast about a TV show and I want to earn a living from it in five months I would\'ve told them to not even bother. If they had told me five years, I would explain to that you need to come up with multiple streams of income. I would also point out, that it is 100% OK to do a podcast as a hobby and enjoy yourself. What Do One of a Kind People Do? Tom Brady is a quarterback in the NFL. For my friends across the pond, forgive me as I say "Football." He is playing his 20th season this year. Brady has played in nine Super Bowls, winning six of them, the most of any player in NFL history. Due to his numerous accomplishments, records, and accolades, he is considered by many sports analysts to be the greatest quarterback of all time. When you take the phrase Greatest Of All Time you get GOAT. I did a deep dive into Brady (shout out to Monica Rivera for turning me on to Tom vs Time on Facebook). I was not surprised that a ton of his success is his attitude. What Podcasters Can Learn From Tom Brady He started as a child attending football camps. He has a genuine, insatiable love of the game of Football. In high school, Brady was not good enough to start on the 0–8 JV team, which had not scored a touchdown all year. He created highlight tapes and sent them to schools he considered attending. This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation. He joins the Michigan football team as their seventh quarterback. He had over 100 practices his first year not to mention the hundreds of hours of meetings to prepare him to play. He was a backup for two years. When he finally got to play in a game his pass was a 45-yard interception resulting in the other team getting a touchdown. He wasn\'t sure if the coach would ever put him in again. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety and even considered transferring to California. He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance on the field. This aided Tom in believing in himself. In his first year at Michigan, he played one game with a rating of 63.7. He sought guidance on a weekly basis The next three years his rating was 137, 133, 138. Brady was selected by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of 2000 NFL Draft Tom Brady realizes that there are many people that want his job, so he works year-round on his game. He realizes he is in a "What have you done for me? business."In investments, there is a line that states "Past performance does not guarantee future results. " He earns his position every day. He cares deeply and has stated that losing super bowls is something he never forgets. He LOVES the game. Why else with someone with an estimated $180 million dollar net worth be putting his body on the line. He understands how to set priorities. He will say, My family is number one, and football is "One A." When its football time, he is all football. When it\'s family time, he is all in on his family. He has evolved over the years and hires coaches and experts to help out. He is looking for any kind of improvement, even if it\'s only a one percent improvement. The six quarterbacks drafted before Brady combined to start 191 games and throw 246 touchdowns. Brady has won 201 games in his career — including four Super Bowls — and thrown 450 touchdowns ... and counting. Another saying from Brady is staying hungry- stay humble. He often gives back to the community. Getting Your Podcast Unstuck Tom Brady LOVES to evaluate his performance. He is looking for ANY way to improve his performance. You should do the same. I talked about evaluating your own show in the past. Go back to some old episodes and listen with fresh ears. I recently went back through some old email sequences and found some HORRIBLE mistakes. Go listen to your show with fresh ears. Poll your audience. I just got a poll from the show Chapo House who is making $141,042 PER MONTH and their poll amounted to "What are we doing right, and what do you wish we would do less of." Do you have the courage to send out that survey? If you\'re struggling with finding topics, then take some time and search for new blogs, youtube channels, podcasts, and other sources of information that you might want to comment on. Take action to DO things that you can talk about first hand. Go to where your audience is and make friends and start relationships with people Make sure your show is everywhere. I\'ll be talking about this on DC Podfest. I am saddened when someone signs up for the Podcast Review Show or Podcast Rodeo and I ask for a link to your show and they send a link to their episode in Apple. What if I was on android like 80% of people in Europe? Start a Facebook group, or join a Facebook group around your topic. This may feed you with ideas, or introduce you to people you may want to interview. What If I Change Direction? If you change direction (and first, yes you can) you need to have the stomach for it. Why? Because not everyone is going to like your new direction and leave. Are you OK with that? You need to be because you need to realize that anyone who leaves is not your target audience. Then you need to realize that it is a bit like starting over, and it may take some time to get the attention of your target audience and get them to talk about you. Take A Long Hard Look in the Mirror It may be that you\'ve run out of gas about your topic. Maybe you\'ve said all you need to say. Very popular shows like Game of Thrones, Seinfeld, Cheers, all came to an end, and eventually, all podcats will come to an end (unless you hand it off to a new host).

Check out www.seekyourpowers.com My Thoughts on Fincon and MICDC 35:54 I was asked to speak at Fincon and the Military Influencers Conference. Both conferences were in DC.\xa0 I had a great time and probably got more clients out of that week than I have at any other conference. Why? Because the people at Fincon had a budget to learn how to podcast (or they just hire Steve Stewart) and the Military people are disciplined, focused, and not afraid to march into areas and situations they have never been in before. The interesting thing (and by that I mean hard) was these people having conversations I couldn\'t jump into. The financial people were talking Monte Carlo Simulations, and the military people had so many letters and numbers put together in ways I had never heard of I was always confused (when your A1 tried to get to the G7 before the protocol of WHAT?). At Fincon there was a speakers dinner. Everyone I was looking at was a speaker. I got my food and moved as far away from the crowd as I could. I can talk to anybody at podcast movement about podcasting, but this was different. Then I thought, "If anyone is going to benefit from a podcast in this conference it\'s probably a speaker." I walked over and did my best to jump into conversations. These were nice people, and they would eventually try to pull me in, but you feel awkward just watching others talk. You feel like a kid trying to jump into a double dutch jump rope. You\'re looking for the best time to jump in, and you\'re scared you\'re going to trip and fall. I say this to let you know that it\'s scary. I say this to let you know that it\'s a bit overwhelming to do something you\'ve never done. The fear of the unknown is real. I was able to pull myself up, and I can help you to. Work With Me Join the School of Podcasting or let me be your podcast mentor | In a previous episode, three podcasters shared their opinion on the Rodecaster pro. We all liked it but wanted some more PRO options. Today I give you an update. Because of My Podcast - I Got a Sponsor Brandon/StudeeoB of the Beats to Inspire has received his first sponsor from a music-related software company. These included  The ability to record separate tracks (both the computer and the SD card) The ability to access the micro SD card without having to pull out the card The ability to add more jingles to the jingle player The ability to see how much time is left when playing a jingle (great for people talking up exit music)  I\'ve had mine since January, and with the ability to do all the above (and more) if you want a device that will handle just about anything - this is it. Where the Rodecaster Pro Shines If you are having issues where your guest can\'t get to a computer and they want to connect via the phone (as in, well, the phone) this is the easiest way to do it). While I would never do this, but to show off its versatility, I could have my co-host on skype via my computer. Then call the guest on the phone and everyone could hear each other. If I had a panel discussion I could connect to another person on Zoom on my tablet and again, everyone could hear themselves. The\xa0only thing that I wish it did differently is it records a little lower than I normally would. HOWEVER, it records clean, and increasing the volume doesn\'t add any hiss. Holy Cow You\'re an Influencer I am very nervous today mentioning the Rodercaster Pro. Why? Because the last time I did someone with a Zoom H6 and a headphone amplifier bought one. While that setup does just about everything (minus the jingles and all the "Everyone hears everyone" features (the technical term is mix-minus). I say this because if you are doing any kind of reviews be careful and you might want to include to point out who this is a good fit (and when not to buy it) Backpack Studio Reviews StudeeoB shares his insights into Backpack Studio App for the iPhone that works as a jingle player, but also a full recording tool to do your podcast and upload it to your media host.

Emotions also play into why people share items. When you have something in common with the host it can boost the chance of us sharing the content. Emotions such as laughter or anger. Marketing messages tend to focus on information. But many times information is not enough. They need something more. And that is where emotion comes in. Rather than harping on features or facts, we need to focus on feelings; the underlying emotions that motivate people to action. In the book Contagious: Why Things Catch On by Jonan Berger they mention six principles of social currency:  Social Currency: How does it make people look to talk about a product or idea? Triggers: Peanut butter makes us think of jelly. If our content can harness trigger emotions, or tie into an environment. Emotion: Some emotions increate sharing and others decrease it. In some cases, negative emotions can be useful. Public: Making our ideas more public. Practical Value: If your podcast helps people, people love to be helpful and spread the word. Stories: People don\'t just share information and facts, they tell stories.  People prefer sharing things that make them seem entertaining rather than boring, clever rather than dumb, and hip rather than dull.

September Question of the Month How do you decide what\'s worth spending money on for your podcast? We all obviously have different budgets and needs but what\'s essential vs what do we aspire to have or use? Go to www.schoolofpodcasting.com/question Mentioned On This Episode vacuumpodcast.com Podcast Review Show (prices going up) | I was at Podcast Movement last week. I\'ve attended all six Podcast Movement eventss and it\'s been a blast to watch it grow. This year the venue was HUGE and it was weird as the number of people also grew so it was hard to tell just how much bigger it was compared to the previous year. As always this is a class act all the way around. The checking procedure, swag, were all super professional. As a speaker, I would also say I LOVE the tool they use to track my session. If I had one thing that I wish would change (and I say this every year) having loud, live music at a networking event doesn\'t work. Last year they had multiple rooms so those that wanted to dance could dance and drink. Those that wanted to drink and talk could go into another room. This year all the free beer was in the very loud room (it does seem wrong to complain about free beer). It was a great year, and even over the loud music the networking was great, and from what I hear Tom Webster from Edison Research had one of the best/controversial sessions which showed that listeners don\'t seem to care if a "podcast" has an RSS feed or not.

A representative fro Pandora stated that Pandora has planned on sharing revenue with Podcasters. This was said during the live taping of the New Media Show.

Go to\xa0www.schoolofpodcasting.com/question Mentioned In This Show Join the School of Podcasting Ask the Podcast Coach The Average Guy Network Podcast Rodeo Show\xa0 \xa0 | Last week an announcement from Google stated that podcast episodes will now appear in Google Search Results: Starting today, when you’re searching for a podcast about a topic on Google, such as “podcasts about Awkwafina” or “Instant Pot recipe podcasts,” we’ll show you playable episodes in Search results alongside web pages, news, images and videos. We’ll surface these episodes based on Google’s understanding of what’s being talked about on a podcast, so you can find even more relevant information about a topic in audio form. Soon, you won’t necessarily need the term “podcast” in your search to see episodes, making podcast discovery simpler across Search. Where Do You Think People Search More Apple or Google? With Google adding episodes to search results we need to ask the question, where are people going to find my podcast? According to a Jacobe media report, 70% of people find shows via word of mouth and only 11% search in an app. Another study from Edison Research and prominent podcast producer WNYC Studios states that: 84% of WNYC Studios listeners report having recommended a podcast to a friend, while 78% overall report having recommended a podcast to a friend. And one in three WNYC Studios listeners share podcasts on social media, at 32%. Podcast listeners also report having discovered the medium in the following ways: 17% via their smartphone, 15% via public radio programming, and 13% from an article or program. Getting a Grip on SEO The minute I heard Google was taking podcasting more seriously, (and that the Apple search was not great) I started studying SEO. Here is my limited knowledge after a few months.  Always write for humans.\xa0 You need to know where your site ranks Find some keywords that fit your audience, and your website ranks high enough to show up in search results.\xa0 Showing up for less popular keywords gets you more results in Google which can lead to higher rankings.\xa0 SEO is like Bowling or Golf, LOTS of moving pieces and trying to master it us exhausting.\xa0  Some resources I\'ve used: SEO for Podcasters from Daniel J Lewis ( $199) SEO Marketing from Juergen Berkesse of Polymash Skillshare has two classes (and intro and advanced) by Rand Fishkin who started SEO MOZ (one of the top if not THE top sites on SEO) Mangools is a Suite of Tools to help you determine the best keywords and track your progress (free/paid) Ubersuggest from Neil Patel (a free tool that gives you tons of data).

Interviews with interesting podcasters\xa0 and how-to content Multiple topics and specialized guests this way I can identify with other podcasters who’ve encountered the same trials & tribulations in connecting with their audience I really like the real-world examples you cite of how people have made (or are making) their podcasts successful. The high-quality production, how much you assuage my concerns about podcasting, identify speech patterns that drive me crazy, and overall the feeling that you\'re actually talking to me. General updates on how and with what to create, manage, and grow your podcast and audience I like your honesty and transparency most. The topics I enjoy are tips on creating content and marketing content. Honest Information about growing audience and sponsors I like the honesty, the fact you\'ll tell the truth and also aren\'t afraid to give your opinion. Specific sections, I like when you do anecdote, which is odd as I didn\'t when I first started listening. Just goes to show not to change your format. The interviews, also gear talk when you have it. Just listening to Dave talk with excitement about what\'s important to him.\xa0 I always enjoy the Because-Of-My-Podcast stories. You think about the person who is just starting out and the people who have been at it a while. (so helps me learn as a newbie, but also stretches me to research other things). Love how you use sound effects. Think it captures attention well! Expert interviews, and Last Five in Five (bring it back!) The analogies, which helps anyone at any level understand the picture you are trying to paint (even the painting with peanut butter) The interviews with industry personalities and gear/service reviews. But most of all, it\'s just your personality that keeps me listening. Your humor,\xa0 varied topics, pace, transitions, and awesome ideas and content. I love the end of episode bloopers.  What you\'d Like to Change:  The same podcasters on all the time, how about some variety? For example, if the horse podcasting guy is on, I turn the show-off, sorry, but it\'s just not my thing. Other than that, I love everything else about the show! Email responses seemed to shorten then stop altogether after a while. Keep emailing/engaging consistently. While it doesn\'t bother me, I think too often you reference "old" movies, songs etc. and go with your "back in the day" quote which may not resonate with a younger audience. For example, for me, I don’t need to hear all the steps of math to get to an hourly rate for $60,000 a year.\xa0 You could just tell me you did the math and give me the bottom line number. Not this show, but your Rodeo - there is too much \'snide\' comments. But hey, I was born British I think that Podcast Rodeo Show is a disservice to your expertise and kindness. but that\'s another show. Sometimes the sound effects get a little too morning zoo for me. All the extra sound effects you’ve been adding (more in the last year or so? Maybe 6 months?). Also, I know you’re against dates on your blog posts, but I wish you had them. Context matters & if I know it’s several years old, that might impact how I approach something. Sometimes there is so much repetition between this show, ask the podcast coach, podcasters round table, the feed, and new media show. I love all of them but fell a little disappointed when there’s too much overlap in topics.\xa0 A lot of assumed knowledge from previous episodes or technologies or podcasting I guess the only thing I worry about is I hear you on all of your other shows & know that you have a full-time job & do all of your school of podcasting stuff. I don\'t want you getting burned out! Take care of yourself, Dave! The only thing I could think of is the occasional repetition (Anchor sucks - it\'s okay to NOT make money with your show - stop checking your stats) Personally, I\'m tired of "beginner" topics. I understand you make money helping people start, but I can imagine even a beginner would appreciate your expertise on more of the "improve" your podcast topics (which you do, but I want more of them). I’m not a big fan of the easy listening/jazz music you use under your commercials. It does not command authority. The occasional crass comment or innuendo is a bit annoying. I know it doesn\'t happen often, but when it does it makes me cringe. I get that you need to share personal stuff occasionally, as we should all do, and provided it\'s kept in proportion then I\'m fine with it. First and foremost I want you to be a teacher, not a chat show host. For instance, when you did the 5 in 5 with the podcaster talking about atheism and I had to stop and pray for him and I was bummed that there are so many podcasts about people that are fallen away from the church.\xa0 So even the stuff I cringe at in your podcast, help me grow and give me a reason to pray.\xa0 I haven’t done my show in 5-6 years and yet, I still listen every week.\xa0 Keep up the zany antics and stellar content Dave Not the biggest fan of most podcast intros.\xa0 I would prefer you to start talking IMMEDIATELY about the show by possibly asking a few questions...the state that we will get into it further in the show. Example: What mics should you use when walking around outside and recording?\xa0 What is the difference between condenser blah blah blah?\xa0 We will get into it today!!\xa0 I’m Dave Jackson, and I thank you for being here at the SCHOOL OF PODCASTING! Now, let\'s talk mics.

If someone suggests something that doesn\'t\' fit the audience or your goal. you need to ignore it - this show is not for them. You can\'t please everyone. Keep in mind the new listeners, and don\'t get bit by the "curse of knowledge" and leave them in the dark. Your audience wants you to be honest and concise. They enjoy your personality (some followed me to other shows) so let your personality out. Be willing to try new things if your audience wants them, and they fit your goals. I hope you enjoyed episode 681.\xa0 Question of the Month What was the last thing your shared (that wasn\'t your content)? Why did you share it?

The company\'s flagship SaaS product KiSSFLOW is a business process management (BPM) and workflow automation tool with over 10,000 customers and 50 Fortune 500 companies.  Suresh was working as an engineer for a startup when he spotted an opportunity for a business idea. He eventually quit his job to launch his startup in 2003.  Things looked promising at the start. Before he knew it, he had at team of 40 people. But the product just didn\'t get the traction he\'d hoped for and he eventually had to pivot.  With his new idea, he raised $1M from angel investors. But he was too early to market. And by the following year he was running out of money and had to layoff most of his employees.  And then in 2013, a customer helped him see the potential of his product...  A UK based design company bought his product for $50K, but then spent another $90K on building a great user interface for it. That was when Suresh had his aha moment.  He realized that as an engineer, he\'d been focusing too much on features and technology. Instead he had to get his company building great user experiences.  And that\'s when things started to click with his third pivot (which became KiSSFLOW). The more the team focused on creating a great user experience, the more their product resonated with customers.  Today his company is doing close to $10M in ARR and has over 200 employees.  We talk about his multiple pivots, the 10 years it took to find product/market fit, his strategic approach to search engine optimization and how that now drives over 50% of leads. And we talk about what Suresh calls "Desk Marketing & Selling" which his team based in Chennai, India is using to landing customers around the world.  I hope you enjoy it.   Enjoy the show?

Mark got started as an entrepreneur in 2009 by selling online training and coaching products. A couple of years later he started getting into building and selling software products.  Over the next few years, he built a dozen different software products (most of which failed). But a couple of them did well and generated some decent revenue for him.  But one thing that he noticed when selling these products was how there wasn\'t a really good shopping cart solution. He always felt that he was leaving money on the table.  He and co-founder Matt tried different shopping cart products, but none of them met their expectations and gave them the flexibility to sell products the way that they wanted.  So eventually they decided to build their own shopping cart solution. And once they started using their new internal shopping cart, their revenue started to skyrocket.  Before they knew it, they had colleagues and partners asking how they could get the same checkout experience for their products.  That was the aha moment when PayKickstart was born. Today the company is to exceed $1 million in annual recurring revenue and is continuing to grow at a fast rate.  But the founders also had their fair share of challenges along the way. For example, they wanted to build a product that had a lot of functionality and flexibility.  But that resulted in a big customer churn problem for them because after signing up, many customers where overwhelmed and confused about how to use the product.  So they also had to figure out how to find the right balance between flexibility and a simple to use product. They also had to figure out a better onboarding process.  We talk about how they\'ve grown the business so quickly, the importance of being focused and how they went about solving their churn problem.  I hope you enjoy it.   Enjoy the show?

Alex started a web development company when he was still in college. Initially it was just a way for him and a few friends to make beer and pizza money. But over time, it evolved into an online ordering software product that the team sold to restaurant chains.  By the time they graduated the business was making 6-figures in annual revenue. And over the next 5 years, as they all worked full-time on the business, revenue grew to several million dollars and eventually they sold the business.  While working on this business, Alex had to deal with hundreds of requests for proposals (RFPs) and quickly became frustrated with how clunky and manual the RFP and procurement process was for most companies.  So in 2014 he and his co-founders started working on their next startup. With a successful exit and money in the bank, it would have been easy for the team to feel confident that they could solve the problems and start building a product right away.  Instead they agreed that they wouldn\'t build anything until they\'d talked to at least 200 people who worked in procurement. They actually end up talking to almost 300 people and those conversations helped them to build a much deeper understanding of the space.  Although there were a lot of players in the market including some really big companies, the founders decided to focus initially on a really small problem. Their MVP was a one page application and so minimal that prospective customers would often say is that it?.  But once people used the product, they loved the simplicity and how this one feature saved them so much time. And from that simple, almost too minimal MVP, their company now has grown into a business with over 150 employees and they\'ve raised $60M in funding.  There are some great lessons in this interview about the importance of listening to your customers, not jumping into building a product straight away and being really focused with your MVP by solving a really small problem at the start.

Tim worked as a software developer for well over a decade. Over time he took on more management responsibilities In 2010, Tim was hired as the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of Facebook.  He\'d only be on the job for 2 weeks when he was summoned to Mark Zuckerberg\'s office.  Tim was excited that his CEO was so motivated to get into the details of IT, that just two weeks in, he was taking time to meet with Tim.  But when Tim arrived, there was no sign of Zuck. Instead, he was met by a group of executive assistants who wanted to complain about the company\'s internal calendar app.  They told him he had to get it fixed in the next week or he was done.  From that moment, Tim set to work designing creative tools that would help Facebook employees easily find optimal times and places to meet.  Tim\'s experience managing productivity for the entire Facebook workforce helped him realize that traditional calendars are broken.  And in 2016, he left Facebook to co-found Woven, an intelligent calendar that helps busy professionals maximize their most valuable asset - their time.  In this interview we talk about Tim\'s experience at Facebook, why he feels the world needs another calendar app, how he tested different marketing channels to acquire users and why we should trust Woven with our data.

In early 2018, a listener of this show mentioned me in a tweet. He told me how the podcast was such an inspiration for him and that he was about to start his own SaaS business.  He was a single founder, bootstrapping a SaaS business for the first time and he was learning to code as he went. And over the next few months, he\'d started sharing what he was doing.  I\'d often see tweets or LinkedIn posts from him about what he had just tried, what worked and what didn\'t work. He was a completely open book and you couldn\'t help but root for him.  Once he shipped his product, he got a few early customers but wasn\'t making a lot of money. But it was interesting to watch him from the sideline as he tried all kinds of things to grow.  Around December 2018, he tweeted that one of his goals for 2019 was to be a guest on The SaaS Podcast. So I told him, get to $100K annual run rate and I\'ll invite you on the show.  He told me that at his current growth rate, he could probably get there in about 2 years time. But I told him that based on what I\'d seen of him, I was pretty sure he\'d get there sooner.  So that was the new year resolution he set on January 1st, 2019. But a week later, his life turned upside down. He was fired from his job because his employer didn\'t like him moonlighting.  And he had some tough decisions to make. Eventually he decided to go all-in with his SaaS business. He even sold his house to give him a longer runway.  Now his SaaS product wasn\'t just a side-project, it was everything to him. And it was amazing to see how getting fired from his job, gave him even more motivation to succeed with his SaaS.  And in 8 months, he achieved the goal that we set together. His business is currently doing over $10K in monthly recurring revenue. And I\'m delighted to have Reilly join me on the show.

In 2015 Geoff started an affiliate website. It was a simple business model -- promote other companies\' products and get commissions from the sales.  So his priority was to do a great job with search engine optimization and drive plenty of traffic to his website. And in order to do that, he needed to create lots of content. So he built a software tool to help him generate content.  He struggled wit that business for the next two years and he got nowhere. He knew that he had to either shutdown the business or pivot quickly.  And he had two interesting insights at this point:  1. Even though his affiliate business was a failure, he had several people asking him if they could license the software tool that he had built for himself. 2. After doing so much SEO, he realized how important structured data was becoming for Google and wondered if he could get ahead of the curve.  So based on those two factors, Geoff decided to pivot into a SaaS business. This was something that he knew nothing about.  And it became even more challenging when he had to try and sell his new product. Initially there was no user-interface, so he was going to sales meetings and trying to explain to prospects what his product would do for them but he had nothing to show them.  It was too much of a leap of faith for many prospects, but a few decided to give him a shot. And finally after three and a half years of working on his business, he started to get sales.  Today is business is almost $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).  So in this interview, you\'re going to hear Geoff\'s story and how he went through three and a half years of lean times for his business, how he pivoted into a SaaS business, what he learned about sales and the importance of structured data and how it could help you with SEO.

In 2016, a SaaS company founded in a small city in the UK was struggling with a business model that was unsustainable. After almost 10 years in business, the company was struggling to retain customers and was quickly running out of money.  That same year, Derek O\'Carroll was hired as the new CEO to help turnaround the company. He spent a lot of time talking to employees, partners and customers to figure out the issues.  He started building a list of things that needed to get fixed. And the more conversations he had, the longer his list got. He quickly realized that he wouldn\'t be able to fix everything.  He needed to focus. So he eventually identified 3 key areas of improvement. And he decided to focus the majority of his time and his teams\' time on solving those 3 things.  It looked like a good plan. But it wasn\'t smooth sailing. In fact, when they started executing on the plan, they actually made the customer churn problem even worse for a while as they lost a lot more customers very quickly.  But they stayed the course and kept executing the plan. And eventually it paid off.  In the last 3 years, revenue has more than doubled and is growing at almost 50% year over year. And they\'ve significantly reduced their customer churn.  The key lesson here is that if your business is struggling, or you feel like revenue has flatlined, or you have high churn, sometimes it can be overwhelming.  Where do you start? What do you solve? You might have a super long list of things. But identify the top 2 or 3 things that you believe will make a difference and do a really great job to execute relentlessly in those areas.

You\'ve got a great idea for a SaaS product, but no one else seems as excited about it. Does that mean it\'s a bad idea and you should move on to something else? Not necessarily.  In 2013, Josh was at a car dealership waiting for his car to be serviced. He overheard a conversation which got him curious about how brick and mortar companies like car dealerships got referrals and if there was a way to automate word of mouth referrals.  He did some research that evening and thought he\'d found a gap in the market. He was excited about his idea but he didn\'t like what he heard when he interviewed prospective customers. No one seemed excited about his idea.  But being a bit stubborn, he decided to build an MVP anyway.  He kept things really simple and cobbled together a few different tools and technologies to quickly build an MVP. And he started getting the word out anyway and every way he could.  And slowly he started getting people signing up for his product. About 18 months later, he had around 500 users signed up.  But there was one big problem. Josh wasn\'t charging any money for his product. He had hundreds of users but no customers and no revenue.  One day, a close friend told Josh something that he needed to hear. He didn\'t have a real business until he was charging for his product and generating sales.  So reluctantly that weekend, he added a paid plan. And to his surprise, a week later he had his first customer paying him $59 a month.  Today, Josh runs a 100% remote company with 12 full-time employees and he\'s generating $70,000 in monthly recurring revenue. And his business is totally bootstrapped.  At every step, he kept second guessing himself and questioning how big his business could become. But he kept executing, trying new things and taking action.  There was no magic bullet or hack that helped him grow. He kept doing small things to see what worked and if they did, they figured out how to scale them. And that\'s what he\'s still doing today.  It\'s a great story and Josh talks candidly about his successes and failures.  I hope you enjoy it.   Enjoy the show? Subscribe and leave a rating & review to show your support.

Having a great product and clear differentiation is super important, but sometimes that\'s not enough. You also need a great product launch that helps you stand out in the market and drive rapid product adoption.  In 2016, Shawn had an idea for a new SaaS product. He already had an existing business and realized that many of his customers were struggling with the same issue.  So he started thinking about how he could build a SaaS product to help them. After doing some research, he decided he was going to go all in\' with this new SaaS business.  But there was one big problem. Shawn was building a sales automation product and so he was about to enter an extremely crowded and competitive market.  No matter how good his product was, he knew it was going to be a challenge to stand out in that market. So he knew that a successful launch was going to be critical for his new business.  In this interview you\'ll learn:  * How Shawn started promoting Autoklose 6 months before it launched and how he had 1000 demos booked when they launched the product. * How Shawn worked with industry influencers and partners to help promote Autoklose and get in front of a much bigger audience. * How Shawn used social selling on LinkedIn to position himself as an authority in the space and attract prospects.  As a result, the business has gone from zero to over a million dollars a year in about 18 months.  There are a lot of great lessons and insights in this interview. I hope you enjoy it.

In 2002, Cedric moved from France to the USA. And he landed a job as a web developer at a higher education college in Indiana.  He found himself spending a lot of time building web forms to capture data. It was tedious and boring work. But he realized how important these forms were from a business perspective.  He started spending his evenings and weekends developing a form builder - an automated way for his end-users to create these web forms themselves. It was just a side-project.  He shared the project on Hacker News and people started signing up. After a while, he added a paid plan and before he knew it, he was earning coffee money from his side-project.  It was slow going, but Cedric kept working on his side-project. He listened to feedback he was getting and kept improving the product.  The cost of living in Indiana was pretty low compared to places like San Francisco. And after 2 years, he was making enough money to quit his job and focus on his product full-time.  But there was nothing unique about Cedric\'s product. There were already a number of similar form builders on the market and it seemed like new ones were being created every week.  So how big could his little side-project get? And how could he stand out from the crowd?  He kept listening to what his customers told him. And eventually he found one simple thing that helped him differentiate his product.  In this interview, you\'re going to learn what the one thing was. And you\'ll learn how he doubled down on that differentiator to bootstrap his little side-project into a profitable business with 65 employees.  It didn\'t happen overnight, it\'s taken Cedric 13 years to get here. But it\'s an inspiring story on how you can turn a simple idea into a successful SaaS business.  I hope you enjoy it.

One of the elements of the Listing Agent Lifestyle we always talk about is Getting Referrals and managing your after unit for a 20% annual yield. Well, here we are, we\'re going to be talking with someone today who\'s doing just that! You\'re going to hear just how possible it is to get a really great yield and high volume of transactions, based on the relationships with a small group of people. I think this is going to be very motivating. We spent almost the entire podcast talking about his After Unit, and leveraging the things he has going on with his Listing Multiplier opportunities created from the business he\'s doing. You\'ll want to listen closely, and take some notes for this one. \xa0 Links: Show Notes GoGoAgent.com Be a Guest Listing Agent Lifestyle Book Listing Agent Scorecard \xa0 | Today on the Listing Agent Lifestyle podcast we\'re talking with Ric Luis Araujo from Oahu, Hawaii and Ric has just started the Getting Listings program, mailing to an area he wants to dominate. We identified a couple of tweaks that will fundamentally shift the way he thinks about the program, and I\'m glad we had this conversation because we spent the entire hour talking about the structure and thought process behind why and how the Getting Listings program works the way it does. I think even though Ric felt like he was alone in wondering if this approach will work for him, and if he was \'doing it right\', I know a lot of people have similar questions. So this full hour is exactly about how do we evaluate the area you\'re choosing to mail, why we do what we do, and what you can expect when you start a Getting Listings mailing for your area. PS: Our 2nd annual Listing Agent Lifestyle real estate mastermind event is coming up in Toronto next month. We\'ve got an amazing 2 days planned. On day one we join up with the Archangel Summit and we have Seth Godin, Elisabeth Gilbert (author of Eat, Pray, Love) and Todd Herman (author of The Alter Ego effect) and lots of other great speakers... On the 2nd day, we\'re doing a real estate only day to focus on the Future Of Real Estate as we enter the 2020\'s. We\'re going to focus the best things we can do now to really capitalize on the opportunities we have right now while everyone in our industry is waiting for the "disruptors" to ruin everything :) Would you like to join us?

She\'s had a lot of success, especially around the University of Oregon campus where a lot of investors are eager to buy multi-family homes because of the rental nature of people coming to go to school. We had a wonderful conversation about the importance of really dominating that target market because there are so few people actually control that whole space. There are only 235 owners who own 500 buildings, which can tame all of the multi-family homes over four units in Eugene. We talked about a complete strategy to dominate not only the listing side of the market but the buyer side as well. The ideas are totally transferrable from everything we talk about on the residential side, and the same applies if you\'re trying to dominate lakefront homes or golf course homes or oceanfront condos... multi-family is no different. We need to speak to sellers in a language that\'s appealing to sellers, all the while speaking to and attracting buyers with a language that\'s attractive to them. Then we can put them together as a market maker. This was a really great conversation, it went very quickly, and there\'s a lot for you to get out of it.

You may remember Tony from his appearance as the very first guest on the podcast. Well, this September marks the sixth year of his Getting Listings case study, and the numbers are pretty amazing. We\'re now at over a million dollars in commissions, with a 12.2 times ROI, and it\'s pretty exciting to see how it all has worked out so far. We\'re well down the path of multiplying the investment Tony\'s made in that first year, and we spent a lot of the call talking really about what happened in those 12 months. What was amazing is that we found that since mailing the first year postcards, he\'s got 165 people to raise their hand and ask for the report, and since that time he\'s done 22 transactions with people who responded in the first 12 months. So over the six years, he\'s got 22 listings from this group, and there were another 22 people who sold their house, but not with Tony. I know people often ask, \'Are the people responding to a free house price report really selling their house? Well, clearly they are, and Tony was able to get 50% of the people who requested the report and then went on to sell their house in the next six years. It\'s interesting because some of them chose Tony this year, even though they responded in 2013! This is a fascinating conversation and I want it to be an encouragement for you to get started and come on over to GoGoAgent.com. You get access to the entire program, every single thing that Tony\'s doing, including other interviews and videos that will give you you the opportunity to do exactly what Tony has done.

As you know, I was traveling over the summer, and while in Amsterdam for our 4th annual Breakthrough Blueprint event, we got to record our Periodic Podcast. It\'s a kind of \'year in marketing\' review for both of us. We talked about a lot of the things that we\'ve done over the last 12 months, compare notes, reflect on our successes, and talk about what we see for the future. It\'s perfect timing as we\'re moving into the 2020s to look at what are the things shaping not only the next 10 years on a macro level, but what are the technologies, the sentiments, and the tools that we can actually take advantage of right now. I also want to give you a heads up that October 19th and 20th in Toronto, we are doing a marketing and real estate event about the future of real estate marketing. The first day is in conjunction with the Archangel summit where there\'ll be a few thousand people with Seth Godin, Todd Herman, Elizabeth Gilbert and lots of other amazing speakers. Then on the second day, we\'ll have a day just for real estate agents, so it\'s more like a mastermind where we can talk about all the things that are going to be important in getting poised and ready for deploying the marketing, mindset, and tools for the 2020s So if you want to get ahead of the curve here, just send me an email to Dean@DeanJackson.com, and I\'ll get you all of the details. \xa0 Links: Show Notes GoGoAgent.com Be a Guest Listing Agent Lifestyle Book Listing Agent Scorecard \xa0 | Today on the Listing Agent Lifestyle podcast we\'re wrapping up the final installment of our summer series on 10 Money Getting Ideas for your real estate business with number nine, Multiplying Your Listings, and number 10, Becoming a Productivity Ninja. There\'s going to be some really great ideas here. I really work a lot on this idea of Multiplying Your Listings. If you\'ve got listings right now and you\'re the only one with that listing, then you\'ve got an opportunity that\'s amazing right now. You\'ve got not just the opportunity to get that listing sold, but you\'ve got an opportunity to find the buyer for that house. You\'ve got the opportunity to find a buyer who buys another house if they don\'t buy this one. You\'ve got the opportunity to get the next listing in that neighborhood, and you\'ve got the opportunity to get a referral from the seller before the end of the transaction. There is so, so much opportunity to leverage what you\'re doing.

Now, you\'ll see what I mean by that because there\'s nothing more powerful than love as a motivator, and this idea, when you start thinking about it, \'what if you were really treating each prospect like they were the love of your life?\' is kind of an interesting mindset. You\'ll see some of the thoughts that this leads to. \xa0 Links: Show Notes GoGoAgent.com Listing Agent Scorecard Listing Agent Lifestyle Book Be a Guest \xa0 | Today on the Listing Agent Lifestyle podcast we\'re going to talk about something that you can put into action right now... literally today, and preferably every week for the rest of your career. This is the one thing that can have the lowest cost, highest yield return in your business, and we call it being a market maker. There are many opportunities available to you here, but if I could instill one habit in you, it would be to get into the Market Maker Monday habit where every week on Monday, you take a moment and think to yourself, who am I working with right now? Who am I going to show homes to this week? Who am I going to see about selling their home this week?, and then think to yourself, who do I know, who are my clients, or who are the people in my sphere that live immediately near those places I\'m already going to? You\'re able to, with this simple email strategy we\'re going to talk about, be able to turn that thought into a referral getting opportunity. You\'re really going to enjoy this episode. \xa0 Links: Show Notes GoGoAgent.com Be a Guest Listing Agent Lifestyle Book Listing Agent Scorecard \xa0 | Today the Listing Agent Lifestyle podcast, I\'m calling in from Toronto, coming to the end of our summer adventure, and heading back to Florida on Sunday.

Send an email to personal contacts first: friends and family. Start with 10 people, and email them individually from your “real” email account. The email should read like this: SUBJECT: this may not be for you, but... Hey [name], I’m writing some articles about [topic] and thought you might be interested! Can I pass some stuff along to you? [your name] Do not write anything after the question at the end of the email. Do not say thank you. Do not say “I hope you’re well!” You must end the message with a question! This creates an open loop that is almost too difficult to ignore. What happens if a person replies with a yes? Send them this next email. You may not even need a new subject line. Just reply to their email in the same thread. If you start a new email, just use the subject line below: SUBJECT: two quick questions! Hi [name], Awesome! Really quick, I have two questions: What’s your biggest question about [topic]? What blogs, books, or podcasts do you go to in order to learn more about [topic]? Would you let me know? [your name] If you think this is simple, it is. Simple things work. That’s the premise of this entire newsletter. Start with ten people. It’s likely you’ll get at least one or two positive responses. If it worked once, then it can work again. Pick ten more people. Do the work. Why send the second email? Because I’m teaching you to make a habit of gathering data.

The time and effort it takes for someone to click ‘Follow\' on Twitter, or watch a few seconds of a Youtube video, should never be compared to podcast listening.Podcast listening is a commitment, and an investment. It\'s long form content that isn\'t immediately accessible via shiny sidebars and viral social media clickbait.So comparing your downloads to someone else\'s Instagram followers is like comparing the number of rooms in your house, to the number of trees in the Amazon. It\'s completely irrelevant and utterly pointless.Does it (as usual) Just Depend?Of course it does.Could a podcast about breeding Russian white dwarf hamsters realistically expect to see the same downloads as a podcast about Game of Thrones? Absolutely not.Does this mean that the podcast with more downloads is the more successful one? Again, absolutely not.If you ran a podcast about a topic that was only interesting to literally 10 people in the world, and you were getting 7 downloads an episode, statistically, you\'d be running the most popular show in history.It\'s the size of your potential audience that\'s the big factor. Here are a couple of things to consider.Firstly, how many folks out there are interested enough in your topic to actually want to consume content about it?Secondly, how many of those people are current podcast listeners?Thinking along these lines will help bring you closer to seeing what those cold hard download stats tell you. They can help you set realistic goals, that don\'t involve drawing comparisons with viral videos and celebrity social media accounts.A Good Gauge\xa0One of the easiest ways to get a snapshot of podcast download stats as a whole, is to listen to Libsyn\'s official podcast The Feed.Libsyn are one of the biggest podcast media hosting platforms in the industry.Naturally, they can only provide stats based on the shows that host there. But there\'s over 50,000 of them, which makes it a pretty significant sample size.Their show – The Feed – is also essential listening for any podcaster – even if you don\'t host with Libsyn. They provide great statistical data every other week. This can help you to see how your numbers measure up in the grand scheme of things. Remember, though, that it\'s far from the whole story.At the time of writing, here were the latest figures. These are based on the number of downloads in the 30 day period following the release of a new episode.If your new episode gets, within 30 days of its release:more than 136 downloads, you\'re in the top 50% of podcasts.more than 1100 downloads, you\'re in the top 20% of podcasts.more than 3200 downloads, you\'re in the top 10% of podcasts.more than 7,700 downloads, you\'re in the top 5% of podcasts.more than 20,000 downloads, you\'re in the top 2% of podcasts.more than 36,000 downloads, you\'re in the top 1% of podcasts.Source: The Feed – Episode 145A big thanks to NameSilo for sponsoring this episode.

Then, if you make it easy to find and share, you\'ll struggle not to grow your audience.However, many early-stage and aspiring podcasters don\'t like to hear that it can take months, or even years, to build an established listener-base.Podcasting is a long game though, and “overnight success” is a myth in this medium.Getting More PlaysThere\'s no getting away from the above facts. But, for those willing to spend some money, it is possible to get more ears on your podcast in a short period of time.Of course, your content will still need to do its job in making these listeners stick around to hit subscribe. But, you\'re listening to this podcast, so naturally, you\'ve already got that part nailed down!So, where can you actually run some podcast advertising? And which options are the most suited to you and your target audience?What are the Paid Podcast Advertising Options?The following list is ever-changing, ever-growing. At the time of writing, here are the best options available to you.They\'re in no particular order, because in podcasting it\'s rarely ever a case of “the best”, and almost always a case of “it depends”.Read the full articleSocial MediaGoogle AdsOvercastSpotifyPrint MagazinesPodnewsSponsor a BlogSponsor Another PodcastA big thanks to NameSilo for sponsoring this episode.

You put a lot of work into creating your episodes, so let\'s have a chat about where (and how) your end product is actually consumed. This episode starts with a discussion about why you should consider listening to less podcasts too. It was prompted by a great article by Greg Campion titled The Problem With Podcasts (thanks for the heads up, PodNews) and, for a deeper dive on this, check out the excellent Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. On to the listening apps, Colin uses BeyondPod (Android) whilst Matthew uses Overcast (iOS) and both were in agreement that things like playlist and playback-speed customisation, as well as individual show and download settings were key factors here. From a podcaster perspective, you\'ll be listed in these apps (and most other apps) simply by being listed in iTunes/Apple Podcasts. You\'ll still need to submit to Stitcher and Spotify independently though.

And the content itself can benefit from that immediate feedback. The ability to answer questions and offer help and advice in real time can really enhance your podcast.\xa0You can also double up your content output without doubling up your workload, by uploading the video recording to Youtube afterwards.\xa0The live approach isn’t for everyone though. Especially if you’ve just started out in podcasting and don’t have an audience yet.

Nope! As an author, you’re not just looking to write a book, but you’re hoping to sell that book, too. Our guest today talks about what she did for her launch and how it set her on the path to great book sales, as well as opportunities. Amy Lyle is an author, comedienne, actor and screenwriter whose book launch kicked off with a party that set her book up for consistent sales and lots of publicity opportunities that followed. For more information, visit the show notes at https://kindlepreneur.com/e64\xa0 | Back in Episode 61, we talked about what it’s like to work with publishers and the differences between legitimate, illegitimate, and vanity presses. But in today’s episode, we talk with an author who has gone the traditional publishing route and self-published. She has also set up her own publishing company. Anna David became well-known as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers. When her first novel was picked up, her publisher, unfortunately, ended up in the midst of a scandal, and the book was published under a fake imprint. Although she received plenty of press, the book did not sell well. This was back in the early 2000s, before everyone, it seems, was on social media. But Anna also realized that unless you are a major celebrity, publishing houses will only do so much for your book. She found even if the publisher is paying you upfront for the book, you still have to know how to market yourself. She also says it’s important to focus on owning your audience and making sure it’s not an audience you’ll lose should you decide to switch to another publisher or self-publish in the future. Anna has now become a publisher for others with her friend Kristen McGuiness. She helps new authors establish a writing presence, and she also helps authors with their writing and marketing. One of the most important lessons to take from this episode is just because you’re able to land a contract with a publishing company, it doesn’t necessarily mean success. Even with traditional publishers, it’s still important you know how to market your book yourself. For more information about Anna, or any of the resources mentioned, visit the show notes at https://kindlepreneur.com/e63\xa0 | Book writing software. There are a lot of options. In today’s episode, we’ll talk about three of the most common ones: Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and Scrivener. Microsoft Word is familiar to many and may already be on your computer. Google Docs is free and cloud-based, meaning you can access it from anywhere. Scrivener has the most bells and whistles, though, and is designed with authors in mind. Each one has pros and cons, and depending on your style of writing, you may prefer one over the others. For more information, visit the show notes at https://kindlepreneur.com/e62\xa0 | As an author and consultant who has worked with a number of book publishers, it’s important for us authors to understand how publishing companies work, what they look for in books, and what authors need to consider before signing anything. The biggest thing to consider is these companies are looking for books that will sell. There are four main things to take into account when it comes to leveraging your book:  The subject matter is something the company really cares about. Your own sales as a self-published author. Your social media following and/or email list. How much you stick to the company’s core structure.  There are so many independent book publishers now, you may find it’s easy to find a publisher that is perfect for your genre or book style. You may even find publishing companies that are focused even more on particular niches within that genre. If you’ve already self-published, having good sales numbers is also appealing to publishing companies. Even if you’re not published yet, you may have already been building an email list or your social media following. Publishing companies are able to see those numbers as absolute sales, and they’ll see you as a good risk to take. I’ve even seen one author leverage different publishing companies against one another to get a six-figure deal. If you find a publishing company that seems to fit your genre, you may want to look at other books they have published to see their core style. If you’re able to write in that style, you’ll look more appealing to that company. Before You Sign You may have found what you think to be the perfect publishing company for your book. But before you sign anything, you should be aware of the different ways deals can be structured. When talking with Jeff Goins, another author, he said when you sign a deal with a publishing company, how much they give you upfront is usually an indication of how much effort they’re going to put into your book marketing. If they put money up front, they have more skin in the game to recoup those costs. Find out what kind of support you’ll receive from your publishing company. Will there be a marketing team? What kind of marketing are you expected to do? After a Rejection Understand that you may get rejected, as well. J.K. Rowling is known for getting rejected by many publishers until her agent called in a favor and begged a publisher to read the first “Harry Potter” book. But if you get rejected from one of the major publishing companies, you may be passed along to their vanity press, which is like a subsidiary of the bigger company. You may have to pay to get published through these, plus you’ll have to do a lot of your own marketing. And on top of that, they still get a cut. Smaller publishers may be able to give you more personalized attention. Be sure to do your research on the ones you find, though. It’s easy enough to create a limited liability corporation, throw up a website, and call yourself a publisher, but find out if they actually have the skill-set to get your book in front of the right market. Regardless of your decision to sign with a big or small publisher, it’s still important you learn marketing. Gaining a following and an email list is essential, as well. These are tools that will help you sell your own books, as well as pitch your books to publishers. Resources Referred to in this Episode:  Jeff Goins Book Marketing Show Setting Up a Book Publishing Company  | Facebook can seem like an intimidating place to put yourself out there as an author if you’re not used to it. You may wonder how to navigate between using it for personal reasons versus using it as a marketing arm of your books. But it can be a powerful tool and, used correctly, can help your readers connect with you more. Audrey Hughey helps her students in the Author Transformation Alliance use tools like Facebook to help market their books without coming across as too pushy or “salesy.” She talks about how Facebook pages can be set up separately from our personal profiles and what kind of content works to our advantage when it comes to selling without seeming “salesy.” \xa0 For more information, visit the show notes at\xa0https://kindlepreneur.com/e60\xa0 | When you first start out as a writer, you may be looking to supplement your income. One great way of doing this is to become a ghostwriter. A ghostwriter is an author who is paid to write a book for someone else. It may not seem like it carries the same weight as authoring your own book and seeing your name on the cover, but there are a lot of reasons not to discount ghostwriting. For one thing, it could bring in enough income for you to be able to quit your 9-to-5 job to focus on becoming an author, like our guest on today’s podcast, Matthew Thrush. Matthew is a six-figure ghostwriter. He went into it with the idea that he liked to write, but quickly realized that he was able to quit his day job to become a ghostwriter for others.

Sometimes when we find our books aren’t selling well, we may have to make the choice between reviving it or letting it go. In this Reviving a Dead Book case study, we look at an author who decided not to revive his first book, but instead tried reviving his second. Then, he was able to look at both to see the difference a revive can make.  Stuart Thaman wrote his first book in college during NaNoWriMo and it was picked up by a publishing company, but didn’t initially do well. He honed his craft, began writing more, and learning more about marketing. Now he’s considered one of the top book marketers and helps publishing companies with their AMS ads.

Sure, it may sound like less work because they’re typically fewer words, but there are things to think about you may not be prepared for. But if you have ever thought about it, it’s a great market to get into. About 40 million children’s books are sold online every year. Eevi Jones has written more than a dozen children’s books of her own and uses her knowledge to teach others the skills needed to write, publish and market their own children’s books. The tips she shares in this episode will help you think about the different factors to consider when writing a children’s book, as well as get you started in the right direction. For more information, visit the show notes at http://kindlepreneur.com/e57\xa0 | Michael Knight who went from doing OK with sales of his book to seeing some major changes after taking my free AMS course and using KDP Rocket. One of the things I talk about in the KDP Rocket course is that you may find keywords to use for your book you may not have immediately thought of before. Michael is still learning what keywords work best with his book for AMS ads, which he talks about in the episode and gets ideas for even more keywords that may attract his ideal reader to his book. For more information, visit the show notes at https://kindlepreneur.com/e56 | If you’re using CreateSpace to create and market your book, you won’t want to miss this ingenious way you can price your book higher, sell it for a lower price, and still get the royalties that come from the higher price. While you may not necessarily use this tactic, I do encourage authors to test different prices for their books anyway to see what works best for them. Former guest Derek Doepker stumbled upon this hack and talks with me today about how it works and how we can use it ethically. This is within CreateSpace’s terms of service, but when you use this hack, you want to make sure you’re adjusting the price so it make sense for the size of your book and still gives Amazon and Barnes & Noble a profit.

We are just now seeing the beginning days of the end of social media as we know it.

In fact, it was one of my favorite things to read about in school – I find it to be fascinating in many ways, but perhaps it’s because it relates to something we all do, all the time, and don’t really stop to think about why.\xa0And more importantly – we don’t stop to think about if it is doing us harm or good, and how we might control this natural state of the brain. Counterfactual thinking is a fancy way to say “what if..” or “if only...” Maybe you have memories of your childhood or choices you made, and then think that with a little more discipline (or focus or effort or training) you could have been an actor or doctor or run that marathon.\xa0 We all have regrets on actions taken or not taken, and these are represented in our brains via counterfactual thinking. This may seem like a hurdle to overcome, but it is actually central to being a human being – our emotions and the way we think - and can be a VERY good thing (listen to learn the 1 important step to shift from vicious cycle to goal-achieving awesomeness). Studies have found counterfactual thinking happens across all cultures and as early as 2 years old. CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [02:42] Counterfactual thinking is a fancy way to say "what if" or "if only." [04:05] Counterfactual thinking can be very useful for setting and accomplishing goals.\xa0 [04:20] There are different types of counterfactuals, and they do different things. When you are thinking about a better alternative it is called an upward counterfactual, and those with worse alternatives are downward counterfactuals. [04:57] Upward counterfactual are tied very closely with regret. Anticipated regret (or prefactuals) will be the focus of a future episode. Regret and counterfactual thinking really go hand in hand. [05:17] The first theoretical explanation of counterfactual thinking came from Kahneman and Miller back in 1986, and was called norm theory. [05:39] When looking at counterfactuals consider if they are omissions or commissions, ruminations or undoings, usual or extreme, actions of ourselves or others, and if they cause negative impact or how they can be used for good. [06:29] An omission is when you wish you had acted. A commission is wishing you had not taken an action.\xa0 [07:10] A rumination is where you think about what happened, but you don’t have any thoughts about how things might have been different. Undoing is where the counterfactual “if only” or “what if” comes into play – what might have been if you had or hadn’t done something. [08:40] Usual or extreme: the way you do your counterfactual thinking will be different if it was coming in through the same door as you always do versus coming in a way you never do. [11:24] Ourselves or others. Whose actions the counterfactuals are targeted at. We tend to focus our counterfactual thoughts on ourselves – what we coulda shoulda woulda done – more often than we look at others. [12:24] Distress and anxiety. While there is a healthy side to counterfactuals, when used in excess it can be really damaging to the psyche. [14:25] Thinking and counterfactualizing doesn\'t change what happened. [16:02] Putting too much into ‘what if’ and counterfactual thinking can often make a mountain out of a molehill. It can be unhealthy and cause you more harm than simply letting it go and moving on would do. [16:12] Your conscious brain can only focus on so much and the brain gets what it expects. [18:16] A study was published in 1995 in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin on counterfactual thinking and undoing traumatic life events. [20:58] A study found that 80% of those that lost loved ones in a car accident had ruminative thoughts of the event, and 59% said they had thought about the events leading up to the accident within the past month. [21:49] Over half of the respondents were actively undoing the event in their heads – having counterfactual thoughts – within the last month, for an event from 4-7 years earlier. [22:20] 69% focused on a usual activity. 28% focused on an exceptional activity. [23:34] 41% of those undoing reported wishing that they had done something. 31% reported wishing that they had not acted as they did. 17% reported both. [24:24] 55% focused on their own behavior, while the other 45% were focused on the behavior of the deceased. Not one person reported trying to undo the other driver’s behavior (even though in most cases that person was legally responsible for the accident). [26:29] The person thinking about the process is more likely to undo the actions of the focal actor – themselves or the person they knew. [27:26] If you go through counterfactual “if only” and “what if” sort of thinking…remember that just because your brain is only focusing on you…it doesn’t mean it is right or the only option. [28:39] Undoing may, at least partially, be a distress-driven cognitive process. [31:09] The more you continue to focus on undoing, the more you will have continued distress. [32:28] Highly distressed people come to undo more frequently, thus perpetuating their distress. [33:06] The only item that led to increased levels of distress was the frequency that someone was going through the process of undoing. [33:55] Your mood and focus is created by your own brain. And while it is perfectly normal to partake in counterfactual thinking, too much can be harmful.\xa0 [34:30] Counterfactual thinking is a critical way we regulate our behavior and how we are able to reach our goals. [34:50] When you fail to reach a goal, you are more likely to have counterfactual thoughts. [35:23] Instead of having counterfactual thoughts, decide what you could do better next time. [37:47] You need to allow yourself to move on and not let it take over everything else in your life and work.\xa0 [38:57] Next time you get into a counterfactual spin…think about how someone else might think you’re the luckiest guy or gal in the world! [40:17] Whether you are naturally a silver lining person or not…acting as if you were is often enough to trick your brain into starting to think that way.

Behavioral Economics Foundations: Relativity  Free Master Your Mindset Mini Course  | Motivation is definitely a key piece of the mindset puzzle, so it’s no wonder its been taking up brain space for me recently. My Instagram followers already know I’ve been working on getting back into running. In this episode, I get vulnerable and share with you my very personal relationship with running. It revolves around a limiting belief that was created in my mind, as well as mindset and motivation issues.\xa0 I also talk about the two types of motivation. Motivation can either be intrinsic or extrinsic. Essentially, that means it either comes from your own self (intrinsic) or from an outside source (extrinsic). I also talk about apps and other things that can help you with motivation (or you can use to motivate employees or customers in your business). In fact, this is where today’s topic came from. While on a run I was thinking about the apps I use and how their pricing could be better aligned with motivation and the way the brain actually works. Hopefully, you’ll walk away with motivation inspiration and pricing insights for your business. CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [04:03] Motivation is definitely a key piece of the mindset puzzle. [05:01] I\'m going to get vulnerable and share a story about my relationship with running. [06:14] Unfortunately, words from a misguided ballet teacher helped cement a limiting belief in my mind that I couldn\'t run. [08:27] I wanted to run again and tried, but I still had mindset blocks. In 2013, an executive coach helped me to break through my mindset blocks.\xa0 [10:36] I had overcome my running mental demons, but was then hit by two cars on the freeway. This led to new mindset and motivation struggles. [12:09] In August, I decided to apply all of my mindset learning and make a change. I started Couch to 5k all over again from the beginning. [13:30] Running gives me clarity. The spark for this episode came from my thoughts around the running apps that I used and how their pricing could be better aligned with motivation and the way the brain actually works. [13:59] Motivation can either be intrinsic or extrinsic. Essentially, that means it either comes from your own self (intrinsic) or from an outside source (extrinsic). [15:12] Thinking about something from a fresh, new angle will allow you to shake off the cobwebs and old rules to refresh your motivation. [16:16] A lot of people get hung up on is sales calls or some other version of drumming up new business. [16:28] the act of making the call is scary – that’s fear talking. You are intrinsically dwelling and keeping the whole conversation inside your own head. [17:02] You could make a commitment to a friend that you will both make a certain number of sales calls by the end of the week. [18:10] Loss aversion and other brain motivators can help you get over the mindset block and into motivation territory.\xa0 [18:29] When you are feeling a lack of motivation or want to motivate yourself, think about the mindset block that is keeping you stuck. [19:25] Understanding your priorities so you can say no to things that are outside the goals is key to getting (and staying) motivated. [20:37] Couch to 5k is a free app, but you have to pay to upgrade to get some bonus features. [22:19] One thing I think this app really lacks is it stops tracking when their prescribed course is done. [22:42] They are conditioning me to not want to put in any extra effort or push myself beyond their 30 minutes because there is no benefit to doing so. [25:04] Also, I am pushed outside the app to get my pace, which decreases the value of the sell and makes me less likely to pay. [26:56] If ZenLabs and Couch to 5k was my client, I would recommend that the monthly payment include access to all the apps and benefits.\xa0 [27:34] If it does not include all the apps, I recommend the extrinsic motivation / loss aversion model. [29:30] If you don’t plan (which conditions for the importance of mental preparation around fitness) you pay if you miss. Lazy Jar does exactly this. [30:10] This is like stickK which I believe was the first app to use brain science for motivation in this way. This app was created by behavioral economists and has helped people reach all sorts of goals. [31:18] Runkeeper allows you to store your running data. You get tons of free stats. You also get badges, and it does gps tracking. [33:31] I can pay up to track how similar runs get better or worse.\xa0 [34:32] Little pulls from an account on a regular basis could be a motivational tactic as well. [34:53] Runkeeper is definitely catered to the one time annual payment (which I believe is opposite of Couch to 5k). [35:33] Isn’t it funny how the big price disparity makes one thing look like a better value?\xa0 How one small shift makes it look completely different? [36:10] If you have a business with subscription models that depend on regular usage and enjoyment…the goal is really to keep motivation up. [37:55] My 3 tips: 1) Limit your goals. Having too many goals is a recipe for motivation failure. Get your total goals down to 3 max. [38:18] 2) Flip the script (reframe). Look at the mind block and ask if its intrinsic or extrinsic and then switch to the other. [39:11] 3) Look at the small steps. Start by thinking big and then putting together small action steps to get there. [40:00] If social media is a priority, you can break it up into small steps. Once something becomes a habit, you can incorporate more things. [40:55] Keeping motivated doesn’t have to be as elusive as it might seem. It’s all about understanding the brain and how to work with its rules around mindset to achieve your big dreams.

Show Notes:  [04:42] Nikki calls herself a super fan. She is excited about the course. [06:48] I put pricing first, because it\'s the thing I get asked about the most. Price is such a huge factor and having the right price makes such an impact.\xa0 [08:49] This course is about all of the stuff you need to think about when creating a pricing strategy. We don’t talk about specific prices until the very last module. [09:58] There seems to be a huge gap in all of the ways to think about the numbers. The course helps to understand numbers in a more robust way and factor in things that matter (like time).\xa0 [11:10] There is also a step by step walk through on how to raise prices. That discusses what to talk about now before raising your price (and how to change the language/plan for current and new customers). [12:10] There also scripts for presenting the price depending on the platform.\xa0 [13:50] I also review and explain specific framing examples using real-life ads and email subject lines from companies.\xa0 [15:32] The Brainy Pricing Course has comprehensive worksheets to guide through all the steps and possible situations.\xa0 [18:38] I structured the courses and workshops to be evergreen and updated when new relevant content comes out. Purchasers can revisit the course over and over.\xa0 [21:35] The workshop component helps put a deadline in place to complete the work and it\'s an avenue to get questions answered and overcome hurdles that may come up. [25:07] The workshop emulates a mastermind hot seat format. There is so much extra value from hearing other people\'s experiences. [26:58] You can purchase the course and then add the workshop, but you will save $100 purchasing both at once.\xa0 [28:55] Having the ability to set the right price and be confident about it is like the course paying for itself. [31:41] The course has 10 modules. You can also get the mindset module for free (Master Your Mindset mini-course) to see what a full course might be like.\xa0 [35:26] You can find all the courses in the Brainy Business Member Vault. You can also save by buying the bundle, and use the above discount codes for an even better value.\xa0 [37:24] This course is an investment you make in yourself and in your business.

In my master’s program, I was required to do my own study and submit it to at least one location for publication. I already had a relationship with the Filene Research Institute, so I decided to reach out to them before choosing the focus of my project. Their top choices were helping people save money and increase loyalty. A group of researchers from Duke University did an experiment in Kenya to try and find ways to increase savings. After six months, the surprising results were that a using a gold coin to mark off weeks of savings outranked sentimental reminders and matching funds. I loved these findings and wanted to see if this could be replicated if modified for the US. My white paper is now published, and I finally get to talk about the study and share it with you. I was privileged to have a conversation with Dan Ariely which helped me narrow down my three main concepts for the study which are time discounting, reciprocity, and a physical manifestation of savings. I hope you enjoy the results. Before I begin, I also want to remind you that the Brainy Pricing Course is now live. This 10-module course will walk you through mindset, priming (and finding your scent of the cookies), framing, anchoring, and relativity for pricing as well as knowing your numbers, notes on discounts and how to raise prices. Brainy Courses are a little different because they include a workshop component.

Show Notes:  [06:19] Publication wasn\'t a requirement for graduation, the study just needed to be submitted. [07:27] The study done in Kenya on savings behavior stuck with me. [08:17] The gold coin was the condition that did the best. It even did better on its own than when paired with matching funds. [08:32] Finding a way to encourage saving without matching funds is like the holy grail. [09:05] I was interested to see how this would translate in the United States. [09:20] Problem number one was replicating the gold coin in the US. [09:53] The coin was a constant reminder to save. This needed to be replicated at least in premise. [11:17] The three main concepts I wanted to focus on were time discounting, reciprocity, and a physical manifestation of saving. [12:02] We started with 240 members, who were narrowed down based on a few factors, including age, income, and time with the credit union.\xa0 [12:36] Filene requested we look at loyalty scores as well. [12:48] One item we used to narrow down the list was if they had completed a Net Promoter Score survey in the six months or so before the study began. [13:41] The 240 members were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The control group received no communication at all.\xa0 [15:05] We tracked savings until the Monday before Black Friday so we wouldn’t end up with totally skewed numbers when people went shopping after Thanksgiving. [15:29] I also had the previous year\'s data for comparison. [16:31] It was decided to not have the members precommit to wanting to save or sign up for a program. [17:50] Two of the groups groups received communication from the credit union talking about the importance of saving and this new information they found on helping people to save. (The other group was control.) [18:29] About a week before the planned study, the two non control groups received a letter with very similar text. One group also received a refrigerator magnet. [21:23] The magnet group’s letter also had an image of the magnet in the corner. All envelopes were the same. [21:44] After 12 weeks, the 160 individuals all received an email reminding them of the importance of saving, and letting them know it was never too late to start or pick up where they left off. [21:52] And after the 24 weeks were over, they received an email thanking them for participating, encouraging continued saving, and everyone – all 240 members – received an email with an NPS survey to see if the loyalty numbers were different after 24 weeks. [22:55] Making the future self more tangible today is important in combating time discounting. [24:15] Even though I was only using three main concepts, these others still had to be considered and incorporated for the best chances of adoption. [24:53] The hypotheses of the study were that the magnet group would save more than either of the other two groups and that the magnet group would have a higher increase in loyalty score than the other two groups. [26:14] Physical representation is the magnet itself, which was specifically designed to be a reminder of money and savings. The letter only group was encouraged to make their own note and place it somewhere to be a reminder of savings and goals. [26:37] Time discounting is represented in the verbiage on the magnet, “I care about my future self” and that same verbiage was included in the letters and emails for both groups. [26:50]\xa0 Reciprocity was in both the “gift” of the magnet, which was called out specifically in the language on the letter for that group, and the less physical gift of tips to save money and have a happier, more financially secure life. [28:22] The hypotheses were that the magnet group would save more and have a bigger change in their loyalty scores over the 24 weeks. And they did! [29:16] The control group savings went up 1.42%. The letter only group went up by 1.35%. The magnet group went up by 4.51%. [30:07] The most significant jump in loyalty score was by the magnet group. They went up to 9.2. [30:49] The main thing to learn from this study is that the magnet group went up in both categories, and while we cannot say with 100% certainty it is because of the nudges, there aren’t any other explanations that readily explain what else might have happened.

Things like colors and shapes can be recalled by our brains and associated with other non related things. This topic is really an amalgamation of other concepts, but it’s still a valuable tool to understand and use when communicating about your business. This episode gives examples of making concepts tangible, and their practical applications in business.\xa0 This topic is the last main concept from my research paper that I announced last week. I also gave tips on running experiments like: keep it small, be thoughtful, and test often.

Show Notes:  [04:59] This isn\'t really a topic you can easily look up. It\'s more of an accepted premise. The physical representation of concepts is an amalgamation of various other concepts. [05:35] The brain works on associations.\xa0 [07:47] Colors and shapes bring a physical presence that can be recalled easier than words. Your brain has been trained to recognize this physical representation of the concept of street signs (as explained here). [08:56] Logos are physical representations of the concept of a business. [09:27] The physical manifestation of the brand makes the business more real in your mind because there is a logo to relate to. [10:21] This is not exactly the same as anthropomorphism, which is when animals or objects are given human-like tendencies; it can be a similar concept because it helps you relate to the item in question. [10:52] Abstract concepts are everywhere in business, and they can easily cause miscommunication in conversations or messaging. Providing a physical reference point makes everything feel more real.\xa0 [15:16] I did not want to get rid of my DVDs during a decluttering session. The reason why was because the physical, tangible, representation – the box and the item itself – was tied to my emotional center and triggered loss aversion. [16:06] Where could you inject physical form we\'re only concepts exist in your business today? [16:48] How Progressive took the concept of insurance and made it tangible. [18:41] When you take something from conceptual to tangible, it makes it easier for the brain to categorize, relate, and remember. [19:19] Pictures, logos, and icons make your business and its features feel real. [19:29] Physical representation can help remind you of associations that you have made previously or that are important to you. [19:56] Physical items are a constant reminder to your brain. [21:57] You can make physical items that remind people of your business without having your name plastered all over them, that will be subtle reminders of you and your business. [22:04] A strong brand is able to live through the lack of words and evoke feelings – they leave an impression even without their name. [23:31] What could your business do to be a constant association and reminder in the brains of your customers? [25:01] I share a credit union concept where the idea of using logos on items could have gone very wrong. Keep in mind that small associations matter. [25:53] For your business, consider the emotions you want to convey – the things you want people to think when they consider your brand. Or, when they might be most likely to need your brand. What can you provide that will help them and remind them of you? [27:10] You can also create visuals around what you want to do to help achieve your goals. What you surround yourself with has a HUGE impact on your approach to life, business and your success. This is priming in action. [27:32] I want to help you surround yourself with the right physical representation of the concepts you care about to help you be successful.  Thanks for listening.

This week we are talking about the benefit of experiments and some of my tips for how to do this on your own in your business, as not every experiment requires hiring a consultant to come in and run a big study. If you have been listening to the podcast for a while you probably remember me mentioning a few times that I have a research paper coming “soon” based on a project I did on behalf of the Filene Research Institute and a credit union in Portland, Oregon. I am so excited that I have approved the (potentially) final draft and that should be published any day now!\xa0 There will be a dedicated episode talking about the research in two weeks, but I wanted to give some tips about experimenting first, because it truly is so important for every organization to test things. Next week is an episode on the physical representation of concepts, which is the only main concept in the study I have not yet covered on the podcast. Then on September 13th, I’ll share all the details and findings of my research study. CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [05:08] Experimenting is important for any organization. You have probably done experiments and not even realized it. [05:30] Good experiments need to be narrow and focused, because if you test too many things at once you won\'t know what contributed to the result. [07:09] I share a story about how I needed to continue to narrow down a research paper topic.\xa0 [08:16] The study found that advertisements for low cognition products were twice as likely to be standardized as high cognition products. Ads using pictures were more than twice as likely to be standardized as those using text. [09:08] There were so many variables and items cross referenced just for a study that looked at one month of magazine ads. [09:59] The study I ended up with, which felt incredibly small to me at the time, was actually a huge undertaking - it was a true experiment. [10:16] When there is a lot weighing on the outcome of the experiment, it\'s a good idea to bring in experts. There are also tests you can do on your own fairly easily, which can still have a great impact on your business. [10:41] You can be more agile and adapt quickly with small tests. [10:56] The three things to keep in mind when setting up experiments are to be thoughtful, keep it small, and test as often as you can. [11:14] Keeping it small allows you to do the test on your own and understand what contributed to the results you are seeing. [11:55] To determine what is best, separate everything into multiple mini-tests. [12:53] Make one small change and track what the results are, so you\'ll be learning every step of the way. [14:44] One of the studies I share the most often is the one with the end cap displays for Snickers bars. This used anchoring and adjustment and found when they said “buy 18 for your freezer” there was a 38% increase in sales. [15:36] Behavioral economics shows us that hunches about what customers will do are often wrong, because they are based on logic, not the rules of the subconscious brain. This is why everything needs to be tracked. [16:01] Some other things you could test would be how your ads (or emails or direct mailers or website pages) do when you change a number frame. You can also do tests on blog post headers, or copy on social media posts, and images you use on ads. [17:04] The second important way to focus your attention is to be thoughtful. Being thoughtful means looking outside of what you always do or what you “know” to be true. [17:45] Behavioral economics teaches that humans do not always act “rationally” or with much forethought. Take the time to plan before you jump into a test, or start testing absolutely everything. [18:45] Instead of testing everything, just test the right things. Know the problem you are trying to solve and narrow your focus. [19:15] Anything can be worth testing, but everything can be a waste of time if you don’t have a clear focus and goal. [19:36] If your company is about driving value, then all your tests should be about creating more value for your customers. [20:16] Focus on items that are driving revenue and value to your company. [21:01] The results of one test will not necessarily hold true in every situation or for every business. This is called generalizability or being generalizable - while it matters in most academic studies, it isn’t as important if you are testing for your own business (because if the results don’t apply to your competitor...who cares?) [22:05] It\'s also important to know whether the data you are collecting is qualitative or quantitative. Conversations with people are qualitative, number of clicks are quantitative. [24:00] If you know you will want to dig into demographics and other details, you probably need to build that into your data pull up front. Think and talk through what you actually want to know. [24:35] My final tip is to test early and often. [25:24] Small tests let you act quickly, so the more you test, the more you learn. No results still tells you something important. [26:25] Findings tell you what attracts attention or what matters to your customers, but non-findings tell you what they don’t pay attention to or care about. Remember to keep it small, be thoughtful, and test often.  Remember - The Brainy Business now offers courses! Thanks for listening. Don’t forget to subscribe on  Apple Podcasts or  Android.

Behavioral Economics Foundations: Framing Qualitative vs Quantitative  | If you’ve been listening to the podcast for a while, you already know that humans aren’t rational (and, honestly, you probably know that just from being a human person too). And the base of economic theory would often incorrectly predict behavior because it assumes logical people making rational choices.\xa0 Because humans do not behave this way in practice, new theories needed to be developed which accounted for these irrational choices. And in game theory, it is exactly the same. We humans don’t always make choices that are fully rational. We try to game the system or play the odds. This episode is all about game theory and how it can help your business. We will dig into three basic games: the dictator game, the ultimatum game and the prisoner’s dilemma.\xa0 And if you haven’t checked out last week\'s episode, it was all about color theory and what really matters when using colors in your business and your brand.\xa0 CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [03:21] If you\'re wondering, Game Theory actually has a lot to do with business. [03:41] Humans aren\'t rational. Basic economic theory would predict behavior incorrectly, because it would assume logical people are making rational decisions. [03:45] Since humans aren\'t rational, new theories needed to be developed. [05:06] Downton Abbey and Survivor are great examples of game theory in action. [05:22] In behavioral game theory, we need to consider how revenge, fairness and personal gain all play into the outcomes. Three main games that are often used in game theory are the ultimatum game, the prisoner’s dilemma, and the dictator game. [05:38] We start with the dictator game. What it is and how different scenarios can impact your behavior or decision.\xa0 [08:38] The ultimatum game is similar, but the second person has an option to respond to the offer. If they reject, both get nothing. [10:18] History has a lot to play in the actions people take, and existing relationships help determine actions. [11:04] The human component – knowing you are playing against a person who is profiting from your situation – has a big impact on the way people respond. [11:57] Think about how the anchor shifts when you have power versus when you don’t. [12:33] It\'s important to understand who has what power in each situation when you determine what to offer and think about how they might react. [13:11] Even when money is not changing hands, the process of buying and selling is exactly the same. Other items of value can be bartered. The way people react changes based on the power or belief they have. [13:22] This is worth considering as you put offers out to people and are wondering how they may respond or act. Are you putting power in their hands that makes a generous offer seem stingy? [14:02] In your business, you aren’t limited to the lab style test – your clients know who you are and what you are offering them. [15:29] If you give something, people want to give back (reciprocity). [16:10] The last game is the prisoner\'s dilemma.\xa0 [17:41] The shifting anchor impacts the position someone takes. Saying something may feel like a win win (even though it often isn’t).\xa0 [19:57] The best overall strategy for the extended prisoner\'s dilemma is a tit-for-tat strategy in which you cooperate until someone defects then you respond in kind. [21:41] Most of us would likely plan to play fair. Do you expect the same kindness and fairness in others? How does the story you tell yourself about what they think influence your actions? How would your strategy be influenced by the look of the person?\xa0 [22:48] Game theory applies in all sorts of business situations. Obviously, this applies in negotiations with potential partners. [23:37] Humans are emotional, and it is not just in the after-the-fact stuff...the thoughts and “what ifs” before a negotiation starts can always influence actions much more than we may think. [23:57] Always have written contracts and agreements. [24:19] Negotiating terms in a cold state is so much better than not doing your due diligence. [24:38] Another example of how this impacts business is in advertising. [26:21] There are countless examples of game theory – it is truly all around us all the time. Pretty much any time you interact with another person or business or entity, game theory comes into play. [27:21] Buying in at the bottom of a recession is game theory in action. It’s all based on what you expect other people will do and how you choose to react to it – before and after the fact. [29:47] The YouTube example of United Breaks Guitars which is the ultimate customer revenge.\xa0 [32:15] When emotions take hold, it can cause people to make bad decisions that they may regret in the long run, so try and get some distance and perspective before acting…especially if you feel really betrayed and angry. [32:49] Perspective lets you look at the game in a whole different way and play by the real rules. [33:15] The last point I want to make is this: when it comes to games, many people are playing not to lose, instead of playing to win. [33:47] When you play to win – in games, life or business – you know it is a long game and have a calmer approach. You understand the rules backward and forward. This is much more effective than playing not to lose.  Thanks for listening. Don’t forget to subscribe on  Apple Podcasts or  Android.

There are tons of color charts out there. I’ve even linked to a few. I’ll give you the general associations in this episode, but I’m also going to explain what really matters when it comes to using colors in your branding – the common mistakes and the most important things to keep in mind. CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [05:01] GENERAL COLOR MEANINGS [05:03] Red: is full of excitement and said to be youthful and bold. It is also said to make people hungry or angry, and is associated with stopping. [05:45] Orange: is said to be cheerful and have confidence. It is also fun, whimsical, childlike, friendly, spontaneous, glowing, hot, and persuasive. [06:16] Yellow: has optimism, clarity and warmth. It is also joyful, illuminating, nourishing, sunny, sweet, stimulating, innovative, energetic, hot, surprising, or can bring awareness. [06:50] Green: is said to be peaceful and associated with growth and health. It can also be calm, quiet, fresh, lush, soothing, renewal, balance, life, and fertility. [07:43] Blue: is associated with trust, dependability and strength. Some other words (again, depending on the shade) can be calm, quiet, water, clean, peaceful, reassuring, serene, transcendent, open, sophisticated, confident, tasteful, cool, credible, authoritative, classic, traditional, nautical, or professional. [08:42] Purple: is associated with creativity, imagination and wisdom. It can also be romantic, thoughtful, nostalgic, thrilling, dramatic, regal, intuitive, mysterious or visionary. [09:19] Pink: ranges from vibrant, flirtatious, attention-getting and high energy to soft, subtle, romantic, compassionate, delicate, innocent, fragile or youthful. [10:08] Grey and other neutrals: are bringing balance and calm. It is also classic, corporate, timeless, quiet, logical, reserved, basic, modest, efficient, accountable, staunch, professional, sleek, classy, mature, sophisticated, and methodical. [10:50] Brown: is earthy, rugged, outdoor, rustic and woodsy, but as you change the shade to chocolate it could be delicious, rich, robust or appetizing. [11:28] Black: is powerful, empowering, elegant, sophisticated, mysterious, bold, classic, strong, expensive, nighttime, stylish, or prestigious. [12:12] White: is positive, pure, clean, innocent, simple, airy, bright, pristine, or bridal, but it can also be seen as sterile, cold and clinical. [13:09] COMMON MISTAKES [13:11] Colors have tons of associations and meanings, and often opposite associations depending on the shade or context. [14:02] GENDER PREFERENCES [14:13] Gender does have different impacts on preference for colors, which can be important for brands. [16:06] Blue and green are universally predominant favorite colors. Orange and brown are least favorite for both genders. Purple is gender polarizing.\xa0 [16:27] BEYOND GENDER In some cultures, white is bridal, pure and innocent, but it is a funeral color for others. Black can be sophisticated or menacing. Red can be aggressive or mean luck. [19:33] THINK ABOUT BRAIN ASSOCIATIONS The associations absolutely do matter, and studies have found that appropriateness of the color to the brand persona matter quite a bit. [20:18] Think about how all the context triggers come together to support or contradict the color used in your brand, logo or other aspects of your marketing. [20:41] When people are not already familiar with a brand, the common emotions tied with the color of the logo make a big difference in the way they interpret the brand. [21:13] When starting your brand be aware of the associations with color and the emotions those colors bring up. Knowing the color associations can also help you go against the traditional theory if that is your strategy.\xa0 [23:00] When it comes to the way a designer or someone working with colors would explain the type of color, there are three important items: hue, value, and chroma. [23:51] The hue is the color itself. Purple, red, and green are all hues. [24:14] Value shows us how light or dark a color is – the level of brightness. [24:18] Chroma is the saturation of color or its vividness. [26:00] Google tested to find the perfect blue for its links.\xa0 [27:13] There are ways to use color in your business, beyond brand associations and color choice. [28:28] The thing that is most important when it comes to calls to action is to have a lot of contrast. This is known as the isolation effect or the Von Restorff effect. [29:39] You want to pick your colors based on congruency to your message and the personality, as well as the market you are targeting. [30:03] Go with contrast when picking secondary or tertiary buttons and links, so they stand out. [30:22] Know what your competitors use so you can stand out.\xa0 [31:26] Fight the urge of your herding brain and be different from the competition. [32:05] Trendy colors generally aren’t good for brands, but they can be great for for special editions etc.\xa0 [32:56] For physical items, keep in mind what your competitors are using and find colors that help you stand out on the shelf. [35:31] Color is incredibly important for brands to understand and consider when creating their materials. With a little bit of thought and consideration, you can absolutely use color to your business’ advantage.  Thanks for listening. Don’t forget to subscribe on  Apple Podcasts or Android.

Behavioral Economics Foundations: Sense of Sight  Episode 19. Behavioral Economics Foundations: Herding  | First off – welcome to episode 60! How exciting – I love hitting milestones and I am excited to celebrate this one with a fun episode on surprising and delighting customers and how that differs from satisfaction. Last week we talked about the pain of paying and how it can impact the way people spend with you. It is quite possibly one of my favorite episodes to date – I really enjoyed digging through the research on that one, and I think the most telling study for you was the AOL example.\xa0 Special Announcement: The first online course from The Brainy Business is going live on September 9, and there is a one week presale starting this coming Monday, August 12! A lot of businesses are competing for your ideal customer. Plus, those same customers are becoming more selective and are more aware than ever of the many options they have. These days, it’s not enough to just get the job done or to do an ok job. If you really want to build true customer loyalty and customer engagement, you’ll need to surprise and delight your customers. This is how your business can build a loyal following and increase profits. In this episode I talk about how to do exactly that. CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [06:26] Many people assume there is a linear relationship between dissatisfaction, satisfaction and delight, but it doesn’t really work that way. Satisfaction is not the opposite of dissatisfaction, and vice a versa. [07:08] The scale of customer experience actually goes from outrage, to dissatisfaction to satisfaction to delight. [07:29] When you have a surprising positive experience, it results in delight. An unexpected, surprising negative experience? That is when outrage comes into play. [08:25] In a business, you have to be aware of these all the time, including your overall experience for everyone as well as for each individual customer. Ideally, you are living in “satisfied” territory most of the time, with a few “delights” popping up here and there. [08:57] Delight is much more likely to drive loyalty than mere satisfaction, and there is a lot of research that shows loyalty is positively linked to profits and stock market price. [09:45] Once a customer becomes satisfied, they have achieved pretty much whatever level of loyalty they are going to have, but the loyalty score shoots up when delight is introduced. [12:27] Delightful experiences are much more likely to hit the emotional center of the brain and be much more likely to be remembered. This also holds true for the mirror of delight which is outrage. [13:23] One heavily cited study estimates that a 5% increase in loyalty from customers can increase profit anywhere from 25% to 85%! [14:13] Delighted and loyal customers can have a lifetime value equal to 11 “regular” customers. [14:31] Loyalty can also result in lower costs in advertising, branding and acquisition, as well as higher revenues per transaction or per customer, lower defection rates, plus an increase in brand equity. [15:22] There\'s no standard scale for measuring delight.\xa0 [17:08] Satisfaction is more of a cognitive process. Delight and outrage are more emotional. [20:25] The reason the Ed Sheeran Edchup promotion works is because fans know that it\'s authentic. Consumers can’t be expected to let you know what will delight them, because at its core they can’t be expecting them. [22:33] It\'s important to know your numbers, so you\'ll know in advance if the cost of delighting is worth it. [23:06] The next pitfall is the peril of ever-changing expectations. If the delights become standard, customers will expect them. The key to delight is surprise. [24:23] The last pitfall to be aware of is assuming that everyone has the same expectations. [26:41] Often, simply being courteous, showing empathy, and making an effort to understand the needs of the customer are enough to create a delightful experience. [29:41] Employee empowerment is still crucial in any business if you want to surprise and delight. [33:08] You can also provide unanticipated value. You can also provide novelty and entertainment – think of Disneyland or Disney World. [35:52] Reposition the business to focus on delivering solutions instead of products and services. [39:18] Seven organizational changes from the Berman paper to consider so you can better deliver delight:  be aware of the need for organizational change to establish delight objectives; link customer delight to bottom-line benefits; look at world-class customer satisfaction criteria; listen to customers to ascertain what\'s important; empower employees so that they can go "the extra mile"; make measurement of customer delight and loyalty a priority; and link raises and bonuses to customer satisfaction scores.   [41:30] Delight is not something you do one-off and hope for the best. It requires time and strategy. [43:13] If you are sending gifts to your clients and customers, don\'t do it in November or December, because people are expecting gifts at that time.  Thanks for listening.

Behavioral Economics Foundations: Herding  | Buying things isn’t all fun and games – and the process of paying for things can actually cause pain for many people. In fact, neuroeconomics has found that when scanning subjects’ brains in an fMRI machine while they are going through the process of buying things, there is activity in the insula, which is a pain center in the brain. In many ways, it is just like physical pain, and the emotional pain can be very real. It doesn’t impact everyone on every single purchase, and there are some times when it is more impactful, and some people it is more impactful for. In many cases in business, you want to do what you can to reduce the pain of a payment so people are more likely to go through with a purchase, but there are times when it is important to keep those pains in place…I will give examples of these and what to do when the pain can’t be reduced.\xa0 In this episode, I will let you know how this concept works including twelve different conditions where it is most likely to occur, some unexpected mechanisms that can cause pain when you wouldn’t even realize it, and (of course) tips for how to use this concept to your benefit in any type of business.\u200b CLICK HERE FOR YOUR FREE DOWNLOAD! Show Notes:  [04:08] The process of paying for things can actually cause pain for many people. [06:16] Context is incredibly important when it comes to the pain felt by making a payment.\xa0 [10:06] Paying and consuming have sort of a reciprocal relationship…because making a payment reduces the joy of consumption, but consumption reduces the pain of paying. [11:48] The way you talk about the price impacts the pain felt in paying more than the amount. Everything that comes before the price matters much more than the price itself. [12:42] The more a transaction is perceived as: fair, an investment, immediate, for the sake of another person, under one’s own control and has payment before consumption…the WEAKER the pain of paying. [13:45] When the pain of paying is too much – so that people do not buy things that they need or want because it is too difficult to give up money…they are called tightwads. Those who spend too much, too easily and do not feel an appropriate amount of pain before or during the spending process…we call them spendthrifts. [16:43] Tightwads and spendthrifts don\'t change their ways even when their income fluctuates. [19:45] Tightwads are most sensitive to framing adjustments, so that is where you can make a difference. Adding the word “small” before a fee, or framing the purchase as an investment made it so tightwads were more likely to buy and feel less pain in paying. [22:25] When people feel good about themselves (as when purchasing a virtuous product) there is less pain felt and associated with the payment across the board. [23:35] One of the big issues for spendthrifts is they do not account for or intuitively understand the opportunity cost in the moment when they are getting ready to buy or wanting to buy things. [25:38] Everyone will feel some sort of pain when paying. It is your job to figure out what the buyer needs, what would benefit them the most, and then present it to them in a way that will have the least pain felt. [27:27] Think about how people interpret what they are getting. Did they choose the circumstance or was it thrust upon them? If it was not their choice, are there some other areas where you can help them feel like they did make a choice? [31:14] When the pain of paying isn’t felt as much, it doesn’t impact the experience. [33:29] Loss aversion is a big contributing factor to having the meter running and the pain of paying. [36:30] Sometimes, people are willing to pay money to reduce the pain of lost time and they enjoy the experience more because it was their choice. [37:15] Consumption can reduce the pain felt by paying, but paying can reduce the joy felt during consumption. This is a concept called coupling. [39:56] Think about yourself as a consumer and how you would feel if you got the bill for your product or service after the fact. [40:43] Are there any points in your business where you could use coupons or tokens or chips or beads instead of cash? [41:28] The biggest thing is to make sure that people feel they are really gaining something when they spend money, and that it is not just being thrown away.\xa0 [43:11] Classifying your product or service as a gift really helps overcome the pain. [44:34] Reminder: the more a transaction is perceived as: fair, an investment, immediate, for the sake of another person, under one’s own control and has payment before consumption…the WEAKER the pain of paying.

I’m about three months in since launching my blog and business back in June, but I’m starting to feel very isolated. While I’m at home every night, grinding away at the next steps for my business, my friends fill our Marco Polo chats, breaking down what they ate for dinner, the latest Netflix series they binge watched, or the amazing work out class they got to go to in the middle of the day. Seriously! Who has time for that? But in all honesty, I’m not disappointed in that per-say, because I have a lot of clarity and direction for my long-term goals. But I’m just here, helplessly wondering if it’s normal to feel bouts of loneliness throughout this Teacher Hustle journey. I just feel like no one can relate to me. Do you have any advice?"It’s hard to find people “in real life” who share a love of WORK. But an online business not just WORK for us. It’s a creative outlet, and it has the potential for us to earn a substantial income- one that allows us to contribute to our finances in a significant way. It’s also a way for us to continue to LEARN- something we tend to love as educators by nature! To me, it’s totally exciting to spend my Friday night writing social media posts or creating content for this podcast. I know that’s not the norm, and I also know it can be tough for those who don’t have this drive to relate to it.We have to reframe the way we think about this special drive- that teacher hustle. Why do we take that and make it SMALL with words like “It’s no big deal” or “I’m not as good at this as you think I am”? Why are we quick to minimize our work?It’s because it’s comfortable to be small. It’s more comfortable to remain humble about our aspirations and accomplishments. It’s uncomfortable to stand out-- to want something more.This business NOT just something you do in your spare time. You work HARD for your business, and if you’re anything like me, you actually PREFER that work to going to the movies or going bowling or whatever your friends are doing.Your self-care is creativity. Like an artist or a writer, you love to create content or to learn about marketing or to create products- to dream and to see those dreams through. That’s self-care. That’s your time.So how can we grow our circle of people who understand this drive? Because it’s incredibly important to have a place you can go to laugh, vent, and cry about this side of your life. Just like you can call your mom about cooking, or you can call your best friend to vent about your kid, you need a group of people you can chat with about your business.\xa0In this episode, we’ll talk about:The 3 best places to meet like-minded business owners!How to create an accountability group or mastermindWhy you need to make connections with other teacher business ownersWe all have our own zone of genius, of course, but we have one thing in common. We can’t shake this urge for personal and professional growth...and we’re fine with that.However you find your people, whatever way makes the most sense for you...go for it. It’s a little scary chatting with new people, but that’s what makes you incredible-- that’s what makes you different. This entrepreneur life isn’t always easy, and sometimes it feels like we’re the only crazy people in the world sitting behind our laptops in our free time. But you’re not alone. Surround yourself with driven people, surround yourself with people who can strategize and brainstorm with you, and watch your business and your relationships grow.\xa0If you’re looking for a supportive group, but you don’t want to search high and low- don’t worry! The Teacher Hustle U. Crew is the most amazing group of educators, and the conversa | TEACHER HUSTLE UNIVERSITY doors are publically open at the time of this episode. Sign up now before the doors close at the end of the week. https://www.alissamcdonald.com/frameworkIn today’s episode we’ll talk about how to choose a course, a coach, or a mentor in a world that seems SO incredibly saturated- the world of online marketing. (It’s A LOT more saturated than the teacher world, believe me!) There is a TON of variety when it comes to choosing a coach, mentor, course, membership, workshop etc. in the online space.As teachers, I think we’re used to being kind of scrappy. We’re used to figuring things out on our own, we’re the queens and kings of DIY, we love a good challenge. I don’t know about you though, but when I see a project on Pinterest and think I can do it myself, I always manage to royally screw it up. Sometimes DIY isn’t the best choice. It isn’t even always the quicker choice...or the cheaper choice. Sometimes you end up spending MORE time, MORE money, and MORE energy trying to figure it all out and piecing it together yourself, when you could’ve come out with a better quality product if you had taken the time to really learn the steps in the process from someone who has done it before and can teach you how.When it comes to marketing for your online business, you don’t have time to waste- especially if this is your side hustle! If you try to DIY your marketing, I’ll tell you right now how that might go for you in today’s episode, and I’ll tell you one way you can be sure you won’t waste time trying to figure out your marketing on your own ever again.Maybe you’re a little scared because you’ve signed up for courses before and it hasn’t been all it was cracked up to be or you weren’t able to complete the course work for whatever reason. You’ll have to let all of that go when shopping around for a new way to learn about your business. This is a fresh start. Maybe take into consideration your own learning style and how you like content delivered, and pay attention to that as you read about the different program offerings.We’ll talk about:How to find the right offeringHow to find the right coachHow to choose the right fit for you and your businessThe type of online program I think is best for teacher business ownersDon’t let the pressure of the CHOICE get to you. You will grow from every investment you make in your education around your business goals. You’ll grow from every unique experience with a coach. And When you see growth as a result of your experience in one course, you’ll feel confident enough to invest in another course. Even if the material happened to be exactly the same, each business coach would teach the material in a different way. Each coach has their own story, messaging, values and experiences to bring to the table. Because of that, every experience in a course, membership, workshop or conference will benefit your business. | Behind the Scenes!

This is the exact topic of my upcoming video series called “Selling Without Being Sales-y”. Be sure to reserve your spot for the free training at https://www.alissamcdonald.com/video.“Hi Alissa, my name is Monica, and I am on Instagram as @thelipsticklifeteacher, and recently I actually changed my name from The Lipstick Life Girl to The Lipstick Life Teacher because I am trying to rebrand myself and just change my Instagram because for so long I was just selling makeup, and it felt very restrictive, and I felt very held back because every post had to be about makeup. And I’m so much more than that! I’m a teacher, I’m a new mom, and I do want to sell my resources on Teachers Pay Teachers, but I really want to connect with other educators and teachers that are moms, and I just want to find my tribe like you’ve mentioned. I’m really at a loss about how to start, how I can change my Instagram so it is all of those things, or if I should start from scratch. I’m hoping I can find a way to make the account I have now work and be something that is all me and that I can still have my side hustle built in. Hope that makes sense, and thanks for your help!”Understanding your brand is more important now than ever before. Here’s why. Have you noticed that the noisier it gets online, the more everything seems to look the SAME? And when things start to look the same- that’s boring. And it’s also scary. We’re- as a collective group of human beings- we’re not supposed to be the same. It’s our differences that help us learn and grow- these are the same values we teach our kids. Yet, somehow, we tend to get sucked right into that “sameness”.The word brand may bring up images of professional logos and professional images, but it isn’t that. Your brand is the way you bring your unique stories, values, and experiences to the world. It’s the way you showcase your personality in the online space.We’ll be answering all of these questions on today’s podcast:Can both of those things co-exist on your Instagram?\xa0What if your target audience will be completely different?\xa0What is your content strategy?How can you develop a brand that’s reflective of your story and serves your ideal customer?And the controversial answer Alissa has for…What if someone else is already doing the thing I want to do?!We, as consumers, we need multiple voices in one niche area. If we didn’t have multiple voices in one niche, life would be BORING!\xa0We wouldn’t have Coke and Pepsi, we wouldn’t have Nike and Adidas, we wouldn’t have Britney and Christina! Competition makes the world go round!Lean into your passions, and tell your story!

Which one is more personal? Which is more likely to grow a relationship with you? Which is LESS NOISY??That follower number means absolutely nothing. If your sales aren’t increasing in your business as that number rises, the number doesn’t matter.Anytime we talk about Instagram, we’ll always talk about growing RELATIONSHIPS, not growing the follower number. Your following will grow organically as you nurture your relationship. People will see you interacting, they’ll feel your vibe. Real finds real.We’re in this AMAZING time where teachers across the globe can connect, share resources and ideas, and support one another in implementing those ideas. As standards, rigor, and pressure on teachers seems to be weighing on us, we can lean on our community for support. Sometimes your people are states or countries away...and you’d never find them if it weren’t for this incredible platform.Today we’re talking Instastories. If you’re not using Instastories...you MUST start. That’s your official challenge. If you’re nervous about being on camera- try a filter. The eyelashes filter and the “pretty” filter will make you feel like a million bucks!! (I’m not nearly as polished as I look in Instastories.

I was wondering if you could talk to how you transfer from summer mode into back to school mode when it comes to your business. I feel like over the summer I finally got ahold of how to do everything from creating and marketing my products to working on my blog, my e-mail list, Pinterest and Instagram, and now that school is back in session I have grading, I have new content I’m creating for my classroom- that I’d love to put on TPT, but when I get home it’s family time and grading time. So I’m just struggling to balance it while still giving my passion the time it deserves. Any tips?”It’s that time of year! Summer is ending, and we don’t want to neglect our online business, but there just isn’t enough time in the day.For many teachers, September is also the season of having big hopes and dreams for our plans for the upcoming school year, which means this is the time that actually our businesses are expected to kind of ramp up because teachers are in need of new resources for their classrooms!All the things we wanted to do over the summer are not done and now September is here and we need to focus on our classrooms. What do we do with our business? Do we just let it go? Do we drop it? How do we keep it going when we\'re expected to be doing all of these things with school?\xa0First, give yourself grace! If you didn’t finish all the things that were on your summer to-do list, if there are a million more things you want to do, that\'s okay. There will always be something more to do in your business- that’s what makes you a great entrepreneur!But give yourself the gift of September. You are not going to finish all the things at this point that you need to do for back to school season when it comes to your business- that time is over. Whatever you accomplished on your to-do list, you did! And whatever you didn\'t, you didn\'t! We can’t change that.Let’s focus on the future! We’ll be talking about how you can rest, reflect, and organize during September and use the upcoming quarter- October, November, and December to meet your end-of-year goals.Rest: Really! Give yourself September to focus on school and family. We need rest in our business the same way every cycle has a “down time”.Reorganize: You need systems for your business, and the sooner you begin to implement those systems, the sooner you’ll see growth and feel a sense of peace in your business.Reflect: Look at where your efforts paid off and how you can set goals moving fowardThe problem with our business is that when we do sit down to work, there is nobody to say, “Alissa, today you\'re going to focus on your blog, and don\'t you do anything else because your job is to work on the blog tonight!”\xa0I\'m going to give you a process for how you can set a goal for next quarter and how you can achieve it.\xa0If you’re anything like me, at a buffet I fill my plate to the brim and eat maybe a quarter of it. Don’t do that here. Don’t set your task goals so high that you’re unable to get it done. Make it easy enough that it\'s achievable. Simplify it.\xa0What are the smaller tasks you need to do in order to complete that larger task? What do you need to learn- what do you need to | What’s the thing that when people mention it, you say “That’s my jam!?”Whatever you picked...that’s your passion!

In this episode, Sharlene Dozois from Cision talks about her experiences with change and how she’s managed teams through that change to be successful. | Why do sales reps always want to talk about themselves? It’s because they are comfortable with that. It’s hard to learn about the customer, their problems, and their industry but that’s exactly what great salespeople do. They spend more time on the customer then they do themselves. In this episode, Chief Business Development Officer Lori Langholz talks to us about her discoveries of moving from a question-based sales to an insight based sale. | We've all sold for a long time but many of us have not taken the time to step back and think about what are the principles that make us successful in our day-to-day selling. In this episode, Joe Haynie from JCI talks to us about three enduring sales principles that have shaped his career and help to make him a successful sales leader | Pre-call planning is one of most important tasks we overlook in sales. Many sales reps want to simply get on the phone and do their thing, but more and more reps are finding that shoot from the hip approach is not working. In this episode, we dive into how Jeff Boyle from Cision coaches his team to think about pre-call planning:  - Research the contact & their company  - Check your CRM system  - Explore on LinkedIn (Contact & Company Page) - Competitor overview  - Plan for the call | There are a lot of salespeople in the world but not every salesperson really wants it. To win at sales, you have to dive deep into yourself and really decided if you want to really get better at what you do or not. Don’t talk the talk if you’re not ready to walk the walk. In this episode, we talk about how some of the greatest salespeople in the world are successful. | Front-line managers are oft-forgotten and they shouldn't be. In this episode, Natalie Bering from Service now talks about how to support managers by coaching them, maximizing your 1:1 time with them, and focusing on their professional development. | September 11th was a terrible time for many people and the US as a whole. For many people, it was a day they will never forget as it changes their lives forever. In this special episode, we talk to inside sales executive Jim Donovan about his experience on 9/11 and how his life was transformed. | If you don't hire and retain you will wither and die in today's market. The problem most people don't know how to do this. In this episode, we discuss how to select candidates, on-boarding, and training. | We need to change the way we sell. We can't sell our products anymore. There are two many products but there are not enough solutions. Buyers have problems and they need solutions but not in the way you think you need them. We need to change the message in sales to get buyers to change vendors/product. Salespeople tend to focus on the gain by asserting to the customer that they will save $x money (but this isn’t the best way to create change or motive a buyer to take a risk, i.e. buy your product). Salespeople should shift focus to the loss, which motivates people to be more risk-seeking/risk-taking to improve their situation. So rather than claiming (A) “we can save you 10% (framed as a gain), you should claim (B) “you are spending 10% more than you should be (framed as a loss). In this episode, we talk about prospect theory and how it can help you move from product selling to solution selling. | Sales Operations is a known function for many organizations but it is often underutilized.

But that doesn’t mean the concept is out of date, in fact, it’s more important than ever. So, when it comes to making your design brand authentic, what does it really mean?On this episode of Wingnut Social, Darla and Natalie speak with Karima Neghmouche, a brand expert who works alongside all kinds of people - designers and otherwise - to help them discover, capture, and communicate a brand that is authentic to who they are. As a designer, that’s of paramount importance because the clients you attract will be attracted to your personal approach as much as they are attracted to your beautiful design work. Listen to hear all of Karima’s advice.What You’ll Hear On This Episode of Wingnut Social[5:20] Beyond the buzzword, what does “authenticity” mean?[9:54] How simplified branding gives you the ability to pivot in the future[13:36] Website principles for resonating with your ideal client[16:50] Common mistakes designers make when building out a genuine brand[20:40] Soul-searching processes to discover your authentic brand[23:09] The importance of a great website[28:39] Summary of the episode: focus on your closet!Connect with Karima NeghmoucheKarima’s website - https://karimacreative.com/On FacebookOn Instagram @Karima.CreativeOn LinkedInOn PinterestResources & People MentionedThe RESA Edge chat Darla will be doing\xa0Darla’s upcoming presentation at High PointBOOK: You Are A Badass At Making MoneyAuthenticity is keeping it real no matter what others say you should be doingWe all know authenticity is a buzzword, a trendy thing people tack onto their slogan or mantra. But behind the buzzword is a principle that is vital for designers to understand and apply. Here is Karima’s definition of authenticity:Keeping it real and ignoring the noise of what everyone else says you should be doing.That’s a pretty good definition. But there’s a trick to developing the relationship between branding and authenticity in today’s marketing. Filters and effects change how things are perceived, which is not how your brand may be best represented. Karima has a good perspective on what it takes to keep things authentic. It includes taking pictures of the favorite spaces in your own home. Listen to learn how it works out practically - and to understand why her approach is so helpful.Practical ways to keep your interior design brand authenticThe authenticity of your interior design brand is what will appeal to your ideal clients - the ones you really want to work with. That’s because something about you and your personal perspective on design work draws them to you. So you want to make sure you’re getting this piece of the branding puzzle right.Karima’s advice makes it so easy to see how everyday observations about your own life, the kind of things you are drawn to on Pinterest or Instagram, and the previous design work you’ve done will reveal some of the real you that needs to go into communicating an authentic interior design brand.Don’t miss this episode. Karima digs into logos, websites, naming conventions, images used to represent your brand, and more.

There are so many great ones to choose from. And if we will be honest, every one of us who works in the design world has wondered what it would be like to star on one of those shows. Well, fellow wingnuts, wonder no more!This episode is a delightful conversation with Britany Simon - star of several TV Interior Design shows. Darla and Natalie talk with her about the behind the scenes world of those productions to find out whether it’s as glamorous as it seems and what benefits come to a designer who gets that kind of limelight. Britany also gives her best advice for anyone who wants to pursue the same types of opportunities.\xa0In her characteristic way, Britany gives us the unvarnished truth.

She didn’t know if she had a chance of making the cut because she’d never done any work on camera or in front of an audience, but she figured it was worth a try. She and her husband drove to Las Vegas so she could audition for the show and the rest is history. But what she discovered behind the scenes was a world of extremely hard work. She jokingly says she often ended her production days in the fetal position.The kind of things she had to deal with were unexpected. For example, she was assigned a design assistant who was not at all ready for the kind of work involved and who didn’t know how to go about sourcing the items she would need. So Britany had to take that on herself. She also had to work tirelessly on the things the show’s producers assigned to her to meet the deadlines for the show - including a number of DIY projects. Listen to hear how the perceived glamor of being on the show turned out to be not so glamorous.What is the return on staring on your own design TV show?One of the things Darla was interested in finding out was how Britany’s many TV shows have benefitted her design business. After all, Joanna Gaines seems to have done pretty well from her TV opportunities.\xa0What comes to light in this conversation is that Britany is a designer at heart and always wants to have her hands in the actual process, so to grow her business rapidly and in a way that puts her in more of a management role was not attractive to her - at all.So thankfully, that’s not what happened. While it’s true that Britany has had many and varied offers as a result of her television stardom, she’s been able to remain in her sweet spot of designing. She's been the choice of many clients simply because they saw her work on TV and took it upon themselves to track her down so they could have her design their homes. That’s the kind of exposure money can’t buy and Britany has made the most of it.We hope you’ll listen to this episode to get to know Britany. She’s down to earth, transparent, and a joy to talk with. You’ll find yourself feeling happy that she’s been the one to experience the kind of success she has - even if you secretly envy her - like we do.\xa0Connect With Darla & Wingnut Socialwww.WingnutSocial.comOn FacebookOn Twitter: @WingnutSocialOn Instagram: @WingnutSocialDarla’s Interior Design Website1-877-WINGNUT (connect with us for your social media marketing needs)Subscribe to The Wingnut Social Podcast on iTunes, Google Podcasts, or TuneInAudio Production and Show notes byPODCAST FAST TRACKhttps://www.podcastfasttrack.comClean and compress CSS files for an optimized website.

Video is betterFor a few years now the social media gurus have been telling us that video performs better than static images. It's true because video provides the benefit of communicating your personality and “vibe” a lot better than images. Having said that, here’s the weird thing: 48% of brands are only using static images, not video. What?!!!!If you are not using video on Instagram, these stats show that you’re missing the boat. Video gets 48% more engagement from followers than static images alone. That means you have more opportunities to interact with potential design clients simply by using video regularly. Listen to learn more.Instagram stat of interest #2: The sweet spot for captionsWhen you scroll through Instagram, you’ll see that some images and videos have accompanying captions, others don’t. You know what captions are, right? They are those descriptions or comments that go along with the images or videos you post. Some Instagram users who make use of captions write books in the captions (we don’t have time to read books on Instagram). Other’s keep them short and sweet.The Instagram statistics revealed in the recent Quintly study say that the sweet spot for captions is not so much about how long they are, but what you do with the first 125 characters. 125 is the magic number because once you write more than 125 characters, Instagram truncates the caption and users have to tap the “read more” ellipsis thingie. So if you’re going to use captions, make the most of that first 125 characters. Hook your followers with that text. Make your copy so good they can’t HELP but tap for more.Go ahead and hit the play button on this episode. We also talk about how 10 or more emojis could help your Instagram efforts be more effective, and give you our opinion about the infamous hashtag debate (in the post, or in the comments?) - based on the Instagram statistics we discuss on this episode.Connect With Darla & Wingnut Socialwww.WingnutSocial.comOn FacebookOn Twitter: @WingnutSocialOn Instagram: @WingnutSocialDarla’s Interior Design Website1-877-WINGNUT (connect with us for your social media marketing needs)Subscribe to The Wingnut Social Podcast on iTunes, Google Podcasts, or TuneInAudio Production and Show notes byPODCAST FAST TRACKhttps://www.podcastfasttrack.com\xa0 | A while back Darla noticed this gal - Alisa Popelka - EVERYWHERE on social media.

That's when Alisa decided to crank up her Instagram strategy even more by signing up for the Wingnut Social strategy package. The results of adding what she learned to what she was already doing have been astounding. Alisa says that 50% of her existing clients first contacted her through Instagram. FIFTY PERCENT!

SeriouslyThere are many Interior Designers who don’t believe that social media can do much for their business. It’s a hassle, it takes too much time out of the day, and it’s more about vanity and showing off than it is truly connecting with legitimate clients. That’s what THEY say. But Alisa Popelka would say something FAR different.Alisa has been doubling-down on her Instagram strategy for some time now, and she’s got carefully documented stats to show that at least 50% of her current clients have come to her directly from Instagram. As a result, she’s a very busy designer. She’s convinced that it’s more than worth the effort to make Instagram the primary way of marketing her business. She even refers to Instagram as a “free marketing tool” every designer should be using. Listen to learn more of her secret sauce.Being intentional is vital to an effective interior design Instagram strategyIf there’s one secret to Alisa’s success using Instagram to generate more client leads, it’s this. Be intentional and consistent. OK, that’s two things - but they are both important.Lisa doesn’t do anything on Instagram in a haphazard way. She spends two days every month to plan out her content, including the captions that will go with and on her photos. She uses a curation app to schedule it all out at regular intervals. She determines what other designers and local events she will share. And she budgets time into every day to engage with the comments and activity surrounding her posts and the posts of those she follows.If that sounds like a lot of work to you, you’re right. But it’s the kind of work required to put your design work into the orbit of the exact people you want to work with. If you’re willing to take an intentional, disciplined approach like Alisa has, you’re going to win at Instagram. No question.Listen to this episode to hear every detail Alisa shares about her Interior Design Instagram strategy!Connect With Darla & Wingnut Socialwww.WingnutSocial.comOn FacebookOn Twitter: @WingnutSocialOn Instagram: @WingnutSocialDarla’s Interior Design Website1-877-WINGNUT (connect with us for your social media marketing needs)Subscribe to The Wingnut Social Podcast on iTunes, Google Podcasts, or TuneInAudio Production and Show notes byPODCAST FAST TRACKhttps://www.podcastfasttrack.com | You may not have grabbed a copy of Pat Flynn’s new book, “Superfans” yet - Darla has it but hasn’t made space in her busy schedule to read it yet - but you need to understand the term all the same.\xa0A superfan is exactly what it sounds like - a person who truly loves the things you do, whatever that might be. They comment on your social media posts. They share your stuff with others, they even reach out to you directly from time to time via DM or email or whatever.This episode is about handling superfans the right way because when you do, they provide something you can’t buy.What You’ll Hear On This Episode of Wingnut Social[0:55] What are superfans and why do you need them?[4:30] The simple (but not easy) way of attracting superfans[7:50] A simple example of a missed opportunity to create superfans[8:59] One of the best social media superfan builders out there (MoonPie)[11:30] Pay attention to the details of your engagement with peopleResources & People MentionedPat Flynn’s book “Superfans”The Ivy Design GroupMoonPie’s Twitter accountBOOK; Jab, Jab, Jab, Right HookBrittanie Elms episode on Wingnut SocialSimply taking the time to respond to people could create superfansWe’ve all been there - charging through a busy day and spinning all the plates when a random email from a random person pops up in our email inbox. It’s long. Really long. And the message raves about your last blog post or social media image or latest design portfolio. It might even ask very specific questions you don’t feel you have time to answer.Don’t ghost that person. Don’t hit “delete.” You need to respond to them - not necessarily right at that moment, but you have GOT to get back to it soon. Why? Because that person is telling you that they are a superfan of your work. That means their influence on your behalf could be HUGE.\xa0Listen to learn how to make the most out of interactions with superfans once you hit the “reply” button on that email.Superfans are born from treating people like they deserve to be treatedYes, a good relationship with a superfan could benefit you and your business. But that’s the secondary issue. Uppermost in importance is that those people used their precious time to correspond with you, and they are people worth caring about.They are not a bother, or irritation, or inconvenience. They are human beings who deserve your attention and care. How you respond to them is a reflection of your character, which is the thing they care about most, even more than the great work you do.In this episode, Darla and Natalie give a handful of examples of the quality relationships they have been able to build with superfans in just the past few years, and how those relationships in and of themselves have become very satisfying - even if they never lead that person to do business with them at all. Listen to hear how the superfan thing works - and how you can make the most of it relationally and for your design business.Connect With Darla & Wingnut Socialwww.WingnutSocial.comOn FacebookOn Twitter: @WingnutSocialOn Instagram: @WingnutSocialDarla’s Interior Design Website1-877-WINGNUT (connect with us for your social media marketing needs)Subscribe to The Wingnut Social Podcast on iTunes, Google Podcasts, or TuneInAudio Production and Show notes byPODCAST FAST TRACKhttps://www.podcastfasttrack.com | As you’ll hear during the first part of this episode, just the thought of hiring an interior design virtual assistant stripped Darla’s gears a bit. That’s because there’s so much specialization, so many moving parts, and a ton of location-dependent stuff involved in design work. She couldn’t see how an assistant who’s not on location could be effective.But now she’s seen the light - thanks to Brittanie Elms.On this episode of Wingnut Social, you’re going to hear how Brittanie became an interior design VA, how she has learned about the design industry enough to provide tremendous value to designers of all stripes, and how her service turns into a cost savings instead of an expense for most designers.\xa0It’s an amazing concept - and one our team is likely to take advantage of very, very soon. Don’t miss this incredibly practical episode.What You’ll Hear On This Episode of Wingnut Social[1:15] Impressive results from Darla’s Tequila diet (to get ready for Highpoint)[2:28] Darla’s speaking at The RESA Edge and Highpoint Market[7:39] Brittanie Elms: The decision to start a virtual design assistant company[13:02] How is it even possible to work with an interior design virtual assistant[19:58] The benefits of hiring a virtual assistant for interior design[23:20] How robust can this really be for interior designers?[26:43] Can a design virtual assistant service truly keep up on design trends?[34:47] Brittanie’s best advice to designers looking for a virtual assistant[37:22] The channels Brittanie uses to market her services to designers[38:40] The Whatup Wingnut round[44:14] Should we do it?

It’s great to have a staff that can run with projects and get things done. But sometimes you have small little things to be done that don’t justify another full-time hire. And you don’t want to add to the already-full schedule of some poor soul on your team, either. What do you do?Hire a VA to take on that task. Not only is it cost-effective it’s also a way to tap into the brilliance and giftedness of someone who is an expert at exactly what you need to be done.As you listen to this conversation you’ll hear Brittanie explain how various Interior Design Virtual Assistant roles might look, and how each of them could benefit your design practice. She’s already got Darla thinking about things unrelated to design but that are integral to our business - like email and other correspondence. Listen up! There’s good stuff here for you.How does hiring an interior design virtual assistant impact the bottom line?Naturally, when you have a task or two that don’t fit into the job description of one of your full-time staff people, a VA makes sense. But how do you ensure that the cost you incur in bringing on a VA is worth it?The answer is this: You need to be VERY intentional about the work you pass to a VA.\xa0Give them the things that drain you, that you don’t like to do, that slow down your creative process and drag out design jobs. That way you will be freed up to do your best work and deliver for your design clients in a bigger way.\xa0And consider this too - you may need more than one VA. One person is not likely to be skilled at every one of those small things you need to offload, so don’t expect them to be. Bring in multiple people who operate in different zones of genius so that you have a team of specialists rather than one or two generalists. The difference could be huge.And finally, there’s the practical part of it all. When hiring a VA you’re hiring a contractor. That means you don’t have to pay for unemployment insurance, contribute to taxes or social security, or any of the other hoopla the government requires for full-time employees. That alone could be enough cost savings to pay for the VAs fees in the first place.Listen to this episode to get all the details about working with an Interior Design Virtual Assistant - and if you want to reach out to Brittanie you’d better do so quickly.

Enter custom furniture design.Yes, it sounds intimidating and like it might require skills you don’t have, but there are ways around that. Darla and Natalie’s guest on this episode is going to explain how you can pull it off.Kelley Bishop is the owner and designer behind Steel and Plank furnishings, a custom design furniture company that she started as a second business while she was still working as an architect (she’s still partner in an architectural firm even now, BTW). Kelley has developed a custom fabrication shop that enables her to create both entire structures or custom pieces that delight her clients.Join the conversation to hear how Kelley made the transition from architect to custom furniture designer, how she’s getting her custom wares out into the world, and how she suggests you think about offering custom-designed furniture to your clients and developing the partnerships that will enable you to do it.What You’ll Hear On This Episode of Wingnut Social[1:51] Darla’s upcoming speaking gigs you don’t want to miss[5:02] What you’re going to hear from Kelley Bishop on this episode[7:10] The frustration that moved Kelley from being an architect to a furniture designer[14:10] How can designers get started creating custom pieces for client homes?[17:34] The best ways to offer custom furniture design to clients[21:50] Is it possible to design furniture that could lead to licensing agreements?[26:32] Kelley’s newest ventures: curating and manufacturing her own lines[30:13] The “What Up Wingnut” roundConnect with Kelley BishopSteel and Plank - Kelley’s businessKelley’s Instagram: @SteelAndPlankSteel and Plank on PinterestSteel and Plank on FacebookResources & People MentionedDarla is speaking at Highpoint Market with Nicole HeymerShe’s also speaking at the RESA Edge chapter - https://ResaEdgeBroward.4stagers.comThe Design Influencers ConferenceWingnut Social episode with Nicole WhiteAuburn University’s Rural StudioWidell and BoschettiFurniture BrandingBOOK: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle MaintenanceFrom architect to custom furniture designer? How did THAT happen?In this episode, Kelley shares how she got into designing custom furniture - and the story goes way back to her childhood. Her father both modeled and encouraged her to figure things out so that she could do them herself. He was always fixing or building things on his own instead of hiring someone to do it for him. Kelley learned the lesson so well that she partnered with her Dad to rebuild an MG motorcar as a teen. Fast forward from there and apply that attitude to the design of furniture, and you’ll see how her creative, industrious bent could create some amazing pieces.If you take the time to listen to this episode, you’ll see how Kelley's “figure it out” attitude has lead to an entirely new and profitable business that she absolutely loves, and how Steel and Plank has become a showcase for her work and the work of others who offer complementary wares. It’s a great story you’ll want to hear..Why would you want to suggest custom furniture as a designer?As designers, most of us are busy enough with all the moving parts of the typical design project. But we have to admit that we come across situations when something else is needed for a project, something special to bring things into focus and alignment. Could that “something” be a special piece of furniture that is truly one-of-a-kind?Naturally, not every client is going to be interested in custom furniture pieces as part of the design package you put together for them. But some will be - and “custom” means “cha-ching” for your bank account. The beautiful part is this: Clients who are interested in custom pieces typically know that fact - and are willing to pay the extra money to have something unique in their homes.What’s the best way to talk about custom furniture design with clients?If you’re going to offer custom furniture design, you’ll need to be able to describe it in a way that is appealing to clients and that explains the process that will take them from concept to construction to placement in their home. It may sound simple but it’s not. Many things can easily go sideways along that path.Darla was curious about how to approach the messaging regarding custom furniture options so she asked Kelley to share her best advice for designers who want to start offering custom furniture to clients. Kelley says it’s a process of knowing the client’s desires, exploring those effectively, and having the right relationships and resources to pull it off. You’ll have to listen to get all the details.Clients need to connect with the furniture you create as much as they need to love that it is customWe easily understand how a client would feel to have a true one-of-a-kind piece in their newly designed home. Excited - unique - special. But much of the time, “special” is not enough. People want to have a deeper connection to the pieces they select - and it’s your job as their designer to help them make that connection.\xa0How? You do it by learning the story behind the piece - and you do that by developing a great working relationship with the furniture designer. Kelley believes this is one of the most important aspects of selling custom furniture design to clients. You want to connect them to the furniture, not just its uniqueness.

You can now become part of a “tribe” - or make your own! What is a tribe? It’s a group of people who share pins oriented around the same topics - like design work. Those people rally together to share each other’s pins and give everyone involved a boost in the Pinterest algorithms in the process.Dara’s created her own tribe - Design Bloggers United - and is inviting you to be a part of the tribe. Just grab the Tailwind app, find the Design Bloggers United tribe, ask to join, and once you’re approved you’ll be able to get in on all the Pinteresting fun (see what we did there, too?).Why Pinterest? Why now?This little PInterest experiment comes about because of an encounter Darla had with a new Wingnut Social client. As she shared her social media status, Darla noticed something - there were plenty of social platforms our team could definitely help her with, but she was rocking Pinterest in amazing ways all on her own. A little bit of prodding later, and Darla found out it was Tailwind Tribes at the heart of the action.

I’m on mission to add different types of audio content to this show. Last week, I was asked to moderate at session at the InfoPresse event,  Platforms\xa0(here in Montreal). I had the chance to speak with Blake Sabatinelli about the state of media, the news and his growing organization, Newsy. Blake is CEO of Newsy. Prior to joining the organization, Blake oversaw video strategy at Newsy\'s parent company, The E.W. Scripps Company. Blake has a long history in both news and digital strategy. A native Texan, he started his career as a digital producer at ABC Action News in Tampa, and was later promoted to executive producer, managing a team of producers and overseeing editorial operations. Blake later led the digital strategy and operations at WJLA and News Channel 8 in Washington, D.C. For those who are not familiar, Newsy is quickly becoming the source for concise, unbiased video news and analysis covering the top stories from around the world. With persistent curiosity and no agenda, Newsy strives to fuel meaningful conversations by highlighting multiple sides of every story. Newsy prides itself on delivering the news and perspective you need without the hype and bias common to many news sources. With that, Newsy\xa0streams a 24-hour network that is focused on over-the-top environments (OTT). This includes Newsy’s apps for connected TV platforms such as Apple TV,  Amazon Fire TV and Roku, as well as distribution deals Newsy has signed with streaming pay-TV services such as Sling TV and YouTube TV. In you look around, many in the media see Newsy as one of the fastest growing news companies in the world. Enjoy the conversation...  Running time: 32:25. Hello from beautiful Montreal.

deal these days and it isn\'t going anywhere anytime soon.\xa0 I\'ve heard statements such as "if you are not doing video for your business you will be irrelevant inside of 5 years!\xa0 Do I have your attention now?The reason I wanted to have Karin on the show is that Karin moved to a new market 3 years ago and has built an extremely profitable business with very little money spent by using video on youtube.So anyone out there who is moving, or just starting out, can build a real estate business without spending a boatload of money. \xa0Just START making videos.\xa0 (Yes, your first ones will suck!)Set up your youtube channelLearn how to do "Keyword Research"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Keywords everywhereMake videos that answer the questions your ideal customers are asking (googling)Videos should be 4-6 minutes in length.Of you have a lengthy topic consider doing a video series and break the topic into multiple 4-6 minutes videos 👊Send viewers from one video to another.\xa0 (this is why batching is important) You can also reference older videos.Don\'t overthink the video, videographer, expensive editors, etc.Use your iPhone (sorry Android users)\xa0If you\'re going to spend money spend it on a microphone.\xa0 Bad audio is something people will not tolerate.Keep a log of video ideas for future videosBatch your content.\xa0 If you\'re going to spend the time to get all dressed up go ahead and

| If you are anything like me you might struggle with what to do for closing gifts?\xa0 In my career and being around many many different brokerages and Realtors I have seen quite a variety of gifts given to clients.Cutco knives emblazoned with the agents name and brokerage.Engraved cutting boards with the agents name and brokerageBottles of wine (i\'ve done this)gift cardsEngraved wine glasses with the agents nameflowersArt work for the homeWelcome home signs (i\'ve done these)Electronics and Amazon Echos (i\'ve done these)The list goes on and on but I think you get the idea.Now fast forward to me being involved with Industry Syndicate and meeting David Greenspan.\xa0 David asked his audience of Agents this question "Where does your business come from?"\xa0 the majority of agents responded with Referrals and Repeat business.\xa0 But when asked "where do you spend your marketing dollars?" Sphere of influence and current/past clients was nowhere to be found...everyone sends their money on NEW LEADS?????????This is where Jay Obrien steps in and blew me away with Client Giant.\xa0 I was reading the July edition of Florida Realtor Magazine and found an article titled "Rethinking the customer experience" . Anyone who has been following for a while knows that Jason Frazier with Shred Media (Formerly Agent Marketer) just hammers on Customer experience or CX, So the title got my attention and I read on.\xa0 What I read got me excited and I wanted to learn more.I found Jay on facebook and sent a DM telling him I just ready his article and wanted to learn more...within a few minutes Jay responded.\xa0 After a brief discussion he sent me links to 2 talks he had given at Inman, the first before client giant was born titled "Delivering 7-star service in a 3 star Industry" the second video "Zooming out and reclaiming your life"Delivering 7-Star Service in a 3-Star Industry:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gihtHL9hh4A&t=153s\xa0Zooming Out and Reclaiming Your Life:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMbnhmBFkm4&t=1sJay won Inman Innovator of the year in 2018 with Client Giants theory of reinvesting into your customers experience during the purchase/sale and creating lasting relationships long past closing.Find out more about Client Giant on their website\xa0https://www.clientgiant.com/ | In this episode we talk with Josh Summers, the current COO of the Emerald Coast Association of Realtors here in North West Florida.Josh has been with ECAR for almost 4 years and serves over 4000 local Realtors.Topics covered include:The FREE education opportunities offered by ECARThe benefit of getting involved with your associationWhy RPAC is importantThe Forewarn App for Realtor SafetyFlorida Realtor Convention and Great American Realtor Days (GARD) | Congratulations, you got your real estate license...now what?There are close to 1.4Million Realtors in the united states.\xa0 1.4 Million!!!\xa0 With new Realtors joining our ranks all the time.\xa0 How are you going to make sure that, not only are you NOT part of the 84% of new Realtors that don\'t make it, but that can stand out from the crown and succeed?Before you go down the road of worrying about zillow leads etc etc.\xa0 Learn and master your craft!\xa0 Take inventory of all of the resources available to you that can help you be a great Realtor. \xa0Learn your contracts inside and out.\xa0 Learn to be a great negotiator.\xa0 Learn how to utilize the information available to you in the MLS.\xa0 Learn the market.\xa0 Know the numbers.Ideally your broker will help with this.\xa0 Unfortunately in my market we see many brokers being too busy, or perhaps simply uninterested in helping their agents become better agents.\xa0 Better stewards of the industry.\xa0 They just want to collect their portion of the commissions and recruit more agents.Turn to your local association.\xa0 Here at the Emerald Coast Association of Realtors in NWFL where I work we are lucky to have a fantastic association who is very education centric.\xa0 We have FREE education offered almost daily!\xa0 MLS, Contract, Core Law, Ethics, Negotiation, you name it we have it available.\xa0 We do have to pay for the designation classes but thats expected. \xa0I recommend getting involved with the association in some fashion.\xa0 I joined a couple of committees last year and got a lot out of it, so this year I continued on with one of my committees and joined another new one.\xa0 Right now I am trying to figure out which committees I want to be part of next year.\xa0 In these committees you will find other great Realtors who have a desire to give back to the Realtor community.\xa0 Some of these agents will Mentor you and be happy to share ideas and strategies....sometimes even more so than agents in your own office.If your broker is not helping and your local association is not on par with mine you can attend classes in the eXp cloud university.\xa0 This is not a recruiting pitch!\xa0 Hit me up and I will send you a guest invite to the world and you can sign in and attend our free classes online from the comfort of your laptop...(Nobody has to know LOL)My point again is, this is your business.\xa0 We as Realtors are told all the time that we are Entrepreneurs who run our own business.\xa0 So act like it and be professional, not for your broker, or your team...but because YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL so ACT LIKE IT!\xa0 Educate yourself, master your craft, deliver excellent service to your clients and build the business you always wanted!NOW - please go to facebook.com/modernagentpodcast and leave me some feedback.\xa0 Tell me what you are struggling with, what questions you have and help me bring you the value and info you need. \xa0Thanks for listening...see you next time!

(A lesson I was taught early in my career that has served me well) So dont get in over your head, if you have clients that could benefit from this info get them in touch with someone like Andrew Martin of Atlas Financial in Pensacola.\xa0 Self-directed IRA\'s is the term that Andrew is teaching us about.\xa0 Take notes, read up on it...just enough to be dangerous...and then be cognizant of any of your clients who may be in a position to benefit from this.If you could help your client purchase investment properties, using the money in their IRA WITHOUT paying any early withdrawal penalty or taxes, do you think they would tell their friends who also likely have IRA\'s and would like to maximize the effectiveness of those funds?\xa0 I think they would.I hope you enjoy this episode and learn as much new stuff as I did while speaking with Andrew.If you would like to learn more Atlas Financial is Andrews website. | This podcast is as much a journal of my own real estate journey as it is a way to try to help other agents.\xa0 For 2019 I had set some pretty lofty goals for myself professionally.\xa0 I set 2 goals.\xa0 I wanted to sell 40+ homes AND I wanted to grow my own team of local agents.\xa0 I realized quickly that January and February 2019 were going to be slow as they have been in the past years.\xa0 I was already behind the pace I would need to reach my goals.\xa0 This IS the year I breakthrough!!!\xa0 I can\'t fail already.\xa0 My big speed bump or hurdle was the expense of lead generation.\xa0 You see, in order to hit my production goals I need more leads.\xa0 AND in order to be able to provide for agents on my team I would need...you got it...MORE LEADS!Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Zillow Ads etc etc all cost money!\xa0 Then when you get a heavy enough flow of leads coming in you need to make sure they are handled effectively to ensure conversion.\xa0 Our friend David Tal from Agentology just mentioned a story about a top team in California that realized that 75% of their zillow leads that bought a house, used a different brokerage because they were not following up with their leads effectively.So I needed MORE leads, and I needed LEVERAGE to ensure the leads were being handle correctly to maximize my ROI.A friend had reached out a few months ago asking about the beach market in my area.\xa0 I thought nothing of it at the time but in the recent weeks I had seen posts and chatter about a new team forming HOMES + CITY and HOMES + BEACH.I reached out and talked to the team leader, asked all of my questions, did my "due diligence" lol.\xa0 Then I reached out to my coach and bounced the idea off of him.\xa0 With Coaches blessing I accepted the offer to join the team.The team has the lead gen systems already in place.\xa0 The support and coaching is in place.\xa0 I know am already receiving a flow of leads that feels like it will definitely allow me to hit my goals, and without that concern I have bought back time to focus on maximizing my conversion.\xa0 I also now have a brand and team that I can leverage to attract other agents and grow my local team to work with me.\xa0 Its a win win for me.Teams are becoming to the new brokerage if you will.\xa0 A brokerage within a brokerage.\xa0 Now teams may not be for everyone.\xa0 Some people were just meant to be lone wolves lol.\xa0 I for one am already enjoying the "espirit de corps" if you will, of having a team around me.If you think a team may be beneficial to you and you would like to reach out and chat about it in more detail please feel free to shoot me a DM and lets jump on a quick call.If you have been thinking about a change and would like to learn more about eXp realty go to my website and click https://www.modernagentpodcast.com/join-our-team if the video intrigues you in any way, lets jump on a quick call and see if eXp and/or The Homes + Beach Team is a good fit for you too!I am confident 2019 will be my best year yet.\xa0 I want that same success for you!Thanks for listening and supporting the Modern Agent Podcast!\xa0 If you haven\'t yet, I would really appreciate if you took a minute and left us rating and review on iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/modern-agent-podcast-for-new-and-stuck-real-estate-agents/id1446501828?mt=2Rick Gonzalez is a licensed Realtor with eXp Realty on the Emerald Coast of NW Florida. \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'The Modern Agent Podcast - For New and Stuck Real Estate Agents was created to help prepare real estate agents to be successful in 2019 and beyond.

What is discussed in this episode isn’t meant to replace the type of therapy or healing you might find when consulting a licensed mental health professional, but it’s Rachel’s advice based on her own experiences and research. She’ll be looking at the traumatic effects of stress and trauma on our brains - and our quality of life in general. If you’re in the “thick of things” you don’t have to stay there, or keep rehashing the same stuff over and over again. There’s more than one way to heal, and you will be your own best ally by researching and discovering what is best for you. Your words are so powerful, so audit yourself this week and be conscious of what you are choosing for your life. Like Rachel tells the listener, none of us are promised tomorrow, so live and feel for the present moment. We triumph over trauma by recognizing that we have more control over our current situation than we believe we do! You’ll want to tune in to the podcast next week, where Rachel will talk about trusting the process, and how she did just that even when things didn’t make sense and she wanted to quit… We are just weeks away!

Indecision hurts everyone…. So with Confidence Activated quickly approaching, Rachel was feeling done with the planning process, but she shares what has kept her going to get to the finish line, because leaving things unfinished simply isn’t an option! Have you been agonizing about getting things done? Rachel recently listened to a speaker at an event in Chicago, and he summed it up perfectly. Don’t make it difficult! Just make a decision, and then make it work…. This advice has resulted in her being more decisive than she’s ever been, and it can do the same for you too. It’s important to start thinking about what you want, not what’s available (check out Rachel’s restaurant story in this episode to see what she means by this). Every day, little by little, do those little things to get you closer to what you want, and just imagine what’s possible if you did this. Remember, it’s not about the result, but it’s about the processes and actions that get us to the result!

Much of that fear is absurd. And THAT is one psychologically-proven way to deal with that fear. You\'ll hear a simple process to view your fear as ridiculous so it doesn\'t hold you back. | Lots of stats are thrown around every day regarding sales... how many calls or touches it takes, how many times you need to close, how many objections you\'ll hear before someone will buy... and it\'s all irrelevant. You\'ll hear about the only numbers that matter. The phone numbers you call. | Some salespeople use the "Your Baby is Ugly" approach. It directly tells the prospect that they have a problem, or are doing something wrong. And it should be avoided.

This episode has some straight talk that might cause some people to reevaluate what they are doing. Which is good. | This was a situation I encountered the other day. A waitress made several sales mistakes in asking for what she wanted, and they are the same mistakes many salespeople make every day.

Is your podcast delivering the results you expected when you committed the time and money to creating it? Are you considering taking it for coffee and gently explaining, “It’s not you, it’s me…”? If you’re not getting what you wanted out of this whole podcast affair, it may be time to shift your approach. Or, maybe something even more dramatic. In  episode 066 of Just the Tip, I give you a few options on how to deal with a lacklustre podcast (or a lack of energy to keep it going).\xa0 So, how do you know if it’s time to shift, relaunch or reinvent your podcast?\xa0 If your podcast is just for fun, then there is only one real question to ask. Are you still having fun? If yes → keep going. If no → stop. If you don’t know → listen to this episode.\xa0 For entrepreneurs and business owners who are using their podcast as a marketing tool, there are some key questions you need to ask before you pivot. The first relates back to the  last episode of Just the Tip - are you measuring the right things to determine if your podcast is successful? If you are, and your podcast is NOT successful, then recognizing that is the first step.\xa0 Next, you have to determine if pivoting your podcast focus will do a better job of attracting your ideal client. Or, if there is a better way to serve your existing audience.\xa0 If your podcast is not serving your ideal client, it’s not serving your business.\xa0 Many podcasters resist the pivot. They’re worried about losing audience members who they worked so hard to attract. Keep in mind, if podcast is a marketing tool, there is no point in continuing to market to people who will never be customers.\xa0 Pivoting your podcast may seem like a daunting task. In this episode, I give two examples of podcast hosts who saw the need to shift their podcast and successfully pulled it off.\xa0 In some cases, a podcast pivot goes hand in hand with pivoting your business. You might be niching down or you might be adjusting the products or services you offer your target market. If this is the case, your podcast (which can be a huge marketing asset) should be part of this shift.\xa0 Pivoting can make your podcast more effective and more satisfying. For some of my clients, it has been essential for the growth of their business and their show. But, for a podcast pivot to be successful it has to be intentional and it has to be done right. In my next episode, I’ll cover how to pull off an effective podcast pivot.\xa0 In the meantime, click play to find out if a podcast pivot should be in your future.\xa0 Oh, you already listened? That was fast. And, you’re still not sure? Hit me up for a free  15-minute coaching call. We’ll assess your situation and answer that great existential question - to pivot or not to pivot.\xa0  Get Yourself in My Calendar! | Mega-downloads = successful podcast, right? Not so fast, podcaster. Look, I get it. Watching your download numbers grow feels good. It’s like a whole bunch of gold stars on your homework. And, skyrocketing downloads seems like a reasonable goal.\xa0 But, park your ego for a sec. Just for a second, you can have it back in a minute.\xa0 If you’re podcasting to market your business then sheer numbers is not really what you should be aiming for. Think of it this way. Say you had an old bricks and mortar store. And everyday, more and more people came into the store because it’s warm and it smells nice. Do you think you could go to the bank and say - hey, I need to take out a loan because so many people are coming in my store that I need a bigger store.\xa0 No. You couldn’t because the banker doesn’t care about how many people come in. He cares about only one thing.\xa0 His hockey pool. Just kidding. He cares about the money, chum. How many of those people are buying? Do more people through the doors mean more cash in the till?\xa0 You have to measure the right things!\xa0 Caveat - if you’re business is your podcast, meaning your content is your commodity, then by all means - care about the downloads. Obsess about the downloads because each one gets you a little closer to bigger sponsorship deals.\xa0 But, if podcasting is a marketing tool for your business - those numbers are not the most important measure of your success. Downloads don’t tell the whole story. They can’t give you an ROI.\xa0 So, what is the best way to measure the success of your podcast?\xa0 There are a few ways to go here. You could measure the number of leads you get from the podcast, you could measure the number of conversions you get from those leads, you could measure the lifetime value of that customer.\xa0 I like to measure engagements. Because the goal of my podcast is to serve business owners in their podcasting efforts, everytime I get the opportunity to connect with a listener, I get a little closer to my goal.\xa0 This KPI can also tell me if I’m reaching my target audience and give me more information about what they need. And, I know that many of these connections will result in my being able to serve them on a bigger level.\xa0 My podcast is supposed to be a conversation, so when I hear from my listeners, I’ve succeeded in starting that conversation. Isn’t that what you want from your podcast, too? Once you set the right KPIs for your podcast, the next step is hitting them.\xa0 The key to hitting your KPI in your podcast is to have a strong call to action. A lot of podcasters leave this our or they inundate their listener with a million calls to action. Are you one of those podcasters. Here, hold out your hand so I can smack it! Stoppit! In this episode, I cover how to set the right KPI for your show so that you can really assess when it’s a success. Spoiler alert - it will likely be WAY before you hit 10,000 downloads! Don’t believe me? Let’s talk about it. Book a free 15-minute coaching call and we’ll get your podcast KPIs realigned for success. | You’ve heard me say it before. You have seconds, SECONDS, to grab the listener's attention. Don’t squander it with a boring first question.\xa0 Picture it. A new listener has found your show. They made it through the  show intro, the  tease, the  guest intro with the cautious anticipation that you might actually have something interesting for their earballs. But, they’re still just one swipe and click from quitting you and trying someone else on for size.\xa0 The moment has arrived. Everything is hanging on your first question. Do you have what it takes to keep them interested? Have you got the sauce to make them want to stick around? Here’s a hint. If you ask, ‘How did you get started?’ or simply state, ‘tell us about yourself’ (which is  not even a question!) then you’re dead in the water. Your chances at an explosive first impression as an interviewer have been doused.\xa0 Don’t worry. I’m here to help.\xa0 In this episode of Just the Tip, I don’t just give you some gentle (not so gentle) coaxing to abandon the boring and get creative; I give you ways to do it.\xa0 And, I even demonstrate how interesting this can be. #parentsjustdontunderstand #mymomhasnocluewhatIdo So, if you’re looking to improve your interview skills (and you should be unless you’re freaking Oprah, in which case, holy crap, hit me up Oprah!) then don’t waste another second reading - hit play. In less than 5 minutes, you’ll have a much better way to kick off your interviews and you’ll find out what my mom thinks I do for a living.\xa0 When you have better questions, you have better conversations. That translates to a better podcast for your listener and for your guest (who is WAAAAY more likely to share something they thought was not the usual, ho-hum snore fest).\xa0 Want more help making your podcast unboring?

It’s no secret that being a guest on another podcast is a great way to expand your reach, grow your authority, and potentially give your own podcast numbers a boost. Most importantly, you’re reaching ears who may be completely unfamiliar with your voice. Hold the phone, podcaster. (For all of you youngens out there, holding the phone was something we used to do when we had physical phones attached to a landline and.. Oh forget it) Not so fast, podcaster. There are plenty of risks involved in being a guest on someone else’s podcast, not the least of which is you sound like a total megalomaniac/jerk/dumdum and the audience swears they’ll never waste their time listening to your show.\xa0 Opposite of the desired effect. So, how do you avoid it?\xa0 The truth is, there’s a real art to being a great guest. That’s why companies pay thousands of dollars to have their executives go through media training.\xa0 But, we don’t have time for all of that in this podcast - after all, it’s called just the tip.\xa0 I will share one key tip that, if you follow it, will significantly increase your chances of nailing your interview.\xa0 Here it is.\xa0 Be prepared.\xa0 No, that’s not more lead up. That’s the tip, “be prepared!” Like a good boy-scout or girl-scout or genderless-scout, you have to be prepared for the interview. No. You. CANNOT. Wing it. Not if you want to actually have the interview benefit you and your podcast.\xa0 So, what does that mean? It means that you’ve done your homework. You know a little something about the podcast you’re about to be on and the host who you’ll be talking to. You have some notes in front of you and you know what it is that you’d like to share with their listeners (either a resource or a way for them to connect with you).\xa0\xa0 This level of preparedness is the bare minimum if you want your guest appearance to be a success.\xa0 There are many (many) more ways to ensure you knock it out of the park.

I’m here to pull you out of the podcast equipment weeds. To grab you by your little cotton tail and rip you out of the hole.\xa0 Newsflash: Equipment is not the most important part of your podcast. And, it certainly isn’t going to make or break you (as long as you have  the bare minimum).\xa0 If you’re spending all of your time worrying about your equipment then I hope you are either:\xa0  a) the host of a show about podcast equipment\xa0 b) a total hobby-podcast who does this just for the love of talking shop with other podcast geeks c) a host with buckets of loyal listeners and sponsors  If that’s you; carry on.\xa0 The rest of you - smarten up.

Um, your show content and doing the work to make sure that people actually hear your show content.\xa0 I know, I know. The gear is the fun part. But, if you’re podcasting to grow your business or you’re hoping to make your podcast your business then you need to focus on the stuff that is actually going to move the needle.\xa0 Here’s what matters.

Do you think about your listener every single show? You should! It’ll make your podcast better and it’ll be better for business. If you’re new here, let me clarify. I subscribe to the idea that podcasting should be listener-centric. Meaning - everything on and about the podcast is for the listener.\xa0 There are no exceptions. Well, unless you want to suck. In which case, my show is not for you.\xa0 If you are podcasting for business, this is especially true because when you serve your listener, you serve your business. I explain this little bit of logic in this episode but let’s assume you’re on board with being listener centric and you’re ready to start serving your audience.\xa0 Here’s how to be sure that each episode serves your listener.\xa0 \xa0  Know who they are! If you haven’t figured out who you’re talking to, you can’t possibly serve them. If you need help getting to know your listener, direct your earballs to  this.\xa0 Educate and help them. You know the struggles they face - you chose them as an audience so you could solve their problems. So, solve them. Share the info you have. Give them ways to overcome their challenges. Arm them with amazing insights and ideas to keep them moving toward their goals. Give them a valuable  takeaway every time they listen. Be their guide, their mentor, their friend.\xa0 Entertain them. If they wanted boring instructions they’d read a book. Serve your listener by being fun to listen to. Now, there are varying levels of ‘entertaining’ and I’m not suggesting you have to be Jim Carey in the Mask (yes, I’m that old). But take the time to put the information together in a presentable and entertaining way. Yes, that does mean you have to prep a little… and probably edit a little. Keep the show moving and don’t waste their time. Engage them. A lot of people are surprised that I include the CTA in my listener-centric approach. “Isn’t the CTA about me?” No. The Call To Action is helping your listener take the next step beyond just listening. If you run a business where you actually help people or sell something that works and is of value, then helping someone get closer to that resource is helping them. And the best part is - it’s helping you too.\xa0  If you’re not serving your listener, you’re serving yourself. Who wants to listen to that? I really can’t say this enough. If you’ve got a podcast that you are using as a way to grow your authority, build your ‘know, like, and trust’ factor, or introduce the value of your products, you HAVE to focus on your listeners needs first. Otherwise, it’s just a commercial and we all know what people with commercials.\xa0 Skip.

If the only thing a listener had to go on, would they guess your podcast genre and target audience? All too often podcasters go about picking their music all wrong. Here’s the first mistake - they pick something that they like (and then  they play too much of it) and never really consider if it’s telling the right story for their show.\xa0 The second mistake is that they hunt down free podcast music. Or, they precure it in a not-so-legit way. Do you really want to limit yourself here - you’re going to have to listen to this music a lot (especially if you’re editing or at least  listening to your podcast like you should. ) You want your music to be on brand and attract your ideal audience. Is it doing that? Be honest.\xa0 The third mistake podcasters make with their music is not picking a versatile enough track. You want a piece of music that does more than one thing. With the right piece of music, you can get an intro plus bumpers, sounders, earcons / earmarks, extro beds… yes, you want all of those things even if you don’t know what they mean. Essentially, you want music that does it all.\xa0 By now, you’re probably getting the sense that your music is a big part of your podcast. Good!\xa0 Finding Great Podcast Music In this episode, I explain why it’s so important, how you can get the most out of a great piece of music and where to find royalty free podcast music. I even give you some time saving tips on how to search through those mountains of podcast tracks without totally losing your mind!\xa0 Whether you’re just starting out with podcasting or you’re realizing that your music might need a tune up, this episode will help you develop a show with sweet, sweet sound.\xa0 Listen to more 5-minute-tip episodes, explore my resources and check out my coaching packages at https://podcastperformancecoach.com/ Want some personal help with your podcast music selection?

Are you naming them with as much consideration as say a file name? If you are, then you’re missing opportunities! Episode title names aren’t fun. They’re not sexy. They seem so inconsequential. And frankly, they seem so insignificant compared to the content, the performance and all of the technical stuff that we deal with as podcasters. Make no mistake. Your episode titles matter. A lot. And, if you’re simply slapping a basic description like, “Eps 0112 Interview Bill Smith” than you are doing your podcast a disservice. I mean, that’s assuming that you want people to find your podcast, and listen to it… I’m making an assumption here that you actually want your podcast to be heard and to grow. If not, feel free to stop reading (and listening to my podcast).\xa0Yes, I'm being\xa0sarcastic. I’ve seen some bad examples of this while browsing through Apple Podcasts. I click on a podcast because it seems interesting, then I look at their long list of episodes and if nothing catches my eye, I move on. I’m not unusual (at least, not in my podcast browsing behaviour). Lots of people do this. A few weeks ago, I had someone take me up on my offer of a  free 15-minute coaching call and she was concerned about the lack of growth in her podcast. We took a look at her podcast titles and the problem was immediately obvious. Every title was a total snooze-fest devoid of any real information that would inspire a potential listener to click. What an easy thing to fix! In this episode, I’m going to further explain why you really do need to pay attention to each title. Plus, I’ll give you three tips to help you craft really great podcast titles that will help your podcast get found, and convince listeners to click play. And, do it with integrity. \xa0 These tips are especially important if you are podcasting for your business. If your podcast is part of your marketing strategy (you’re using it to build your authority, grow your potential customer base, and share what you do) then you may be seriously limiting your reach just by phoning in your title. And, if you are using your podcast as a marketing tool, let’s talk. Whether you’re pre-launch or hundreds of episodes in, I’d love to talk to you about how my coaching services can help you get to that next level in building your business with podcasting.

Movie and TV trailers serve a critical role in the world of entertainment - they convince people to spend their time and money to see the rest. Your podcast trailer should do the same. Every podcast should have a trailer - even if they’ve been around for years. The benefit of a trailer is that it gives potential fans a chance to hear your ‘best of’ and get a sense of what they are going to get if they listen. Which is a heck of a lot better than if they randomly pick an episode. The benefit to you is that you get the absolute best chance of attracting that potential listener and turn them into a subscriber. So, how do you make a killer podcast trailer that will turn them on instead of tune out? In this episode of just the tip, I go through the three main sections of your podcast trailer:  The intro The clips The call to action  You need to execute each of these in a way that is exciting, on-brand, and honestly representative of your show. This last part is really critical if you want to keep the subscribers you earn with your trailer. Have you ever seen a trailer on TV for a movie and you think, ‘wow, that looks hilarious’ or ‘oh my mango, this is going to be the scariest thing I’ve ever seen’ then you pay your money and come out feeling ripped off? Not a nice feeling, is it? So, don’t do that with your trailer. If your show is good, let it speak for itself. Those misleading TV and movie trailers do that because their show sucks. If your show sucks, well  stop sucking. There. Fixed. If you have a new podcast, you should definitely do a trailer - it’s a great way to promote your ‘coming soon’ podcast and trigger your account so that people can subscribe before your launch! So, spend some energy making your podcast trailer great and take advantage of this promotional tool. Not sure if your trailer is good enough? Send it to me and I’ll tell you straight up if it sucks or rocks. Just  book a free 15-minute coaching call and include it in the links. | Are listeners turning off your podcast prematurely? Are you making critical mistakes that cause listeners to run screaming from your show? I hit the streets recently to find out what exactly makes people turn off a podcast. Metta side note: In the last episode of  Just the Tip, I explained the power of using streeters or man-on-the-street interviews in your podcast. Now, in this episode, I’m demonstrating what that can sound like by sharing what I learned when I asked people what would cause them to shut off a podcast. People in  Kelowna, BC (where I live) were more than happy to chat with me about podcasting pet peeves. Or, as my wife would say, what gets in your craw about podcasting? (What does that even mean?) They brought up some of the things you would expect – too salesy or too many ads. (Go listen to episode  25 How to Handle Sponsorships Successfully for more on doing this right). They also talked about length – as in they hate when podcasts are too long. One woman cracked me up when she said, “what, am I going to listen over 5 car rides?” \xa0Which, by the way is a reminder to think about what your listener is doing while they listen – this chick is clearly a podcasts while you drive person. But, aside from these expected ‘hates’, there was one resounding complaint and it has to do with that thing that I’m always harping on. You know, that thing where you’re supposed to remember who your podcast is for? Listener-centric podcasting? Hello? Anyone? Alright, I’ll cut you some slack… maybe you’re new here. Listener-centric podcasting is simple. Remember that you are making your show for your listener. Your show is not about you. It’s FOR them. Everything you do, from length, to content, to sponsorships needs to take them into consideration. Respect their time and attention. They could very easily be going somewhere else for their content needs. This is especially important for people who are podcasting for business. If this is a marketing tool for you and your business then you need to be treating your listeners like gold otherwise, this tactic is not going to work. Nobody signs up for an hour-long commercial! Engage them, help them love you by serving them, and you’ll get the results you want. If you decide not to have a listener-centric podcast then you can expect your listeners to turn you off.

DG and Leela talk about what career progression looks like for marketers, why she thinks marketers shouldn\'t get hung up on their title, and the number one thing she\'s learned from each of her roles at Bain, LinkedIn, OpenTable, Lever, and SurveyMonkey. | Marketers love case studies. As they should. But on this episode of the Swipe File, DG talks about why it might be time to re-think traditional case studies, and the importance of finding "real proof" out in the wild. | DG sits down with Kate Adams (VP of Demand Generation at Drift) to talk about a big change she recently made to the marketing funnel at Drift. | DG sits down with Josh Allen, Drift\'s Chief Revenue Officer, to go behind the scenes and talk about the sales and marketing teams at Drift, playing the long game, and what\'s different about marketing in 2019 vs. 2009. | DG talks about the process he uses to create speeches and presentations, the highs and lows of doing big events for your business, and why you shouldn\'t listen when people say "our customers are not on social media." | The best marketing today has one thing in common: it\'s real. DG talks about why the best marketing is real, authentic, and human, and why people don\'t want marketing that feels "manufactured." | You know how you get down those Instagram rabbit holes where you suddenly find yourself on some random profile and have no idea how you got there? That\'s how DG came up with the idea for this episode. He stumbled upon on the profile of some celebrity trainer he had never heard of, and started reading a post they shared on their 10 commandments for training. And DG liked the idea so much that he sat down in that moment to write down the 10 marketing rules that Drift lives by, like using social proof (aka your customer\'s words) whenever and wherever you can. Want the other nine commandments? Listen to the full episode. | Your job as a marketer is to paint a picture. Because your buyers – real people – are visual learners. And they need a little hand-holding to guide them to your desired outcome. But in B2B marketing you don\'t always have images or videos to show, so you have to do that with words. The key is to be as specific as possible in your copywriting. Want to know how to apply this to your next campaign? Listen to the full episode. | Great marketing isn\'t about sending your emails at 2:08pm on a Tuesday because you read somewhere that it\'s the best time to send an email. Nope. It\'s about zigging when everyone else is zagging. But what will it take for B2B marketers to really get out of the echo chamber? DG sits down with Brian Kardon to get find out. Brian is the CMO at Fuze, and before that he served in the same role at Lattice Engines, Eloqua, and Forrester. DG and Brian talk about whether marketers put too much stock in technology, why marketing isn’t for the lazy, why you should answer your next cold call, the benefits of the right peer group, and a lot more. | Are you stuck? Hitting a creative wall? Brain just not working like you want it to? Hey, we\'ve all been there.

That’s exactly how Carrie Lupoli felt. As a certified Health Coach, Carrie was sure she could make an impact working in the health and wellness industry. But she was limited by mental blocks around network marketing. Nothing felt authentic. Carrie figured everything out over time. She’s now thriving as an authentic influencer and quit her full-time job two months ago.\xa0 “I needed to be authentic with my messaging and who I was. I needed to feel confident in bringing people onto my team. Now I absolutely can be those things.” - Carrie Lupoli (26:16 - 26:26) Three Steps to Becoming an Authentic Influencer Step 1. Choose Your Movement. The key to finding your movement is identifying what you’re truly passionate about and what you’re aching to share. Carrie had struggled with her body image from an early age. She felt like there had to be a better way for women to take hold of their health and reach their goals. Becoming a certified Health Coach just made sense. What do you spend hours thinking, talking, and brainstorming about? That’s your movement. Step 2. Build Your Audience. Once you’ve identified your movement, focus on building your audience. There are two easy ways you can organically do this. The first is to create your own Facebook group. The second is through foundation traffic. This is where you offer value in other related Facebook groups through posts and comments. Passion, vulnerability, and authenticity attract followers who can become team members. Step 3. Turn Your Audience into Business Builders. In the process of building your audience, you simultaneously create a team. Keep your eyes open for clients who are invested and could be potential business partners. Give priority to those who show a high level of commitment and engagement. Make sure all your systems are in place for your team, such as an introductory training and separate Facebook group. “You can build a network marketing business that’s authentic and branded around you. If your company suddenly closed its doors tomorrow, then it wouldn’t affect you. You could just go find someone else and plug it in.” - Brooke Elder (15:09 - 15:21) The path to becoming an Authentic Influencer isn’t rocket science. It’s shockingly simple, revolutionary, and fulfilling. Learn to act from the heart. Give yourself permission to move in a way that feels right to you. Change starts now.

People often think that failure is the biggest fear that entrepreneurs face. While that’s certainly the case for many people, network marketers can be even more afraid of success than they are of failure.\xa0 You might wonder what will happen if you recruit a lot of people into your team. Will you be able to manage them all? Will there be enough time? Are people going to see you as an expert that has all the answers, and what if you let them down? “The first step to overcoming your fear of leadership is to not let it stop you from recruiting new people into your team.”\xa0 - Brooke Elder (4:34 - 4:42) While it’s normal to have doubts, you shouldn’t let fear hold you back from success. You signed up for this business because you want to have an impact on people’s lives and because you want to live abundantly. You shouldn’t let your fear of leadership stop you from bringing other people into your team so that they can also pursue their goals and dreams. But how do I overcome my real fear of becoming a leader? Before you can overcome your fear of leadership, you need to address the underlying reasons behind it. What exactly is it about leading a team of hundreds of people that you find scary? As soon as you recognize the root of your fear, it gives you the power to address it. Maybe you see the leaders in your organization, and you think they’re perfect. They’re not perfect, and they’ve also had to figure things out along the way. Taking action in spite of your fear is the best thing you can do to overcome those limiting beliefs you have about yourself. The great thing about network marketing is that you don’t have to be like anyone else. You can have your own unique style of leadership, and you’ll attract the people that resonate with your way of doing things. “We see the leaders in our network marketing businesses, and we think they’re perfect. We think we can never be like them.”\xa0 - Tricia Peterson (3:50 - 3:58) Your aim for today is to identify the root cause of your fear that’s holding you back from embracing leadership. If you’re having trouble figuring it out on your own, find someone in your organization who is a leader and ask them for help. They’ve most likely been through similar struggles, and they’ll be able to help you overcome your own fears.\xa0 Once you’ve identified the causes, create a plan of action to help you get past those doubts. Remember, action overcomes fear, and it works every time.\xa0 How to get involved  If you are ready to stop living in scarcity and have the wealth you’ve always wanted, check out www.socialtenacity.com/gift and get a free gift just for listening!

Here’s a hint: it has nothing to do with your clients or product. Behind every successful network marketing company is a team. Without the contributions from each member, your business wouldn’t exist. As a result, retention has become an important issue in network marketing.\xa0 “When you reflect on your wins and losses, you can create the content that teaches others how to move forward from their own wins and losses.” - Chelsea Lewis (5:30 - 5:38) Creating a training program for your team teaches, inspires, and empowers them to succeed. The process of developing a training program might sound intimidating. Here are three factors to consider to help you simplify the process:\xa0  Your Journey. Take time to reflect on your journey in network marketing. How has it been? What has helped you get to where you are today? Jot down all the successful and unsuccessful strategies that you learned along the way. Research. Take a look at current and successful trends. Use Google and YouTube to research what other network marketing companies are doing as well as traditional businesses. You can find, teach, and apply innovative techniques in your training for the benefit of your entire team.\xa0 Overcoming Fear. Joining a network marketing team can be scary. As a team leader, it’s your responsibility to help your team members overcome their fears. Use tactics in your training that guarantee small wins fast. Celebrate small wins to build confidence.\xa0  “The number one way to keep your retention is to help your new recruits achieve small wins quickly.” - Brooke Elder (16:09 - 16:17) You can increase the retention of recruits by creating and implementing your own training program. This strategy requires time and energy, but it’s worth it in the long run. It leverages the lessons you’ve learned as well as the strengths you’ve developed. You can pass important lessons on to others so that they can move closer to their vision of success while you all continue to profit and grow as a team.

In order to be a great leader, you have to know how to create leaders within your team. It’s the one step that many network marketers overlook. But how can you be a good leader when you don’t have someone to look up to and follow as your own leader? “It's hard to step up and be the leader that you know you can be when you don't have an example to follow.” - Brooke Elder (4:04-4:11) Lack of confidence can get in the way of leadership building in network marketing. Many people stick to just one way of doing things, and they can be intimidated when others step up with the qualities that they lack. Letting go of control and allowing others to lead can keep you from achieving the growth that you need within your team. Being a leader requires you to step out of your comfort zone. When you learn to become the leader your team needs, everyone in your team can also step into their leadership roles.\xa0 Finding People Who Fit Your Team and Vision The leadership development process comes from finding the right people for your team. Trying to recruit every person who comes your way is the wrong way to build a successful network marketing team. Instead, you need to find the right people who resonate and fit with your business goals. That’s what helps you develop a sustainable team in which everyone can grow.\xa0  Being selective about who joins your team is an essential part of leadership. You need to set the right expectations from the beginning while giving your team someone they can turn to for support and learning. Find a leader and mentor who you can turn to for guidance in building a successful network marketing business. Although most network marketers look to their companies to find leadership, it’s important to branch out and look beyond your company. There are plenty of amazing coaches and resources that can help you grow your network marketing team and develop the leadership you need to thrive.\xa0 “Don’t think that everybody is a potential recruit, because they're not. You're not going to build a sustainable team that way. Find people that fit and resonate with what you're trying to do.”\xa0 - Nicole Easton (10:48-11:00) Develop a community around your business so that you can connect with like-minded people who are pursuing their goals while supporting each other along the way. Community is a powerful part of the business process, regardless of the companies that people are working for. As long as everyone is working towards finding their mission, building a community helps you leverage the strengths of others as you let others benefit from your own strengths. Becoming a leader requires you to get the coaching you need while also developing other leaders in your team. The more you let go of wanting to control how your team operates and the more you allow them to step up and become leaders for others, the faster you can all grow together.\xa0 How to get involved  If you are ready to stop living in scarcity and have the wealth you’ve always wanted, check out www.socialtenacity.com/gift and get a free gift just for listening!

Companies don’t always provide the resources and tools needed for success. Uplines aren’t always helpful, so it’s no surprise that the average turnover rate for a network marketer is just three months.\xa0 “There’s something to say about getting trained by people who are in the trenches and doing it right there with you.”\xa0 - Brooke Elder (11:20 - 11:29) Train New Recruits the Right Way for Your Business Success Within three months of launching my website, over 10,000 people began accessing my training tools for authentic network marketing. I realized that no matter how great a company’s training system is, it’s never going to be enough. Here are three reasons why you should build your own training system:   Develop Confident Recruits. Jumping into the world of network marketing. can be scary and exciting all at once. New recruits can face resistance in the form of negative self-talk or disapproving family members and friends. What can you do in their first 30 days to assure them that they’ve made the right decision? How can you personalize their training so new recruits quickly succeed and gain confidence? Build an Authentic Team Culture. It’s inspiring to hear the success stories of top leaders in your company. But it’s far more helpful and efficient if new recruits learn what has and hasn’t worked from their own upline. Share the lessons you’ve learned to create unity in your team as you work towards the same goal. Increase Retention. When you give your team the tools they need to succeed, your directs, first, second, and third lines can all grow, and they’ll be able to train their new recruits the right way. Profits will increase as each person becomes a more valuable member of your team.  “When you have your entire team trained in the same way, you can all row together in the same boat.” - Brooke Elder (20:23 - 20:29) The real magic happens when your whole team is trained your way. But tt might feel overwhelming at first, so do your best to start small and go from there. Facebook has a great new feature available to you. If you change the type of your group to “social learning,” then you’ll have access to a section called Units, where you can create your own team training. You can map out what your new recruits need to know within the first 90 days and upload them on a weekly basis. It’s that simple. All you need to do is get started.

The average length of a network marketing career is only 3 months. In the beginning, everything feels exciting. You may start with high hopes of retiring your husband early and taking your kids to Disneyland.\xa0 But as time goes on, reality sets in, and you can slide further into a deep and discouraging dip. Reaching out for guidance helps you climb your way out and achieve your best self.\xa0 “When you’re in the space of trying to decide if you should quit or not, determine whether it’s a short-term strategy or a long-term strategy. Quitting for the long-term can actually be a very good idea.” - Tricia Peterson (2:03-2:18) Have you discovered that network marketing is more challenging than you originally thought? If you’re thinking of quitting just because everything feels hard, then you’re settling for average.\xa0 You should only quit for the right reasons.\xa0 The bottom of the dip is the worst place to quit. It’s a good idea to stop before you slide down or after you’ve climbed out of it. Ask yourself, “If I choose to quit now, then how will my life change and my goals be affected?” Consider the possibilities to discern the best course of action for long-term success.  Ask for help and push through for what you really want. The good news is that when the going gets tough, you don't have to go it alone. Even high-achieving professional athletes seek help for every aspect of their lives, from nutrition to training. A coach can bring an outside perspective and years of experience to move you through the blind spots that hinder success. They provide a step-by-step plan to get you out of the dip.\xa0 You should never talk to somebody else who’s in the dip. Have you ever seen a lobster try to climb out of a bucket of fellow crustaceans? It’s a tragedy. They’re continuously pulled back down from freedom. The same goes for humans. Misery loves company. It would be wise to refrain from speaking with colleagues who are also in the dip. They’ll only feed into your hopelessness and render you immobile. “Just because things get hard doesn’t mean it’s time to quit.” - Brooke Elder (6:29 - 6:33) The bottom of a dip may be challenging, but there is hope. Don’t let the fear of making a wrong decision paralyze you from making decisions. This week, identify what your dip is and someone who can help you get out of it, like a coach or a call with our team. When you accept help, you’ll not only survive, you’ll also thrive.

But you need to know what a vision board is before you can take advantage of the benefits it can provide.\xa0 A vision board alone won’t give you the things you want in life. Its purpose is to train your mind to act on creating the things you envision for yourself. It’s like a visual brain that motivates you to take the action steps that turn your vision into reality.\xa0 Look at your vision board first thing in the morning and start your day by asking, “What can I do today to generate these things in my life?” Return to your vision board in the evening and ask, “What have I done today that has gotten me closer to these goals?”  “A vision board keeps us grounded, centered, and more efficient.”\xa0 \xa0- Alice Edgerton (21:37-21:41) 5 Questions to Recognize What You Really Want:  What does your vision board represent to you? How do you envision your life, and what do you want to put in it? What feelings do you want your vision board to give you? What lights you up and creates the fire that fuels you? What emotions drive you to create that? What does your ideal life look like?\xa0 What makes your life worth giving everything you’ve got each day?\xa0 If you only had seven days left to live, what would need to happen for you to be satisfied with the life you’ve lived?  Your vision board can include pictures and quotes that motivate you toward your dreams and goals. It doesn’t need to be as complex as it might sound. Our brains can become overwhelmed and shut down when we try to visualize too many things at once. Alice Edgerton recommends having nine blocks on your vision board with one item per block. 9 Topic Blocks for Vision Board:  Wealth Relationships Spiritual Goals Health Love Career/Business (be specific and include numbers and dates)\xa0 Hobbies What truly fulfills you  “A vision board is your path of what you want to do. Every day you create little things that build the life that you want.”\xa0 \xa0- Brooke Elder (19:52-20:00) A vision board keeps you focused on what matters. There can be so much to do that you don’t know where to start. You can look at your vision board and say, “These are the goals I’m trying to meet. What can I do to move me one step forward?” There are many things you could do, but that doesn’t mean you have to do them all. A vision board helps you keep your priorities in place so you can become more efficient and effective at setting and achieving the goals you want in your life.\xa0 How to get involved  If you are ready to stop living in scarcity and have the wealth you’ve always wanted, check out www.socialtenacity.com/gift and get a free gift just for listening!

She is the Founder of the Single Soul Sisterhood Facebook group. Network marketing is the ideal stepping-stone business. If you’re a\xa0 first-time entrepreneur looking for ways to escape the nine-to-five, network marketing might be a convenient first step. Maybe you’ve seen others who are just like you succeed at a company, and you recognize the possibilities that are available to you. It can be very liberating to know that you can join a team of other entrepreneurs and that you don’t have to do it all on your own. And it’s true. With network marketing, someone else has already built a fantastic product, there's a customer service team in place, and all the tools are in place for you to create a business that can provide you with a lifestyle that you want.\xa0  “You’re not just offering a product and an opportunity. You’re taking your strengths, combining them in with all your experience, and bringing a lot more to the table.”\xa0 - Cristi Chauncey (11:53 - 12:33) But like most successful marketers, you’ll probably get to a point where you discover your real purpose and passion, something bigger than promoting any product. It can be within network marketing or beyond. The good thing is, if you build your business the right way, you’ll be in a position to pursue your passion and your truth when you find it. 3 Ways Network Marketing Will Help You Live Your Truth. Transferable Skills - The things you learn in network marketing can be used in any other business or cause that you pursue. Your passion might be to help others take control of their lives, but maybe they’re lacking the confidence to take action just like you once were. Now you can help them through each step of the way because you’ve done it all before.\xa0 More Than a Business Opportunity - When you're sharing what you do, it's a lot more than promoting a product. It's the story of how you use that product as a vehicle to live your truth. Maybe you help single moms overcome their past and believe in themselves so they can be happy and fulfilled. When you talk about your purpose instead of a product, people will resonate emotionally, and they’ll be drawn to join you. It becomes more about what you can do for others instead of what they can do for you. You Are, in Fact, Capable! - Regardless of what you’ve been told, there are people out there that need what you have to offer. Not necessarily just the products, but they need to hear your story. Maybe they are exactly where you once were, and the only way they’ll ever have the confidence to do what it takes is if they know that YOU made it. Your business is only a vehicle that helps you sustain what you really want to do - make a significant impact on the people around you. “I’ve realized that I am capable and that I do have something to offer. I now know that there are people out there that I can inspire with my story.” - Cristi Chauncey (15:31 - 15:57) Take some time this week to find your truth.

You can find more information  here) then it may not be surprising to you that my top strength is Futuristic.\xa0 I love dreaming about the future and making plans for the things to come in my life and my business. What I love even more than dreaming, is watching as those things actually come to pass!\xa0 In the past few years, I have used visualizing as a POWERFUL tool to bring my dreams into reality.\xa0 The Art of Visualization\xa0 It may be helpful to think of visualization like you would meal planning for the week. Before the week begins, you have thought of the meals you would like to prepare. From those thoughts, you have made a plan for which meal your family will have each night, and then gathered the ingredients necessary for those meals. While, you may end up changing plans last minute (somehow we always end up eating out on the night I plan to make homemade chicken nuggets!), the plan is in motion, and will happen more or less as you decided.\xa0  Why Do We Visualize?\xa0 Before our plans and goals are manifested physically, they come to life spiritually.\xa0 Instead of limiting your future plans to schedules, meetings, and deadlines, take the time to visualize HOW you want to show up each day. When we set our intentions for the next day, we can start shaping the way we want our lives to look, before the next day even unfolds.\xa0 “Being proactive is the whole point of visualization... if you are always in the state of reaction, you are never allowing yourself to show up authentically” - Trisha Peterson (4:40 - 5:04) We visualize because it helps us be proactive rather than reactive. You don’t have to wait for your life to just happen. When we take charge, and visualize the way we want life to look, we have the power to manifest those things to achieve the outcome we desire.\xa0 When we take the time to visualize the things we desire to happen, we help our subconscious get in sync, to start manifesting our goals. Some Ways to Visualize\xa0 Sit and Meditate - When I wanted the house in the mountains I spent every night going to sleep and thinking about that house. This works best when you play soft music in the background because it helps to break down the barriers between the conscious and the subconscious.\xa0 Vision Boards - Find the images that represent the goals you’re reaching for. Is it a car, a house, a relationship? Maybe you are ready to take it up a level in your business, or be on the stage at next year’s convention. Find the pictures to represent those dreams, and put that board in a place you will see it every single day.\xa0 Morning Formula - The Morning Formula, or Magic Morning, is a routine to be performed, you guessed it, every morning. Write out what who you are, who you are becoming, and what you want your life to look like, and this is how I feel. Write the achievements you want to accomplish as if they have already happened. \xa0An easy way to implement this process into your day is to record yourself reading this list and then listen to it each morning as you get ready!\xa0 “How are you showing up in your life? Are you going through the motions and hoping for the best, or are you setting out a plan and actually working towards something better?”\xa0 - Trisha Peterson (14:35-14:53) Dig In to the Details.\xa0 One of the most important details to remember about visualization is the importance of detail. Your brain can go through the motion of thinking about the dreams that you want to accomplish, but it doesn’t shift to bring it into reality until you think about the details. Your subconscious is ALL about the details.\xa0 If you dream of walking across the stage at next year’s convention, start visualizing every single detail of that experience. What are you wearing? Who is with you? What does the stage look like? How are you feeling? How will you do your makeup? The more detail the better. Utilize all of your senses to help your subconscious become aligned.\xa0 This week ...\xa0 Pick one goal you want to start visualizing. Then, pick a method you’ll use to help you make this goal a reality. It can be helpful, if you are just getting started with this process, to pick a couple of different methods to discover what works best for you.\xa0\xa0 Take charge of the goals in your life. Visualization can be such a helpful tool to help you get excited about those dreams you have, and help to bring them to pass. It’s time to start dreaming!\xa0 How to get involved  If you are ready to stop living in scarcity and have the wealth you’ve always wanted, check out www.socialtenacity.com/gift and get a free gift just for listening!

Are you ready for summer madness? Whether you are a mom with kids ready to get out in the sun, or a school teacher with nothing but a desire to drink a (well-deserved) margarita, summer can be a really hard season for productivity. The eight to nine-week period has the potential to stall the growth of your network marketing business. Stay on track by implementing these three systems and maintaining momentum all year long! “Being a couple of months ahead of the curve is ideal… a lot of people try to wait until the last minute to take advantage of holiday promotions.” \xa0- Chelsea Lewis (16:08 - 16:41) Here are some systems that will help keep you on track through the summer.  Customer Relationship Management for Customer Follow-Up. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a business strategy to manage the relationship between you and your customer. The goal is to track purchases, customers’ buying preferences, and send automated emails when they run out of a product. This could be as simple as keeping a record in your address book next to their name or using an online outline like Social Tenacity’s free one here! CRM is such an easy way for you to retain existing clientele and increase profitability for your business. Automated Team Training. This is not as hard as you think! With the availability of Facebook Live, you can host live trainings once a week through your Facebook group. There is also a new feature for Facebook groups called “Units.” It allows you to organize content into courses or posts by topic. Not big into Facebook? Then consider email sequencing training. Whatever you choose, make sure to manage your entire team in one place. Find what works best for you! A Yearly Plan. We understand the amount of work a network marketer has. A well-constructed plan for the entire year will ease the load. Sit down and brainstorm a theme for each month. Then put together three-months worth of content to stay ahead of the curve. It’s best to batch and schedule posts to keep you within one frame of mind. Not sure what to say or push? Think about what would be most helpful for your customers? Focus on their needs to plot valuable topics of discussion and relevant products.  “Plan what you’re going to do. Everything is so much easier when you have direction.” - Brooke Elder (17:16 - 17:21)  If you’re reading this and already pulling your hair out mid-July, then it’s time to start planning at least for the coming fall. Summer doesn’t have to be so worry filled. It’s possible to enjoy the season and stay productive in your network marketing business. This week, aim to choose just one system you can implement or teach your team for business clarity and mental sanity. It’ll make your life easier and the coming months smoother. Then you can relax in the sun with the confidence your business is right on track no matter the season!

Structured data takes a technology-based approach to SEO, where it helps to better organize the data on your website so that it’s more easily processed and analyzed by Google, and they can have a better idea of what your website is all about. Pioneers in this area, such as Geoff Atkinson from Huckabuy, guarantee that taking this approach will see your website ranking higher, you’ll see more organic search traffic, and search engines will better index your pages for keywords more relevant to your business. Most importantly, this is a best practice that both large and small businesses should be adopting. | Thanks to Siri, Alexa and Google Home – among other devices – voice search is having a huge impact on content marketing, and will account for nearly half of all searches by 2020. Which makes sense when you think of the consumer convenience it offers with better efficiency and cool tech options.\xa0 But as Courtney Cox Wakefield reminds us, optimizing your content for voice search is a totally different beast than optimizing for text. So if you want to be found in voice search, you need to make some changes to your current SEO and content marketing strategies. | One area that nearly all businesses struggle with is how to price their products and services.

Today’s guest is Tom Schwab, founder of Interview Valet. As we celebrate International Podcast Day, we will discuss the power of podcast guesting and why it is a strategic component of legendary marketing today.Connecting with PeopleTom stresses the importance of podcast guesting, especially for business executives, authors, and entrepreneurs. He believes exposure brings opportunity and podcast guesting is one of the most intimate and targeted ways for customers to know somebody.“I love podcasts because its a way to really connect with people. You’re not yelling, you’re talking with them. They\'re choosing to listen to you.” - Tom SchwabMainstream Media vs. PodcastingTom discusses how powerful podcasting. He says it should be a major part of one’s content strategy. In mainstream media, aside from the cost to advertise (television, print, and radio), one acquires a limited time and limited space, unlike in podcast guesting, where it reaches hundreds of thousands, overtime.\xa0“You\'re tapping into an audience, getting that like and trust, getting introduced by someone,\xa0 they already know. The other thing too is, if you do a live speech, it’s really hard to repurpose that content. If you do a podcast interview, you can do the transcript to make blogs.” - Tom SchwabChristopher agrees with Tom, as he speaks based on experience. He mentions how he appears on different mainstream media and only get to share a portion of his thoughts for a few seconds. “Podcast interview is an easy and scalable way to really go deeper. People will understand you and what really drove you, why you got into the business. People should know they could like and trust you. That’s really hard to do in a 30 sec clip or a little Facebook ad.”\xa0 - Tom SchwabThe Golden Age of PodcastingTom cites Harvard University and the conference that they organized last year on podcasting. They call this time as the Golden Age of Podcasting and there is never the best time to explore podcast advertising other than at the present time.\xa0Christopher also shares that there is a lot of whitespace opportunity in podcasting. He believes that there is a high value for sponsors because podcasts provide a high level of intimacy in terms of getting to know the guests through a conversation.\xa0“I think today, brands want to know the heart behind it. Those people that can get out there early and explain that, not in an ad but in an actual conversation. To me, that\'s where you can really build up a lifetime value of a customer.” - Tom SchwabTo hear more about the power of podcast guesting and more relevant information from Tom Schwab, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Tom Schwab knows how to build an online business.\xa0He’s done it successfully several times and now helps others find online success with podcast interview marketing.\xa0Marketing at its heart is starting a conversation with someone who could be an ideal customer.\xa0Tom helps thought leaders (coaches, authors, speakers, consultants, emerging brands) get featured on leading podcasts their ideal prospects are already listening to.

He shares to us why legendary marketers opt to sell a POV, rather than sell a product or service.\xa0Market the POV, not the product!Legendary creators and designers, market the point of view or POV, not their product and services. When companies show consumers the idea or the problem that they envision to solve, consumers will most likely become interested in the products and services around that idea.\xa0“Its counter-intuitive for most marketers, innovators and CEOs. We think what we\'re doing in marketing, is marketing a product with features and maybe, benefits. When in reality, category creators and designers market the POV, because once people subscribe to your way of looking at things, they are going to be interested in what you have to market.” - Christopher LochheadPOVs are timelessPOV is the company’s true North. It doesn’t change over time, unlike messaging. Companies such as Salesforce or American Airlines have consistently focused on their POV. These are companies who have anchored their business to a point of view, about what they stand for in the world.Messaging is Tailored POV for an AudienceChristopher cites examples on how messages are tailored POVs for an audience, idea or a trend. He shares how they train an entire company on how to deliver their POV. Employees watch a 10-min presentation on thePOV of the company. The ultimate goal is for the employees to be able to deliver the POV.Play Bigger Chapter 5Here is an excerpt from Chapter 5 of the book Play Bigger:"Stories have always been an industrial-strength force in human progress, from the epic poems of Homer to the tales of Marco Polo, Shakespeare’s historical plays, the novels of Ayn Rand, and biographies of Steve Jobs.Stories alter perspectives and exert influence.When traders on Wall Street consider a stock, they often ask, “What’s the story?”When pitching a venture capitalist, entrepreneurs get funding when they craft a great story, and now a cottage industry offers pitch training.Raw information reaches us on an intellectual level, but stories reach into our hearts and our pants.Decades of brain research have demonstrated that stories have a more lasting impact than facts.One 1969 Stanford study, “Narrative Stories as Mediators for Serial Learning," showed that students remembered six to seven times more words embedded in a story compared to random words. [i]In the 2010s, Paul Zak, a professor at Claremont Graduate University found that character-driven, attention-grabbing stories actually increase oxytocin in the brain.Oxytocin is an empathy chemical, and it motivates cooperation and understanding—quite important when trying to convince someone to, as Apple used to say, think different.“My experiments show that character-driven stories with emotional content result in a better understanding of the key points a speaker wishes to make and enable better recall of these points weeks later,” Zack wrote.He added a swipe at the way too much business has been conducted for far too long:“In terms of making an impact, [storytelling] blows the standard PowerPoint presentation to bits.”[ii]That’s why category designers tell a story. We call that story a point of view, or POV.After you come up with an aha of an initial market or technology insight, and after you discover and define the right category, you have to craft the story about the category that you’ll tell. You need a powerful POV.A POV tells the world you’re a company on a mission, not a missionary company looking to make money any way it can.It frames the new problem that your category identifies and sets you up as the answer. When someone can articulate your problem, you believe that person must have the solution.It’s why Bill Clinton won two presidential elections by c... | In this episode, Christopher Lochhead talks about a giant topic in business today, personal branding. He further shares the difference between a brand and a person. Moreover, he discusses why legendary executives and marketers don\'t give weigh to personal branding much. Personal Beef with Personal BrandingPersonal branding has become a giant issue in business today. It seems like people cannot fire up their social media, such as Linkedin and even Amazon, without personal branding. The idea started around the late 80s or early 90s and has become effed up overtime.\xa0Christopher lays out his argument on the difference between a brand and a person. People have a mental connection with a brand while with a person, people develop relationships.“I have a very different relationship with my friend Sue Barsamian. She’s the most effective exec I know. Guess how much time she spent thinking about and working on her personal brand? Zero!” - Christopher LochheadDeveloping A ReputationSue Barsamian was the guest on Follow Your Different Episode 083. She has a solid 36-years in Silicon Valley, working with Startups and multinationals such as HP. Christopher shares that she has zero efforts in maintaining a personal brand, instead, she aims to develop a reputation.Silicon Valley respects Sue for producing legendary results and creating massive value. Moreover, she dominated her own niche: “Legendary Enterprise Tech Executive, who scales.” In developing a reputation, Christopher poses the following questions:“What’s your personal Niche Down? Where are you going to focus your talent? What results are you going to produce? Who are the kinds of people you want to surround yourself with?” - Christopher LochheadRethink this Personal Branding BullshitChristopher encourages everyone to re-think this idea of personal branding because he believes that what people prefer is a reputation. “Reputations come from producing legendary results. Personal branding, by definition, is contrived and inauthentic.” - Christopher LochheadPeople would best be deemed as a person of character, who produces results and is doing legendary work. In conclusion, Christopher advises everyone to spend zero time on personal branding and focus, instead, on the following:1) Your personal Niche Down - what niche do you want to be known for owning2) Producing legendary results - people who produce legendary results are highly sought after in business. They are unique by definition and they hang out with people who also do legendary things.3) and making a difference.“Because in my experience, people who do that, get the most valuable thing in business: a reputation.” -Christopher LochheadTo hear more about why personal branding is bullshit and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher Lochhead is a Top 25 podcaster and #1 Amazon bestselling co-author of books: Niche Down and Play Bigger.He has been an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups; a former three-time Silicon Valley public company CMO and an entrepreneur.Furthermore, he has been called “one of the best minds in marketing” by The Marketing Journal, a “Human Exclamation Point” by Fast Company, a “quasar” by NBA legend Bill Walton and “off-putting to some” by The Economist.In addition, he served as a chief marketing officer of software juggernaut Mercury Interactive.

To illustrate, he cites a music company,  m, and ho they recently pulled something off in the marketing and PR point of view.Frame the Problem, Not the SolutionWise marketers and category creators have a strategic way of creating legendary marketing. One of these is framing the problem. This strategy is a sure-fire way to win a category.“When the world agrees with you about the problem that you solved, and thinks about the problem, exactly the way you want them to, then they sort of have an ‘a-ha!’” - Christopher Lochhead.Case In Point: Kobalt\xa0One illustration of this point is a recent article about Kobalt. Kobalt is a music technology company, which recently raised $200 million in VC funding.TechCrunch featured Kobalt in a two-part series. Christopher highlights a part of the article stating “changing the way the music industry does business and putting more money into musicians’ pockets in the process.”What blew Christopher’s mind off is the title of the article: “How Kobalt is simplifying the killer complexities of the music industry.”Why is this headline, mind-blowing?Christopher believes that Kobalt’s PR team presented their company in a very effective way since TechCrunch featured them. The reporter Eric Peckam, needs to believe that there are “killer complexities” in the music business and that these need to be “simplified.”“They [Kobalt] are evangelizing their problem and in this case, their getting the media to write a headline at the top of the homepage, with the exact framing of the problem that they want.” - Christopher LochheadAs Christopher describes it, this is a legendary category design PR. Once people think that you get their problem, they connect the dots and infer that you have the solution.“If you want to be moving your company forward, evangelize the problem. Spend a lot more time marketing, talking about the problem than the solution.” - Christopher LochheadTo hear more about how to Frame the Problem and Win and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher Lochhead is a Top 25 podcaster and #1 Amazon bestselling co-author of books: Niche Down and Play Bigger.He has been an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups; a former three-time Silicon Valley public company CMO and an entrepreneur.Furthermore, he has been called “one of the best minds in marketing” by The Marketing Journal, a “Human Exclamation Point” by Fast Company, a “quasar” by NBA legend Bill Walton and “off-putting to some” by The Economist.In addition, he served as a chief marketing officer of software juggernaut Mercury Interactive.

Christopher loves hearing from his listeners. Feel free to email him, connect on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and subscribe on iTunes! | In today’s episode, Christopher Lochhead talks about why courage is a critical ingredient for legendary marketing and category design. He poses the question: “What does it take to make legendary marketing happen?” and he shares some except his book Niche Down to answer this.\xa0Break From The PackWhat does it take to break from the pack? The pack, which usually means the general public, the people who think and does the same kind of marketing. What do we need to enable us to design a category and from then, execute to dominate that category?On Christopher’s second book, Niche Down, co-writer Heather Clancy wrote some very important pointers in creating a category“I hope you find it informative and inspiring as it relates to summoning the courage to actually do something legendary, design and dominate a category.” - Christopher LochheadExcerpts from Niche DownHeather Clancy wrote in the book:Category design actually requires going against that pack mentality. Humans have a primordial need to feel safe in numbers. We get a lot of positive feedback from being the same as others. Our challenge to you is to break from the pack. Free the creative part, the innovative part,the legendary part of you — and let that part be different.Our dream is that you harness the exponential power of what makes you different versus the incrementalism of just being better. Because it is being different that makes a difference. And we know how tough that can be.“Kermit The Frog” famously sang: “It’s not easy being green.”Bill Walton, the NBA legend commiserates: “In life, things go wrong. In life, things collapse….People try to drag you down and people try to say ‘No’ to you.”\xa0He goes on to posit, “I want to live in a world of ‘Yes’.”  Of course, there will be a lot of “losery” along the way.\xa0 To be legendary is to be ready for setbacks, disappointments and failures.Because shit happens. Sometimes, life can be crushing. We’ve both been crushed more times than we can count. It’s okay to be a loser.We all are. Failure is our teacher. Failure is our friend. Failure is our coach. Failure gives us humility. Failure gives us grit. Failure gives us a foundation. Losing is an essential ingredient for being legendary. Every time we lose we have a choice.\xa0Give up.Or, take the loss head on, learn from it and execute like a badass legend.It Takes Courage to be LegendaryWhat Heather and Christopher are trying to communicate is the "emotional or psychological” barrier in doing legendary marketing. To put it simply, it takes a lot of courage to be legendary. Courage is moving forward in pursuing your plans, even though a lot of evidence states it won’t work. Christopher cited his other podcast, Follow Your Different as an example. Regardless of what the experts in the podcasting industry were telling him — that business people will not listen to a long-form, unedited conversation podcast — FYD has become a top 200 overall charting podcast in the United States.“If you believe in the problem you\'re solving and you believe in your vision, then go with it. Be different, stick to it and have the courage to be legendary and execute like a badass legend.” - Christopher LochheadTo hear more about Category Creation Courage and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher Lochhead is a Top 25 podcaster and #1 Amazon bestselling co-author of books: Niche Down and Play Bigger.He has been an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups; a former three-time Silicon Valley public company CMO and an entrepreneur.Furthermore, he has been called “one of the best minds in marketing” by The Marketing Journal, a “Human Exclamation Point” by Fast Company, a “quasar” by NBA legend Bill Walton and “off-putting to some” by The Economist.In addition, he served as a chief marketing officer of software juggernaut Mercury Interactive. | In most industries, product-market fit is an unquestioned gospel, even in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, Christopher believes that product-market fit is a dangerous idea.  Why? Because legendary marketers create and design their own category, as opposed to competing in an existing category.Product-Market FitIn the tech startup world, achieving product-market fit is often considered a major milestone. However, Christopher argues that product-market fit is one of the most dangerous ideas in business today.“The problem with product-market fit is that language can trick marketers into thinking that what you’re doing is building a product and you’re trying to fit it in a market.” - Christopher LochheadLegendary creators are not looking to “fit” into a market, instead, they want to stand out. Standing out means to design their own market category.Category King and QueensChristopher cites some of the category kings and queens of today. Think about Jeff Bezos, he is equated with the term eCommerce, just as we equate Pablo Picasso with Cubism. We also have Sara Blakely of Spanx, who created her own category of Shapeware, not just trying to fit into the girdle category."Think about the most respected entrepreneurs, creators, and innovators. a huge part of why we all respect them is because they broke or took new ground." - Christopher LochheadSome other great examples are AirBNB, which presented a new idea and experience for tourists and travelers. Another one is Evian, who deviated from the idea that water is free. Red Bull also dominated their energy drink category, as opposed to hydration drinks, where Gatorade was category king.\xa0“The greatest innovators teach the world to think differently. With a fresh idea, a new take on an old problem or by solving a problem we didn’t even know we had.” - Christopher LochheadWhere the Challenge LiesThe challenge of product-market fit is, it can trap inventors and creators into thinking that they can test their product and service to people and f they consume it, they equate it to the future success of the product. If these people do not consume the product intuitively, then they can just go back and work on the product.This is in opposition to Henry Ford’s mindset who said: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” Moreover, even Steve Jobs has the same ideas on product-market fit, saying “customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.”“The big ah-ha here is that there is a massive distinction between fitting into an existing market category and competing versus creating your own new market category.” - Christopher LochheadTo hear more about why Product-Market Fit Is A Dangerous Idea and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher Lochhead is a Top 25 podcaster and #1 Amazon bestselling co-author of books: Niche Down and Play Bigger.He has been an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups; a former three-time Silicon Valley public company CMO and an entrepreneur.Furthermore, he has been called “one of the best minds in marketing” by The Marketing Journal, a “Human Exclamation Point” by Fast Company, a “quasar” by NBA legend Bill Walton and “off-putting to some” by The Economist.In addition, he served as a chief marketing officer of software juggernaut Mercury Interactive.

Legendary marketers create a new language that educates the world on how they want their product or service perceived. Customer’s adaptation to that language is also a great tool to measure success.How People Perceive Us Christopher recently had Lee Hartley Carter on Follow Your Different Episode 099. Lee and her firm specialize in language strategy. We can infer that marketers pay very close attention to the use of words.\xa0Christopher reminds us that the usage of some phrases undermines a person’s credibility. Some examples include phrases such as “don’t take my word for it” or “let me be honest with you.” “Legendary Marketers and Category Designers know that a demarcation point in language creates a demarcation point in thinking, which creates a demarcation in action, usage, and consumption.” - Christopher LochheadCreate New, Powerful LanguageChristopher discusses how legendary marketers use language to create new thinking that educates the world. This language teaches customers what they do, why it matters and how to value it.Some important examples are Starbucks and their “Double Grande Latte” instead of medium coffee. Another one is selling “pre-owned vehicles” versus “used cars.” Moreover, cloud-based software benefitted greatly with the usage of “on-premise software" Indication of SuccessIt’s far too common to hear at almost every other coffee shop other than Starbucks — customers are asking for Grande or Frappe. Customers adapting to a new language is a great indication of success.\xa0“You know you’re winning when customers start using your language, parrot them back to you, and they use it in the competitor’s stores.” - Christopher LochheadChristopher stresses Lee’s point, marketers need a language strategy!

Aside from bad creatives, much of this onslaught of marketing stems from their inability to make a difference in designing and dominating a market category. Who’s to blame? Christopher says its the committees.“This is probably true for most major initiatives in business, but it’s especially true in marketing because, fundamentally, legendary marketing is about leadership.” - Christopher LochheadTo become the leader in your space — the category queen — a company must define and dominate a market niche. This not only holds true in tech companies but for almost all industries today. To dominate a market, every company’s objective should focus on building the company that wins, with a clear point of view on problem-solving.\xa0The problem with committees\xa0A famous automotive engineer and businessman, Charles Kettering, once said: “If you want to kill any idea in the world, get a committee working on it.” Why does committees hinder legendary marketing?“The problem with most committees is that they are focused on process, not results.” - Christopher LochheadCommittees generally try to incorporate everyone’s “feedback,” spend time “socializing ideas” and analyzing data. In the end, they are trying too hard to make everyone happy. Committees strive to be collaborative and ensure that all constituents have a say.More issues with committeesA structural problem with many committees is that a lot of people can say no, while at the same time, they are not clear about who can say yes. By definition, if everybody agrees, that\'s not a legendary idea.“As a result, committees produce a compromise. They settle on the ideas that everyone could agree on. Not legendary ideas.” - Christopher LochheadAdditionally, people involved in committees are oftentimes not subject matter experts themselves, which further leads to mediocre marketing efforts.\xa0“It\'s not about what people like, it\'s about what\'s gonna work. Particularly what\'s gonna work through the lens. Will these help us design and dominate a giant category that matters and take 2/3 of the economics?” - Christopher LochheadTo hear more about committees kill legendary marketing and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher Lochhead is a Top 25 podcaster and #1 Amazon bestselling co-author of books: Niche Down and Play Bigger.He has been an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups; a former three-time Silicon Valley public company CMO and an entrepreneur.Furthermore, he has been called “one of the best minds in marketing” by The Marketing Journal, a “Human Exclamation Point” by Fast Company, a “quasar” by NBA legend Bill Walton and “off-putting to some” by The Economist.In addition, he served as a chief marketing officer of software juggernaut Mercury Interactive.

Christopher layout facts and data on category creation economics that you’ll find beneficial for your business, whether you’re in the tech industry or not.\xa0Winner Takes AllIn Christopher’s first book Play Bigger, they wrote about a research project they conducted on thousands of tech start-ups from 2000 to 2015, determining the market cap or valuation. Specifically, they wanted to know the percentage of the total value goes to the leader or category queen. In reality, one company gets 2/3 for the entire market category.\xa0“The study shows that category queens earned 76 percent of the market capitalization of their entire market categories.” - Christopher LochheadChristopher’s good friend, Bob Evans said: “every company is a software company.” Tech company dynamics are now applicable to non-tech companies.VCs “Me Too Strategy”Christopher quoted a portion from his book Play Bigger. VCs oftentimes fall for the Me Too strategy where every firm would invest in some company in an emerging category, thinking it will succeed just like the first one who did.“In Silicon Valley, we’ve watched venture capitalists (VCs) increasingly adopt a category king investment philosophy. Paul Martino of Bullpen Capital notes that VCs used to have a “me-too” strategy. \xa0If a start-up hit it big and opened up a hot new category, the many VC firms in Silicon Valley assumed that there was room for a lot of winners in that category.” - Christopher Lochhead, Play BiggerFurthermore, Paul Martino tells us "it’s now apparent that one company wins big and dominates a healthy c0ategory, and the rest struggle, get acquired or perish. That means that as soon as one company appears to be the category king, the smart money competes to invest in that company, bidding up its value.”Category Creation is the Ultimate StrategyChristopher’s friend and category guru to Fortune 500 companies Eddie Yoon wrote for Harvard Business Review on the financial impacts of category creation.He reported that “top 20 firms in Fortune‘s 2010 list of fastest-growing companies received $3.40 in incremental market capitalization for every $1.00 of revenue growth. Half the top 20 companies grew via category creation. Wall Street exponentially rewards the category creation companies, giving them $5.60 in incremental market capitalization for $1.00 in revenue growth.”“No matter how you want to look at it, the bottom line is category kings take the vast majority of economics and are massively rewarded for becoming the category queen of the space.” - Christopher LochheadTo hear more about the category creation economics 101 and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher advised over 50 venture-backed startups.

Christopher Lochhead talks about what your real product or real service is. He discusses why product development and marketing should team because the perception of your product is your product.Marketing DefinedOne CEO, who is also a good friend of Christopher, once stated that “Marketing is what you do when you have a shitty product.” He was telling Christopher about their competitor who had a significantly inferior product but is, at that time, out-marketing them. Additionally, quite a lot of people in Silicon Valley also think this way.\xa0Wikipedia defines marketing and product as such: “In marketing, a product is an object or system made available for consumer use; it is everything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer."“I actually don’t want to disagree with Wikipedia, but I do want to propose a different perspective. Your real product, your real service, is people’s perception of your product and service." - Christopher LochheadThe People’s Perception of Your ProductsChristopher asserts that your product and service is not your product, but what people say it is, think it is and feel about it. He thinks that what other people say about the product or the service, is the truth, regardless if we think of it as true or not.He cites examples such as Harley Davidson and Jack Daniels. These brands may not be the most efficient in performance or the most premium whiskey available, but they have made a mark in the minds and the hearts of consumers. In fact, they are considered category kings.However, Christopher also cited instances when people\'s perceptions of product change, such as that of Facebook and Boeing 737 MAX. They can fix their products but the perceptions will take forever to change.The “Perception Manufacturing Business”Christopher believes that we are in the “perception manufacturing business.” Further, he mentions that not only does the perception of the product more important than the product itself, but it is also actually what the developer is building when he builds and market the products.\xa0"You don’t make products, you make perceptions about products. That is why legendary marketing is equally important to building legendary products.” - Christopher LochheadIn conclusion, Christopher says that product engineering, product development, and marketing need to come together. They must realize that they are in the “perception manufacturing business.”\xa0“It is ludicrous to say marketing is what you do when you have a shitty product. Marketing is what you do when you have a legendary product and you want people to perceive it as such.” - Christopher LochheadTo hear more about the Perception of Your Product is Your Product and more relevant information from Christopher Lochhead, download and listen to the episode.Bio:Christopher advised over 50 venture-backed startups.

You’d get to see patterns in what works and what doesn’t. Talk about an unfair advantage! Now imagine getting to do that through a purely Operational lens with companies in hypergrowth – how much more dangerous would you be in your role? That’s exactly what this week’s guest, Jason Reichl, does every single day. Jason is the CEO of GoNimbly, the first ever, subscription-based, revenue operations consultancy. Tune into the full episode to learn what Jason has to say about the complementary skillsets on an Ops team, bringing a design thinking approach to Ops, and how to draw the line from an Operations team’s work to its dollar impact on the business. | You hear a lot about serial entrepreneurs. But in this Operations episode, Sean sits down with a serial operator. Heidi Rawding is the Senior Director of Operations at RapidMiner and has been hired as the first ops person at three different companies. Meaning she's gone through hypergrowth and has built the foundation for an ops organization three different times. Heidi talks about what it's like to start an ops org from the ground-up, how she's built a community of operators, and why she thinks that every ops pro should have a background in hospitality. | What does it mean to be a COO at a hypergrowth company? A valid question for sure, but if you ask 10 people the same question, chances are you'll end up with 10 different answers. To find out why the COO role is so misunderstood, Sean talks to J Zac Stein – COO of Lattice. In this episode, Sean and J Zac cover everything from what being a COO means to him, the relationship between a CEO and a COO, and the rare but powerful ways you can match your own career trajectory with your company’s trajectory during Hypergrowth. | These days, the market is exploding with tools aimed at operations teams. So on this episode of Operations, Sean sits down with Marko Savic, the co-founder and CEO of FunnelCake, to find out what’s behind the surge and explore how one of those products came to be. You see, Marko is building a product that is meant to help Ops and Go-To-Market teams be better as they go through hypergrowth...all while in the midst of building his own company. Want to learn how Marko says Ops teams should be structured so they can drive more revenue for the business? Listen to the full episode. | A scale-up is typically a company that has found product-market fit, has created more specialized roles within an organization and is in the process of building a repeatable, predictable machine for growth. And while there are tons of books, webinars, conferences, and coaches dedicated to this concept – it’s a whole other story when you get a chance to talk to someone who’s actually in the middle of one right now. So on this episode of Operations, Sean and Jason Holmes, COO of Showpad, break down the processes behind a successful scale-up. Want to hear some of Jason’s biggest lessons learned from his time scaling Adobe and Marketo? Listen to the full episode. | On this episode of Operations, Sean meets with Sylvia Kainz, VP of Global Revenue Operations at Eventbrite. Sylvia joined Eventbrite when the company was 12 years into its existence and on the brink of going public– and was tasked with creating a RevOps team from scratch. No small feat. Sylvia shares what that experience was like and what she learned from it, as well as her definition for RevOps, how to give ops pros a home, and her recipe for the best way to organize and structure your RevOps team. | On this episode of Operations, Sean explores a common trap that Ops teams fall into. And spoiler alert – it’s not what you think. Listen to the full episode to learn what the trap is, how and why Ops teams fall into it, and four actions you can take today (and every day) to make sure you don’t get stuck in the trap. | On this episode of Operations, Sean chats with Kyle Morris about his unique path into ops. Kyle was an Army Ranger for four years before making his way to Silicon Valley, where he started his career in sales and eventually found his way into operations. Now Kyle is the founder of SifData and Kicksaw. Together Sean and Kyle cover everything from how Kyle fell into ops, why operations people should learn how to code, and why SDRs might actually be the best funnel for future ops talent. | On this episode of Operations, Sean goes back in time – to 2012, to be exact – when special guest Bala Balabaskaran first joined Salesforce as Vice President of Go to Market Technology and Operations. At the time, Salesforce was a $2 billion dollar startup going through hypergrowth. Sean and Bala talk about Salesforce's operating model and what it was like to be in charge of the go to market planning process at a large company with a startup mentality. Want to know Bala's step by step approach for building out the annual planning process at Salesforce? Listen to the full episode. | On this episode of Operations, Sean interviews Michelle Palleschi, the COO of Sendoso, the world's first sending platform. Because, as Michelle puts it, sending stuff is hard. But that kind of complexity is what Michelle lives for – she previously worked in finance at Cisco and Apple. Ever wonder how Apple forecasts new product launches? Well, re-engineering that process was Michelle's job. She shares a few stories from her time there – including how her team was able to predict the success of the rose gold iPhone in China. Michelle and Sean dig into the level of planning required when you're launching brand new products where the market demand is completely unknown, what the decay curve means for ops, and why it counts to take out the trash. Want to learn about the behind-the-scenes operations that enable Michelle and her team at Sendoso to send out 10,000 handwritten notes in any given shift?

Because without you, there would be no hypergrowth companies. This podcast is just for you.

We had a really great discussion about the impact of what he does, the result, versus the mechanism that he uses to do it. A lot of the time, people who help people 'do things' focus on the mechanism, the track they follow, the product, how much they actually do for people, instead of focusing on the outcome, the results of what is being produced. So that's what we talked about today. Focusing on what it would mean to focus exclusively on the result you're able to create. There are a lot of great ideas here to help you focus more on what people really want — the results. \xa0 Show Links:Show TranscriptProfitActivatorScore.com \xa0 \xa0 Want to be a guest on the show?

It's September, a new school year here in Florida. I always love to think of my time as an academic year, and before I get started, it's great to look back over the summer. This year I again got to go to London, Amsterdam, and Toronto, and while in Amsterdam for our 4th annual Breakthrough Blueprint event with my good friend Elko de Boer, one of the things that we do is record our Periodic Podcast. It's a kind of 'year in marketing' review for both of us. We talked about a lot of the things that we've done over the last 12 months, compare notes, reflect on our successes, and talk about what we see for the future. It's a delightful episode to listen to, and it's a nice thing to set the scene on my marketing world view as I look forward to November this year when I go to Australia and do the same thing with James Schramko. I always love talking with Eelco, and this is a great episode with lots of ideas for the year ahead. \xa0 Show Links:Show TranscriptProfitActivatorScore.com \xa0 \xa0 Want to be a guest on the show?

This was a really great conversation about understanding who your clients are, what they really want, and knowing that who it is you're trying to attract. Then we talked about a strategy for attracting and keeping those people.\xa0 She does a really great job of keeping people once they come in, with around an 85% conversion rate into ongoing clients. When we did the math we found out they're worth a lot of money over the lifetime of a client, and we talked about a very useful strategy I've used in a lot of different situations to kickstart and bring in new clients in her before unit.

It's usually someone I don't know, but today on the More Cheese Less Whiskers podcast we're going to spend an hour hatching said evil schemes with someone I know very well! Richard Miller. I've spent a lot of time with Richard. When we first met, he was taking over the role of running all the audio visual requirements for the big real estate seminars I did with Joe Stump and Eben Pagan. He has a long, long history of putting on high stakes events for entrepreneurial businesses. We would do 600-800 person events every month for many, many years, and Richard was responsible for making them go off flawlessly. He's done events for people like Dean Graziosi, Jeff Walker, Eben Pagan and many of the names you would recognize. He's a bonafide audio visual expert, and this is a really great conversation, hatching some evil schemes around the future of the audio visual business. You're really going to enjoy this episode. \xa0 Show Links:Show TranscriptProfitActivatorScore.com \xa0 \xa0 Want to be a guest on the show?

Steve's a building contractor who works with remodels, new construction, and all kinds of building projects, and one of the things we talked about, which turned out to be one of the big opportunities for him, is his After Unit. It turns out that a lot of his business is by referral. He's been in business for over 30 years and he knows a lot of the people in his town and his reputation is great. He does a good job, so of course he's going to get referral business and luckily most of it just happens without him really doing anything to orchestrate it. We looked at that as a big opportunity and had a great conversation about a strategy for him to orchestrate referrals. A low cost way that will have a big ROI for him. Then we talked about targeting specific people on the high end of what he likes to do, full house remodels. We talked about a really great strategy to attract just those people and I think you're really going to enjoy this conversation. \xa0 Show Links:Show TranscriptProfitActivatorScore.com \xa0 \xa0 Want to be a guest on the show?

The number one way you're going to achieve what you want to achieve is by wrangling your time. People often tell me, the thing that stands in their way is that they just don't have time.

I first met him at a Breakthrough Blueprint event I did in London, maybe four years ago now, and we had a really great conversation about who he wants to be a hero to. This is a conversation I've been having with Dan Sullivan recently, and the subject of his new book also called Who Do You Want To Be a Hero To? It's one of the most profound books I've ever read, and we're going to have a lot of discussions about it on future episodes here.

We dissected the roles each part of this strategy is playing; using books as a lead generator, and the purpose of a podcast or a radio show as a distribution channel and lead conversion tool.

However, not every cause is lost. Some companies get their Customer Experience right, and we can all learn a lot from their journey. In our global Customer Experience consultancy, we have the honor of working with fantastic organizations that are committed to doing the difficult work of improving their Customer Experience from the inside out. One of these companies is RICOH Canada. Years ago, they were facing enormous changes in what can only be described as a declining industry. Moreover, there were few differentiations between the product from the top tier firms from a hardware standpoint. As a result, the printer business was heavily commoditized and highly cutthroat. RICOH Canada decided the only way forward in an aggressive industry with little competitive differentiation was in the Customer Experience. They embarked on a Customer Experience Journey that they are still on today—and with great success. They increased their Net Promoter Score®[i] (NPS) by 34 points over 30 months. Furthermore, in a declining market, they enjoyed a ten percent increase in sales. Since that time, they have climbed another 15 points to an all-time high. A question I always get in my global Customer Experience consultancy is whether business-to-business customers are subject to the same emotional decisions that we have as consumers. The answer is a resounding yes. One thing RICOH Canada understood early was that by enhancing that emotional connection with their business customers, they not only improved their relationship, but they also improved their customer retention and loyalty.\xa0 This episode of The Intuitive Customer is the story of how RICOH Canada did it. We spoke with the President and CEO of RICOH Canada, Glenn Laverty to hear how and why they did it. Plus, we will hear about the new challenges they face and what they are doing to address them. \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts help you take your Customer Experience to the next level by unlocking the “hidden” aspects of your experience and determining what really drives value for your customers.\xa0 To find out more about how your organization’s marketing can improve customer loyalty and retention, contact us at www.beyondphilosophy.com.

Many people assume they are the same thing, but they are not. Marketing is deciding what you are going to say; Advertising is saying it. In my corporate life, I worked in Marketing for a long time. One of the things I learned was that Marketing should know the marketplace and understand their customers. Marketing communication should reflect this understanding. Moreover, every campaign, script, web page, and tweet should have a purpose, something that you are hoping the communication will cause people to do. In other words, the marketing communications in your advertising should show that you know who you are saying it to—and why.\xa0 This episode of The Intuitive Customer discusses the fundamentals of Marketing communications through advertising and how it affects the Customer Experience. More importantly, we share the three general goals of marketing and how to do them right, as well as how it looks when you get it wrong. One of the reasons these things are essential is because when you advertise, you communicate what a customer can expect. It is your brand promise, your value proposition. If you get it wrong, the Customer Experience will fall short of the expectations you set, which does not do your Customer Experience Strategy any favors. When crafting your Customer Marketing Strategy, you need to have an idea of who you want to talk to and why. You should know what those people want and what they value. You also have to understand the obstacles keeping them from being a customer right now. Then, when you advertise, you address all of these issues. Moreover, you tie it to the overall Customer Marketing Strategy so that you stay on brand and set the proper customer expectations. Furthermore, advertising should have a specific action you want to evoke, as well. All of these things are fundamentals of Marketing, or what I sometimes call, “a blinding flash of the bloody obvious.” That said, you might be surprised how often you learn that an organization does not have a clue about any of that when they choose, launch, and execute a marketing campaign. In this episode, we review the basics of marketing communications. We also discuss how you can avoid having a brilliant campaign that is wildly successful at getting attention but fails to move the needle for your bottom line. \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts help you take your Customer Experience to the next level by unlocking the “hidden” aspects of your experience and determining what really drives value for your customers.

Their goal is to determine what to do with the Ring that threatened to end life as they knew it. Gandalf reasoned that since the Ring was a problem for all of Middle Earth, everyone should be involved. A Customer Experience Council (CX Council) follows Gandalf’s lead. Although, to be sure, the stakes are a little lower. Your goal with the CX Council is to gain alignment of actions toward a common goal, improving Customer Experience, a vital but not (middle) Earth-shattering purpose.\xa0 This episode of The Intuitive Customer discusses the CX Council and how to create one for your organization. We also take a look at what their objectives should be and how to set up your meetings. The CX Council is designed to help you get everyone on board with your Customer Experience goals. A CX Council is a team of people that represent all the different departments of your organization, from Marketing to Sales to Customer Service to Operations. Each member of the team determines how to adapt their actions to align the other departments and improve the Customer Experience. Best of all, it is inexpensive from a balance sheet perspective, so senior management is usually on board with your plan. It was in my role at British Telecom as Customer Experience Manager that I first saw the importance of a CX Council. My program affected all the departments, but none of them were doing the same things to get to where we needed to go. Moreover, they operated so independently, like silos, that they often stepped on each other’s toes. I realized that if I wanted to improve the Customer Experience, I needed everyone marching in the same direction toward the same goal. I also knew to do that effectively, I needed all of their buy-ins. I was from these epiphanies that the idea for a CX council was born. Over the years in our global Customer Experience consultancy, we have learned a thing or two about CX councils, what works, and, perhaps most importantly, what doesn’t. This podcast explores the details and shares critical information about how to make them useful in your organization. Plus, it doesn’t involve anyone fighting an Orc or walking up the side of an active volcano, so, how can you afford not to listen to it? \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts help you take your Customer Experience to the next level by unlocking the “hidden” aspects of your experience and determining what really drives value for your customers.

His best quote is, “There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.” Of course, there are times when people are talking so bad, one might wonder if it is worse than being ignored. This episode of The Intuitive Customer explores if there are times when the bad press can be good news for your brand. In other words, are there times when bad news is good? Is any attention good attention? The answer, for my part, is it depends. It turns out scientific research says the same thing. There are no absolute answers to this question. The circumstances of the attention, the bad press, and the goals for your organization all play a part in how you answer the question. In the early days of our global Customer Experience consultancy, Wilde’s statement sums up the marketing efforts for my brand. We started back in 2002, when nobody knew who we were, or, frankly, what a Customer Experience was. To get attention, I published my thoughts on customer behavior and emotional experience anywhere I could. Back then, the idea that customers had an emotional experience in business or consumer situations instead of rational ones was not widely accepted. (You might argue that we are still working on that one.) It was controversial, and many people in the industry thought I was mad and, well, wrong. The result was I debated a lot of people. These disagreements were fantastic for us. Why? People knew who we were and what I did. Now, in this case, the negative attention I generated from my views was positive for my brand. I needed people to know who we were and, based on my beliefs that few people agreed with at the time, they discovered us. However, this result is not always the case. There are times when the bad press is good news for your brand. There are also times when it isn’t — knowing which is which and whether it’s suitable for your current marketing goals is essential to your brand message. Do you and your marketing team know the answer? In this podcast we help you figure out how to get there and get the results you need. \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts help you take your Customer Experience to the next level by unlocking the “hidden” aspects of your experience and determining what really drives value for your customers.

A new report by the Institute of Customer Service indicates that Customer Satisfaction is declining in the UK. Earlier this year reports from both Nunwood and Forrester, two firms entrenched in the Customer Experience movement, presented similar sentiments. All of this disappointing news about the state of Customer Experience makes one wonder what is going on in business today? We decided to ask the expert Joanne Causon, CEO of the Institute of Customer Service what she thought the problem was with Customer Satisfaction. Moreover, we asked her why we are seeing the results we are and what we can do about it moving forward. It is important to note that the ratings are not plummeting. The downward tick is from 78.2 to 77.1. It is not a significant drop. The concern is the direction of the numbers and how long they have been moving in the wrong direction. Two years, it seems, is indicative of a trend. The Institute of Customer Service is an independent membership body that undertakes research designed to help businesses up their customer service games. Their survey, the UK Customer Satisfaction Index Report, is one of the most robust in the industry. They run their research twice a year and have done so for the past ten years. For all of these reasons, the Institute is considered a barometer for Customer Satisfaction. Furthermore, it addresses 13 different industry verticals and receives over 45,000 responses. The areas the survey covers include the following five:  How professional is the website or how knowledgeable are the people with whom you interact at the organization? How easy is it to do business with them? Does the product or service meet your expectations? Is the company sufficient at resolving conflict, and do you feel resolution from the outcome? Are they timely in their responses?  This year, the Institute also explored some of the emotional indicators that predict customer satisfaction. For example, they asked if customers felt the organization was doing the right thing? Also, they asked respondents to judge whether organizations were transparent in their business dealings. To summarize the report, overall Customer Satisfaction is declining in the UK. Fixing it is complicated because there are several factors at work that are dragging the number down. One of the most significant problems, however, is that many organizations focus on the wrong things in Customer Experience. In my view, too many organizations do not concentrate their efforts on areas that create value for the customer. What’s worse, they don’t know what those areas are. Listen to the podcast in its entirety to learn more about why Customer Satisfaction is Declining in the UK and what that means for your Customer Experience. \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts are designed to help you improve your Customer Experience by unlock the ‘hidden’ aspects of your experience and what drives value for you to enable you to take your experience to the next level If you would like to find out more in your organization’s marketing to improve customer loyalty and retention, contact us at www.beyondphilosophy.com.

However, our ability to do it is hard-wired into our brains, and it doesn’t only apply to people. We can stereotype an organization, too. Let’s say you need to name a type of business that is frustrating across the board. My first thought is internet service providers, aka, the cable company. No matter which carrier you have, you probably have a beef with your service (or lack thereof) or with at least some part of your Customer Experience.\xa0 However, stereotypes work the other way, too. If you were to name a business where the representatives were universally excellent, you could do that, also, like a spa. Another example could be candy stores that hand out free samples. This episode of The Intuitive Customer explores how and why we create these stereotypes and what purpose they serve in making decisions. We also take a close look at what happens in an experience that can put you into a stereotyped group—and what to do about it if that stereotype is hurting your bottom line. Stereotypes are the product of a shortcut in thinking, or heuristic, called Representativeness. The Representative Heuristic is how our brains look for ways to group separate entities and associate them with characteristics so we can make quick and straightforward decisions. For example, when I ask you on a scale from one to ten of how likely it is that I am a male model, what is the first thing you do? You probably think of how male models look and then compare that mental image to my profile pic to determine what number you would give me. The “male model” entity you compare me to is an example of Representativeness. (For the record, I don’t need to know what number you gave me. It was only a way to demonstrate the process for the heuristic.) Now, heuristics work pretty well most of the time, which is why we use them. However, heuristics are not foolproof. It is here where heuristics fail that decision scientists focus their interest. Usually, the Representative Heuristic fails when you reach the extremes, and you forget about how probability works.

This is one of our key questions we ask organizations when we consult with them. It seems a very simple question and yet in reality, the answer is very strategic and critical to moving your CX to the next level. What is surprising is most organizations do not know the answer to this question! Be clear, everyone thinks they know the answer, but in reality every part of the organization does what they think is the right thing. Marketing, Sales, Customer service, Finance, IT, etc. all do what they think is the right thing, but it is not aligned, it is different and as a result the Customer is confused, there are overlaps and gaps in the experience. This leads to re-work, overlaps, gaps and all this costs money. More importantly, the Customer looks at your organization as a whole and ends up being frustrated. This does not build Customer loyalty. It is therefore vital to define the answer to this question. What is the experience you are trying to deliver to your customers? The answer to this is a strategic choice. The experience that you should be delivering should be one that drives value ($) for the organization. It should be decided strategically by the senior executive of the organization. It should be debated and argued about. Once agreed, it should set the direction of the whole organization and as a consequence it should outline all the things that you need to start and stop doing as a result of the strategy. In this podcast we outline how to go about this. We give you an example of one organization who, by setting the strategy in this way, improved their Net Promoter Score® by 40 points in 30 months that lead to a 10% rise in volumes. \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts are designed to help you improve your Customer Experience by unlock the ‘hidden’ aspects of your experience and what drives value for you to enable you to take your experience to the next level If you would like to find out more in your organization’s marketing to improve customer loyalty and retention, contact us at www.beyondphilosophy.com.

In this episode of The Intuitive Customer, we are going to talk about how organizations often define loyalty, and why I think they have it all wrong. It makes me upset when I think about it. Many, if not most, companies believe that when a customer gives you all their business, it means they are a loyal customer. After all, isn’t that what we all want, all the business our customers have to give? If they are giving it to us, then they must be loyal right? Not so fast.. A customer giving you all their business doesn’t always mean they are loyal customers. It could be because they have a habit of buying from you, or it could mean they haven’t bothered to seek out an alternative. It might also be that they have no other choice, but as soon as they do, they will leave and take all that business with them. (I’m talking to you, Internet Service Providers.)\xa0 Customer Loyalty is more than an automatic, indifferent, or begrudging action. It is an emotional connection with a brand. Customer Loyalty is hard to earn but also hard to lose. However, it can be lost, so don’t rest on your laurels. When you think about who you are loyal to, you likely think of family and friends. That’s because you have a relationship with them. Over time, you have had a consistent and positive interaction with these people, and you share an emotional bond because of it. Sometimes friends and families disappoint you though, don’t they? However, you don’t cut ties over it. With time and communication, most families work it out. Many friendships endure despite quarrels or disagreements, too. Again, that is because of the history and the emotional tie that you share with these people. When you have loyal customers, you have a relationship with them, too. It is built through your consistent positive actions. Also, when you make a mistake or do something they don’t like, they don’t cut ties with you over it. Why? Customer Loyalty is an emotional bond with your company, and it persists over time and troubles. One thing is certain about Customer Loyalty; it is the result of what you do in your Customer Experience. We examine what Customer Loyalty is, why it works that way, and, perhaps most importantly, how it benefits your relationship with them and all that business of theirs you would like to have. Listen to the podcast in its entirety to learn more about The Secret of Creating Loyal Customers with your Customer Experience. \xa0 The Intuitive Customer podcasts are designed to explain the psychological concepts behind customer behavior.

We have a way we operate at work or school; we act a certain way in public and another way with our friends and family. The difference is the type of relationship we have with the other people involved. This variance in behavior is also at work in our relationships as customers. In this episode of The Intuitive Customer, we explore how our relationship with customers affects how we interact with them. For this episode, we characterize relationships into two types, Relational and Transactional. You might think that one is better than the other, but it is not the case. For example, let’s say you want to sell an old car. You make the listing and wait for the responses. It turns out you get one, but it’s from your brother. Would you change your approach to selling the car? My guess is you would—unless you and your brother are on the skids. For my part, my brother and I would enjoy the match up and would have a no-holds-barred approach. The fact is, most of us wouldn’t haggle the same way with a family member the way we would a stranger. In my case, I would not only skip the haggling, but I would probably back off the price. Moreover, I would worry every time that I saw them that they would tell me there was something wrong with the car. Advantages and disadvantages exist for each of these relationships on both sides of the equation.\xa0  Relational: This relationship is emotional. It focuses on value instead of price. These relationships are the foundation of customer loyalty and related customer behavior. Transactional: Unlike Relational interactions, transactional relationships tend to be a one-time thing. Rational parts of the experience, e.g., price or shipping costs, etc., often drive the buying decisions. Instead of loyalty, these relationships tend to focus on What’s In It For Me (WIFM).  If we go back to the car example, the idea of selling a used car to your brother is one point in a much more extended relationship. As a result, you feel more responsibility to ensure that it is positive. You also feel more guilt if it is not great.

Measuring your progress for your Customer Experience strategy is an essential aspect to your program’s success. Not only will it show if your program is working to provide an excellent experience for your customers, but it also shows what customers really value, which can be an elusive thing to discover. In this episode of The Intuitive Customer, we discuss the importance of measuring Customer Experience correctly. We invited Don Peppers, bestselling author, business strategist, and engaging keynote speaker to joins us to share his wisdom on the subject. With 11 books on marketing and Customer Experience, he had much to add to our discussion about the best way to handle Customer Experience measurement. \xa0 \xa0 There are two types data marketers can user for measurement:  Voice of Customer (VOC) data, which involves an interaction with customers. Observational data, which involves analyzing numbers and operational reports, among other things.  \xa0 Peppers says that VOC data is excellent for many things. It can provide you feedback on moments in your experience that are or are not working. It also gives you the opportunity to respond to problems immediately and repair damage to a relationship before it has repercussions on customer behavior. However, it has some drawbacks for Customer Experience measurement. Let me give you an example. I fly on Delta a lot. Every time I fly back and forth to England, they send me a survey. They want to know more about my experience on the flight. However, I never fill out the survey unless I had either a very good or very poor flight.\xa0 This survey is an example of why VOC data measurement is flawed. Since I don’t fill out the survey every time, they have a skewed view of how I feel about their airline. Sometimes I am delighted; other times I am disgusted. Now, if Delta were to look at my flight purchases over the past six months, that would be observational data. If they were to see that I purchased fewer flights compared to the previous year, they would see that my customer behavior had changed. Then, they would know how their Customer Experience is performing and they could react. To be fair, both types of measures are useful and have their place in Customer Experience Measurement. However, in many ways, marketers tend to favor VOC measurement over observational measurement. The reasons for this preference are understandable; VOC is easier and more popular, and who knows better than the customer how they felt about the experience, right? However, it is in the observational data that you get a much clearer understanding of how your Customer Experience performs. Observational data shows customer behavior, and that is a far more accurate indicator of how customers feel about your experience.

It makes you algorithm-immune.\xa0Listen to the episode for more.To download the e-book of copy advice that could 10x your resonance: https://bit.ly/2nw1SpR | "Do you secretly have an army of content producers behind you? How do you produce so much high-value content all the time?", a colleague asked.It\'s true. I create multiple (long, substantive) posts a day, accompanied by original images, for my own feed as well as to different groups. I post a new video or do a live almost everyday. I write several (long, substantive) emails to my list a week. I write books... and do this podcast.And none of it is fluff.But I don\'t have an army of content producers. It\'s all me.And I\'m not glued to a screen all day, either. I do it all in minutes a day.The answer is NOT a content calendar, some weird batching strategy, or witchcraft.It\'s how you THINK.I tell you all my \'secrets\' in this episode.To find me on social media:Facebook -\xa0https://www.facebook.com/seungheesimoneInstagram -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/simone.grace.seol/ | If you want to make $1,000, make sure you first contribute $10,000 worth of value.If you want to make $20,000, make sure you first contribute $200,000 worth of value.This is my 10-to-1 Rule of Profitability.You get back in profit 10% of what you give freely, 10% of the usefulness that you provide, the service you offer up purely out of the love of being helpful.\xa0 | I never worry about how to be consistent on social media, and neither should you.Because inconsistency is not the problem, but a symptom of the real problem. And the real problem is what you are thinking about social media.\xa0People who have trouble with consistency tend to have the same deflating thoughts, like, "I need to do this for my business," or "I need to get good engagement." Thoughts like these create feelings of obligation and heaviness.\xa0No wonder they don\'t want to show up!\xa0I make sure I have thoughts that create joy, lightness and a spirit of service. And the consistency happens automatically. | "You\'re making a big mistake if you\'re not creating content for social media," says entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk.\xa0He could be right.\xa0Social media works like a digital resume, or a credit score. How you show up, and for how long, matters. It is how we meet new people, get to know our existing friends better, and more importantly for business, how we create loyal fans and customers without having to pay for ads.\xa0In this episode, I explore why having an authentic social media presence is is one of the best investments of time and energy you can make -- even if you don\'t have a business. | If you don\'t think social media is working as well for you as it seems to for other people, the problem may not be for lack of good strategy.\xa0The problem might be your internal dialogue!If you\'re telling yourself one of these FOUR things, you\'re likely holding yourself back from reaching more people and making more money.I\'ll tell you what they are... and how to fix it.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'You know your weirdness, quirks, and "flaws" that you try to hide on social media? What if that\'s the key to profit?All the "proven" social media strategies won\'t work until you show us who you are... because your you-ness is the secret ingredient to success.Life coach and digital entrepreneur Simone Grace Seol talks about how to have fun, be yourself, and making money on social media.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/26/ef/a2/26efa2ac-a207-9ab8-ec86-a0a356b354b7/mza_2822524491362942231.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-09-17'}}

Matt has built a wildly successful advisory firm, generating seven figures in annual revenue while taking more than 200 days out of the office in 2018. Spending half the year outside the office doesn't interest me, but I have been obsessed with Matt's story since he appeared on Michael Kitces' podcast.\xa0 He has become a friend, coach, and mentor and I've learned through our time together that much of his success can be attributed to adding massive value to prospective and existing clients through tax planning. In this episode, we discuss:  Why there is a big opportunity to inject comprehensive tax planning into your business Strategies for using taxes to generate prospective clients How to articulate and add massive value to existing clients through tax planning How to work with tax preparers and CPA's without stepping on their toes and getting yourself in legal trouble  For all the links and resources mentioned in this episode, visit www.taylorschulte.com/7 | In today's episode, I’m sharing four things I have been working on recently:  Sonic branding. How we all can up our audio and video marketing to stand out in a noisy content world. Back to basics marketing. All the details of a snail marketing experiment we will be deploying this summer. Blog/website page optimization. The exact steps I take with each blog post to help improve its organic search visibility. A lesson in repurposing content. How a recent podcast episode became the cover story for a highly regarded industry publication.  As a bonus, I'm also sharing an easy-to-implement hack I use to mitigate FOMO and avoid feeling overwhelmed about marketing. For the links and resources mentioned in this episode, visit www.taylorschulte.com/6\xa0 | I have something lined up today that I don't think 99% of advisors have ever heard or thought of doing. Steven Fox, the owner of Next Gen Financial Planning, is taking us behind the scenes into a hyper-local marketing idea he looped me in on two years ago. Fast forward to today, and this little experiment is producing some powerful results.\xa0 The great thing about Steven's clever idea, and the reason I wanted to share it on this podcast, is that it can be applied to just about every city and by any advisor. With Steven's help, we are going to be sharing four things in today's episode:  Exactly what this local marketing experiment is and how we got it off the ground The specific results we have seen in the last two years How you can adopt something similar and what the first step is Things we think we can do to improve on so you can avoid the same mistakes and gain traction sooner\xa0  For all of the notes, resources, and links mentioned in this episode, go to www.taylorschulte.com/5\xa0 | If you're a listener of the show, I’m going to assume you are either:\xa0  Not creating content, want to start, and unsure where to begin Currently creating content and want to improve and reach more people  If that sounds like you, you're in for a real treat today.\xa0 I have four really special guests who have found massive success (both personally and financially) each on a different media platform. Joining me on the show today I have Jeff Rose, Roger Whitney, Kathy Longo, and Justin Castelli sharing:  Their favorite content platform and why they think it's best How they are using that platform to build and educate their audience Their advice for financial advisors who aren’t sure they are on the right platform, want to take their content game to the next level, or don’t know even know where to begin  For all the resources, links, and show notes for this episode, go to\xa0www.taylorschulte.com/4.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 | As you\xa0hopefully\xa0know by now, I’m not afraid to experiment. And, last year, I experimented with my first acquisition by purchasing a practice from a retiring advisor. I wanted to go through the process for a few reasons:  To help another advisor – who I have a lot of respect for – ensure that his clients were going to be well taken care of for the rest of their lives To learn and try something new To experience the process of an acquisition from start to finish and determine if it’s something I want to build into the future of my firm  In today’s episode, I share my experience as well as\xa0three really important things\xa0I learned through this process that I wanted to personally take note of in case I ever pursue this again. For all the details, links, and show notes, go to www.taylorschulte.com/3\xa0 | In 2017, the Start Here button on our website was responsible for over 100 introductory phone calls. For some, that might sound like a success. But, over the last couple of years, I’ve learned the hard way that the quantity of calls isn’t always most important.\xa0 In the chance it helps others improve their website and avoid some of the mistakes we made when trying to turn web visitors into potential clients, I'm sharing three things today:  How I’m flipping my marketing approach on its head to improve user experience and success rate Step-by-step how we designed our Start Here process and what it looks like today Why the Start Here button works so well for us + our goal for 2019 and beyond  For all the details, links, and show notes, go to www.taylorschulte.com/2\xa0 | Welcome to the very first episode! In this episode, I'll be discussing\xa0the what and the why behind the Experiments\xa0in Advisor Marketing podcast and setting the stage for future episodes.\xa0 I will also be sharing my top 5 tech and marketing tools that I use in my financial advisory practice.\xa0 For show notes, links, and resources, please visit www.taylorschulte.com/1 \xa0 \xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Most of my marketing experiments have failed. But, some have succeeded. From spending tens of thousands of dollars on print ads to hiring a Harvard data nerd to run Facebook campaigns, it’s quite possible I’ve experimented more in the last five years than the average advisor has in their entire career.

Is there really a place for machine learning and the world of computer vision (or machine vision, which we have conclusively determined is a synonym) in the real world of digital analytics? The short answer is the go-to answer of every analyst: it depends. On this episode, we sat down with Ali Vanderveld, Director of Data Science at ShopRunner, to chat about some real world applications of computer vision, as well as the many facets and considerations therein!

Pick a number. Now double it. Double it again. You’re getting close. A  recent study by Pixalate found that 19 percent of traffic from programmatic ads in the U.S. is fraudulent. David Raab from the CDP Institute found this number to be "optimistic." Ad fraud historian Dr. Augustine Fou, our guest on this show, has compelling evidence that the actual number could easily be north of 50 percent. Why? Who benefits? Why is it hard to tamp out? Is it illegal (it isn’t!)? We explore these topics and more on this episode!

The paid search manager needs to know whether brand keywords can be turned off without impacting revenue. The product team needs the latest A/B test results analyzed before they can start on their next sprint. The display media intern urgently needs your help figuring out why the campaign tracking parameters he added for the campaign that launches in two days are breaking the site (you’re pretty sure he’s confusing “&” and “?” again). And the team running the site redesign needs to know YESTERDAY what fields they need to include in the new headless CMS to support analytics. You’re pulled in a million directions, and every request is valid. How do you manage your world without losing your sanity? On this episode, analytics philosopher Astrid Illum from DFDS joins the gang to discuss those challenges.\xa0For complete show notes, including links to items mentioned in this episode and a transcript of the show, visit the show page. | Somewhere between "welcome to the company, now get to work!" and weeks of tedious orientation sessions (that, presumably, include a few hours with the legal department explaining that, should you be on a podcast, you need to include a disclaimer that the views expressed on the podcast are your own and not those of the company for which you now work), is a happy medium when it comes to onboarding an analyst. What is that happy medium, and how does one find it? It turns out the answer is that favorite of analyst phrases: "it depends." Unsatisfying? Perhaps. But, listeners who have been properly onboarded to this podcast know that “unsatisfying” is our bread and butter. So, in this episode, Moe and Michael share their thoughts and their emotional intelligence on the subject of analyst onboarding, while Tim works to make up for recent deficiencies in the show’s use of the “explicit” tag.

You can listen to this episode and find out what you learn. Or you can NOT listen to the show and NOT find out what you learn. You can\'t do both, which means that, one way or the other, you WILL be creating your very own counterfactual! That, dear listener, is a fundamental concept when it comes to causal inference. Smart analysts and data scientists the world over are excited about the subject, because it provides a means of thinking and application techniques for actually getting to causality. Bradley Fay from DraftKings is one of those smart data scientists, so the gang sat down with him to discuss the subject!

Well, we did! This episode of the show was recorded in front of a live audience (No laugh tracks! No canned applause!) at the Marketing Analytics Summit (MAS) in Las Vegas. Moe, Michael, and Tim used a “What Grinds Our Gears?” application to discuss a range of challenges and frustrations that analysts face. They (well, Moe and Tim, of course) disagreed on a few of them, but they occasionally even proposed some ways to address the challenges, too. To more effectively simulate the experience, we recommend pairing this episode with a nice Japanese whiskey, which is what the live audience did!

It just wiped out the human race! As machine learning and artificial intelligence are woven more and more into the fabric of our daily lives, we are increasingly seeing that decisions based purely on code require a lot of care to ensure that the code truly behaves as we would like it to. As one high profile example after another demonstrates, this is a tricky challenge.

On this episode, long-standing digital analytics maven June Dershewitz, Director of Analytics at Twitch, drops by the podcast\'s analytics kitchen to discuss the relative merits of building versus buying an analytics platform.

Find out what I learned in my first six years of business--and take comfort that you are not alone. | Welcome\xa0to Stories in Small Business, a podcast experience that puts to rest the idea that we all need to do business the same way and celebrates the unique stories and paths that we’re all on.\xa0 Hi, I’m Abby Herman and in the six years since I quit my day job, I’ve learned a thing or two about growing an online business. But it hasn’t been without some false starts and frustrations.\xa0 You see, my journey has been a unique one, with intentional slow growth and doing things my own way. But the gurus out there will have you believe that the only way to grow is by following their lead. If you’ve been able to grow a business that way, more power to you! Here on Stories in Small Business, we’re going to celebrate the very different stories each of us has.\xa0 Through solo episodes and guest interviews, we’re going to dive into how to use story--your story--to grow your business, overcome your own mindset challenges, foster business relationships and use content to gain more visibility online.\xa0 This podcast is here because there was a gap in what was out there and I wanted a place to truly honor the growing business owner who wants to do it her (or his) own way. Are you ready to discover YOUR story and how you can grow your business in your own way? Lace up those sneakers...buckle up your seatbelt...do what you do when you dive into a good podcast.

But there is a huge problem with the way that this concept is often taught to entrepreneurs. I want to offer an extremely simple and clarifying alternative -- so that you can actually get what the Ideal Customer Avatar is trying to get you: clarity about whom you serve. | It\'s all about freedom for you -- freedom to run your life on your terms, and do whatever it is that you want to do. Whether you want to be a more present parent, choose exactly when and where you\'re working, do some traveling, or you don\'t want anybody to tell you how much money you\'re allowed to make. I have been thinking lately that this is really my purpose: to empower you to make the choices that would give you more freedom in your life, whatever it looks like to you. And in this episode on the podcast, I want to share some ideas around the freedom to take things slowly and at your own pace, instead of pushing to get more and more done. | How can you know when an investment is right for you? Should you hire this coach, or take that course? How do figure out if it\'s the right time, or the right price? In this episode, you\'re going to learn exactly how to make business purchasing decisions with confidence. So the next time you see a program, course, or package from a coach or service provider (or even a job opportunity!) you\'ll know whether it\'s right for you now or not. We\'re asking the big questions here: How much should you spend? How do you know when it\'s time to spend it? Do you have to spend money to make money? How do you recognize the right opportunity? How will you measure the outcome of your investment? And much more! We will examine 5 pieces of the puzzle: The kinds of different investments you can make, the investment traps you should avoid, how to decide if it is the right time, person, or opportunity to invest, and how to determine your personal ROI. | Our final Summer Series episode is here with an all-time fan favorite!

By doing so we get more familiar with dealing with change, and we become better at it.On this episode Dustin Mathews explains which elements we need in order to go through the process of reinventing ourselves successfully. We also discussed how sending creative and thoughtful gifts to prospects and clients can make you stand out from everyone else.\xa0We also shared insights on:Why we need people who support and guide usHow stepping out of our comfort zone helps us growThe importance of embracing disruptions\xa0Reinventing ourselves and stepping out of our comfort zone is a part of life that we all need to go through. When we reinvent ourselves we need to be able to slow down and have a grounded person or team of people that can support and guide us. In order to grow we must embrace disruptions so that we can get better and better at dealing with this inevitable part of life.

How can we stay informed about market trends and best practices? What is currently impacting the luxury market? What can we do to manage and overcome market shifts? In this episode, Brad Inman explains where the luxury market is mid-2019, and how conferences and communities can help us through these shifts.\xa0\xa0Sellers are pricing too high, and buyers don’t want to make a move to lowball or bid. -Brad Inman\xa0Takeaways + Tactics\xa0We can better overcome and manage the challenges we face in a shifting luxury market by going to conferences and events about luxury market trends and best practices.We need to be upfront with our clients, especially when talking about listings. We have to inform them of all the implications that are going to affect the luxury market so we can stay ahead of the market and make more successful transactions.We stand to gain a community of support from people in our industry who are helping one another be successful by attending conferences like Luxury Connect.Use the discount code "LUXE" to get $250 off either of the next 2 Inman events: Luxury ConnectInman Connect Las Vegas\xa0We also shared insights on:Overcoming and managing luxury market shiftsHow to gain a community of support for successHow keeping clients informed helps our success\xa0The two biggest problems the luxury market has at the moment are taxes and sellers pricing too high. There’s no shortage of wealthy people, no shortage of successful realtors, and no shortage of referrals, but there is a hesitation on the buy side with the wealthy. By keeping our clients informed about the luxury market and its trends, we can help them sell and buy more effectively and successfully and in turn grow our business. When we invest in our career by attending industry conferences and events, we allow ourselves to stay up to date and educated about our market as well as build a supportive community of like-minded luxury professionals.\xa0Guest BioBrad Inman is the Owner and Chairman of the Board of Inman, a digital media company that reports on the real estate industry.

Should we be expecting that to change anytime soon? How can you continue to have a successful business if the market does become less favorable? On this episode, we’re joined by David Osborn, co-author of the New York Times Bestseller Wealth Can’t Wait, who shares his advice for thriving even through changing market conditions.\xa0\xa0Prepare for a dip. Nothing goes up forever, and we’ve been going up for a long time. -David Osborn\xa0Takeaways + Tactics Most luxury real estate in North America is in a “neutral” to “buyers” market.A drop in the market is inevitable, and it’s likely to take place relatively soon.A pro-tax, pro-business environment is very important for the luxury market to thrive.This episode began with David Osborn sharing his background and explaining his motivations for getting into real estate. We then discussed the amazing opportunities real estate offers, even when the market is unfavorable.We also shared insights on:Staying positive and avoiding discouragementWhy real estate will remain an important industry for years to comeHow real estate has created more millionaires than any other business, worldwide\xa0Financial experts in every industry agree that a market crash is inevitable. However, the great news for real estate professionals is that there will always be a reason for buying or selling property. Don’t allow yourself to be discouraged.\xa0GUEST BIODavid Osborn is an Operating Partner at Keller Williams.

How can agents make their property stand out from the rest? How can you use a property’s unique feature to make it memorable? What can we do to get a plain property noticed?In this episode, Melissa Leonard who listed the "50 Shades" home and Kristin Gyldenege who showcased "fitness models" in her listing pictures talk about their creative ways of getting their listing noticed and how it increased traffic to their properties.View an Article on the \'50 Shades\' House\xa0HEREView the Home for Sale Featuring Half-Dressed Fitness Models\xa0HERE\xa0\xa0Taking a risk is worthwhile if it gets someone to look at the house who would’ve never looked at it before. -Kristin Gyldenege\xa0Takeaways & TacticsIn order for our property to stand out from the competition, we have to make it memorable to local buyers, people in the industry, and even the news and media. If there is something unique about a property, use it to your advantage. Property launch is key. The first 7-14 days are crucial when you’re marketing a home. After that, there will naturally be less online inquiries and showings. From the start, you have to be priced correctly, and your photos have to be great. Most buyers cannot visualize, and people are lazy by nature. They want to be able to move into a house and not do anything except unpack. We need to be aware of this when we market and show properties to potential buyers.\xa0By stepping outside the box and getting creative with how we market our properties, we can significantly increase the traffic to them. Too many listings are done in the same old way with the same kinds of photos, and continuing to do so does not make your client’s listing stand out from the competition. By using elements that are unique to a property we can make a listing memorable not only to buyers, but to the media as well, and create a buzz around the property. It is our job to get as much traffic as possible to a listing, and we can do so by taking calculated risks and leveraging opportunities to our advantage.\xa0 | In a space where we are constantly surrounded by noise and options, agents need to be able to cut through that noise by providing high value service to clients. It is especially important to be able to do this in the luxury market. How can we continue to deliver a luxury experience? Where is the luxury market sitting today? What best practices should agents be using?In this episode, CEO of Engel & Volkers, Anthony Hitt, explains some of the best practices that top luxury listing agents are using to further their success in the climate of today’s industry.\xa0\xa0We’re providing a much higher level of service than we have probably ever provided as an industry, and we’re continuing to go in that direction. -Anthony Hitt\xa0Takeaways + TacticsClients who want a luxury experience sit at every price point, and we need to deliver that experience to make successful transactions.In an age where we’re constantly being inundated with the noise that elements like technology bring, we have to provide a higher and higher level of service. If we don’t, we won’t be amongst those who survive and thrive in our industry.In order to articulate your value proposition properly, you need to be using four best practices. These are attracting the best talent, constantly learning and training, collaborating with your network of fellow agents, and taking action on the data you have.\xa0We also shared insights on:Delivering a luxury experience at every price point Why high-level service is vital todayWhat we need to articulate our value proposition\xa0Agents in the luxury market have to continuously provide a higher level of service for their discerning clientele. Today, discerning clientele stretch across all price points, and we need to be able to deliver a luxury experience across the board. By attracting the best talent, consistently learning and training, collaborating with our network of fellow agents, and taking action on the data we have to drive successful sales, we can set ourselves up for success in our industry and really add value.\xa0Guest bioAnthony Hitt is the CEO of Engel & Volkers Americas since January 2014. Engel & Volkers is known as the leading destination for highly selective real estate service with unique, international accessibility and looks to Anthony’s leadership for its continued growth and success.

Someone you all know. One of the top names in the internet marketing space claim this as a statement of FACT from stage. In fact, the exact quote they used is this: “90% of your sales will come from your top 3 to 5 affiliates.”\xa0Let me be brutally clear here: This is nothing more than a cop out. An excuse to not work with smaller affiliates. An excuse to go out and get your 3 or 4 best buddies and a few other people and call it a day. Today, I share why this myth is flat out WRONG and how to develop an ARMY of loyal, dedicated affiliates of all sizes.

Another thing you can do with your IGTV videos, is send to people directly. So when you click into one of your videos, see the little paper airplane type icon, click that and direct message it.

Do I create a downsell/upsell offer?” My advice is - not immediately! It’s a mistake to shift your focus before you’re ready (but I’ll explain what to do instead + how to know when you *are* ready, inside this episode!). | If you’re an entrepreneur who hates feeling boxed in by calendars, schedules, systems, processes… you’re normal - but you really need those things to scale your business! Here’s how we make it happen at Hirsh Marketing. | Wondering how to make “realistic” ads projections for your company? Start with the numbers (your numbers!) - and move backwards.

And the best way to do great email is to know everything possible about your customers. Both those things give you a formula for growth. Customer Research + Amazing Email Onboarding = Better Upgrade/Retention rates. We talk to Val Geisler, founder of Fix My Churn on how we can all create better email campaigns to increase engagement with our products. We cover: - The three groups of customers you should interview each week, and how to create a habit around customer research - The framework Val uses to do those customer research, and what questions she asks to get insights that will result in better product engagement. - Two recommendations that any business can start doing immediately for better results. \xa0 Happy Growing! | How would you like to grow revenue for your business without needing more traffic, signups, or leads? It sounds pretty great, right? Well, one question to ask is: "Have I done enough conversion rate optimization for my website?." We talk to Talia Wolf, a renowned expert in the world of conversion rate optimization and founder of GetUpLift about the framework she uses to generate results time and time again. We cover: - How every project Talia takes on starts with research broken out into data and strategy. We cover how she does each of them. - The customer questions that\'ll get you the insights needed to improve your conversions. I\'ve already started to use them. - A framework Talia uses to identify the emotions of her buyers and how she uses that information to create better web experiences. Happy Growing | When we think about growth teams, we usually associate them with small, but fast-growing companies. But what about large enterprises. How would growth work for a company that is more than 108 years old, with over 350k employees? Well, we ask Jason Barbato, global growth lead at IBM on the show to find out. When Jason began growth at IBM three years ago, the team was four people. Today, the central growth team is thirty people, but many other product teams are now taking ownership of their growth framework. We talk to Jason about: - How the growth team IBM is organized into three pods, growth engine, nurture love, and experiments. - The evolution of growth at IBM and how one experiment completely changed the trajectory of growth at IBM. - Why Jason now runs an internal growth accelerator program at IBM and how it\'s helping to take product teams from zero experiments to over 500. \xa0 Happy Growing | You know one of the most difficult challenges we have in growing our businesses? It\'s doing the actual work! It\'s so easy to be distracted. We have so much technology that helps to enable it. But is it the fault of technology, or do we need to take more responsibility about how we use our time? We talk to best selling author Nir Eyal about his new upcoming book Indistractable, and how he wants to teach us all to be more productive. - We cover Nir\'s first booked, \'Hooked\' and how it\'s helped to democratize the secrets to creating habit-forming products. - Nir talks us through his four-step model to be indistratable and walk through an example of how to use it. - And, what can workers do to tune out all of the distractions we encounter working in an office, including Nir\'s favorite tech products to help us become indistractable. Happy Growing! Kieran | Growth through paid advertising is hard. Advertising channels are more saturated than ever. How do we cut through the noise? And, how do we develop paid advertising programs that deliver a fantastic return on profit? We talk to Shanik Patel, who runs consumer growth for Grammarly, the app that helps to make all of us look smarter. In this episode, we dive into how Grammarly has scaled quickly through paid advertising, with one of their biggest levers being video. We talk: - How a big part of Grammarly\'s success was because of first-mover advantage on Youtube. - The model Grammarly uses to measure the impact of paid marketing on brand awareness - What Shanik has learned about video marketing that you can use for your own company. Happy Growing | Today customers have hundreds if not thousands of options for products that solve very similar problems. How can you win in ultra-competitive markets? Well, investing in employer branding is something that can help. Hiring and retaining talent is a crucial part of building a successful company. That\'s why we caught up with Byran Adams, CEO, and founder of PH creative, an agency dedicated to helping large companies with their employer branding. We talk: - Why PH creative changed from generating demand for companies to helping them with their employer branding, and how that helped their agency to grow. - Three things employees look for in a company when deciding if they should work there. - Why Bryan doesn\'t shy away from working with any brands regardless of their culture. Happy Growing! |  Did you know that 60% of users who signup for a SaaS product only logs in once? That\'s crazy but speaks to how vital your onboarding experience is. That\'s why we decided to hang out with SaaS onboarding expert Aaran Krall and get his advice on how we can build a better experience for our users. Warning! The following episode is jam-packed with actionable tips from Aaron so there are a bunch of things you can implement straight away including:  How you can reengage users, who went through your free trial but never upgraded to your paid product. Why you can double your revenue through customer research, and how to conduct that research. And a fantastic example of the process Aaron used to increase a products activation rate from 20% to a whopping 80%.  Happy Growing!  |  Did you know that by 2020, near 40% of workers in the USA will work remotely for some amount of time? That\'s going to continue to disrupt the way work gets done. We talk to Dennis Lankes who is the co-founder of Proximity Space, an all in one software package to help make operating a coworking space easy. We cover:  Why companies who don\'t embrace remote work are facing a tidal wave of disruption. The advantages of remote work, including a couple you\'ve probably not thought of before. How Dennis and team stay close to their users when developing and iterating on their product.  Happy Growing \xa0  | Copywriting is a potential growth lever for many businesses. The reason being, so many of them under-invest in it. We talk to Neville Medhora who is the brains behind a lot of fantastic copy on the web and is known for his incredible work over at AppSumo and the KopyWriting Kourse. We catch up with Neville on: - His early entrepreneurial days and how they lead to him doubling down on copywriting. - Why great copywriting is more than text, and how Neville uses video and gifs to sell products better. - A tonne of great tactics on how to create copy that will sell, including how to use the review section of Amazon.com. \xa0 Happy Growing | Most founders start a company with a dream of turning their idea into a hugely successful and profitable business. Not many succeed, but for those who do, what\'s life like after reaching that dream? Justin Kan is someone who reached that dream. He founded Twitch.tv, which was sold to Amazon for $940 million, and is now founder/CEO of the fast-growing Atrium, which is aiming to create a better law firm for start-ups. We talk to Justin about: - How he has incorporated wellness into his everyday life, his daily routines, how he formed those habits, and how they\'re helping him to be a better founder. - Why some companies grow to become uber-successful like Twitch and others don\'t. - His reasons for starting Atrium and his goals to build a conscious company.

Getting more of your ideal customers/clients to follow you on social media can help - a lot.\xa0 But how do you increase your social media followers? Do you need to use different strategies for different social media platforms e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or Instagram? And how long does it take to grow your following on a particular platform?\xa0 That’s exactly what I cover in this podcast episode.\xa0 {Click on the player above to listen to the podcast episode and/or read on for a detailed overview. Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode.} 1.Share compelling content\xa0 Think about the people you follow on social media. The people whose posts always seem to pop up in your Facebook or Instagram feed. The accounts you actively check out to see what they've been posting lately.\xa0 You don’t follow them because they post boring updates about their products/services. You follow them because they inspire, entertain or even challenge your thinking. In other words, they make you FEEL something.\xa0 Now think about your own account. Are you posting compelling content that makes people feel something? Or are you putting out posts so you can tick social media off your to-do list. If you’re posting dull updates about your products/services, whimsical reflections about what you did at the weekend and/or 'must do' tips no one ever comments on, why would anyone want to follow you?\xa0 If you’re not getting much engagement on your content - amongst the followers you already have - that’s a sign you need to change something.\xa0 After all, if you can’t get the people who already know, like and trust you to comment on your content, why would anyone new want to follow you?\xa0 For an example of someone who is publishing excellent social media content that inspires people to follow her, check out\xa0 copywriter\xa0Jo Watson\xa0on LinkedIn. Want to get more engagement on your social media posts? Check out my\xa0social media engagement\xa0playbook. 2. Don’t follow the rules\xa0 If you’re trying to build your following on a particular platform, don’t feel like you have to do what everyone else is doing. In fact, sharing content that challenges the ‘norm’ can be a great way to stand out.\xa0 For example, Baggage Reclaim founder\xa0Natalie Lue’s\xa0following on Instagram only really took off when she stopped worrying about ‘posting pretty pictures’ and starting posting hard-hitting quotes from her blog and podcast. As Instagram is a visual platform, this was a brave move on Natalie’s part - but doing the opposite of what everyone else was doing - and doing it consistently - is what helped her reach her first 10k followers. 3. Spend more time on other peoples’ accounts than on your own What’s the first thing you do when someone new comments on one of your posts - a name you don’t recognise? You go and check out their profile of course. And that’s exactly what other people do when you comment on their content. They just can’t help but check you out.\xa0 This is why something as simple as making a list of your ideal customers/clients and committing to spending half an hour a day commenting on their content can be so effective.\xa0 Alternatively (or additionally) you can use the Gary Vee $1.80 strategy.\xa0  Step one. Find the 10 most relevant hashtags in your niche and follow those hashtags Step two. Reach out and comment on the top nine posts in each of the 10 hashtags Step three. Continue to like and comment on posts each day  The $1.80 strategy gets its name because you’re giving your two cents on nine posts for 10 hashtags every day. If you add that up, it equals $1.80 per day. 4. Use hashtags on all your posts As Chris Taylor explains in\xa0how to grow your Instagram following to 27k - fast,\xa0hashtags are like the index in the back of a non-fiction book. People search hashtags to find content on the most relevant topics to them - just like they would if they were looking something up in a non-fiction book. While expert opinion varies, current advice commonly suggests that using up to 30 hashtags on Instagram (which is the maximum), three on LinkedIn, two on Facebook and two on Twitter is the optimum number.\xa0 You could even create your own hashtag and awareness day like dog photographer Kerry Jordan did. This helped her\xa0go viral on Twitter. 5. Cross-promotion\xa0 Running joint competitions can be a great way to get more followers. For example, dog photographer Kerry Jordan hosted a joint competition with\xa0Quirky Campers\xa0founder Lyndsey Berresford and added 1.5.k new email subscribers, along with tons of new social media followers, to her audience.\xa0 6. Collaboration\xa0 Creating content for or collaborating with other business owners e.g. guest blogging, podcast interviews, Facebook Lives, Instagram takeoevers can be a great way of getting in front of other peoples’ audiences. This will help you grow your social media following. Be smart about who you collaborate with though. It’s best to target people with a similar or slightly larger audience than your own - ideally those who have a similar audience to you, but serve them in a different way. That way, there won’t be a conflict of interest. If you do want to target the big hitters in your niche, think carefully about how you can add value to them. If they’ve already built a large online audience, they probably don’t need to get in front of your audience, so why would they want to collaborate with you? So before you ask, think carefully about what’s in it for them. If your ‘pitch’ is all about you - and what you hope to gain from the collaboration - they’re far less likely to say ‘yes. 7.Secure press coverage Getting press coverage can be a great way to increase your online following. For example, Baggage Reclaim founder Natalie Lue gained 2k followers after she was featured in Cosmopolitan magazine recently. However, stories like this tend to be the exception rather than the rule. While it’s rare to get thousands of followers from a single magazine article or radio/TV appearance, over time, regular press coverage will help you grow your following. Find out:\xa0how to\xa0get press coverage for your business.\xa0 8.Work with bloggers/influencers Asking bloggers/influencers to promote your products/services can be a great way to grow your following. Ideally they need to have a larger audience than your own. But they don't need to have a massive audience for this to be effective. This can either be done on a paid basis or in exchange for free products/services. Find out more about\xa0working with bloggers/influencers. 9. Speak at live events Every time you stand up and speak in a room of your ideal customers/clients, you will attract new social media followers. So if you don't mind public speaking, why not give it a go? Find out\xa0how to land more speaking opportunities. 10. Post the links to your social media channels everywhere The more places you post the link to your social media profiles, the easier it will be for people to follow you. So make sure they’re on your email signature, website, any landing pages you create...and basically anywhere you show up online.

More social media followers, more website visitors and more email subscribers. So when you do have something to sell you have an 'audience' of people who already know, like and trust you - which means they're far more likely to buy. But building an engaged audience takes time, With that in mind, here's the answers to the most common questions I get on asked on building an online audience.\xa0 {Click on the player above to listen to the podcast episode and/or read on for a detailed overview. Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode.} 1.What exactly is an online audience?\xa0 Your ‘audience’ is the people who engage with your online content e.g. social media, blog/vlog/podcast, email marketing. 2. Why do I need to build an online audience?\xa0 You don’t NEED to have an online audience. You can choose to market your business completely offline if you wish. But if you want to to do business online, you do need an online audience - otherwise who are you going to sell your products/services to?\xa0 3. When's the best time to start building myonline audience? If you want to sell online, the ideal time to start building your audience is way before your product/service goes on sale. That way, you'll already have built relationships with prospective customers/clients - which means you're far more likely to make sales. 4. What size does your online audience need to be? This depends on your sales goals. The average conversion rate for online sales is 1-2%. Which means for every 100 people on your email list, only a small number will actually buy from you. If you’re a coach selling 1-2-1 coaching and need 20 clients a year, you may only need a thousand or so on your email list. If you sell lower-priced products or online courses/memberships you’ll almost certainly need to shoot for 10k or beyond. So whatever it is you’re selling…you almost certainly need a much bigger audience than you think. To find out what size your audience needs to be right now, check out my audience calculator \xa0\xa0 5. What is the best way to measure your audience numbers? Some people think your audience is the number of social media followers, readers of your blog or listeners to your podcast. But while you may make the odd sale on social media - or from your blog/podcast/Youtube channel - the majority of sales will happen in your inbox. PLUS it’s almost impossible to reliably predict and track income from sales on social media.\xa0 This is why building your email list is the single most important thing you can do in your business. Which means the number of engaged email subscribers you have on your list is the most reliable measure of audience size.\xa0\xa0 In order to build your email list, you need an audience of people who engage with your content (otherwise how are you going to get people to join your email list?). This is why I recommend starting by building your audience on social media, then moving on to content (e.g.blog, podcast./Youtube) before tackling email marketing. And that’s exactly what I cover in my Build Your Online Audience Programme.\xa0 6. How do I find out where my ideal audience is hanging out online? (so I can find more people like them)\xa0 \xa0Just ask them. Find 10 of your ideal clients/customers and ask them where they spend time online. Then start sharing some content on that platform and test and tweak accordingly (see the next question).\xa0 7. How do I find out what kind of content my audience would like me to share?\xa0 Just ask them. Find 10 of your ideal clients/customers and ask them what they would like to hear about. But don’t just leave it at that. People sometimes tell you what they think you want to hear. Which means you’ll need to test and tweak different types of content until you figure out what works best (i.e. what gets the most engagement). And do remember that it’s not about numbers of followers/likes. Your best measure of success is comments and conversations.\xa0 Bonus tip: Making a list of your most frequently asked questions is an easy way to generate content ideas for your audience.\xa0 This can be turned into ten blog posts/podcast episodes/Youtube videos and/or social media posts. Also look at your competitors - those who are have a bigger audience than you.\xa0 What the more you understand about the type of content that captures your ideal clients’ attention, the better placed you’ll be to create your own engaging content.\xa0 8. I want to launch an online course/membership programme or a live event. Do I need to build my audience before I launch?\xa0 Ideally yes. Otherwise who are you going to sell to? People often think they can use cold ads. But ask yourself this: when’s the last time you invested in an online course/membership or live event after seeing an ad? While there are always exceptions, most of us need to get to know, like and trust someone before we hand over our hard-earned cash. Which is why it’s generally best to start building your audience organically before you start using advertising. If you have the budget to hire a strategist and/or a testing budget for ads, a Facebook ad campaign can work, but you’ll still need to ‘warm up’ your audience before they’ll buy from you with content.\xa0 Find out:  how to build an audience for an online course/membership.\xa0 9. Do I need to be active on every social media platform to make online sales?\xa0 While it’s tempting to think you need to be active on every single platform, it’s much better to start with one or two. Once you’ve mastered those, and understand what works, you can replicate your strategy on other platforms. Spread yourself too thin, and could wind up being ineffective on multiple social media platforms (and wasting time and money in the process).

You just need to decide on the following\xa0  How regularly you are going to post on your Facebook page\xa0 What days and times you are going to post What kind of content you are going to share\xa0  {Click on the player above to listen to the podcast episode and/or read on for a detailed overview. Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode.} Remember that creating a strategy is just the first step. You’ll need to post consistently. And you’ll need to experiment - tweaking and testing your content to improve your results. You may also wish to start experimenting with other things e.g. best days and times to post your content and tweak accordingly.\xa0 Do this one thing Write down the answers to the following questions (what gets written down gets done).  How regularly are you going to post on your Facebook page\xa0 (I’d recommend at least 3-5 times a week) What days and times are you going to post?

However there is an art to getting engagement on this kind of content and in this podcast episode I’ll show you how. {Click on the player above to listen to the podcast episode and/or read on for a detailed overview. Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode.} People also love to share their experiences/advice, which is why more vulnerable, personal content works well. This is why posts on my training for the London Marathon (including injuries and setbacks) tend to get more engagement than any of my business posts. When you share personal content, over time, you build up a narrative and take people on a journey with you - something that\xa0 can be very powerful. \xa0  \xa0 Remember this does not mean you have to share your deepest, darkest secrets - one of the most popular ‘I know how that feels’ posts I created was round-up of my most embarrassing headshots (we all know how it feels to look at an embarrassing old photo of ourselves).\xa0 But people like to do business with people. If you’re willing to share a little of the person behind the business you’ll get much better engagement on your page. And when people feel connected to you through a shared experience - or just being able to relate to your feelings - they’re far more likely to want to be your customer.\xa0\xa0 Do this one thing Create a short ‘I know how that feels’ style Facebook post which encourages people to share their thoughts/experiences.\xa0 Ideally, choose a topic you can people will actually care about and make it easy for people to respond (as shown in the example above).\xa0 Many of the engagement strategies I share above (e.g. asking questions, giving a narrow range of choices) can work for this type of post, but if your post is powerful enough, you may not need to use them at all. Experiment and see what works.\xa0 Tip:Photographs, video and images are all great for engagement.\xa0 Next, chivvy up your Facebook Engagement Tribe and get them commenting on your post. While no one truly knows how the algorithm works, many believe that comments made in the first 15 minutes of posting have the biggest impact (and that’s certainly been my experience) so get to work!\xa0 Finally, share your post in the\xa0Facebook group\xa0to get feedback from myself and others in the group (we have a dedicated thread for each day).

People love to share their ideas, so content that asks people to state their preferences generally works a treat.\xa0 This can be anything from asking people which version of your new logo they prefer, to whether you should stock the blue or red handbag in your Etsy shop to whether they like to have an iron provided when they stay in a holiday cottage. I generally refer to this as ‘I know about this’ content.\xa0 This is one of four types of content that generate lots of engagement.\xa0 \xa0  I need to know this I know about that\xa0 This is what I think\xa0 I know how that feels\xa0  \xa0 However there is an art to getting engagement on this kind of content and in this podcast episode I’ll show you how. \xa0 {Click on the player above to listen to the podcast episode and/or read on for a detailed overview. Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode.} \xa0 If you want people to respond to ‘I know about this’ posts, you have to give them clear choices\xa0 e.g. A, B, C or D, yes/no, agree/disagree - or even ask them to respond with emojis.I generally refer to these as short/two tap answer posts.\xa0 \xa0 Here is an example of a post I shared which attracted 115 comments (can’t see the image, click here). All respondents had to do was state whether they were interested in getting a copy of my social media engagement playbook when it was ready (with a ‘Y’ or ‘N’).\xa0  \xa0In this example, I asked for feedback on the artwork for an upcoming masterclass (which was available for members to buy) stating a preference of 1, 2, 3 or 4.\xa0 \xa0  \xa0 Not only do short/two tap answer posts make it super quick for people to engage, they don’t have to think too hard about what to say - which means they’re far more likely to respond. Occasionally someone warns me that the Facebook/LinkedIn algorithm penalises content like this i.e. content that encourages short/two tap answers. I have no idea if this is true, but I actually think it’s pretty irrelevant. Once someone has responded to you, you can - and should - go back and ask them an additional question/encourage them to give you more information e.g ‘Interesting…why does that one appeal the most (if you don’t mind me asking’). So it’s easy to turn a short/two tap answer posts into a conversation. And conversations are exactly what you should be aiming for with all your social media content.\xa0 I wouldn’t advise you to use short/two tap answer postsall the time -it’s definitely important to vary your content - but they can be a great tool to encourage engagement, particularly when you’re trying to boost the engagement in your page.\xa0 \xa0 Do this one thing \xa0 Create a short ‘I know about this’ style Facebook post where you share a useful piece of content which encourages people to share their opinion on something. \xa0 Next, chivvy up your Facebook Engagement Tribe and get them commenting on your post.

One really easy way to create curiosity is to ask a question that relates to the content you want to share. So, for example, I published a really podcast episode entitled 15 post ideas for your Facebook group. Although this is a useful episode, when I just post a link to the episode I don’t get very much engagement. If I ask a question that relates to the subject of the podcast episode, I get far more engagement. I can still share the link to the episodes in the comments. Other ideas for generating curiosity.\xa0  Share a short clip from your podcast/vlog (rather than the whole episode) and ask people to predict what happens next\xa0 Share a divisive quote from your blog post and ask people if they agree/disagree Share a blooper from your vlog Share a still/photograph and invite people to write a caption\xa0 Summarise a piece of industry news and ask people if they agree/disagree  \xa0 Do this one thing \xa0 Create a short ‘I need to know this’ style Facebook post where you share a useful piece of content that helps solve a problem for your audience (remember that entertaining people can be solving a problem).

Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode} Having tested hundreds of different types of content - on both my own account and my clients’ I’ve noticed there are four types of post that generally get more engagement.  I need to know this I know about that\xa0 This is what I think\xa0 I know how that feels\xa0  You may have spotted already that there’s a common theme: relatability. If you want people to engage with your content, it needs to be relatable - something that either solves a problem for them, they have experience of and/or an opinion on.\xa0 Let me break that down for you.\xa0 ‘I need to know this’ content\xa0 Creating content that solves a problem for people is a great way to get engagement. This can be anything from a vlog on how to pitch yourself as a podcast guest (link to blog post), an important piece of industry news (link to article on Twitter change of terms) to an amusing cat video (link to amusing cat video) (making people laugh is definitely solving a problem). However there is an art to getting engagement on this kind of content, which I’ll share with you tomorrow.\xa0 ‘I know about that’ content People love to share their ideas, so content that asks people to state their opinions/preferences, generally works a treat.\xa0 This can be anything from asking people whether you should stock the handbag in blue or read to whether they like to have an iron in a holiday cottage to what they think of new laws that affect your industry.\xa0 In the example below, I asked my audience which cover they preferred for my media diary: \xa0 N.B. You do need to be specific to get engagement on this kind of content and I’ll show you how to do that on Day 4 of the challenge.\xa0 ‘This is what I think’ content People love to share their opinions - particularly on topics that are divisive. This is why posts like this one on whether you should put toddlers on reins\xa0 tend to perform better than other posts.\xa0 \xa0‘I know how that feels’ content People also love to share their experiences/advice, which is why more vulnerable, personal content works well. This post on picking up an injury during my London Marathon got more engagement than any of my business posts (as did many of my other marathon related posts).\xa0 \xa0 It’s worth remembering that Facebook is, primarily,\xa0 a ‘friends and family’ platform - which is why personal posts - of the kind you might post on your own Facebook wall - often do better on your Facebook well than business related posts. This is not to say you need to share your deepest, darkest secrets, but people like to do business with people. If you’re willing to share a little of the person behind the business you’ll get much better engagement on your page.\xa0 Do this one thing Brainstorm at least five ideas for each type of content.\xa0  I need to know this I know about that\xa0 This is what I think\xa0 I know how that feels\xa0  Be brave and share them in our Facebook group\xa0\xa0so you can get feedback from myself and other members of the group\xa0 (we have a dedicated thread for your ideas) Podcast shownotes  How to take part in the challenge when it has finished (01:05) The four types of posts that will generate Facebook page engagement (2:55) How to create content for your Facebook page that adds value or solves a problem for your clients or customers (3:11) How to ask people’s opinions to generate content and engagement (4:34) How to create content by getting people’s opinions (especially if they disagree) (5:33) How sharing relatable personal stories will increase engagement on your Facebook page (6:08) Why you’ll get better engagement if your content is personally relatable rather than just about your business (06:58) What you need to do for the challenge for this podcast (08:08)  Resources Take part in my 7 day Facebook challenge here Join the Facebook Challenge group\xa0 [365] Day 1\xa0Why your Facebook page isn’t getting enough engagement (and what to do about it)(podcast) [329]\xa0What’s working on Facebook right now with Liz Melville\xa0(podcast) [334]\xa0How to build a large audience without paid advertising with Callie Willows\xa0(podcast) [352] How to sell in a Facebook Group without annoying your members(podcast) [357] How to transform your Facebook group from ghost town to garden party(podcast) [358]13 Ideas for engaging social media posts(podcast) [361 15 post ideas for your Facebook group(podcast) Build Your Audience Programme Buy your ticket for Build Your Audience Live Order your 2019 Media Diary Rev.com* Kapwing Social Media Video Engagement Playbook Social Media Engagement Playbook LinkedIn Content Strategy Playbook Connect with me on\xa0Twitter,\xa0Instagram,\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0LinkedIn \xa0 | Are you frustrated by the lack of engagement with your Facebook page?\xa0 You’re posting regularly but your reach is poor. Your posts are only attracting a handful of likes and comments - leaving you wondering if it’s worth having a page at all.\xa0 If this sounds like you, the first thing you need to know is that it’s nothing to do with the Facebook algorithm and everything to do with the kind of content you’re sharing. Which means there is a lot you can do to improve your engagement (without spending a penny on advertising).\xa0 If this sounds familiar, you’ll love my seven episode podcast series on how to improve your Facebook page engagement. {Click on the player above to listen to the podcast episode and/or read on for a detailed overview. Scroll down to the bottom to read the show notes including all the links mentioned in this episode} This episode is part of a seven episode challenge to help you improve your Facebook page engagement. You can read more about the challenge here.\xa0 Why your Facebook page isn’t getting enough engagement (and what to do about it) If you’re not getting engagement on your Facebook page, it’s easy to blame the algorithm (i.e. the complicated - and super top secret - mathematical equation Facebook uses to determine how many people your content is shown to).\xa0 The truth is, if you’re engagement stinks, it’s nothing to do with the Facebook algorithm and everything to do with the kind of content you’re sharing (plus how you’re sharing it).\xa0 The good news is, there is a LOT you can do to improve your Facebook page engagement (without spending a penny on advertising).\xa0 But the first thing you need to know is that posting great content is not enough. You also need to ‘train’ the Facebook algorithm to recognise your content as important so it will show it to more people. How do you do that? By getting engagement on your posts in the form of likes and comments.\xa0 If you’re currently struggling to attract likes and comments, this might seem like a ‘chicken and egg’ situation. If you not many people are commenting on your content, others are likely to want to comment either. But the answer is surprisingly simple; instead of sitting back and hoping someone will comment on your content...you need to go out and find people to comment on your content.\xa0 Do this one thing\xa0 Make a list of 15 people\xa0 you can ask to comment on your content for the duration of the challenge (and beyond if you can). This is your Facebook Engagement Tribe.\xa0 Ideally these will be your ideal customers, but if this is not possible, just do what you can to get some engagement going on your page. You can even get together with a group of fellow business owners and comment on each others’ posts - that way everyone benefits.\xa0 It may take a while for Facebook to catch on that your posts are valuable and start showing them to more people - which is why it’s important to be patient. Remember, also, that it’s not just about the algorithm. Your Facebook page is your shop window; if people look you up online and see you’re effectively broadcasting to an audience of none, they will assume (rightly or wrongly) your business is not successful. If they see engagement - in the form of likes and comments (even if they do initially come from your best friend!) they’re much more likely to take you seriously.

Joe is a leading authority on college planning resources and late-stage college funding. He frequently speaks to organizations such as the FPA, NAPFA, ACP and XY Planning Network, as well as parent groups across the country.In this conversation, we discuss Joe’s College Pre-Approval™ system, a revolutionary approach to providing expert college planning advice in a client-centric and comprehensive way. With Capstone College Partners (a resource for financial advisors who want to learn more about helping families with college planning) and College Aid Pro™, Joe is on a mission to educate and empower other financial advisors to raise the bar in college funding advice — and to help end the student loan crisis, one family at a time.

What hurdles have kept you from adding this service in your practice?\xa0 We hope you will find some practical ideas to try — and feel more comfortable with offering college planning resources and advice to your clients in the future.

What about if you\'re presenting on topics that are more data-driven or research-based? You should definitely include stories as well. My guest in this episode is Karen Corbin, PhD, RD, who\'s a scientist herself and has a company with a great name called Geeks That Speak® to inspire and empower scientists to become powerful storytellers. Incorporating storytelling into their presentations is crucial, whether they’re presenting at conferences to peers or to the general public.\xa0 Stories can help spark curiosity, give context to facts and data, and make the information being presented more memorable. You don’t have to be a scientist to learn a lot in this episode. What Karen and I talk about applies to any topic. This episode is part of our Storytelling series, episodes 137-140. \xa0 About My Guest: Karen D. Corbin, PhD, RD is the Owner and Chief Geek of Geeks That Speak® and an Investigator at the AdventHealth Orlando Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes. She is an expert in human nutrition and metabolism. Her scientific career is devoted to finding new approaches to prevent and treat diseases like diabetes and fatty liver disease. She is also an expert is scientific storytelling. After spending years traversing the worlds of healthcare and science, she realized that a fundamental gap exists for translating ideas into solutions: the common inability of scientists and other “geeks” to deliver information in a way that is impactful, relevant and inspires action. This led Dr. Corbin to an important conviction: by helping scientists translate complex scientific information in a way that is accessible to a broad range of audiences, she could help advance the innovation that will solve many of society’s most pressing problems So, she created the movement “Geeks That Speak®” to inspire and empower scientists to become powerful storytellers.\xa0 \xa0 About Us: The Speaking Your Brand podcast is hosted by Carol Cox.

Having a feedback form that the audience fills out is one of the best ways to generate leads, especially if you don’t feel comfortable making a hard sales pitch in your presentation or if the place you’re speaking at forbids “selling from the stage.” Since I first started talking about the feedback form on this podcast in 2017, I get asked regularly which episode someone can listen to specifically about it. I haven’t had one specific episode - until now. In this episode, I describe what the feedback form is, what’s included on it, and how to use it. And then you’ll hear from six women in the Speaking Your Brand community who have used the feedback form at their presentations and the results they’ve received. Be sure to listen until the end - I have a bonus tip that you won’t want to miss. This episode is part of our Money series, episodes 132-136.

For many companies, the gender pay gap is one of those issues that they want to be seen as making progress on, yet having real conversations around it, that lead to action, can be challenging. This is the situation that my guest, Michelle Gyimah, finds herself in regularly. Michelle lives in the U.K. and works with companies to improve the pay and leadership gap between men and women. Michelle faced this issue herself when she went back to work after having children and what she found was frustrating: resistance by companies to part-time and remote work for women at her skill level who should be paid equitably but aren’t. In this episode, Michelle and I talk about:  The gender pay gap is more than money The way the world of work is structured is putting up barriers Michelle’s personal story How Michelle gets people at all levels of a company to open up and have these difficult conversations about the gender pay and leadership gap The solutions are found when you come to the table The kind of company culture that’s open to this The workshop activities Michelle uses Bringing people’s objections out into the open (this is for any topic you speak on) Women speakers not getting paid, especially ones like Michelle who speak on the gender pay gap {rant}  \xa0 This episode is part of our Money series, episodes 132-136.

However, many conferences and groups explicitly forbid “selling from the stage.” I’ve never liked that phrase because it conjures up images of a pitchman on stage hawking their wares like on an infomercial. It’s a turn off to the audience and for many of us speakers it feels awkward and inauthentic. But, there IS a way to sell who you are and what you do in your presentations authentically and by providing value to your audience. My guest is Nikki Rausch, who is my sales coach and who last appeared on the podcast in episode 34 in September 2017.

As I watched, I kept making connections between the musical story and copywriting. I thought to myself, who is the Quincy Jones of copywriting? The first person that came to mind was The Word\'s Greatest Copywriting Coach, David Garfinkel. David has agreed to be a guest on this week\'s episode of the show to discuss why I call him the Quincy Jones of Copywriting.\xa0 | What do Pablo Picasso, J.S. Bach, and Charles Dickens all have in common? They were prolific creators, each in their own rite and own art form. Those who haven’t dedicated themselves to a lifetime of artistic creation often have a false and even “romantic” image of an artist, taking their time creating one or two masterpieces every 10 years or so, and then sitting back and relaxing the rest of the time. This couldn’t be farther from the truth, and it’s one of the most important lessons online business owners and content creators need to learn. | One of my favorite bands is the progressive rock group Pink Floyd. I’ve been listening to their fantastic 1973 album The Dark Side Of The Moon a lot lately. It’s one of those albums for the ages. And the album, as an art form, is totally lost nowadays. We’ve gone back to the 50s in a way. We’ve returned to the age of the “Single.” But instead of 45 rpm records, we have one-off iTunes downloads. My favorite song on Dark Side Of The Moon is the first song on the B-side (for those of you who remember what a record is… 🙂 ). It’s called “Money,” which seems an appropriate song to learn from when it comes to selling and advertising. | I like to think about killer pieces of sales copy like they’re hit songs. The truth is, whenever Beyoncé or the Beatles or the Backstreet Boys write a song, they’re trying to sell you on something. They’re selling you on their sound, their ideas, their point of view, their lifestyle, and of course, they’re selling you on buying tickets the next time they come to town. Let’s take the simple path to organizing your sales message like a hit song so you can start singing your customer’s tune with stunning clarity and effectiveness. | Writing effective email copy has its challenges. One of them is getting the order of things right. There’s a psychology to the correct order of a sales email and messing it up can quickly result in no sales whatsoever. If you want a quick and easy to remember way to jumpstart your email copy to “Rockstar” status, this report is for you. Here’s the deal… We’re going to use acronym R.O.C.K.S.T.A.R. to make sure you’re handling the emotional content of your copy. This applies to emails, sales pages, Facebook Ads, landing pages, and any other type of copy you write. But we’ll focus mainly on email in this training. | Your business is just like a blockbuster film.\xa0BUT… Without this crucial element, even Stephen Spielberg’s films would fall on deaf ears and hard hearts. \xa0 When it comes to your business, YOU, the business owner, the entrepreneur, the risk-taker… YOU are Stephen Spielberg.\xa0You’re the director. The mastermind. The wizard behind the curtain. \xa0 But no matter how great the cinematography, the actors, or the location…\xa0Your film has ZERO chance of triggering your audience’s emotions without a well-crafted soundtrack.\xa0 \xa0 It’s the music of a film that tells the audience how to feel.\xa0It tells them what’s going on in the main character’s mind and heart. The music warns the audience of approaching danger. It tells you when to laugh. It tells you when to cry. \xa0 But when it comes to your business, what’s the soundtrack? Where’s the music?\xa0How will your audience know, deep down, that you can solve their problems, soothe their pain, and help them find their Never Neverland once and for all? \xa0 That’s the question we will answer today on Episode #1 of The Music of Copywriting Podcast… “The Soundtrack of Your Business”', 'chan_desc': 'The Music of Copywriting Podcast is the go-to copywriting resource for "take action" entrepreneurs.

It's a big question, and a big challenge - but one that WPP's Perry Nightingale is keen to answer (with a little help from Oxford University and the Future of Marketing Initiative). In the second part of Andrew and Jane's conversation with Perry, we hear about Perry's creativity school, infusing creativity into an organisation, what has changed in the last 10 years (and what might happen next), along with Perry's views on how advertising agencies can find, encourage, retain and empower creative people. | Kirk McDonald, CMO of advertising and analytics company Xandr, talks to Jane Ostler in Cannes about his views on the digital landscape – how digital advertising is analogous to the food supply chain, why Xandr’s mission is to ‘make advertising matter’, and how a great user experience can go hand in hand with effectiveness for marketers and efficiency for publishers. Kirk believes we can use technology in smart ways to deliver highly personalised ads, but he argues that the whole industry should endeavour to make things simpler, reduce the jargon, and acknowledge that data isn’t everything. Read the latest relevance report from Xandr and Kantar.\xa0 | There is a lot of disruption in the world of ‘mobility’ – but what does that actually mean? What does it take to launch a ‘mobility’ product? How will marketing teams encourage consumers to adopt new platforms and travel methods, including autonomous vehicles? And what do these innovations mean for traditional car and transport brands, other types of businesses, and society at large? Mat Heinl, CEO of Moving Brands, talks cars, sandwiches, horses and ice cream vans with Andrew and Jane. | There is a lot people don’t know about eBay, says Gareth Jones. In order to bust some of those myths – around things like delivery and newness – the online shopping platform is spending more and more on traditional media channels like radio and TV. Telling these stories and reaching a wider audience is helping them achieve longer term success, he explains, and complements their digital advertising approach nicely. So how does it work? How can “digital” principles be applied to things like radio and TV ads? How is it all measured? And what’s next for eBay? | Technology and data now sit at the heart of marketing, and AI has quietly embedded itself in our culture. But how can we use it to produce adverts that make an impact? Why is human creativity still important? And what are the big questions we need to be asking about evolving technology... not just from a business perspective, but for society as a whole? In part one of a two-part discussion, Perry Nightingale shares his wisdom with Professor Andrew Stephen and Jane Bloomfield. | If enjoying food makes us choose to consume more of it, then learning how to trigger greater levels of enjoyment could be a valuable tool in a brand’s repertoire. How can you encourage consumers to buy, consume and enjoy your products? What if they really think they won’t like the flavour combination? And why do choices around packaging – size, wording and related ‘content’ – matter? Andrew and Tara talk to an expert, Dr Cammy Crolic, to find out. | How do you bridge the gap between creative and media teams to deliver more effective campaigns? How do you encourage users to actually watch a video ad on their mobile device? And how do you achieve mass reach without losing personalised, contextual relevance? These are just some of the questions Jane and Felipe discuss with Grant Gudgel, the head of Teads Studio in North America. They talk AR, AI, chatbots, interactive creative, user friendliness and the sound on/sound off debate, to understand how the industry at large can innovate to make online advertising better. | What makes Pinterest different to other platforms? Jon Kaplan, Global Head of Partnerships, explains to Jane and Felipe how users (or Pinners) actually appreciate content from brands on this channel, as they find\xa0inspiration for everyday products, seasonal ideas, or major life moments such as planning a wedding, a new baby, or house renovations. Jon tells us what innovations are new and coming soon, why these changes make Pinterest an even better place to advertise, and how marketers can make the most of the platform. Recorded live in Cannes in June 2019.\xa0 | Nick Lawson, CEO EMEA and client practice lead at MediaCom, spoke to us in Cannes about the changing world of the media agency, how the industry has evolved, why clients look to media agencies for growth solutions… and what the future might look like. Will technology replace people, or just boring tasks? What skills do agencies need? What role can media agencies play? And why has Nick stayed at the same company for 28 years? | The Culture Next global trends report from Spotify explains how younger audiences are changing – experiencing screen exhaustion and re-evaluating their relationship with digital media, they are moving to new channels and expecting new, personalised but connected experiences. With these trends and the ubiquity and innovation in audio, says Danielle Lee (Global Vice President, Partner Solutions at Spotify), it is a perfect time for agencies and brands to consider getting creative on platforms like Spotify.

It starts when you are very young in a management position with the basics of making sure you are on time, dressed appropriately and care about doing a good job. As you get more experienced it gets more complex. You turn from looking out for yourself to developing and looking out for those that work for you. It’s much more than not backstabbing, not using bad language or not lying, all things we associate with character. It boils down to doing the right thing for those around you no matter how tough it may be.Competence:Being competent in your job is vital. So many managers equate competence in knowing more than everyone. They think it is about being the smartest person in the room; in fact, it’s probably more the opposite of that.In its truest form Competence is the ability to make more good decisions than bad ones.It’s putting in the time and effort, listening to your team, taking suggestions and putting together the best answer to a solution. When I first started my Type A personality felt threatened when someone else had an idea no matter how good it was! I had a lot to learn.Motivation:This is VITAL. Now I understand it is not everyone’s personality to rah rah and high five people. That’s ok. All this really means is that you need to be POSITIVE in dealing with people. You need to be more of a positive influence than a negative one.This does not mean that if you are taking some kind of corrective action (I hate that term by the way) that you need to have two nice things for every “negative” thing you say to them. That ridiculous in my mind, every situation is different and I’m not going to make up nice things to say if they are not warranted at that time. I believe that weakens your messageWhat I am saying is that if you asked yourself :Would my employees truly think I am a positive person, one that motivates more than demeans, one that lifts a room more then makes people uncomfortable? | Wanted to make a special announcement to make the one-year birthday of our call center ops book "Advice from a Call Center Geek" that started this whole thing off!We have just completed our new version on the book "MORE Advice from a Call Center Geek" and will be publishing it on Amazon on Tuesday, Aug 13, 2019.Head over to moregeek.callcentergeek.com to sign up to receive the link to the FREE digital version of the book.\xa0 We will also be selling the paperback at the lowest rate Amazon will let us.\xa0 Should be 3-4 dollars tops.Again head over to moregeek.callcentergeek.com so you don\'t miss out on the free version! | Its time to really look at implementing video and co-browsing into your customer support and sales.\xa0 In this episode, we take a look at the reasons why you should be thinking about video in your 2020 planning.\xa0 UNIQUE EXPERIENCEINCREASING THE URGE TO BUYTECHNOLOGY IS HERECOST FOR VIDEO CUSTOMER SERVICEGROUP SERVICE/FUN!ENGAGEMENT WITH VIDEOSALESAUGMENTED REALITY', 'chan_desc': 'Advice from a Call Center Geek is a weekly podcast with a focus on all things call center and contact center.

You’ve put a lot of work into crafting a bio that describes you to a stranger online but then when we are at a networking event or better yet, at the coffee shop and bump into someone who asks the question “what do you do?” we don’t give it much thought. That’s what we’re chatting about today - how to use your bio to help you introduce yourself in any situation that will help the person know exactly what you do. Because when they know this, they can know they want to work with you, or refer you to others. \xa0 www.marketingyogawithconfidence.com/podcast\xa0 | I interviewed copywriter (and yoga teacher), Allison Gower and it\'s packed with tips! She speaks our language and even better, she breaks copywriting down to a simple formula, with a cool name too!

But I have a few tips that can help you craft one that will draw in your dream students based on your words. And if you’re not at the place where you know who your dream student is, I’ve got you covered too! \xa0 Yoga studio bios are all over the map in terms of how they’re written so the absolute best advice I can give you is to write the bio according to how that studio has other bios written. Because if you don’t and the studio is concerned about consistency, you run the risk of them changing your bio to fit their style.\xa0 \xa0 And the second best advice I can give you is to write one bio and then edit based on the needs of the studio. And save them all! I would love for you to have one LONG list of bios that you can choose from at any point. Here’s my step by step process for yoga studio bio writing:\xa0 Step 1: Write your bio in first person for your website and how you would talk about yourself. “I am a yoga teacher…” This is your 4 to 5 sentence overview of what you do.\xa0 In this bio you want to answer a few questions:\xa0  What do you want to be known for?\xa0 Who do you work with?\xa0 What problem or situation do you work with?\xa0  If you’ve just graduated from YTT and you aren’t quite sure yet about these answers, that’s okay. Your template can be a little different.\xa0  What’s your yoga teaching style?\xa0 What are your credentials?  Step 2: Take that bio and change it to third person. “Amanda is a yoga teacher….”. Since some yoga studios use third person, you want to have this ready too. This bio is the same other than that.\xa0 Save both of these bios in a Google Doc or an Evernote or something digital so you have it saved somewhere.\xa0 Step 3: As you apply to work at other studios, look at their bio page to see how the other bios are written. Not just the first or third person reference but also the tone that they use and if they have all yoga teachers answer the same questions. Do your research. By all means, please don’t send them a bio to use if you haven’t done this. Don’t be lazy.\xa0 Step 4: Keep a long SAVED list of all your bios. As you change and evolve as a yoga teacher watch your bio change too. You will be amazed at this process and how much it changes with each year you teach. Trust me, you will wish you had started this process earlier when you look back. I still have my first bio that I wrote and it’s completely different than what it is now. There’s beauty in the process (because it wasn’t in my words).\xa0 Your Best Next Step:\xa0 Write your yoga studio bio. Do not let anything stop you from doing this today, just write it. You can edit it later but you need to get something down so you have it saved. |  \xa0  I don’t know about you but when I only have 150 characters to get a point across I sweat a little. Words are hard and you would think that the less you have to come up with the easier it would be but it’s so the opposite for me. In this episode I’m sharing my tips on crafting your social media bios.   \xa0   All Bios:    Short and sweet - you have 7 seconds or less   You have a long story but what’s really relevant to say in a short space?   Write to your dream student - what would they need to know   What emotion do you want the person to feel as they read your copy (this helps create your brand tone)   Write it for ONE person - how would you introduce yourself to someone new   What do you do?   Who do you serve?   What do you want to be known for?    \xa0   Instagram Details    Small area just under your name to share a few details and have someone decide if they want to keep looking and follow you   150 characters - you have to get creative   You want to describe yourself in very few words and characters   List your interests   List your contact info (email address or DM mention)   Add a call to action   You can use emojis and hashtags in your bio   You can use symbols too - CoolSymbol.com is a free resource you can copy and paste from   You can change up the font that’s used by using Lingojam.com if you want to get fancy.   You can only have one link shown - so use your website or Linktr.ee to have more. If you have a freebie, you want to make sure this is included.   Line breaks - you can’t do this in Instagram, you have to use another tool. The easiest is a notepad tool on your phone. Type it how you want it with the breaks (no space after the last character, just enter) then copy and paste into Instagram. There are apps you can use for this too but keep it easy on yourself.    \xa0   Facebook About Section: Business Info, Contact Info & Story    You need to have this included, so many people miss this one   To my knowledge there isn’t a character limit to the Story section but let’s be real - no one wants you to go on and on so keep it short   A little about you but more about what makes you different. Why you?   What do you want to be known for?   You can have links in this section which is GREAT for your freebie   Do not under any circumstances forget to include a contact method - this is what you want them to do, contact you to book a private session, or come to your class, or buy your online course    \xa0   YouTube Channel Description    If your channel isn’t your name, what’s your name?   What can people expect from your videos - what’s in it for them?   When do you upload new content - don’t make them guess, just tell them   Keywords matter in this platform, not hashtags    \xa0   Pinterest    Highly visual platform so you really have to be short and sweet here   160 characters   Why should someone follow you or re-pin your stuff?   Focus on keywords, not hashtags on this platform but don’t sound like a robot    \xa0   Links:    Linktr.ee   Lingo Jam   Cool Symbol   | Let\'s talk about money! Generally speaking, we yoga teachers have a tendency to not talk about money, or making money or the desire to make money teaching yoga. But the reality is that we all have to pay for our trainings, for the props we use for our private sessions and to live our life so why not make money doing what we love? Because if we don\'t, we will have to make money in other ways and that will limit our impact with others through yoga. In this episode, Shannon Crow (The Connected Yoga Teacher) and I talk about money mindset and yoga. It\'s a real, honest conversation that you will gain a lot from.

You have investors that may need more background. Pitch decks often spend more time on the company and its financials. Investors want to see that you have the team to succeed, that you have a growth plan, and that you are seeing traction in the market. A sales deck focuses on “you.” Directly talking to the pains or potential gains of the person you’re talking to. Sales decks also focus on establishing agreement on the problem first, solution second.  |  Key Points:  First, start with validating the problem. Just because you think it’s a problem, doesn’t mean others agree. Sometimes, people will guide you towards other ideas you hadn’t considered, or reveal that they actually have bigger problems they’d like solved. Ask people what they think!  Carrie from Little Nugget (and a guest on the Better Product podcast), made a powerpoint and shared with other moms who she wanted to help.\xa0 Ensure that you are talking to the right person. I’ve talked to startups that are solving problems for retail consumers and they forget to talk to the store owners. For example, if you had an idea to create a parking app for grocery stores, you could validate the idea with the shoppers and hear things like “That’s a great idea, it’d make parking so easy!” But in that case, you’d need to also be solving a problem for the grocery because you can’t build something without their buy-in.\xa0  | Another season of Better Product is in the books, which makes this the perfect time to reflect on some of the conversations we’ve had over the course of Season 2.

But what is the MOST important thing you should include?\xa0\xa0\xa0The #1 thing you absolutely must have in your client contracts is the Absence Rule! In this Biz Bomb episode we blow your mind with WHY you need this rule in your contracts to make sure those clients that disappeared last year don’t reappear asking to restart their package.\xa0An Absence Rule is when you set a period of time where if the client is gone for that period of time and decides to return later (no joke, Kendra has had clients appear 2 years after going MIA) that you have a rule that says in order to restart their package, they need to pay a percentage of their original package cost or an additional fee to get started.\xa0Tune into today’s Biz Bomb episode to find out why you need a Absence Rule and how to include it in your contracts.\xa0If you like what you hear, be sure to subscribe to the 360 Health Biz Podcast so you keep up to date with all our episodes.

We were never taught in school how to hire team members or how to bring people on and for a lot of us. You may not know when to hire, how to hire or how to manage a team. Lucky for you, that’s where we can help!\xa0\xa0We realize that bring someone on can be super scary because you may think you can’t afford it, but if this is your business and this is your dream, then you don’t want to cheap out on having a dream team that can not only be an extension of you to run your business but also give you more time to grow your business! Your VA may be your biggest expense each month but it’s worth very penny.\xa0For starters, it’s important to determine what actually needs to be done and the time it requires. If you need one off items checked off like graphic design, logo, or a blog post written then you likely can contract that work out through a freelancer (see our show notes below on some of the site we use for this). When it comes to ongoing responsibilities like answering emails, creating protocols, etc. you really want to vet these people to determine if they are right for your team.\xa0\xa0To determine what can be taken off your plate, ask yourself, "What do I lack skills in? What do I hate doing?” because you\'re not going to be good at everything and there will be someone out there that IS good at it and loves doing it. So write down the things that you actually should be doing in your business. Things that are going to be helping move your business forward. Things that help you make money. This will help you get a better idea of the type of person you need to hire or what jobs can be contracted out.\xa0When you’re ready to hire, do your research. Ask for references, ask for examples of their work, ask A LOT of questions to determine if they are a good fit. Don’t be afraid to take your time to find the right person. As our business coach says “Hire slow, fire fast." You’ll likely know within a month if they will work out or not. And if they don’t work out then don’t waste your time trying to micromanage them. Because at the end of the day, whoever you hire needs to be devoted to your business as much as you are. Your business needs to be their baby as much as it is yours. You need to be open and honest with your team - tell them how you appreciate them and tell them if you’re pissed off. Similar to a relationship, if you don’t communicate how you feel then they will never know. And when you don’t see each other face to face every day in the office, that makes communication even more important.Visit\xa0https://360healthbizpodcast.com/episode36/ (https://360healthbizpodcast.com/episode35/) for show notes including the hiring tools we discussed in the episode.Connect with us on social:instagram.com/360healthbizpodcastfacebook.com/360healthbizpodcast@kperrynutrition@sleeplikeabossAnd don\'t forget to subscribe to our podcast and leave us a 5-star review!

Through being an entrepreneur in the mix and it becomes even MORE complicated. As an entrepreneur and looking for love, you have to ask yourself the important question – do you want to date another entrepreneur or a 9-5 worker? While it may not seem like that big of a deal, It\'s hard for people who don\'t run a business to understand your passion and the fact that your business is your baby. This means that you work evenings and weekends, that money isn’t always flowing, and that your partner may not be your first priority.\xa0\xa0In this episode, we get to hear the modern day romance of Kendra and Ryan, two entrepreneurs that have been making it work for the last three years. We discuss how dating another entrepreneur can be beneficial to your business. You can bounce ideas off one another, support one another as you know what the other person is going through, and learn from one another. But two entrepreneurs dating isn’t always rainbows and butterflies. Like most relationships, and boundaries need to be set and rules established (but sometimes broken). \xa0\xa0\xa0On the flip side to Kendra’s relationship, we also hear about Christine’s past relationship with a non-entrepreneur and where things didn’t go as planned. Again, like other relationships, money was a big factor….not to mention her turn ons include talking social media in bed and not everyone is into that.\xa0\xa0Whether it’s a romantic relationships, friendship or even partnerships, we dive into communication skills and techniques that can be used across the board. Because it can be lonely as an entrepreneur and it\'s really important to find your people, or as Christine put it, find another zebra.\xa0\xa0In addition to being Kendra’s love, Ryan Flett is also an outdoor adventure photographer, filmmaker, and educator.\xa0 Over the past decade, he has worked in the action sports and tourism industries but now has focused his sights on environmental sustainability, climate change activism and cultivating positive change through imagery, film, and community connection.\xa0\xa0Connect with Ryan:\xa0www.instagram.com/ryan_flettwww.linkedin.com/in/ryanflettwww.facebook.com/ryanflettmediawww.vimeo.com/ryanflettmedia\xa0\xa0Connect with us on social:\xa0instagram.com/360healthbizpodcastfacebook.com/360healthbizpodcast\xa0@kperrynutrition@sleeplikeaboss | Drumroll please!!! The secret to pushing through the fear that comes with running a business? Is realizing that the fear doesn’t go away. Not much of a secret hey? No matter how long you’ve been in the business, you will always be fearful, feel vulnerable about something!\xa0You may feel impostor syndrome, have self-worth issues, or just feel like your confidence has gone out the window. You are not alone in feeling this way. In fact, a lot of times when we sign up to be a health coaching, we don’t actually realize that means that we were going to have to put ourselves online out to a bunch of strangers.\xa0We get it! It still feels uncomfortable putting ourselves out online. It always feels uncomfortable launching a new product to the Internet. It always feels uncomfortable when you\'re vulnerable. Putting yourself out there online is like sitting on a podium and letting people throw judgment at you.\xa0But with fear, can come great reward and success! And if you don’t fit through the fear, how will you ever know if you’ll achieve your goals and establish yourself as a successful business owner?\xa0So the secret is: the fear doesn’t go away. And you absolutely MUST push past it. No matter how many courses you do, unless they are self-help courses, that fear will remain. | Personal branding is THE most important thing in 2019 when it comes to marketing yourself and your business. While brand colours and fonts are important, no one connects with a logo, they want to connect with YOU as a human being and as a practitioner or health coach.\xa0\xa0If you are worried that people won’t like you…won’t like that post you put up, then you need to work on yourself before you work on your business. Here’s why. We ALL have triggers in our businesses. Our last episode with Lori Kennedy, we talked all about this (check our Episode 30) and we talk about it again today…your business WILL bring out insecurities that you may or may not realize you have. As Kendra puts it, she sometimes feels like\xa0 she’s “still that girl in high school who\'s wondering if anyone\'s going to show up to my party”. So you need to make sure you have your support team to support you, so you can support others.\xa0\xa0But let’s get back to personal brand. When you show up authentically, fearlessly, genuinely, and honestly….ladies and gentlemen, you have your brand. But don’t expect it to happen overnight. And if you’re just starting out, don’t expect it to stay the same. Often time our clients can actually shift our brand and our niche! It\'s not like you\'re just going to listen to this episode and know exactly what to do. It\'s going to be a work in process. You\'re going to make some mistakes. You\'re going to have to switch things and change things and revamp things. It\'s always a work in progress, but in the end just don\'t try to be who you think you should be, just be you. Just be who you are, exactly how you would in everyday life.\xa0\xa0So how can you make your brand you? Kendra and Christine offer some great tips in today’s episode including how to make your Instagram more searchable, which platforms you should be on, ways to discover what your brand is (hint JOURNALLING!) and if you decide you can’t do it yourself and need a brand coach – what to look for in a brand coach. | In today\'s Biz Bomb, Christine unleashes 4 ways she finds topics for content creation..and it\'s much easier than it seems!

We talk about starting our day with purpose, setting intentions, and getting off to a good start. We look at how living in the moment can take our life to a new place free from struggle. Sometimes we can achieve what we think we want but intuitively find ourselves completely disconnected.\xa0 One of the key takeaways from our talk was to not be afraid of change and finding what you are truly in alignment with. It’s okay to pivot to really come into your own greatness. We can learn a lot about ourselves by paying attention to what we are feeling, even if we think that we are where we are supposed to be.

And that’s okay. But of course, it leaves you feeling stuck. The idea that you feel stuck starts with your body and the awareness that you are not feeling as well as you could be. So what can you do?\xa0 In today’s episode, I will be sharing three mindset strategies to help you get yourself out of a rut so that you can move forward in life with grace and confidence.

Emily helps women leaders shift out of hustle mode and into a state of freedom, flow, and fulfillment so they can grow and scale their businesses to make a powerful impact. Emily is also the host of the podcast, Sexy Soulful Success, where she facilitates visionary conversation with women entrepreneurs and leaders to redefine success and womanhood.\xa0 Today we are talking about times in our life when we go through conflicting emotions and how to navigate through them. We look at how avoidance behavior can manifest and how to recognize it. We also discussed how to recognize when the path we set out for ourselves is no longer the right path for us to follow. Emily was gracious to share how a conversation halted the plan she had set out for herself and how she had to come up with a new plan instead. She also shared how she handled the fear of judgment when she pivoted. One of the biggest takeaways from my talk with Emily is this: It is important to reflect back on our emotions around different times in our life, especially when they are conflicting with each other. I have found that those conflicting moments are the most defining moments in our lives.\xa0  Show Highlights  The moments of greatness are not always fireworks moments At a certain point, being completely stuck to a plan with no room or allowance to pivot can actually get in the way of pursuing your true calling Knowing what you want to do, but having no idea what that looks like or how to get there Trusting yourself in the moment Remembering the importance of honoring your calling. Your calling is trustable and divine.\xa0  “When we surrender to that identity shift and we allow ourselves to become who we are meant to become, then the other stuff doesn’t really matter.” - Emily Cassel \xa0 Contact Emily: \xa0Website: www.emilycassel.com Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/emilycasselofficial/ Podcast: https://www.emilycassel.com/podcast \xa0 Contact Renee: \xa0 renee@reneemanning.com Instagram: @Biggest_small_things\xa0 Subscribe: https://mailchi.mp/939b8210f2f2/bst | Today on the show, I welcome Enid Brenize, a published author, journalist, and former PR pro.

You never know on the surface if one is about to go under or go unicorn. Austin Leo, VP of USI Insurance Services, highlights a specialized type of insurance, once reserved for large manufacturers, that can help larger companies identify who to do business with… especially those with the least risk of going under before they pay their bills. | After culling through a decades-worth of data on IT services companies, Colin Campbell, associate director at Livingstone Partners, sees serious potential for a market downturn on the horizon. He shares what trends he sees that point to this slowdown, as well as how Buyers and Sellers should change the way they approach M&A deals to account for it. | Acquisition can be the ideal way to experience fast growth as a company. But there’s no need to stay within your home country when looking at potential target companies. Jacob Whitish is the San Francisco-based vice consul for financial services for the U.K.’s Department for International Trade. And he doesn’t just work with U.K. companies looking into the U.S. but also American companies looking to expand in the other direction. | When we usually see cross-border deals, it’s a U.S. company acquiring a foreign business. But increasingly the reverse is happening, says Craig Lilly, corporate partner at the Palo Alto office of Baker McKenzie, and there are three primary drivers for that trend. But cross-border deals with foreign buyers aren’t without their pitfalls, especially with newly enacted regulatory and anti-trust and merger controls – at that’s just the start. | What happens when a minority of shareholders don’t agree to the terms to acquire or merge their company? The terms could change drastically… or the deal could fall apart completely. But, says Nate Gallon, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of Hogan Lovells, there’s a way to avoid that fate… because the shareholders will be contractually obligated to vote “yes” on the sale. | When you hear the word drone, you might think of the military uses, the proposed Amazon.com delivery drones, or those jokers who shut down airports by flying drones around runways. But drones are serious business, says Gretchen West of Hogan Lovells in Silicon Valley. There are little-known commercial uses of drones that save time, money, and lives that will only expand in the near future… as long as government regulations can keep pace with development of new technology. | It’s a tight talent market out there in the technology industry. And that’s especially for all C-suite positions right now, says Stephen Kuhn, partner at Advantary. Yet companies, especially startups, are facing pressure from their boards to hire senior executives. And that means they’re sometimes rushed into bad hiring decisions. | The politics of healthcare is a mess in this country, as you know. But Matthew Hanis, executive producer and host of the Business of Healthcare, is more interested in practical measures for incrementally improving a system that is the most expensive in the world and doesn’t offer a great quality of care in exchange. | M&A activity has been heating up in the last few years… and 2019 is no exception. At the same time there has been a lot of movement in the healthcare sector, but due to its unique nature, special care has to be taken when dealing with acquisitions in this industry. Patrick Krause, a director at investment bank MHT Partners focused on healthcare, has shepherded a lot of deals in this sector. | What did due diligence in M&A deals look like before virtual data rooms? Teams of lawyers and other experts combing through paper files stacked floor to ceiling in a conference room. With the virtual data room, explains Darryl Grant of Toppan Merrill, those days are long gone.', 'chan_desc': "Master the clean exit! Discover secrets of M&A Masters.

YOU SHOULD GIVE IT TO THEM. Marketers face a paradox. Consumers expect your brand to know everything about them-who they are, what they want, and why-and to deliver it at the exact moment they need it. But ad saturation and inbox clutter make them resent everything marketers do. In this environment, traditional approaches just won\'t cut it. Marketing to these entitled consumers demands a new strategy: consumer-first marketing. And this book, featuring a foreword by NFL Hall of Famer Steve Young, is the first to lay out how to do it. Based on focus groups and surveys with 7,000 consumers, combined with the authors\' experience with hundreds of brands,\xa0Marketing to the Entitled Consumer\xa0shows you everything you need to apply consumer-first marketing in your organization. You\'ll learn which data to collect-from purchase histories to pollen counts-and how to deploy it consistently across online, mobile, and real-world channels. You\'ll see how to build consumer connections that cut through the clutter with the three Rs: reciprocal value, relevance, and respectful empathy. You\'ll even get a roadmap on how to win over your fellow marketers and the rest of your company. Read the book that the legendary marketing thinker Don Peppers called "a warning shot across the bow of traditional marketing." Then get to work. Your entitled consumers are ready for a new approach...are you? | Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life by Nir Eyal  Click here for show notes!  https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/indistractable-nir-eyal\xa0 You sit down at your desk to work on an important project, but a notification on your phone interrupts your morning. Later, as you’re about to get back to work, a colleague taps you on the shoulder to chat. At home, screens get in the way of quality time with your family. Another day goes by, and once again, your most important personal and professional goals are put on hold. What would be possible if you followed through on your best intentions? What could you accomplish if you could stay focused and overcome distractions? What if you had the power to become “indistractable?” International bestselling author, former Stanford lecturer, and behavioral design expert, Nir Eyal, wrote Silicon Valley’s handbook for making technology habit-forming. Five years after publishing\xa0Hooked, Eyal reveals distraction’s Achilles’ heel in his groundbreaking new book. In\xa0Indistractable, Eyal reveals the hidden psychology driving us to distraction. He describes why solving the problem is not as simple as swearing off our devices: Abstinence is impractical and often makes us want more. Eyal lays bare the secret of finally doing what you say you will do with a four-step, research-backed model.\xa0Indistractable\xa0reveals the key to getting the best out of technology, without letting it get the best of us. Inside, Eyal overturns conventional wisdom and reveals:  Why distraction at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture—and how to fix it What really drives human behavior and why “time management is pain management” Why your relationships (and your sex life) depend on you becoming indistractable How to raise indistractable children in an increasingly distracting world  Empowering and optimistic,\xa0Indistractable\xa0provides practical, novel techniques to control your time and attention—helping you live the life you really want. | The Innovation Mandate: The Growth Secrets of the Best Organizations in the World by Nicholas Webb  Click here for show notes!  https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/innovation-mandate-nicholas-webb In this constantly shifting world, companies must innovate if they want to survive.

In today’s ultra competitive marketplace, the difference between success and failure is innovation. From small entrepreneurial startups to global Fortune 500 companies, innovation—the steady flow of new ideas—drives sustained success. It allows a company to:  Introduce new products and services Effectively connect with customers Sharpen the supply chain Efficiently manage finances Hire and retain the best people  Without a steady stream of new ideas, even the best company will slow down, atrophy, lose market share, hemorrhage customers, and eventually close or be sold. The Innovation Mandate\xa0offers a clear and straightforward pathway to profitable innovation. It demystifies the concept, making it easy to understand, implement, and measure. The book centers around three simple concepts:  Innovation generates profits; Innovation, in the form of new, profitable ideas, can come from anywhere Identifying, harnessing, evaluating, and implementing these new ideas cannot be left to chance  Additionally, the book offers a five-point checklist to ensure your company is innovation ready. | The Science of Customer Connections: Manage Your Message to Grow Your Business by Jim Karrh  Click here for show notes!  https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/science-customer-connections-jim-karrh Engaging, practical, and immediately useful for any business and its messengers on how to talk about their business and connect with their customers.

Inspirational real-world examples are presented from entrepreneurs and career changers, growth companies, and large global organizations. | Growth IQ: Get Smarter About the Choices that Will Make or Break Your Business by Tiffani Bova  Click here for show notes!  https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/growth-iq-tiffani-bova A\xa0WALL STREET JOURNAL\xa0BESTSELLER  Do you know the best way to drive your company\'s growth? If not, it\'s time to boost your Growth IQ.  Trying to find the one right move that will improve your business\'s performance can feel overwhelming. But, as you\'ll discover in Growth IQ, there are just ten simple--but easily misunderstood--paths to growth, and every successful growth strategy can be boiled down to picking the right combination and sequence of these paths for your current context.  Tiffani Bova travels around the world helping companies solve their most vexing problem: how to keep growing in the face of stiff competition and a fast-changing business environment. Whether she\'s presenting to a Fortune 500 board of directors or brainstorming over coffee with a startup founder, Bova cuts through the clutter and confusion that surround growth.  Now, she draws on her decades of experience and more than thirty fascinating, in-depth business stories to demonstrate the opportunities--and pitfalls--of each of the ten growth paths, how they work together, and how they apply to business today. You\'ll see how, for instance:  \xa0\xa0*\xa0\xa0Red Bull broke Coca-Cola and PepsiCo\'s stranglehold on the soft drink market by taking the Customer Base Penetration path to establish a foothold with adventure sports junkies and expand into the mainstream.  \xa0\xa0*\xa0\xa0Marvel transformed itself from a struggling comic book publisher into a global entertainment behemoth by using a Customer and Product Diversification strategy and shifting their focus from comic books to comic book characters in movies.  \xa0\xa0*\xa0\xa0Starbucks suffered a brand crisis when they overwhelmed their customers with a Product Expansion strategy, and brought back CEO Howard Schultz to course-correct by returning to the Customer Experience path.  Through Bova\'s insightful analyses of these and many other case studies, you\'ll see why it can be a mistake to imitate strategies that worked for your competitors, or rely on strategies that worked for you in the past. To grow your company with confidence, you first need to grow your Growth IQ. | Flip the Script: Getting People to Think Your Idea Is Their Idea by Oren Klaff  Click here for show notes!  https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/flip-script-oren-klaff THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF\xa0PITCH ANYTHING\xa0IS BACK TO FLIP YOUR ENTIRE APPROACH TO PERSUASION.  Is there anything worse than a high-pressure salesperson pushing you to say "yes" (then sign on the dotted line) before you\'re ready?  If there\'s one lesson Oren Klaff has learned over decades of pitching, presenting, and closing long-shot, high-stakes deals, it\'s that people are sick of being marketed and sold to. Most of all, they hate being told what to think. The more you push them, the more they resist.  What people love, however, is coming up with a great idea on their own, even if it\'s the idea you were guiding them to have all along. Often, the only way to get someone to sign is to make them feel like they\'re smarter than you.  That\'s why Oren is throwing out the old playbook on persuasion. Instead, he\'ll show you a new approach that works on this simple insight: Everyone trusts their own ideas. If, rather than pushing your idea on your buyer, you can guide them to discover it on their own, they\'ll believe it, trust it, and get excited about it. Then they\'ll buy in and feel good about the chance to work with you.  That might sound easier said than done, but Oren has taught thousands of people how to do it with a series of simple steps that anyone can follow in any situation.  And as you\'ll see in this book, Oren has been in a\xa0lot\xa0of different situations.  He\'ll show you how he got a billionaire to take him seriously, how he got a venture capital firm to cough up capital, and how he made a skeptical Swiss banker see him as an expert in banking. He\'ll even show you how to become so compelling that buyers are even more attracted to you than to your product.\xa0  These days, it\'s not enough to make a great pitch.  To get attention, create trust, and close the deal, you need to\xa0flip the script. | Rehumanize Your Business: How Personal Videos Accelerate Sales and Improve Customer Experience by Ethan Beute and Stephen Pacinelli  Click here for show notes! https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/rehumanize-your-business-ethan-beute Accelerate sales and improve customer experience Every day, most working professionals entrust their most important messages to a form of communication that doesn\'t build trust, provide differentiation, or communicate clearly enough. It\'s easy to point to the sheer volume of emails, text messages, voicemails, and even social messaging as the problem that reduces our reply rates and diminishes our effectiveness. But the faceless nature of that communication is also to blame. Rehumanize Your Business\xa0explains how to dramatically improve relationships and results with your customers, prospects, employees, and recruits by adding personal videos to emails, text messages, and social messages. It explains the what, why, and how behind this new movement toward simple, authentic videos—and when to replace some of your plain, typed-out communication with webcam and smartphone recordings. \xa0•\xa0\xa0 Restore face-to-face communication for clarity and connection •\xa0\xa0\xa0 Add a personal, human touch to your emails and other messages •\xa0\xa0\xa0 Meet people who’ve sent thousands of videos •\xa0\xa0\xa0 Learn to implement your own video habit in an easy, time-saving way •\xa0\xa0\xa0 Boost your replies, appointments, conversion, referrals, and results dramatically If you’re ready to influence, teach, sell, or serve in a more personal way,\xa0Rehumanize Your Business\xa0is your guide. | Nincompoopery: Why Your Customers Hate You--and How to Fix It by John Brandt  Click here for show notes!  https://www.salesartillery.com/marketing-book-podcast/nincompoopery-john-brandt Find and kill the corporate stupidity that drives customers crazy. CEO and award-winning business writer John R. Brandt offers concrete examples of how any organization--large or small, and regardless of industry--can innovate in ways that delight customers and attract top-level talent. Nincompoopery--terrible customer service, idiotic business processes, and soul-crushing management practices--surrounds all of us. We lose time, patience, and profits as stuck-in-the-past organizations actively prevent us (and our customers) from getting the value we (and they) deserve.\xa0 Can’t anybody change this? CEO and award-winning business writer John R. Brandt says we can. In\xa0Nincompoopery: Why Your Customers Hate You--And How to Fix It, he leverages research across thousands of companies to show leaders how to find and kill the corporate stupidity that drives customers crazy. More importantly, he offers concrete examples of how any organization--large or small, and regardless of industry--can innovate in ways that delight customers and attract top-level talent. Brandt has worked with hundreds of companies to help them outwit competitors, and in the blunt (and funny)\xa0Nincompoopery, he shares his unique blueprint for success. It usually starts by asking a simple question or two, such as  Why should our customers have to rekey their data multiple times to make a single purchase? Why are there four levels of approval just to order basic supplies? Why can’t we get qualified candidates for open positions, or provide new employees with decent training? In short: How did we become such nincompoops? And when will we stop?\xa0  Nincompoopery\xa0offers leaders the answers they need--and the profits they crave--with a scoop of humor on the side.
