Happy Holidays! | Well... it's been a while.\xa0 Can you believe almost a full year has gone by since the end of Wolf 359? Saying that\xa0feels very surreal to all of us at Kinda Evil Genius HQ. And lately a lot of people have been asking us: what has everyone on the cast and crew been working on lately?\xa0 Honestly? A lot of stuff. New audio dramas! New talk shows! Getting advanced degrees! Modeling! Adventures in the world of tech! Big writing projects! Experimental cross-media performance art! Landscape architecture! So! Much! Stuff! But seriously: when we stopped to take stock of how much cool work folks were doing, we thought it might nice to share the latest from the team with all of you. So fire up the old podcasting apps, and join Doug Eiffel himself, Zach Valenti, for a whirlwind update on what some of the cast and crew have been up to this year. | Please be advised this episode of Wolf 359 contains violence and the use of firearms. Listener discretion is advised. Our finale episode. Faced with a choice between finally going home and stopping Pryce and Cutter's master plan, the crew of the Hephaestus heads towards their final confrontation with their enemies, their past selves, and each other. Plus, the Doug Eiffel Fastball Special, the lies we tell ourselves, another bad plan, cool stuff with robots, and one day more. | Before you dive into our finale episode, one last quick announcement from the show's producers. Thank you to everyone for three and a half amazing years! | Mission Mishaps, entry eight. SI-5 surveillance log. Entry #CRT004. Maxwell and Jacobi try to talk their way out of a mandatory assignment. | Investigative reporter Andrea Nash is having a very good day. She's flown halfway around the world on a very special assignment: an exclusive interview with Marcus Cutter, the infamous Director of Communications for Goddard Futuristics. It's a shot at journalism greatness, and Nash intends to make the most of it. But as she gets closer and closer to unearthing the earth-shaking story she's after, her subject gets more and more defensive... and starts considering more radical means of eliminating the unwanted attention. Plus, terrors to work for, a big, honking private plane, the charms of analog recorders, things no monkey could ever manage, and the fiery intensity of a thousand burning suns. | Please be advised this episode of\xa0Wolf 359\xa0contains instances of violence and use of firearms. Listener discretion is advised. With the wayward pod successfully recovered but Doctor Pryce still in the hands of the rebellious crew, Cutter must find a way to defuse an explosive hostage situation. Will the uneasy truces formed during the state of emergency last long enough for both sides to reach a diplomatic compromise? Or will Cutter and his operatives resort to more... extreme measures in an attempt to give the conflict a more permanent solution? Plus, a homecoming of sorts, supportive company culture, rashness, impulsivity,\xa0and a hell of a sunset.\xa0", 'chan_desc': "Life's not easy for Doug Eiffel, the communications officer for the U.S.S. Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts5/v4/d6/af/60/d6af60d2-cf8d-7cfe-1499-2dae208d535f/mza_187903058843893414.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2014-08-15'}}

Coming home, Colleen and Leland try to mend their relationship and find some way back. | The body count rises as the detectives discover what happened to Arthur, and Colleen questions whether Lucy is telling the truth after the facts don’t add up. Meanwhile, Leland is devastated by the death of his friend, and vows to protect Lucy at all costs. Suspicious of Lucy, Colleen and Pruitt follow her and discover the real nature of Aaron & Lucy’s relationship, and use that information to pressure Aaron into coming clean about what happened to Robin and Billy. | Colleen feels responsible for Joan’s actions, and they finally have a break in the case when Pruitt finds a surprising connection between Lucy and Aaron, leading them to believe that Lucy knows much more than they thought. When the warrant for the Wade house comes through, Colleen is forced to go up against Leland again, and the detectives discover the murder weapon in an unexpected location. Arthur continues to mentally spiral, while Lucy tries everything to get through to him. | When Travis gets a tip on the murder weapon, Colleen and Pruitt are finally forced to do the one thing they have been trying to avoid, question Arthur about the night Robin died, to disastrous results when Leland ends up in the middle. Back home, Colleen feels the full weight of her actions as the conflict with Leland results in a devastating fight, leading Colleen to take shelter in the Pruitt home. Meanwhile, Joan enacts her plan to get justice for her son.\xa0 | Following the dramatic events of the Waffle House shootout, Colleen and Pruitt learn key information about the murder weapon from Darryl Ballinger, who also reveals that Aaron knows a lot more about the case than he initially let on. Meanwhile, Colleen and Pruitt learn that Arthur has not been honest about Robin’s final night, which puts Colleen in a difficult situation with Leland. Joan, convinced that Aaron killed her son, makes a dangerous decision to take things into her own hands. | As news of the investigation leaks to the community, Colleen and Pruitt must race to find their new lead, the mysterious Darryl Ballinger. Travis deals with the trauma of taking a life, and Leland visits Arthur, whose trauma has been reignited by the reopened case. At home, Pruitt struggles with his marriage and House Cat warns Colleen about the consequences of her actions. Meanwhile, Aaron frantically searches for Darryl, but is caught in the middle when a more dangerous foe finds him first. | When Riley makes a daring escape, Travis makes a split second decision that has massive repercussions both personally and for the case. Colleen and Pruitt must make a deal with Eunice to gain a new lead in the case, and notify the families while trying to keep the investigation under wraps. Joan Schipper grows frustrated that Colleen isn’t following her leads, while Pruitt studies the original 1987 case files and Colleen attempts to talk with Leland about Robin and Arthur. | Colleen and Pruitt are forced to reopen the infamous local cold case of Robin Wade and Billy Shipper, after learning that Riley and Eunice's confessions shed new light on the case. The detectives must tread lightly in order to keep their actions under wraps, discovering that the cousins know details of the murder that were not made public. Colleen worries about news getting out that they have re-opened the case, which has personal stakes for Leland, and must work quickly to verify the new leads.\xa0 | Picking up where season one left off, Detective Colleen Clayton (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her partner Pruitt (Ray McKinnon) follow a trail of confessions that lead them back to Exeter’s most infamous unsolved crime: The brutal murder of two teenage lovers. Colleen and Pruitt must fight to maintain order as their renewed investigation rips open 8 years’ worth of old wounds in their small southern town. | Colleen is pulled back into the case when Eunice will only speak to her. During a haunting interrogation, Eunice reveals he had a partner, his cousin – and they’ve been killing for years.

I’m also nominated for two thrille audiobooks I’ve done. It’s such an honor to be nominated at all, and to be nominated three times is outrageous. Thank you for listening to the podcast, and telling your friends. Apparently, we still go it! Now, I had always heard that the original Bambi was much edgier and darker than the Disney film, but I had never read it. It just came into the public domain this year, so I thought I’d give it a go. I was blown away. It’s written so beautifully, so poetically. But there is a deeper, resounding philosophy as the creatures are forced to face their own mortality in so many ways. I t reads more like Watership Down or Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh. But there is no substitute for reading the original, unabridged work. Once Bambi starts to understand the way things work, things start to get really real. I had to do it in October, because in Utah, our kids actually get out of school for the deer hunt.

I’m running a little behind this week. It’s tricky to try and sneak in a few hours to record over the weekend. I’m going to release this in two shots, as a Part One and Part Two, since it runs around 20 hours. So keep an eye open for Part One. Please make sure your membership status is current, as I will be sending the completed audiobook out to all current financial supporting members. Today’s story is Edgar Wallace who co-wrote the groundbreaking story of King Kong with Merriam C. Cooper. Wallace was a prolific author, and at the time of his death, was known as “The King of Thrillers”.\xa0 When Wallace finished writing The Four Just Men, he was sure he had a hit. The problem was, nobody else thought so. He couldn’t get it published. So, he self published it, and decided to advertise the novel on an unprecedented scale. He came up with a bold advertising gimmick: a\xa0£500 reward was offered to any reader who could guess how the murder in the novel was committed. Wallace was working for The Daily Mail newspaper at the time, and here he published the serialized version of the story along with the competition. Well, it didn’t work out quite like he’d anticipated. While the book did well, it didn’t do that well. Furthermore, Wallace wasn’t quite as clever as he thought. Some people were guessing the ending. After three months, Wallace still hadn’t recouped his advertising investment, and he had more contest winners than he was planning for. So, the official list of winners kind of went unpublished, which kind of made a lot of people lose trust in The Daily Mail, which is really a bad thing when you’re, you know, a news source. In the end, Wallace had to borrow £5,000 from his boss, so the newspaper could save face with their readers. Wallace’s working relationship with the paper soured after that, when it became evident that Wallace was in no hurry to pay the money back. But while the publishing of The Four Just Men was a bit of a fiasco, it did establish Wallace’s name as a writer. The reason I chose this story was because while I was reading it, I was constantly fighting with myself. This was Wallace’s intention. Of The Four Just Men, he said, “The most lawless of us would hesitate to defend them, but the greater humanitarian could scarcely condemn them.” We aren’t supposed to be completely for or against them. The story takes place before the two World Wars, when anarchists were big news in Europe. Today, we would likely dub them terrorists. They are vigilantes, who seek their own version of justice from the world. I hope you like it. Warning: there are a couple offensive racial epithets in today’s episode, including the “n” word.\xa0 And now, The Four Just Men, part 1 of 4, by Edgar Wallace. \xa0  Tap here to go to www.classictalesaudiobooks.com and become a financial supporter! \xa0 \xa0 Tap here to get early access to the Airr app, and share your favorite snippets of the episode with your friends!

The Hunchback of Notre Dame is coming along. I’m actually using a combination of several translations to record this audiobook, as I’m using three at the same time. The one from J. Carroll Beckwith is the main one, but I’m also using the traditionally used anonymous translation as well as another audio version for additional reference. I have around four more hours to record. Please make sure your membership status is current, as I will be sending the completed audiobook out to all current financial supporting members.\xa0 Today’s story is by Lydia Maria Child, who lived from 1802 to 1880. She was best known for her stand against slavery and for her promotion of the rights of Native Americans. The musical version of her Thanksgiving poem, “Over the River and Through the Woods”, is still sung by children today. Her story, “The Rival Mechanicians” has been lauded as one of the finest science fiction tales from the first half of the nineteenth century. The Western Literary Messenger declared it to be “above praise”, when it was first published in 1847. There are so many diverse and profound elements to the story, however, I think I’ll let it speak for itself.

I’m very excited to announce that Annie, from the Join Us In France podcast, has agreed to write a special introduction for the Classic Tales Audiobook edition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. She is a licensed historian and tour guide, and her insights into the history of the Notre Dame cathedral will deepen the experience of the audiobook. After searching many different translations, the one I landed on by J. Carroll Beckwith was only published in a very limited edition of only 1000 copies. But it is by far the best I’ve come across. Please make sure your supporter status is up to date, so you don’t miss out on this amazing production. Once it’s done, I’ll be sending the entire 20 hour-long audiobook to all current supporters. This week we finish our story of Conan. It’s got some pretty gruesome violence, and the misogyny is back, too. The violence is pretty obvious, but parents might also want to stop and talk about the misogyny. If we point it out and talk about it, we can make sure it stops.

While it\'s clear that she has supported and sacrificed her share for our podcast, and also had a wonderful voice acting debut as Lucy in our first season, she never really considered herself a fiction writer.\xa0 Feeling inspired by the talented writers in our first season, she sat down and hammered out "Sanctuary," the story that you are about to enjoy.\xa0\xa0 Your first story is always something special.\xa0 It\'s also a very nervous experience.\xa0 Many of us still feel the anxiety of waiting to hear how people feel about the story.\xa0 It\'s these very real moments that strike us far more than any monster or evil deed that you might hear about in The Grey Rooms.\xa0 Why not take the time to reach out to Christina or any of our authors, really, and let them know what you think about their stories. The authors don\'t bite, and no doubt they love to hear your thoughts on their work.\xa0 And, for that matter, so do Jason and I.\xa0 Please don\'t forget to send us all a review or even hit us up on social media and let us know what you think.\xa0 We can\'t do this all without you. Oh! And as for a story summary:\xa0 It\'s hard being a parent.\xa0 You always want to do the right thing, but the challenges are never what you\'d expect.\xa0 One man\'s attempt at reaching his son, and creating something great reaches devastating results when he finds himself in...The Grey Rooms.\xa0 \xa0 Written by:\xa0Christina Wilson Engineered by: Jason Wilson Music by: JM Scherf \xa0 Performances: Father - Warren Richardson Carter - Patrick Mealey \xa0 Episode Art by: Cassie Pertiet\xa0 Additional Art & Advertising by:\xa0Brooks Bigley\xa0 \xa0 EXTRA STUFF Visit our website at http://www.thegreyrooms.com Like what we\'re doing?

It started out with Graham Rowat and Brooks Bigley and went on to include people like Sarah Werner, Jon Grilz, Toni Miller, Bo Chappell, Augie Peterson, Dustin Schyler Yoak, Jesse Dedman, and Michael Rigg.\xa0 You all took a strange idea to have guest hosts interview everyone for a behind the scenes look of the show, and you knocked it out of the park.\xa0 Thank you for all of the wonderful conversations and topics that we were able to enjoy with your help.\xa0 We wouldn\'t have done it without our amazing artists.\xa0 We started out with Mediogre producing some of the early art and soon there was Cassie Pertiet coming up to the plate with her distinct vision of each anthology story.\xa0 Soon Brooks Bigley and Graham Rowat jumped into the mix and started crafting all of the ads on social media.\xa0 These are all such a wonderful and talented team of artists.\xa0 We hope that we have provided you a great challenge, and while it took us awhile to get the art to show up, we\'re so happy that you have given the audience such terrifying and wonderful candies for the eye.\xa0 We wouldn\'t have been able to do anything without our patrons.\xa0 We\'re handing you out keys, stickers, early access, and bonus episodes, but you are giving us so much more.\xa0 We\'re in your debt and everything from the Libsyn hosting, website, sound effects...it\'s happening because of your generous support. And finally we wouldn\'t have been able to do it without you listeners.\xa0 You jump in every week and download our episodes and tell us how much you enjoy them.\xa0 You like our social media posts and tweets.\xa0 You recommend us constantly to other listeners looking for something new.\xa0 We love you.\xa0 All of you.\xa0 And we think about you all the time when we\'re considering things like new stories and whether or not we need to include disclaimers.\xa0 We really, really hope that you enjoyed this finale.\xa0 We did this for you.\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to do it for you.\xa0 Whether you are an author, an actor, a composer, an artist, a host, a patron, a listener, or even The Warden, at the end of the day, we want to tell a great story that is going to fulfill that urge to figure out what is going on.\xa0 We know the stories are dark and tragic.\xa0 We know that they can be incredibly gory or play on your phobias.\xa0 But...

Thank you all so much for listening to our penultimate episode. We really hope you\'ve enjoyed episodes 1-12 and we are all currently working hard on finishing up our season finale.\xa0 Brian Black lovingly calls Episode 13\xa0 "Grey Rooms: The Movie" and it is certainly earning that title.\xa0 It\'s huge.\xa0 Hugely huge.\xa0 We hope we can say that and still remain respectable adults.\xa0 But it\'s also true.\xa0 It\'s a giant who\'s who of voice talent that we\'ve been using in every episode.\xa0 It\'s fully scored by JM Scherf.\xa0 It\'s got the longest Raymond and Bob story that we\'ve done to date. It\'s full of all sorts of mysteries and dark secrets.\xa0 And it\'ll probably spoil Avengers: End Game if you let it (just kidding.) We cannot wait for you to listen to this.\xa0 But due to the size of our movie length finale, we might also be a week late in what we normally promise as a bi-weekly podcast.\xa0 We\'ve been so good at keeping up with our promises though that we have something else in store for you.\xa0 We decided to compile all of the Raymond and Bob intros together into one episode so that everyone can prepare themselves for what is to come.\xa0 If you don\'t feel like relistening to the intros, it\'s totally fine, and most likely won\'t hurt Bob\'s feelings.\xa0 At least we think it won\'t.\xa0 He\'s got layers.\xa0 Stay tuned for the compilation episode and the finale! We can\'t wait to end the season with a bang and we look forward to hearing your thoughts when we bring Episode 13 - Everything Ends to podcatchers everywhere.\xa0 \xa0 EXTRA STUFF Visit our website at http://www.thegreyrooms.com Like what we\'re doing?

Buy the Capricious ebook Get the Capricious audiobook \xa0 | This month\'s patron-funded story is "Spawning Grounds" by Julie Cox, narrated by Nikki Delgado. I shifted my weight back and forth and stretched my wings, fidgeting, rolling them in their sockets. I still wasn\'t used to them; they were new, only a few months old. The feathers had finally come in all the way, the central shafts opening like strange mottled brown blossoms. They were lighter than they looked, but I still had trouble with my balance. I knocked into things. These days, I was far more graceful in the air. “Angela, you gotta relax,” Ester said as she tightened the straps of my backpack. “You’re going to be alright. Some tentacle monsters are scary, but Celpin are as docile as they come.” I nodded. I knew that better than she did; I was the park ranger, after all. She might study them in the lab, but I watched them day after day. I’d watched their numbers dwindle, falling as the birds they cooperated with for spawning disappeared along with so many other species on the planet. Climate change was a bitch. At least this time it was because of a volcanic event, and wasn’t our species mucking about that did it. “You’ll be ok,” she said again, but I think she was talking more to herself than to me. “I’m ready,” I said. “I’ll be waiting when you get back.” She wasn’t looking at me. She was nervous and didn\'t want me to see it. “Break a leg.” I stepped to the edge of the ledge, opened my wings, and jumped. | This month\'s patron-sponsored story is "Arvent4299" by R. Tusker, read by Violet Jade. "Arvent4299. That\'s my access password," said N-04, her synthesized voice not betraying a hint of nervousness. Her client nearly spat out his drink in response, not expecting a serious answer to his question. "Wait, hang on. That\'s a joke, right? You\'re joking." Her client chuckled, setting his stein on the bar counter. "Let me guess. I try to hack you with that password and it\'ll blow up my tablet. Or it\'s actually your kill code and you\'ll go \'Destroy All Humans\' on me." N-04 frowned, the glare of her faintly glowing eyes cutting through the murkiness of the lounge. "The assumption that all synths have a kill code has caused an undue amount of stress for human-synth relations. I gave you my access password, and I will revoke it if you continue to act so foolishly. Or if you’re not bold enough to use it." N-04 sat and watched the TV as the client paused and tentatively pulled out his tablet. Porn was on. There was never anything but porn on in these hookup lounges. All things considered, this side gig could have been worse. The pay was decent, and the benefits were amazing, with free access to a human-synth relations agent, subsidies for maintenance costs, and access to a server for mind-uploading. All you had to do is bend over and let corporate perverts with more money than charm have their way with you. Technically, all a client paid for was your company for the evening, but the more of yourself you gave up, the better the payout, as long as client uses what you offer. Most synths stick to the baseline, some light conversation and maybe a handie, but N-04 had aspirations, and aspirations need more than 14 credits an hour. "Holy shit," her date whispered, breaking her line of thought. "I\'m in." "Took you long enough. You have access to most of my operating system. You can change whatever you wish, do whatever suits what fantasies lie in that little head of yours. As long as you don\'t break the the terms of the contract you signed with Escortcorp. So nothing against the law, no messing up my clothing, and no denting my chassis." The client looked back and forth between N-04 and his tablet, his bemusement clear on his face. "Why?" he finally sputtered out. "Because it\'s either this, cancelling this appointment or listening to you blather on about fantasy football all night. This is the only route that actually seems fun." She smiled cattily. These sort of nights always went better when she poked fun at the client. Always getting mad, going overboard and getting hit with a massive bill. "So go on. Dominate me. Impress me." The client scowled and began to frantically peck away at his tablet, his bemusement turning into indignation. After a few moments, N-04\'s arm locked at the elbow and jerked roughly upwards, then downwards. "So, this is your fetish, huh?" she quipped. "You must like your handjobs super intense." "Do you mind?" he growled. "I\'m testing the movement controls." "If it took you that long to pull that off, I should probably go home. By the time you figure out how to really fuck me up, it\'ll be--" N-04 was cut off as the client, roughly controlling one limb at a time, managed to force her body off of the bar stool and stand it up. She sneered at him as he locked her into a pseudo T-pose and rotated her. Leering at the hot pink minidress and nylons - the standard uniform for greeters at her actual job- and the curvy body of metal, plastic and synthflesh that lay beneath. "You done twirling me around like a Barbie?" she sniped. The client grinned and pressed a few buttons. Slowly, N-04 bent over the bar, her dress riding up her hips until the bottom of her underwear, a pink thong, came into view. He brushed his hand against her ass tentatively and a shock ran through her body. | This is "Having Her for Tea" a straight BDSM story by Harley Easton, narrated by Terry of the Smut Podcast.

You\'re in luck!Layne Parrish sipped an Imperial Stout while his daughter Cameron unleashed a fierce attack on the page with a blue crayon. She colored a helicopter with wanton disregard for the lines. Blue everywhere. The blades, the cockpit, the landing skids.Layne had tried to help guide her aim, but she didn’t seem interested. At four years old, staying inside the lines was a little beyond her grasp. In the end, what did it matter? There would be time to color inside the lines later. Carpe diem.Across the table from them at Sunshine Brewing Company in Redding, California, Inessa Parrish sat. Actually, not so much sat as perched on her chair with a scowl on her face. Of the three Parrishes at the table, Inessa seemed to be the only one not having a good time.She had the same last name as Layne, but she was not currently related. His ex-wife. She was long and tall, with high cheekbones and sharp blonde hair. Almost as sharp as her Russian accent. It had been years since she’d bothered to soften the edge of her voice when speaking to Layne, but that was to be expected.“Cameron, eat your chicken fingers,” Inessa said.“I wanna save it for later,” Cam said, not looking up at her mother. Inessa’s scowl deepened, and Layne decided not to get involved. He remembered hearing the “starving children in Africa” line from his mother many times in his youth, and it had never made sense to him back then. What did eating all his peas and carrots have to do with downtrodden kids in Africa?He was a third wheel on this trip away from Colorado, anyway. Same hotel, different room, taking care of Cam during the days while Inessa would work. She was in town to do a few woodsy photo shoots for a clothing line, and Layne had tagged along since he had nothing better to do.At least, that was the reason he’d given Inessa for tagging along. He did have an ulterior motive to visit Redding he hadn’t shared with her. The timing had worked out perfectly since he’d intended to come here anyway for a couple years now.“New ink?” Inessa asked, her eyes focusing on a particular section of the tattoos blanketing his arms from wrist to shoulder.Layne shook his head. “Not for a while, now. Same ones.”Most of their conversations were like this. Short, strained, not ending well. That was fine with Layne because he wasn’t here to spend time with Inessa or do any sort of work to repair their relationship. Only Cam. Everything was for Cam.When they’d arrived a couple days ago, Inessa had brought up that age-old topic of how Layne could afford to go gallivanting around the country and not have to work. After all, he was retired, not only from a particular nameless government agency but also retired from his post-retirement security consulting business. Double retired from two jobs not known for being lucrative. Inessa had brought it up, and Layne had once again opted not to answer her questions. Since then, they’d said maybe thirty words to each other.He drained the rest of his beer and stood, not able to reach his full 6’4” due to the low-hanging light fixture thing above the table.“Daddy, where are you going?”“Potty,” he said, brushing his daughter’s blonde hair out of her eyes. “Maybe you can finish the helicopter and we can both color the dolphin on the next page together when I get back.”She pursed her lips in consideration and then nodded her consent. He gave her a kiss on the forehead and scooted out from the chair. The Sunshine Brewing Company was a huge, open room, with enormous ceilings and wood everywhere. Like many restaurants in the area, bear-related paraphernalia decorated the walls. | Visit jimheskett.com/seasonfive for podcast episode show notes.__________Want the inside scoop on each Layne Parrish novel, including info on how it was created and the inspiration for each story?Check out the video below for the awesome insider info, direct from the author himself!\ufeffWant to read the first chapter? You\'re in luck!Harry Boukadakis gasped for air. Strong hands pushed him along what he assumed was a hallway. He had to assume, because the bag over his head prevented him from seeing anything. One foot in front of the other, barely able to keep pace with the person or persons forcing him to some unknown destination.He’d been able to gather a few pieces of intel about his current situation, though. They had snatched him last night, right after leaving his weekly Dungeons and Dragons tabletop gaming session with Ethan and Danny. The last time he would see his friends for more than a week before embarking on his planned vacation.Harry had felt a pinch in his thigh walking out to his car, then a sudden and severe feeling of heat. Flushed, like pins and needles. His eyes rolled back in his head, and he lost control. He remembered the sensation of his legs crumpling, then blackness.When he awoke, he’d been bound, gagged, and walking up stairs. Short stairs. Eyes too bleary and head too foggy to make anything out. The thrum of airplane engines had filled his ears. That led to an involuntary trip on an airplane, where he had been secured to a seat the entire time. Hard to say how long, exactly. Maybe four hours. The bag had been over his head for the duration, even when they had escorted him to the bathroom mid-flight.Four hours was enough time to travel from Virginia to any number of destinations.When he deboarded the airplane, though, he had a better sense of location. The dry air told him desert. Possibly. New Mexico, Arizona, maybe Utah. And then, a far off voice from a loudspeaker told him he was in Sedona. As soon as the loudspeaker had sounded, they ushered him along faster. He wasn’t supposed to know.Then, a forced ride in a car, and now shuffling along a hallway. Until this point, his captors had not said a single word to him. They pushed him to his right and then turned him around. Rough hands shoved him down, and Harry felt the hard wood of a chair connect with his butt. A splash of pain worked up his back.The bag whipped off. His eyes slammed shut from the sudden appearance of light. In a couple of seconds, he creaked them open, slowly letting them adjust. Chest heaving, feeling the weight of his belly push against his arms, still restrained.“Good morning, Harry,” said a musical male voice.He blinked a few more times until he could open his eyes all the way. He found himself in a bedroom. A single bed, queen-size, with metal piping for a headboard. Nightstands on either side, no clock or lamps. A small bathroom in a side room near the bed. There was a dresser and the chair he was sitting in, and a single piece of art on the walls. A framed print of a sun setting between two red rock spires.His hands were cuffed together. Red welts covered his wrists. He didn’t remember trying to resist and pull free from the cuffs, but he had, apparently.“How was your trip?” said the man. There were two of them. One, younger than Harry, maybe mid-thirties. He stood back near the door. Tall, white, a wiry frame with jet black hair and emerald eyes. A wicked sunburn had turned his light skin pink. Cheeks gaunt and hints of faded acne scars gave him dozens of pocks like dimples. His arms were crossed in front of him, a deep scowl on his face. Harry assumed this was the one who had brought him here.The other, the speaking man, was older. Fifties, probably. A sharp black suit on his average build. Gray and thinning hair sat atop a wrinkly face, with patchy stubble poking through. Huge hands, though,. Too big for his body. This man had kind brown eyes and a warm smile. | Visit jimheskett.com/seasonfive for podcast episode show notes.__________Want the inside scoop on each Layne Parrish novel, including info on how it was created and the inspiration for each story?Check out the video below for the awesome insider info, direct from the author himself!\ufeffWant to read the first chapter? You\'re in luck!Cameron Parrish hurtled through space, clinging to the metal chain links of the swing. Her three-year-old body blurred. As Layne waited for her to finish the climb and return in his direction, his ears filled with her frantic giggling. Pure joy streamed from her vocal cords.He couldn’t recall the last time he’d witnessed such flawless, unadulterated exultation. Maybe that was the point of having children; experiencing sensations through the eyes of someone not yet jaded or burned by the world.Layne stood behind her—the primary pusher—and Cameron’s mother, Inessa, was in the front. She would hold up her hands so Cameron could bump her feet against them. Each time it happened, Inessa beamed. Her smile, a mile wide, lit her face. Layne rarely pined for his ex-wife, but it wasn’t hard for him to remember why he’d been attracted to her in the first place.Also, too easy to remember why he’d divorced her."Okay!" Cameron shouted. "I’m done."When she returned his way, Layne grabbed either side of the swing and slowed her until the thing came to rest in the middle. He lifted her out of the contraption and set her on the playground, a soft area consisting of a sea of recycled tire bits. He held her there a moment to make sure she wasn’t dizzy."What next, little one?" he asked as he pushed up his shirt sleeves, revealing the tattoos blanketing both of his arms from shoulder to wrist.Her head swiveled around to evaluate the many wonders of this little park in Broomfield, Colorado. Close to where Cameron lived with her mother, some of the time. On this one compact block were the small city’s grade school and high school.As Cameron deliberated, Layne could even hear the classroom bell ringing at the high school at the edge of the park."Slide," Cam said. "I wanna go slide. A whole buncha times.""Slide it is," Layne said. As he stood back up, he met Inessa’s eyes, and both of their smiles faded. These co-parenting play dates had been his idea, but that didn’t make it any more pleasant to see his ex. Sometimes, he was even still mad at her.Layne had lots of practice in the art of being civil, and he considered himself to be quite skilled at it."We should talk about something," she said in her abrasive Russian accent. "It’s important.""Can it wait?" Layne said. "I have a thing to—"But before Layne could finish the sentence, a booming noise raced across the park. A crack, loud enough to interrupt his thoughts. The sound peaked and then dissipated with a rolling echo, like thunder.Except it hadn’t been thunder.When it happened the second time, Layne knew for sure. That had been a Kalashnikov AK-12 in a semi-automatic mode.A few more shots ripped across the courtyard. By instinct, Layne pulled Cameron close to him. He knelt, folding his arms around her. As Inessa gasped and covered her head with her hands, Layne’s eyes darted around, searching for the source of the blasts.Within a couple seconds, he’d found their origin.The shots were coming from inside the high school, just beyond the park. Layne studied the grounds adjacent to the school to be sure there were no shooters outside before he released his grip on his daughter.He then spun Cameron around and took a breath before speaking. He didn’t want her to notice the spike in his heart rate. "I need you to go with Mommy."Cameron nodded dumbly as he pushed his daughter back, toward her mother. Inessa stood there, frozen in a state of near panic. Layne took Cameron’s hand and inserted it into Inessa’s hand, pressing it there.He stood up and snapped his fingers in front of Inessa’s face. This broke his ex out of her trance. | Visit jimheskett.com/seasonfive for podcast episode show notes.__________Want the inside scoop on each Layne Parrish novel, including info on how it was created and the inspiration for each story?Check out the video below for the awesome insider info, direct from the author himself!\ufeffWant to read the first chapter? You\'re in luck!Layne Parrish slid his fingertips along the wooden ax handle. He appreciated the fine craftsmanship, the quality of the wood, and the razor-sharp edge of the blade.“You like it?” asked the receptionist at the lodge’s check-in desk.“What?” Layne said, angling his body toward her. As he did, he lowered his hand, since touching the ax had made the sleeve of his hoodie ride up, exposing the web of tattoos on one of his arms. Not that he expressly needed to hide his ink from this woman, but he liked to keep a low profile. During his pre-retirement jobs, Layne had to spend time cataloging what each contact knew or had seen. Too much work.Lots of work, yes, but also danger. In a situation like this, when anyone and everyone could be a suspect, care had to be exercised at all times. Letting the guard down for an instant could result in a grave mistake. Mistakes meant the targets would flee without accountability.Layne would not let them get away this time.“Sorry,” the receptionist said, her face folding like a bashful animal. “I saw you examining the ax, Mr. Priest. It was a gift from a member of the Coast Salish tribe in Vancouver. Their people used to live all up and down these mountains.”“Gotcha,” he said as he crossed the lodge’s room. Like a log cabin, the interior was stacked wood deeply stained brown, adorned with other similar objects hanging on the walls. Sets of old-timey snowshoes and long-necked rifles. Sepia-toned photographs in thin frames.He paused in front of a wolf’s head, mounted on the wall. The furry beast was in mid-growl, porcelain teeth tinged with yellow. “Is this real?” he asked.“Yes,” the receptionist said. “But he wasn’t hunted or anything of that sort. That wolf was a former resident of this area of the mountain. Some of them live in caves nearby, and we happened upon a recently deceased one at exactly the right time.”“Interesting.”Layne stepped to her desk, and she returned his passport, the American passport featuring his picture, but the name Leonard Priest.“There are still plenty of wolves wandering around, in case you decide to go for a hike. Many of them are not afraid of humans one bit.”“Noted.”“Have you been to Squamish Mountain Retreat Center before, Mr. Priest?”“Please, call me Leonard, or Lenny,” Layne said to the young woman with blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail so tight, her eyebrows arched. “And no, I haven’t. This is our first time in the area.”“Excellent, Leonard. There will be a formal orientation tomorrow morning, but feel free to grab any of the staff at any time, or call the lodge from your room. It’s a free and open sort of environment here.”He flipped through a guest book sitting on the counter. No one had signed it recently, but he made a few mental notes about things previous guests had marked. They talked about the sunsets and the hiking trails and all the typical tourist things. Since it was now in the dead of winter, Layne didn’t anticipate getting out on the hiking trails too much.“I appreciate the hospitality.”“I hope you’ll find the ‘new you’ you’ve been seeking. Everyone gets something unique from the SMRC and their stay here.”Layne accepted the two keycards for the bungalow and slid them into his pocket. “I’m counting on it.”Behind the woman’s head hung a set of crisscrossing pistols. Revolvers, at least a hundred years old. They reminded him of the Colt Peacemaker he sometimes carried.Layne pointed at them. “Those Mountie pieces?”“Oh, yes,” she said. “Donated to us by the Squamish Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant himself.

You\'re in luck!LAYNE PARRISH ALWAYS loved a good rumpus. Nestled in a cramped bed next to a little girl named Cameron, he flipped to the last page of Where the Wild Things Are.“Daddy,” she said.“Yes, little one.”“Why did Max go home? Why can’t he stay with the wild things?”“Because he missed his family.”Cameron stared at the page, an illustration of the protagonist sailing across the water toward home. Pale brow creased, her face riddled with confusion. Thinking. Her eyes were kaleidoscopic puddles of blue crystal, glistening under the meager light of the bedside lamp. The young child readjusted herself on the twin bed, and Layne had to pivot his weight to keep from slipping over the side.“He missed his mommy and daddy?”Layne nodded. “He did.”In his pocket, a phone buzzed. He slipped it out to find a call from an unknown number lighting up the screen. Unknown to the phone companies, but Layne had a strong suspicion who was on the line.The same person who had been calling and texting him relentlessly for the last two days.“Daddy, put it away. You said no more screens.”“You’re right,” he said as he jabbed it back into his pocket. “Watching screens after dark makes our eyes cross, right?” He crossed his eyes and let his tongue loll out.She giggled and poked his chest with a finger not much bigger than a toothpick. “Daddy, stop.”Cameron traced one of her fingers along his arm, gliding across one particular section of the tattoos that covered it from wrist to shoulder. A cherub in the middle of his forearm, obscuring a gunshot wound from long ago. The cherub now appeared faded and blurry on his forty-year-old arms.The phone squirmed inside his pocket again, demanding attention. A repeat call. This time, though, he ignored the eager person on the other end of the line.“It’s time for bed,” he said.She pondered this for a moment and then frowned. “Are the wild things going to get me?”“You’re a wild thing,” he said, and his fingers leaped to her belly for a tickle. She cackled, writhing, and he instantly regretted it. Bedtime was supposed to be calm time. But he couldn’t resist torturing such an easy target.“Okay, okay, little one. Time for bed, for real.”She pushed out a breath, the remnants of tickle energy fading. Her lids were heavy, her motions thick, like a person wading through swampy water. She was an inch away from sleep. Layne anticipated no bedtime false starts tonight.“I love you much, Daddy.”He kissed her forehead as he drew the covers up to her shoulders. “And I love you much, little one.”He sneaked across the room and rested a hand on the light switch. “I’ll be right downstairs, okay?”“Okay, Daddy.”Layne flicked out the light and stole one last look at her, a miniature head nestled on a Thomas the Tank Engine pillow. He closed the door behind him as his phone buzzed yet again. Didn’t bother to take it out.Next, a knock came at the front door, downstairs. He paused for a moment in front of his daughter’s room to make sure she wouldn’t call out. No way she was asleep already, but maybe she hadn’t heard it. The excitement of someone coming to the door would turn bedtime into a circus requiring a whole new set of little kid cooldown routines.She made no sound. No vibration through the door.Layne held perfectly still until another knock came. He wasn’t unreachable in this small town, but he almost never had visitors. And never unannounced or after dark. The neighbors knew about bedtime policy and wouldn’t betray Layne’s evening ritual.He hustled down the stairs, past the fireplace, and through the living room to the front door.
