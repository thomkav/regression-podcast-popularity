Most of the diversity and inclusion conversations have been solely focused on race and gender. But many aspects of diversity are not as visible. Diversity of thought has to be brought to the forefront. To allow for people to have different perspectives and kinds of experiences that can be shared at work. While an organization can value diversity, it doesn\'t necessarily make it an inclusive one. Inclusion is about creating workplaces where people can feel comfortable bringing their WHOLE selves to work.\xa0Leaders and managers are only as strong as the people backing and supporting them. Inclusion is what makes diversity work.Key episode takeaway: "We\'ve never seen such a diverse amount of people in the labor pool as we see today. Whether it\'s through a generation standpoint, race, sexual orientation, social-economic status–everyone is different. When organizations can learn to capitalize on diversity, it can help them to get ahead faster."---EARN SHRM RECERTIFICATION PDCs FOR LISTENINGHonest HR podcast episodes will help you build your competencies while you earn professional development credits (PDCs) toward your SHRM-CP/SHRM-SCP recertification!

When employees are losing sleep over unexpected expenses, their work is affected.\xa0Customizing any program to meet every individual need can be difficult. What is your organization doing to help employees navigate financial wellness?\xa0Think outside the box. Explore unique short-term options alongside longer-term programs. Ensure your employees know about the programs you do provide, and how to access them if they need to. Just because you have a program doesn’t mean your employees know about them! And what they don’t know won’t help.Key episode takeaway: Push past the administrative hurdles and burdens that may come with providing alternative financial wellness programs—it’s benefits like these that can make the difference between a happy engaged employee and one that is looking to leave. ---EARN SHRM RECERTIFICATION PDCs FOR LISTENINGHonest HR podcast episodes will help you build your competencies while you earn professional development credits (PDCs) toward your SHRM-CP/SHRM-SCP recertification!

After all of his filmmaking, not getting into film school and having to go with the flow, (28:20). With no agent and not much happening locally, Mark catches a crazy break.... that takes a year, (30:58). “I knew I could do it...”, (32:48). Going into massive debt to make movies when nothing was paying him, (35:30). Watching Edward Norton in Primal Fear and thinking, “oh, that’s a performance,” (38:10). “Eventually someone’s\xa0gonna\xa0think I can do it the way I think I can do it,” (39:34). PWI - Passion Will Inform, (40:02). “If you have passion, Will and information, you’ll be fine,” (43:11). The move from Canada to Hollywood, (44:10).

I\'m just very impressed with his whole operation.\xa0 And sitting down with him I was amazed to find something out about him that I never would have guessed.\xa0 But, again, like all of his work, it\'s something I didn\'t see because he has worked so hard to overcome it and succeeded.\xa0 He loves sports, loves to compete, but what you\'ll hear as we speak is that he has extreme compassion and generosity at the core of his being.\xa0    \xa0   SHOW NOTES:\xa0\xa0   “What I do today is a professional speaker and coach, with a lot of emphasis on resilience, mental toughness”, (1:59). Have a long-term goal in mind to always keep you focused, (5:00). “You just have to bob and weave to get to where you want to go, don’t give up on your mission and vision”, (7:10). How his past experiences led to his desires for achieving success, (9:01). “Being a highly competitive person in general, I had to learn the difference between healthy competing and trying to compare compete with everyone”, (9:50). “I have ADHD, so I must be really good at wearing multiple hats and writing everything down, while staying consistent and on track”, (17:00). Running a business requires consistency and leadership because every decision you make will impact the team and company, (20:00). Read books and connect with people, (22:02). “It’s about not being afraid to test things and see what works and what doesn’t so you don’t really know what\'s going to fit your business and your personality until you give it a shot”, (22:58). Entrepreneurship is like a puzzle, it’s really intriguing but the best part is when you do not give up, and let your grow mindset help you rise and thrive, (26:07). The better I can do my job the more people I could help, if you want to succeed help other people succeed, (29:30). A winning competitor in life or someone that I can consider successful in life have grit, they have a growth mindset, they practice gratitude, they pursue greatness in everything that they do, and then they groom others, (31:15). Grit and growth mindset allows you to endure the “no’s”, the 10,000 “No”s\xa0they allow you to keep growing and getting better. Gratitude is what allows you to enjoy the process because without gratitude we lose sight of the why, purpose and the journey that is life. Greatness means are you consistently showing up, do you have that attention to detail are you giving your best to everything that you do. Finally, true leadership is not about the followers you have but the leaders you create. What are you doing as a mentor to give back and help build others around you? These make a successful life because you are building a legacy, (31:56). Never let a hard day win, (34:20). We tend to have a huge goal and not take it one step at a time, don’t let setbacks win, use that as motivation to keep going. All plans will unfold beautifully if taken one step at a time, (37:00). The biggest key for us, it’s not to get frustrated or demotivated by how far we have to go or how much we have to do, just take one step, because those little steps start to add up overtime. It’s when we decided it’s too far or too long that we quit and let one day into two, into weeks. Just treat it like a game of tag, (38:50). “The word no means not yet, keep competing, and don’t be as distracted by the opposite sex and don’t be afraid of challenges that are ahead of you, use them as opportunities to grow,” (41:20).\xa0    \xa0   \xa0 LINKS:\xa0   Podcast: Compete Every Day\xa0   Jake Thompson: The Team\xa0   Jake Thompson: Motivational Speaking\xa0   Instagram: @lifeisworthcompetingfor\xa0   Twitter: @JakeAThompson\xa0    \xa0   RELATED PAST EPISODES OF 10,000 “No”s:\xa0\xa0   EP 11: Panic Attacks to Perfect Life, Craig Ballantyne\xa0   Ep 73: Best-selling Author/Speaker/ Pro/College Sport & Fortune 500 Leadership Consultant,\xa0 Jon Gordon, on Grit, Attitude\xa0 & Faith\xa0   Ep 75: How to Transform Your Body & Persona, Strength Coach, Transformation Specialist & Super-Connector, Jay Ferruggia\xa0 \xa0 \xa0If you like what you hear, please Subscribe, leave an iTunes review and spread the word.

(2:35). The odds of a person being born to being the person that they are have been described as astronomical, (2:57).

Unfortunately, it hasn’t gotten any cheaper. Anyone who’s ever purchased an ink cartridge knows how ridiculously expensive printing things can be. So what’s an entrepreneur to do when they need banners, flyers, t-shirts, business cards, and everything else?Today, we’ve got 4 specific tricks you can use to lower the cost of printed materials and raise the return on investment. And don’t worry — we’re not talking about cutting corners here, or doing things on the cheap. You can lower the cost without sacrificing one iota of quality.You just have to know how.We’ll explain the most efficient process for creating print materials, and discuss where (and how) to look for the best price. Get the job done beautifully, without blowing your marketing budget. Click Play! | Never stop learning. Part of being a successful entrepreneur is keeping up on the latest ways to be better at...well, everything.But especially marketing.Of course, there’s a ton of content out there, and roughly eighty bazillion “gurus” with blogs full of advice on how to market. That’s why today, we’re sharing the 5 blogs we ourselves read. They’re so good — so valuable — that even our absurdly busy selves consider them worth every second we spend reading them.Some are general, some focus on specifics like writing or video marketing. Some have been around for years; others are newish to the scene. Some are long. Some are short. Some are more inspirational, others more practical. Some are daily, and some are not even monthly. But all of them make us better marketers, one blog at a time.Hear which blogs we bookmarked and subscribed to, and see if you agree. Find out what we look for in a blog, and why these 5 stand out. Most importantly, hear how you can integrate their value into your business journey. Click Play! | We keep hearing it’s a global marketplace out there. Unfortunately, not all of the globe has access to the same resources and services that make entrepreneurship possible. What’s an international business person to do?It’s Q&A Wednesday, and we’ve got a listener who can’t find a payment processor willing to do business with their Nigeria-based company. It’s a sad fact of our “global” business scene that it can be nearly impossible to get payment processing, banking, and credit services when you’re in certain countries. But there’s a solution. An incredible, fairly recent, game-changing solution for anyone willing to do business across borders.Tune in, and hear about this little-known trick that can shatter borders — and barriers — for your business. Click Play! | There’s a ton of competition for you, but you’re ready to play anyway. So how do you win?If you’re diving into a crowded, highly competitive market (think fitness coaching or social media app development), there’s a single fact you have to accept: having a great product isn’t enough. You’ve got to have more than just the best thing to sell.The sooner you learn this, the better. A fantastic product is a floor, not a ceiling.Today, we discuss what you have to do to have any chance in a space with tons of other companies. We would know: we’ve both succeeded and failed in competitive markets (It turns out we’re not the only business coaches or SaaS developers out there. Who knew?). Today’s advice might sound...off to you, at first. It’s counterintuitive, and it involves letting go of certain customers (a lot of them, actually). But it’s tried, it’s true, and it’s the best hope for any entrepreneur bold enough to take on an army of other businesses. Click Play! | Every entrepreneur has a toolkit. Adding to that toolkit adds to your potential. There’s one tool that’s undeniably valuable, and can instantly multiply your reach: speaking another language. Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs never think of it. Others don’t pursue it, because they’re afraid it’s too difficult. But without a doubt, learning a language can be huge for you and your business. Best of all, it might not be as difficult as you think.Steve Kaufmann speaks multiple languages, and has seen how it opens doors. He’s the founder of language-learning service Lingq, and he’s this week’s guest teacher.Today, Kaufmann offers a surprisingly convenient trick to accelerate language learning, so you can make a serious effort towards being bi or multi-lingual. This isn’t one of our typical business episodes, but it’s deeply, profoundly relevant to making the most of yourself as an entrepreneur. Tune in, and see how you can reach entire markets you’ve never even considered. Click Play! | Netflix...am I right?I mean, they did it. They really did it. Netflix took a perfectly un-disrupted industry (movie rentals) and coolly demolished a corporate behemoth (remember Blockbuster?), seemingly without breaking a sweat. And before you knew it, they pivoted to pioneer an absolutely groundbreaking new way to deliver entertainment.Was it luck? Was it some endless stream of financing? Was it the will of the Business Gods?Of course not. It was strategy, courage, innovation, and no small amount of risk. Today, we explore the uniquely valuable, inventive business model that’s proved not just enduring, but culturally relevant and personally important to millions of consumers. More importantly, we dissect just how they did it.We’ve distilled 3 distinct lessons the story of Netflix can teach any entrepreneur. By understanding the principles behind their success, you can emulate the Netflix approach and make your own disruptive mark on your corner of the market. Click Play! | Billboards just won’t cut it anymore.Today, it seems like every kind of company is investing in media: everything from books to series to full-on films, all for marketing purposes. Is it a wise investment? Does someone who sells shoes or auto parts or coding courses need a movie to convert their audience? Well, maybe.It’s all about the impact of “touchpoint” marketing, and the need to give way more than the marketers of the past ever had to. Today, customers need more than a pitch: they need a narrative. Every cent (and every minute) you spend on media can come back to you tenfold, provided you execute wisely.Today, we discuss how multimedia efforts add weight and momentum to all your other marketing efforts, and why even startups with beginner budgets can afford to make their mark with compelling media content. Click Play! | Where’s the line between you and your business?Legally speaking, it’s a question worth asking. It’s Q&A Wednesday, and we’re helping one listener decide when it’s time to register a business as a separate entity from themselves. A solopreneur is still running a business, after all — even if it’s a one-person show.Of course, there are advantages and disadvantages to both sole proprietorship and registering a completely separate business.While the rules can vary from nation to nation, most of the Western world has a pretty clear set of standards that can help you make the best decision. We’ll share what we know from experience, as well as point you in the direction of who exactly you should ask. Listen in, and hear why not registering as a business can make it difficult to measure your success. Learn about the effects of registering on everything from your taxes to your personal credit. Get the facts, and make an informed choice. Click Play! | We all need a break. That includes your employees.As your team grows, it’s inevitable that your team members will ask for some downtime. For that reason, it’s important to have a set policy in place that defines when and how they can access a little R&R. Plan for it now, and you’ll avoid problems later.There’s a spectrum of leave policies, from “take off whenever you want” to “we work 24/7 365.” Generally speaking, both extreme ends of the spectrum have been proven ineffective. Where you land on the Time Off Question can make all the difference to your team’s happiness, productivity, and long-term loyalty.Today, we discuss the ins and outs of leave policy, from national holidays to sick time to those ill-defined “personal” days. We explore what to include in contracts and other employment agreements, especially with remote teams with a diverse array of holidays and cultural priorities. Tune in, and create a company culture that lets your people rest and recharge without sacrificing productivity. Click Play! | How did they do it? It’s a question entrepreneurs ask about other successful startups all the time. Very rarely do we get a full, honest answer. Even more rarely do we get an answer that’s completely original.But every once in a while…Shape Up by Ryan Singer is the true story of how the wildly successful Basecamp blazed their own trail, with creative approaches to business management that no one else dared to try. Basecamp’s management model is unique and idiosyncratic, and it might not work for everyone — but it’s sure worth learning about.If you’re building a business — especially one with a digital product — the lessons outlined in Shape Up are incredibly valuable. Again, you might not agree with every move Basecamp made (some of their tactics are controversial, to say the least), but challenging “best practices” and questioning your assumptions is always healthy.Hear all about this book, and get inspired to seek new and inventive ways of doing business.

The first time, she went for fashion designing. The second time, she went for business.\xa0 The third time, she went for communications. It just wasn’t for her.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Literally 2 months after dropping out the last time, she had already started her hair business. People would always ask her where she would get her hair extensions from and thought that people should definitely pay her for it.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 She set herself apart by creating a professional, upscale and chic brand right from the beginning.\xa0 She used her sales skills to bring in revenue and by the end of the first year, she grew over 6 figures.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 She’s not only in the hair business, but she’s also mentoring young entrepreneurs on how to start and grow their business.\xa0 \xa0 I love Atiyah’s story because she took her life into her own hands.\xa0 Most of us don’t realize it until we’re $30k in debt.

Ask people how they would define that word and you’ll find several answers. But when it comes down to one person’s version what it means to be an entrepreneur compared to another person’s version, I’ve witnessed far too often judgement being thrown each other’s way.Now, there’s no doubt that there are different types and structures of self-employment, entrepreneurship, and business ownership – each with their own dynamic and process. There’s no arguing that a high-growth entrepreneur is different, in many ways, from a lifestyle entrepreneur. I certainly have my own definition of entrepreneurship which some people would or would not fit into. Frankly, on this soapbox, I’m not concerned with the actual definition or what is and what isn’t entrepreneurship. That’s not my issue with business shaming.Find out what I’m ranting about in today\'s episode | Sometimes there\'s simply not time to get everything you want to get done, done.It\'s hard as a business owner to remember:\xa0\xa0Not everything is as important as we think it is.I think that realization in and of itself is one of the biggest challenges facing any entrepreneur. With so much we WANT to do, those wants often get confused with "needs to get done". This becomes a problem when it comes time to prioritize and understand what\'s more important and what can wait if need be.I\'ve got a strategy that works really well for me and it\'s a pretty simple one. Find out what it is on today\'s podcast. | I figured it only necessary to share with you one of my favorite parables, seeing as how we are closing out the first month of the year already.As we end January, complete with our goals for 2016, it\'s worthwhile checking in with yourself to see if you still understand\xa0why you\'re working so hard and what you\'re hoping to achieve. I share with you one of my favorite parables; the parable of the investment banker and the Mexican fisherman. | You guys know how important feedback is to our business.\xa0Feedback means growth.\xa0Feedback means accelerated success.But sometimes soliciting and receiving feedback can be a tough path to head down (which is why a lot of people simply don\'t do it - they\'re afraid of what they are going to hear).I recently embarked down my own path of solicited feedback and I\'m sharing the response I got.\xa0Luckily, I was in the privacy of my own office - alone - and could react first, then follow a more normal protocol in terms of putting that feedback to good use.So what do you do when you get feedback, especially when it stings?\xa01. Remember that the purpose of soliciting for feedback is not to hear what you want to hear (although it\'s great when that happens). The purpose is to hear perceptual truth from potential users.2. Next ask yourself if their truth is your truth. Is it applicable? Or is that a perception that is irrelevant or misaligned with your purpose and your audience (as it was in the feedback I shared with you - she clearly wasn\'t my target).3. Don\'t over-analyze or make changes based on one assessment alone, especially if that assessment seems a bit extreme. Seek more input until you see patterns emerge.4. Give it some time. Try to get your feedback or at least react to your feedback in isolation. Chances are, you\xa0are\xa0going to react. Once you can shake away all the emotions, you can truly process from a practical business standpoint.5. When you make changes, split test the changes with your original to ensure it really makes sense. This is called an A/B split. Find a way to test both and make a comparison. You may find the original really was better aligned. | You might of guessed it, this week\'s pep talk is all about new year\'s resolutions, and the one thing it takes to ensure successful in reaching those goals.\xa0Also, the link to our private Facebook community is right here:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/groups/bestkeptselfcommunity/Click on over and request access! | Monday morning pep talks delivered straight to your inbox to help you start your week right.

As Fleet characterizes, mindfulness, compassion, and the practice of loving-kindness are at the crux of radical responsibility. By embracing ownership for each and every circumstance we face in life (without assigning blame or cultivating a victim narrative) we are better able to reflect upon our current situations and assess creative solutions for moving forward. In considering radical responsibility, Jerry and Fleet tackle three important questions: How am I complicit in creating the conditions I don’t want? In what way can I take ownership for circumstances that I may not have any complicity in? What can be gained from holding your seat amongst the chaos of life?

On this week’s podcast, you\'ll meet one female founder who generously shares her story and the singular obstacles she’s been summoned to encounter. A former corporate litigator, Amy Nelson is now the CEO and founder of the Riveter, a workspace which provides support and equal opportunities for women leaders and changemakers. Born in Seattle in 2017, The Riveter has experienced explosive expansion - with five locations being built in the first 16 months. As a result, Amy is now facing down the many hurdles that emerge during a period of rapid scaling. In this conversation with Jerry, Amy expounds on a few of the barriers she’s come up against when raising capital and what it means to take her seat as a leader . Jerry introduces Amy to Parker Palmer’s image of “The Tragic Gap,” recognizing that Amy has been called to stand in the space between the world that is, and the world that is possible. Carrying the burden for all female entrepreneurs to forge a future where women not only have equal opportunity but a true place of belonging as leaders, forging a system where all individuals are worthy of the freedom to actualize in the fullness of who they are.

On this episode of the Reboot Podcast we welcome Jules Pieri, (Co-founder and CEO of The Grommet) back to the show for the third time. In this dialogue with Jerry, Jules describes the maker space and shares a few stories about entrepreneurs from her new book How We Make Stuff Now: Turn Ideas into Products That Build Successful Businesses. Jerry and Jules note how loneliness often accompanies the maker experience and touch on the importance of peer support in the maker community. Jules expands on how tenacity is integral for a maker’s success and how learning to tackle fear creates more resilient leaders. As Pieri proclaims, “people who manage to pursue their ambitions learn to recognize the fear and walk into, rather than practice avoidance.” Leave us a review on iTunes!

In this dialogue, Dan and Jerry explore the importance of radical self-inquiry in leadership and life. Jerry conveys the ways in which the sub-routines of our youth influence the way we show up, meet, and communicate with those around us, and how stepping into adulthood requires that we examine the negative parts of ourselves that we don’t want to own.

While email, video calls, and chatting services provide the means to instantly connect, how successfully do we \u200btruly\u200b manage to communicate within all these channels? For Sara Hicks, CEO and Co-founder of Reaction Commerce, and recently appointed CTO Mathias Meyer, finding congruence via communication is paramount. On this episode of the Reboot Podcast, Sara and Mathias turn to Jerry for support in establishing a blueprint for their new business partnership, specifically looking to gain insight on how to communicate successfully across a large geographical barrier. In this conversation, Jerry puts forth the notion that all human interactions in relationships (whether work or personal) stem from our desire to feel love, safety, and belonging. Jerry helps Mathias and Sara unearth the ways in which their old patterns of communication may be tied to their personal fears around belonging. Jerry encourages Mathias and Sara to consider how exquisite communication built around empathetic connection grants them the opportunity to stand shoulder to shoulder as leaders and adults, offering them the chance to support each other in their journeys towards growing up.

The Emmy Award-winning filmmaker recently received the United Nations\' highest environmental honor, the Champions of the Earth award, for his work on spreading powerful environmental messages to a global audience. Believing that film remains one of the best mediums for effecting positive change, Jeff founded Exposure Labs. Self-described as an ‘impact production company,’ their mission focuses on utilizing visceral, honest storytelling to enact change and enable open conversations on tough subjects. In this conversation, Jeff discusses the parallels of filmmaking and serial entrepreneurship, reflecting on how his new projects can generate the same feelings of uncertainty, thrill, and fear that often arise in early-stage startups. Jeff shares his journey into filmmaking and how he sees himself first and foremost as a problem solver. Together, Jerry and Jeff hold a dialogue on Purpose, pondering its elusiveness, why we chase it and the reasons we often seek our purpose in the ‘wrong’ places. Leave us a review on iTunes!

At the time of this conversation, Alex had reached out to Jerry for guidance and support through a particularly cloudy transitional period. While the transition in her professional career served as a catalyst for their conversation, Jerry encourages Alex to consider what may also be bubbling under the surface in her personal life. Alex opens up about finding joy in being present, recognizing that this break has afforded her the ability to reconnect to her body, her passions, and her community. Jerry notes that this pause, a time of contemplation and rest, provides a profound opportunity to shift Alex’s way of being in the world, granting her the freedom to redefine her definition of happiness and success. As she embarks on this new relationship with herself, the doors open for Alex to become the leader she wants to be. Leave us a review on Itunes!

Whether unforeseen or even expected, transitions provide an opportunity to consider where we are now and where we’d like to be in the future. As our center of gravity shifts, we\'re given space to ponder what\'s on the horizon, oftentimes considering how we will find our way forward when we’re still so strongly tied to the version of ourselves we left behind. On this episode of the Reboot Podcast, we introduce you to David Ryan, former Managing Director and Co-founder of Corilla, a collaborative content tool for software teams. In this conversation, David reflects on his decision to shut down his organization and the period of transition it has heralded forward. David expresses gratitude for his time as CEO and explores embracing the uncertainty of stepping into the newest stage of his life as an author. As Jerry gently reminds David, life unfolds as a series of entrances and exits; we must all learn to softly close doors on previous chapters of our lives in order to fully open to what’s next. With each transition, we have the beautiful opportunity to reflect and grow from the experiences that have shaped us. Carrying the threads of the past onward, we weave the tapestry of our lives, creating the pattern for a story that is uniquely, undeniably yours. Leave us a review on Itunes!

First, we have to consider how the brain functions. How does someone receive information when it’s coming from you? It’s not just about setting expectations and giving feedback, expecting to see results, but leaders need to take the time to think about how those expectations are set and how feedback is delivered. | Brad Stulberg expands upon the scientific and practical formulas that achieve peak performance. He tells us that the mastery behind personal and professional gains can be achieved by anyone because it comes down to understanding that the purpose for what anyone does has to be more powerful than themselves. |  | Frans Johansson talks to Jennifer and Greg about leveraging the Medici Effect, a place where intersectional ideas come together from diverse industries and cultures to create undiscovered innovations. He emphasizes how these unique ideas come to fruition and tells us how to make these breakthrough discoveries.

Liz Wiseman talks to Jennifer and Greg about the traits, characteristics and culture it takes for a leader to maximize talents and competencies among their organization in the midst of challenges and obstacles. |  It’s important to come to terms with the fact that when we show up to work, we’re still people. If you consider yourself the type who only cares about results, you need to come to terms with the fact that you’re not going to get what you want if you don’t take others’ emotions into consideration. | Henry, Greg and Jennifer sit down with Kat Popiel to talk about taking risks while being humble enough to admit that you don’t have all the answers, yet having the willingness and energy to try.

I have made several hiring mistakes over the years and my hope is that this episode will help you surround yourself with a high performing team that allows you to stay focused on the work and home responsibilities that are most fulfilling to you. Have you ever wondered why your team isn’t as outstanding as you’d hoped for? Creating a high performing team is something that every CEO wants.

When your team isn’t performing to your standards, it can often feel like you’re tolerating too much. This isn’t the ‘dream team’ you hoped for when you launched your business and you don’t have to put up with it. If you’re fed up with mediocre team members and want to learn how to build a high performing team that you can be proud of, tune into this special episode with Shelli Warren!

Today I am joined by Linked In expert, speaker and podcaster Louise Brogan of Social Bee NI we are talking how to create a posting strategy, the power of showcasing your thought leadership on LinkedIn, what to do after you publish an article to get more engagement, how to repurpose content from other sources on linked in, the difference between connections and followers and features of LinkedIn Premium and a really cool way to use the LinkedIn app to find others at the same event that are in and out of your network. Connect with Louise on LinkedIn Connect with Natalie on LinkedIn With over 645+ million users, LinkedIn takes the crown as the world’s largest professional network. The ability to tap into a pool of potential clients and make connections that can help grow your brand is where the true power of LinkedIn lies. This isn’t the first time Louise has been on the podcast. A year ago, she joined me for an on-air coaching session, where we talked about whether or not it was a smart business move to specialize on one platform. 12 months later and her decision to niche down and focus solely on LinkedIn has proved to be one of the best decisions she ever made. Bonus Tips! Louise shared so many amazing LinkedIn tips with us including how to get started with LinkedIn Live. Because LinkedIn Live is still in the initial testing stages, the feature isn’t available to all LinkedIn members. If you want access to the LinkedIn Live feature, you need to apply to become a live video broadcaster via a simple application process. A great way to gain more followers without actually connecting with anyone is to switch your LinkedIn profile button from ‘connect’ to ‘follow.’ To do this, login to the LinkedIn app on your phone and tap on your profile. Select “Settings & Privacy” and then click on “Followers.” You’ll see a section beneath it that says, “Make follow primary,” and all you have to do is choose “yes” and your profile’s primary button will become “Follow” rather than “Connect.” \xa0 Connect With Louise Brogan  Website LinkedIn Facebook Instagram  Books, Tools or Events Mentioned: ·\xa0BizChix Live Other Links Mentioned:   Wear the Madonna Headset Social Bee Podcast  BizChix Episodes Mentioned:   331: [On Air Coaching] How to Decide Whether to Specialize with Louise Brogan  Listen to Stacking Your Team Work with Us:  Strategy Session (1/1 coaching) GrowthChix Accelerator Program ProfitChix Mastermind CEOCHIX Mastermind  Join the BizChix Community This episode was first published at BizChix.com/382.

The secret to getting good fast is effective roleplay. You must practice it correctly for it to work. Here are the 5 steps to roleplaying like a pro:  Play with players only. The more experienced players you practice with, the better you’ll get. Only practice with those who are actually making money getting appointments. They already know what real sellers will say, and how to handle objections. No small talk. When roleplaying w/ another agent, jump straight into the script. You’re there to practice not to chat Practice as if it’s real. You create muscle memory with the words and tonality. As you practice, your subconscious starts feeling more comfortable with it. Stand up. You have more energy standing up. This makes people more interested in talking to you. Always get the desired outcome. (Don’t practice failing).  If you roleplay consistently, you can always expect YES! It’ll be so much easier for you to practice roleplaying if you have the best no-B.S. scripts on hand.

From Kevin Ward, international real estate trainer, speaker, and coach | Do you want to start role-playing but don’t know how? The 2 important things you will need are good scripts and great role-play partners.

From Kevin Ward, international real estate trainer, speaker, and coach | This is the biggest LIE told to people who are getting into real estate: ”Real estate is easy and anyone can do it..." The truth is, it’s hard! 80% of real estate agents will fail and quit. Real estate is hard because you have no salary. You earn from commissions, so there are no guarantees. You create your own structure because you have no boss to tell you what to do. The good news is, there is massive opportunity in real estate. The start-up cost is low, and entry is fast. If you do things right, the potential to earn a 6-figure income is more realistic in real estate than from a job you get out of college. So, how do you start real estate in a way that will help you succeed? Here are the 4 things you should have:  HIGH ACHIEVER ATTITUDE.\xa0(Strong self-image, problem-solver, self-starter, enthusiasm in the face of failure). Know how to handle criticism and be determined to push through. STRONG WORK ETHIC.\xa0Take initiative, push yourself every day. You are your own boss. TEACHABLE MINDSET.\xa0You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Learn from someone who’s already done it. COMMITMENT TO MASTERY.\xa0Commit to being the best at what you do.  Put all that together and you can succeed beyond your wildest expectations. If you think this is for you, download your FREE copy of the\xa0Agent Success Blueprint here. It will give you what you need to build a successful 6-figure business in your first 12 months as an agent. If this episode helps you, please LIKE, COMMENT & SHARE.

From Kevin Ward, international real estate trainer, speaker, and coach | How do you handle it when friends or family use a different agent?  1.

From Kevin Ward, international real estate trainer, speaker, and coach | Is the recession coming? How should agents prepare? What should we expect? Last year, I shot a video on "HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE COMING MARKET CRASH." What is my take on it today? It’s an EMERGENCY! The recession is coming...but...it’s not here yet. If you’re not making money now when the market is still good, then you’re already in a personal financial crisis. So, what’s the answer? Stop asking the wrong questions. Here are the RIGHT questions: 1. What should I be doing?  Working, not worrying. Massive action drives out fear. Prospecting and following up. Perfecting skills. Playing to win, not playing NOT to lose.  2. How should I be thinking?  Your thoughts and mindset are more critical than anything else. Thinking about the disaster doesn’t serve you. Decide whether you want to focus on survival or massive success.  If you want to crush it when the recession comes, you have to be committed to winning. Be all in to win. Choose not to participate in the recession. Be clear about your aim to succeed. Constantly take action, assess the situation and adjust as needed. That’s how you win!

If you’re struggling, here are 10 steps to start winning: GET A DREAM…a big exciting dream that’s unbelievable and immerse yourself in that dream. GET TOUGH. Stop thinking you can win by being a nice guy. (You are in a fight.) It makes people think you\'re weak, which makes them feel insecure hiring you. GET UP. Get up earlier and start your day strong. Stop playing from flat on your back (emotionally.) GET DRESSED UP.\xa0Look the way you want to feel. GET TO WORK.\xa0Work as if your life depended on it. Stop wasting time…dodging, drifting, or distracted. GET SELFISH\xa0so you can be unselfish. Take care of you first. "Love your neighbor as yourself." GET A CHAMPIONSHIP MINDSET.\xa0Go pro. Reject everything mediocre. Play to WIN vs playing not to lose. Too many are focused on surviving or security…treading water. GET RID OF THE BAGGAGE. GET OVER IT.\xa0Stop getting offended.

If the seller says it’s their fault that it was overpriced You explain to them that a professional agent wouldn’t follow their advice instead of his expertise just to please them. If the seller says it was the agent who suggested the wrong price You ask the seller why they would go back to the same agent when he has already mispriced the expired listing. You make them realize the problem of having an agent who will list it at the WRONG PRICE- knowing that it’s overpriced- just to get the listing and make them happy. You remind them that as a skilled agent, you get every one of your listings sold for top dollar because you never take a\xa0\xa0chance on mispricing it. A skilled agent knows that a lot of preparation and follow-through at the post-negotiation stage are major factors in selling expired listings for top dollar.

Working with seasoned investors is completely different than working with normal home buyers and sellers. Many people that call themselves “Investors” are not really investors and will waste your time, so learn to identify those that are serious and are actually prepared to invest. Working with Investors Find them. Prequalify them. Find out if they’re actually in investor. Do the have funds and/or fruit? Learn how investors think. They want a DEAL because they are looking for profit or positive cash flow. Understand how investors buy. Often You/they may go through 100 properties, to make 10 offers, to get 1 or 2 deals. “Low Ball” Offers are the way most investors do business. Get used to having most offers rejected or ignored. Learn from them. The education you receive from working with a seasoned investor can be priceless in building your own financial freedom. If this episode helps you, please LIKE, COMMENT & SHARE.

Here are three steps to winner more listings with your ears:  Master the scripts so you stop thinking about what to say next. Listen to the client with total focus. Take notes on the Seller Sheet.  \xa0Take notes of their plans, motivation, their house, pain points… their goals and dreams… and the words they use.

This week, we continue our discussion of clearing and visioning for 2019. In Part II of the Cleaning the Slate series, Elizabeth invites you to consider whether there are people in your life who do not serve you, and offers her best coaching on how to let them go. Connections are so important to our health and well-being. We need to be in relationships with people who meet our emotional needs on a regular basis. Our need for connection is innate. Our brains require face-to-face contact. We thrive when we are witnessed and see our best selves reflected back by people we love and trust. Take an end-of-year inventory of your relationships. Purposefully choose those that serve you. Let go of those that are toxic. Sometimes we have to say, “This relationship has run its course.” Let Elizabeth show you how in Episode 18 of The Women’s Leadership Podcast:  Cleaning The Slate, Part II: Eliminating Toxic Relationships.

One initial step to creating the space for change is wiping the slate clean of daily habits that no longer serve. Think about the places in your daily life where things just aren’t flowing the way you want them to, where stress or dread crop up. Those are likely the moments in your day when you’re keeping the plates spinning, but it’s by default rather than by design. Now, imagine how you could change up that routine to remove the stress and dread, and instead invite more flow and ease. Wipe the slate clean of all your preconceived notions about how that routine needs to go, and think creatively about how you can redesign it. As we move toward 2019, do yourself a favor. Make a note of a moment where daily life is stressful. Then, imagine all the ways you could transform that moment so that it serves rather than depletes you. \xa0\xa0 For more on creating routines and habits that serve, check out Episode 17 of The Women’s Leadership Podcast:  Cleaning The Slate: Shifting Negative Daily Habits.

But how do you explain the lack of certain skills in an interview? Find Your Dream Job guest Eric B.

But all too often, employers avoid\xa0 getting back to applicants unless they plan to bring them in for an interview. And even then, you may go in for an interview and not hear back about the final hiring decision. While it seems like common courtesy for employers to respond to everyone who applies, Find Your Dream Job guest Jennifer Tardy says that some hiring managers are so inundated with applicants that they simply don’t have time to reply to everyone.

Travis shares how he got clear about his goals and how faith in himself gave him the confidence to try something new.\xa0 | When you bomb a job interview, it feels terrible. Don’t get discouraged, it’s possible that it wasn’t entirely your fault. Maybe you expected to speak one-on-one with the hiring manager and you walked into a panel of people asking you questions. Perhaps you were prepared to answer behavioral questions, but instead you received off-the-wall questions you did not anticipate.

Knowing what makes you unique helps employers see how you can help them and allows you to figure out where you will thrive. But how do you discover what makes you unique?

Since finding that next job can take a while, you need to use that time to hone in on your unique strengths and talents. On this episode of Find Your Dream Job, Alfredo Moreno (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredovmoreno/) shares how refining his elevator pitch helped him to see the things he valued most, as a professional and as a person. Alfredo also shares how goal setting and accountability helped him keep his focus, even during a months-long job search. Learn more about Alfredo’s career history below in this installment of our Success Stories series (https://www.macslist.org/articles/success-stories). What do you do for a career? Who do you work for? I’m the community relations manager at Portland Community College’s Rock Creek campus (https://www.pcc.edu/about/locations/rock-creek/) in Washington County. How long did it take you to find this job? It was a long process, but with different stages of intensity. I had my periscope up for about 16 months overall, but I was particularly intentional, strategic, and intense about it for the final nine months. How did you find your job? What resources did you use? What tool or tactic helped the most? I found the job the standard, not-particularly-efficient way — discovered it on a job listing website (Indeed.com, I believe) and applied online. Obviously it was one of many I applied for during the long search, but was one of the few that really resonated with me right away. It wasn’t just an intriguing opportunity, it was a role that I knew I could do at a high level and felt very confident that it would maximize both my person passions and professional skill set. I’d say it was a rare opportunity in that regard to hit that sweet spot. So, I put a good amount of time and energy into my resume and, particularly, my cover letter. My resume changed shapes over time throughout my search thanks to input I received from peers and, particularly, an agency rep I worked with. I didn’t get any job opportunities through them, but the feedback on my resume was invaluable. Also (and honestly I have no idea if this moved the needle at all) I printed off physical copies of my resume and cover letter and mailed them in a manilla envelope to the person I thought was the hiring manager for this role. Turned out, she wasn’t (it’s a little unique here), but maybe that resonated a bit with the hiring committee. At minimum, it didn’t seem to hurt me. Finally, even after I had done my initial interview, I kept networking and through some additional LinkedIn exploration I discovered that one of my PCC counterparts in this role was connected to a friend of mine. I asked for an introduction and set up a lunch meeting with my PCC counterpart a week or two before my final interview that was incredibly valuable. She wasn’t on the hiring committee, but gave me some great insight into the role and, most importantly, a real confidence boost heading into the final round. What was the most difficult part of your job search? How did you overcome this challenge? There were several large challenges in my search. The first was simply how long it took. While the end result was absolutely rewarding, having “job hunting” take over as my top extra-curricular activity for 8-9 months was draining to say the least. I will also say, it was pretty disheartening to experience the shabby way many organizations treat applicants. I’ve been on the hiring side of this process as well and know that it’s no picnic, but I was disappointed with how many companies failed to follow-up in a timely fashion, even when they promised to do so after an interview stage. The organizations that were sincerely appreciative of the great time and effort applicants put forth, and  communicated clearly throughout the process, stood apart from the rest. Finally, as somebody who was well into their career (nearly 20 years) and approaching…okay, at…middle age, with all the varied responsibilities that come with it (mortgage, kid, etc.), I didn’t have the flexibility to explore lower paying opportunities, even if the role had lots of appeal. I had to make a lateral move at worst, which isn’t easy, especially coming out of a niche industry. My window of opportunity was certainly smaller than it would’ve been 10 years earlier when I had more financial and personal flexibility. I overcame these challenges by diving deeper into my goal-setting process and staying as organized as I could (I used a tool called the Best Self Journal to help). I also needed all the encouragement and understanding that I could get from my friends and family who appreciated how grueling it was to stay after this for so long. You’ve got to have advocates in this process, both personal and professional. What is the single best piece of advice you would offer other job-seekers? Get organized and set specific milestones for yourself that will help you march toward your ultimate goal of a new job — things you can measure and check off on a weekly/monthly basis. Mine included developing and refining a strong elevator pitch for myself, building and enhancing my portfolio, and increasing and expanding my professional network. Each of those stages had several subtasks that had to be accomplished or even pivoted to drive them forward. Unless you’re extremely well-connected out of the gate, this is going to be a multi-layered process with no small amount of personal development and learning throughout. Be ready to hustle and grind. Meet with old colleagues, send emails introducing yourself, ask for favors, go to networking mixers and panels, take advice you hadn’t considered before, read books/blogs/podcasts (Mac’s List, hello!). You’re probably not going to find a golden ticket in any single meeting or event, but you’ll keep picking up tips, info, ideas that will propel you forward.\xa0\xa0 Why do you love your job? My new job allows me to get out and engage with a LOT of different people while serving as an advocate and professional fan of this unique and beautiful campus.

My intention is not to minimize mom\'s experience, it is to help protect mom\'s heart and energy. "Taking things personally" can cause so much anxiety, hurt, anguish, sadness, suffering and just sucks the life out of you.\xa0\xa0We will explore what "taking it personally" really means. What are some of the things moms take personally? Why does taking things personally cause so much pain and suffering? Why taking things personally is not helpful to you and your teen?\xa0\xa0Then we will look at why "it\'s not personal" through the lens of neuroscience.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Do you ever wake up and wonder,\xa0 "How good can the teenage years get?" or do you think, "How am I going to survive the teenage years?"Many moms just wonder how they are going to survive the teenage years. And that\'s no surprise since this is one of the most challenging times to parent teens.\xa0The problem is, human beings have a propensity to remember only the negative. We can forget that we have good moments with our teens. The negative experiences can erase the positive experiences from our memories. The truth is that there are many gifts we can receive from our teens and the teenage years.Because of the unique challenges in this culture you will not naturally experience how good the teenage years can be. You have to be intentional and strategic and knowledgeable about the teenage brain.In this episode you will learn how to dial up the good experiences with your teen.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Does your teen stress you out? If you have a normal teenager then the answer should be yes and the reason for that is where they are developmentally and I talk about the science behind that in the podcast.\xa0 So yes your teen will stress you out. The better question is how often does your teen stress you out and to what degree? In other words whats the intensity of the stress you feel. In this episode I go into the major categories of what stresses parents out like monitoring, worrying about their safety and their future.There will be stress but you don\'t want the stress to dominate your life, your parenting, your teen and your home. Stress is not good for you or your relationship with your teen.Here’s the dilemma. It is stressful parenting a teen but your stress impairs your parenting. Your stress can stress your teenager out.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Today we are going to talk about the "4 Steps to Creating the Routine You Want". This is crucial to establish routines that work for you and your family this new school year.\xa0It\'s easy to think that you are starting your year off with a blank slate, but it is never a blank slate. Here’s why. The truth is that the same issues and struggles that drove your crazy last year are going to reappear this year. And why is that? Patterns repeat. Your son and daughter will do what they normally do and then you and your partner will typically react like you normally do. Over time these verbal and behavioral exchanges become predictable patterns of interactions. These interactions are often unconscious and on autopilot and can be triggered with an eye-roll, disrespectful comment, or the infamous slammed door. And then your last years amnesia has shattered and you remember the draining teenage drama from the past.You don’t want these unconscious patterns of interactions to become your “automatic routine” for your new year especially if they were fraught with drama.Many parents fall into routines or patterns that are not working for them or for their teens. You may be aware of some routines and not be conscious of others. Because the fall semester is busy, it’s easy to go on automatic pilot and just tolerate disrespectful behavior day after day.\xa0 And this becomes routine.The good news is this year doesn’t have to be a repeat of last year. But things won’t automatically change you have to be intentional.Listen to find out the "4 Steps to Creating the Routine You Want".Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | The new school year is starting soon or may have already started. Before the year takes off at full time speed, I want to discuss why intentional downtime is a big deal. With our busy schedules downtime is not going to happen naturally, you have to be intentional. Downtime is a pressure-free zone. It\'s non-productive time. There is no competition or comparing yourself to others . There is no pressure to get anything done. There is no agenda. There is nothing hanging over your head. Downtime allows for your mind to wander instead of having focused attention. You get to relax and chill out. Downtime is restful. In this episode I discuss the 5 Benefits of Intentional Downtime.1. Downtime allows you and your teen time and mental space to let go of stress caused by friends, grades, a busy schedule, and lots of demands.2. Downtime naturally brings out our playful nature.\xa03. Downtime allows for creativity and innovation.\xa04. Downtime allows you to slow down.\xa05. Downtime allows your mind to rest,\xa06. Downtime is good for the teenage and adult brain.I spend the rest of the episode getting practical. What is a good use of downtime and what is not? How to insert downtime into your very busy schedule?Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Has your teen ever said anything like, "Mom you are the only one who won\'t let me . . ." or\xa0 "Everyone else is doing it so why can\'t I . . .?" If they have, congratulations you have a normal teenager. Teens from all over the planet use tactics like these to try to manipulate you to get their way.In this episode will look at the\xa0 many different tactics that teen use. These teenage tactics only work when we are not 100% clear if we are making the right decision. These tactics can open the door to a whole lot of drama.You can shut these tactics down when you are 100% clear. However, there are two big\xa0 challenges to becoming clear. One, is the Moving Target Syndrome, and two, is Mother Fog. We will discuss how to take your clarity back.Also, in this episode we will discuss the downside of making decisions based on consensus and why your clarity is a personal decision.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | In this episode we\'ll discuss why curiosity makes you a better human being and parent. You’ll learn how healthy curiosity dials down the drama, and improves your relationship with your teen.\xa0Healthy curiosity is the secret ingredient to a well-lived life. Curiosity makes us feel alive, leads to more happiness, boosts achievement and creativity, expands our empathy and strengthens our relationships.Walt Disney once said, “We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we\'re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”.Instilling healthy curiosity to your teens is one of the best gifts you can give them. \xa0You\'ll learn how curiosity brings down the teenage wall of defensiveness and\xa0 helps you have the hard conversations with your teen with minimal drama. This skill is foundational to parent effectively.There is also a dangerous side to curiosity, that our teens are especially vulnerable to. When you combine a strong drive of curiosity with the teenagers faulty brake system (of their undeveloped prefrontal cortex), it can lead to trouble. You\'ll learn what you can do to protect your teen.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | I hope that Mothers\' Day was all that you hoped it would be. But if you ended up\xa0 disappointed, you are definitely not the only one.Heres the problem with Mother\'s day. I think you come to that day with huge expectations that your kids and partner will somehow make up for everything that was not right in the past year. Realistically on Mother\'s Day you are still dealing with teen issues and are in the kitchen cooking a meal for your mom or your mother in law. Even on Mother\'s Day it\'s hard to have a whole day that you are actually off duty. That\'s why moms need more than a day!Often moms are influenced by implicit messages in the culture like, "it\'s selfish to pay attention to me." It feels like that this message is true, so many moms feel guilty if they spend time taking care of themselves. They wait for someone to give them permission to invest in themselves. This results with moms feeling "all mothered out" and resentful for not being appreciated enough.Actually, it\'s not selfish to pay attention to you; it\'s CRUCIAL. 1. it\'s crucial to pay attention to you . . .So you can honor and appreciate you for everything you do for your family.2. It\'s crucial to pay attention to you . . .to reclaim your self awareness. This is the first step to know how you are doing, what you need, and what you want. If you don\'t know what you need, a good place to start is the 5 essential areas of feeling good. In order to feel your best, you’ve got to focus on five essential needs: foundational, maintenance, relational, self-enrichment, and spiritual.3. It\'s crucial to pay attention to you . . .every day. See part of each day needs to be mothers day. What I mean by this is that YOU needs to get in your calendar.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Whenever I speak to moms I tell them, "This is one of the most challenging times to raise a teen." A huge reason for this is navigating through the treacherous waters of cell phones, social media, and internet with teenagers. Most parents are blind sided with their teens about all thing digital because we didn’t go through this when we were teens. It feels like the iPhone has been around forever but actually it was released in 2007. So your mom didn’t have to deal with these cyber space issues when parenting you.Did you know that the average American touches their\xa0 phone 2617 times a day?Did you know that According to Common Sense Media, teens spend an average of nine hours a day online?\xa0Studies have shown that the rise of anxiety and loneliness in teens is directly related to how much teens are online. 1 of 3 teenage girls will experience significant anxiety. In this podcast I talk about "The 4 big problems with phones, social media, internet and teens."1. The addictive nature of all things online2. Loneliness3. Social comparison and why selfies are more like a question than a statement4. Fomo (Fear of missing out) and how Snapmap is really EOMO (Evidence of missing out.)Most importantly we will end with what moms can do about this.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | I think what\'s challenging and perplexing about parenting is that your child/ teen can feel like a moving target---or you could say a growing target. You feel like you finally have mastered one stage and then your teen grows out of it and you are up against the next stage. This new phase\xa0 has new dynamics to figure out and its own set of perils. Every time you turn a corner, there is new terrain to manage. You finally have elementary school down and then they are off to middle school. You finally have middle school down and then they are off to high school, and then your kids are wanting to get their drivers permit and on it goes. . .\xa0Add to this moving or growing target another factor that can completely throw parents off balance and is the source of much confusion and frustration. This is the Maturity Gap.\xa0\xa0Maturity Gap in adolescence has been studied by many neuroscientists. They look at the maturity gap through the lens of brain development. They define it as the discrepancy between an individual\'s cognitive maturity and emotional maturity.I am going to broaden the definition of Maturity Gap and will share some interesting studies about the brain.\xa0\xa0Here\'s what I mean when I am talking about the Maturity Gap. All the different facets of your teen (physical, social, cognitive and emotional) are not growing together at the same rate. Because of this there is a maturity gap between the different parts. Some areas of your teen may seem more adult-like. You can feel like your teen is maturing and you can relax, but\xa0 then your thrown off by another facet that screams immaturity.\xa0This Maturity Gap doesn\'t magically go away at 18, it\'s alive and well until age 25.This podcast will explore how knowing about the Maturity Gap can help you be a better, happier and wiser parent.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

But, more often than not, the people calling the shots are...men. In this episode of Mentor Memos, we hear from two women who’ve carved out careers in the beauty industry as hairstylists to some of the biggest names in entertainment. Justine Marjan is a renowned celebrity hairstylist and a Global Stylist for TRESemmé. Having worked with high-profile clients like Kim Kardashian and Chrissy Teigen, she often fields requests from aspiring hairstylists who want her mentorship. Tune in to hear what ultimately got Justine to say “yes” to having Kathleen Riley as a hairstyling apprentice who has gone on to build her own celebrity client roster. Plus, hear Justine and Kathleen’s advice for how to make a mentor/mentee relationship work for both parties (as well as what not) to do. | In episode three of Mentor Memos, the new podcast from the Girlboss Radio Network, produced in partnership with TRESemmé, we hear a story that beautifully illustrates the enormous impact a single individual can have on another’s life. Aisha Bowe is an aerospace engineer and the CEO and co-founder of STEMBoard, where she manages multimillion dollar defense contracts. But before becoming the impressive founder she is today, Aisha was an aerospace engineer at NASA Ames Research Center. There, Aisha met a young, eager student by the name of Claire Luce, who was not bashful about asking how she could one day become an aerospace engineer. The two began a friendship and mentor/mentee relationship that has become an invaluable support system as they each advance in their careers. Tune in to hear how Aisha and Claire kicked off their mentorship and learn how you can claim space in fields where women are underrepresented. | In this episode of Mentor Memos, the new podcast from the Girlboss Radio Network, produced in partnership with TRESemmé, we hear a story that’s highly personal to our host, Neha Gandhi. Before working as the COO of Girlboss, Neha spent six years at Refinery29, where she worked under the leadership of Christene Barberich. Christene is one of Refinery29’s co-founders as well as its current Global EIC. She and Neha met during a pivotal moment when they were each dreaming big about Refinery29, albeit from very different perspectives. Neha was looking for an opportunity to carve our a new editorial perspective in media, while Christene was looking for someone who would be entrusted to carry out the company’s vision. Over the years, the two women formed an intimate mentor and mentee relationship where they discuss everything from management styles to motherhood. Tune in to hear how Christene helped Neha find her voice in the workplace and how you can also find yours. | Welcome to the very first episode of Mentor Memos, the new podcast from the Girlboss Radio Network, produced in partnership with TRESemmé. In each episode, Girlboss COO Neha Gandhi chats with a different pair of mentors and mentees about their relationship and the biggest lessons they’ve taught each other. For our first conversation, we hear from the one and only, Cecile Richards, founder of Supermajority and former CEO of Planned Parenthood. While Cecile was at Planned Parenthood, she worked with Kersha Deibel, who soon expressed interest in rising as a leader within the organization. Over time, Cecile began mentoring Kersha and connecting her with other people who could help her advance. Fast forward to today, and Kersha acts as the CEO to Planned Parenthood in Ohio. Cecile continues to watch and stay a part of her mentee’s career by uplifting and providing opportunity whenever possible. Tune in to hear how Kersha first approached Cecile about a mentorship, how the two contribute equally to the relationship, and why it’s so important to have female women in leadership roles. | Having access to an amazing mentor who can coach you as you move up in your career is an invaluable resource.\xa0 But great mentors aren’t always easy to find—especially for women. That’s why Girlboss has partnered with TRESemmé to bring you Mentor Memos, the podcast. TRESemmé believes with the right support and resources, women can transcend societal barriers and lead on their own terms.Across six episodes, you’ll hear from people like Justine Marjan, one of the most sought-after celebrity hairstylists in Hollywood and Cyndi Ramirez of Chillhouse.

Not what to wear, not what to eat.\xa0It was crazy.\xa0So how do we stop ignoring our emotions and instead learn to understand what they are telling us.Denise will also share:The most significant question you need to ask yourself before making any important decisionHow to figure out if you are making a decision for sound reasons or because of the two big fears that most influence our decisions, andThe proper way to mourn a failure so that you can get over it and keep it from holding you back.\xa0Important Links for the Show:The bank that feels right:\xa0http://nbkc.com/dianaDenise on Twitter:\xa0https://twitter.com/DeniseKShull?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5EauthorDenise\'s company:\xa0https://therethinkgroup.netProfessional AF Facebook Group:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/groups/943925015810362/Diana online:\xa0www.DianaKander.com | Everywhere she goes, people ask Esther Wojcicki for parenting advice.

She’s won numerous poker championships and millions of dollars in prizes.\xa0 I got to know her in 2004 when I really got into poker.\xa0 My first book was actually a business novel that took place at the world series of poker and used poker hands to teach important innovation lessons.\xa0 So when I saw Annie, one of the few women who were even competing in the tournament, keep winning, keep being the only woman at one final table after another, and keep doing it with class and style, I became a huge fan.\xa0What I didn’t know about Annie until doing research for this interview is that she graduated from Columbia University and then graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania.\xa0 That she won a fellowship from the National Science Foundation and got a doctorate in cognitive psychology. \xa0Annie is an entrepreneur, a committed advocate for important causes, a mother, a wife, and the author of several books including my favorite and the subject of our discussion today: Thinking in Bets, Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts.\xa0Today Annie is going to tell us:Why you should focus on process rather than outcome to decide whether you made a good decisionWhy there’s a competition going on all the time between your short term wants and your long term wants and how to prevent your short term impulses from sabotaging your long term growth.Our mistaken belief on how we form our assumptions and beliefs about the world – hint, you aren’t as objective as you thinkAn incredible way to get people to question their assumptions and beliefs in a way they aren’t naturally inclined to doThe value of thinking of your work projects as betsHow to identify the habits that your team rewards and understand whether you are actually helping your causeIn the Kander Family we have a saying.

I hope you enjoy this amazing conversation on Professional AF! | This week I sat down with Sally Helgesen.\xa0 Sally is one of the premier experts on women’s leadership. She has been a best-selling author, speaker and leadership coach for thirty years. Her mission has always been to help women recognize, articulate and act on their greatest strengths. Her latest book is called How Women Rise and it explains how the behaviors that served you so well at the beginning of your career, that got you promoted, are many times the same behaviors that keep you from big leadership positions.\xa0 Basically, what got you here won’t get you there. \xa0Today, Sally is going to share:- How to overcome your reluctance to claim your achievements- Why you are overvaluing your expertise to your own detriment- Why you shouldn’t just expect others to notice and reward your work, and what you should do instead- How to not fall into the perfection trap- Why you can’t make behavior change by yourself\xa0– the secret ingredient you need to really make new behaviors stickWhether you are traveling by plane, train or car, walking your dog or doing the dishes, get a pen handy because you’re going to hear some powerful advice on this episode of Professional AF! | This week I sat down with Amy Morin, a psychotherapist turned “accidental” author. You’re going to hear Amy share her very moving, personal story, but I just wanted to brag on her for a second.\xa0 Amy gave one of the most popular TEDx talks of all time—The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong. It’s been viewed more than 8 million times. She’s a regular columnist for Forbes, Inc., and Psychology Today and a parenting expert for Verywell. Her articles reach more than 2 million readers every month. And she’s the author of 3 Bestselling books, the latest of which is called 13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don’t Do.\xa0 And the interview is amazing because we spend about 2/3 of the conversation talking about specific habits mentally strong women should stop, and the last third on the science of creating lasting habit change.\xa0Today Amy is going to share:-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How to keep self-doubt from sabotaging our goals-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How the way we raise young girls has a big impact on their mental strength-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How to deal with critical feedback-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Why women aren’t getting the right kind of feedback at work, and how to ask the right way-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0The biggest mistake we make trying to change a habitBuckle your seatbelts.

I had a chance to interview Fran Hauser, a long-time media executive, startup investor and best-selling author of The Myth of the Nice Girl. Fran is best known for her role building PEOPLE.com – one of the biggest media brands online – She made the leap to early stage investing in 2014. And 18 of the 20 companies she has invested in are founded by women, highlighting her broader commitment to increasing the representation of female founders and investors.\xa0Fran’s first book, THE MYTH OF THE NICE GIRL: deconstructs the negative perception of "niceness" that many women struggle with in the business world and\xa0 resonates with smart women who are looking to take their career to the next level. The Myth of the Nice Girl was named Audible\'s Best Business Book of 2018 and one of Amazon\'s Best Business and Leadership Books of 2018.\xa0In this episode, Fran is going to show you specific tools you can use to:·\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Deliver difficult feedback·\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Create more time and space on your calendar·\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Stop being in reactive mode all day and get a lot more done·\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Know when you need to recalibrate your calendar to focus on what matters.Plus·\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Practical tips on turning down invitations or finding the sweet spot between yes and no·\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How to find the right mentor and nurture that relationship\xa0I hope you have a pen and paper ready or open up an email to yourself because you’re about to get some powerful ideas from this episode of Professional AF! | Over the last 6 months my husband Jason and I have been on an intense journey of mental health and a lot of that growth has come as a result of both of us working with therapists on a regular basis. And of course when you are going through something, you can really see the value in it for lots of others. But in talking about therapy with friends, I’ve found that many found it an intimidating and overwhelming process.\xa0 Even I have all kinds of questions about how therapy works, but it just doesn\'t feel right in the middle of a session.\xa0So this week I sat down with Lori Gottleib. She’s a psychotherapist and writes a weekly Dear Therapist Column for the Atlantic.\xa0 Lori has written a number of New York Times Bestselling books which have been translated to 20 languages. Her latest book just came out on April 2, and it’s called Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. Lori is going to explain:-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How therapists approach every session and what they are trying to accomplish-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0How therapists think about change and how that can help you take meaningful steps in your life-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0What they are scribbling back there in their notes as you’re talking-\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0What you can learn about being a better listener and partner from how therapists approach their clients | Self compassion is the simple art of being kind to yourself in moments of despair the way that you would for a good friend.\xa0 But most of us are much kinder to our good friends than we are to ourselves. Today, I’m speaking with Dr. Kristin Neff. The top researcher for self compassion in the world.\xa0 Kristin will help us understand:How self compassion can help you reduce anxiety, stress, negative head trash, and significantly increase your achievement. \xa0Why we are kinder to our good friends than we are to ourselves. \xa0Why self criticism is not a good way to motivate our selves and push ourselves to be better.\xa0Why self esteem is a fair weather fan and always turns on us when we need it most. \xa0And she will help answer the big myths of self compassion:That self compassion is a form of self pity.That self compassion means weakness. \xa0That self compassion will make you complacent. \xa0That self compassion is selfishSelf compassion has had a profound impact on the way my husband Jason and I live our lives and I hope you will give it a try after listening to this very special episode of Professional AF', 'chan_desc': 'Essential habits for women at work.

This is one of the central questions in my solo+preneur-based business, one that builds a habit (okay, okay, obsession) of looking for simple systems and strategies to help free our time, mind, and money.This episode is preview lesson from my new—totally free!—mini-course, Free-up Founder Time. I cover strategies for time blocking and content batching, and walk you through exactly how I set-up my schedule each week (knowing that life and work never go perfectly to plan). I define Founder Time as time that you dedicate to working on your business, as the owner of the whole operation. Ideally, you schedule it for your most creative windows—when you feel energized to do your best work.\xa0\xa0After you listen, register for the course here to kick-off your fall with more time and energy! In 15 short actionable lessons, I cover topics like content batching, time blocking, getting ready for your big break, courage cookies, luck trucks, and a whole lot more. Each lesson as a combination of helpful tools, templates, podcast episodes, and book recommendations. I also recorded each lesson (most are 5-10 minutes long) as audio for learning on the go. My goal: every lesson will free up two to five hours of your time each week! | In her book, The Making of a Manager: What To Do When Everyone Looks To You, author Julie Zhuo takes us back to the childhood lemonade stand in a way that flipped a major “aha” lightbulb switch for me.As the founder of a budding business, you might be the best at making lemonade, or at least think you are, even as you hire helpers to (wo)man the stand. But if you only ever make lemonade you’ll only be serving an additive role in your business. Instead, if you hire a small team and teach them how to make the lemonade, even if they’re not quite as skilled as you at first, you’ll be serving a multiplicative role.You serving as a multiplier in your business means exponential returns are possible (including exponentially reducing your time). But most of us aren’t handed a manual on how to become an effective manager of other people—we learn by fumbling through the job. In this conversation, Julie and I dig into the three P’s of people management: people, process, and purpose—and it’s a good idea to create a user guide to . . . you!Download a copy of Julie’s sample user guide below (or if you’re viewing this in a podcast player view full show notes at http://pivotmethod.com/132). | What’s the difference between distraction and traction? Why don’t we do the things that we know we should do? And how can we learn from techniques that tech companies use to hook us into their products in order to redirect our attention toward what we really want to be, do, and create in the world?Nir Eyal and I discuss these topics and more in this week’s podcast conversation based on his new book, Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. He also outlines the four steps of the Indistractable model: master internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back external triggers, and prevent distraction with pacts. | This week kicks off a new Listener Q&A feature of the podcast, but before we dive in: I would love to hear from you!

In this episode, which happens to be released on Penney’s birthday (woohoo!) we discuss why we fears and limitations that hold us back from our fullest expression.In this conversation, we talk about the cultural pressure to fit in, self-entertainment as spiritual practice, setting big goals and going too big or too small, willingness to be a “misfit,” why transparency attracts more joyful friendships, and what’s behind comparison to others—how noticing a quality in someone else means that you have that quality somewhere within you.\xa0View full show notes from this episode at http://pivotmethod.com/129.Enjoying the podcast and want to support the show?

You’d be diving into the deep end, but you’d integrate FAR more quickly and effectively than if you took the “pop out of the bubble” approach, of only speaking the second language when you’re comfortable, thus never truly gaining traction.As Scott Young, author of Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career, describes it — the bubble method is the equivalent of getting cold water splashed into your face every day and never having a chance to adapt. That’s the difference between most approaches to learning and ultralearning, which he defines as stretching outside of the limits where you feel comfortable through strategic, intense, self-directed programs.In this episode, Scott walks us through several of his 9 principles that underlie ultralearning: metalearning (Draw a map), focus (sharpen your knife), directness (go straight ahead), drill (attack your weakest point), retrieval (test to learn), feedback (don’t dodge the punches), retention (don’t fill a leaky bucket), intuition (dig deep before building up), experimentation (explore outside your comfort zone).", 'chan_desc': 'What’s next for your career and creative projects?

At the time she was working as a Personal Trainer, exhausted from trading time for money and working the crazy hours .Kristine was a brand new mum as well and feeling very lost in life after losing her financial independence and having to rely on her partner for everything.In the beginning Kristine just wanted to be able to contribute to the household bills however in 3 short years she was able to make it to the top position in her company and began earning a multiple six figure income.Since being part of this industry her biggest accomplishment was out-earning her husband Tom in his Fly In Fly Out job which allowed him to leave work and be a stay at home dad after they had their son in 2016. This gave Tom special bonding time with their kids that most dads do not get, and allowed him 7 fulfilling months off work until his dream job came along.Kristine credits her success to being teachable and doing everything she was told to do.

To answer this question, we talk to two experts: Diana Elliott, a sociologist and researcher at Urban Institute who studies systemic barriers, and Charlotte Cowles, a journalist who writes about money for New York Magazine’s The Cut and New York Times and has interviewed hundreds of people about their money habits. Make sure you're subscribed wherever you listen to podcasts so you get bonus episodes that we share this summer, as well as news when season 4 drops in late summer 2019. \xa0 Links from the show:  Diana Elliott’s bio Diana Elliott’s Twitter Urban Institute Charlotte Cowles on The Cut Charlotte Cowles’ Twitter  Kellogg School report on economic mobility perceptions “Behind the Curve” flat Earth documentary Breakmaster Cylinder on Bandcamp  | Though we usually focus on bigger picture topics like systemic issues within our economy that disproportionately affect women, this week we’re getting tactical, and sharing actionable tips that can improve your finances today, with a little help from some friends of the podcast. Be sure to check out the links here in the shownotes to find all of the awesome financial pros and content creators we heard from and referenced. \xa0 Links from the show :  Broke Millennial Takes on Investing by Erin Lowry Sarah Li Cain’s podcast Beyond the Dollar Bobbi Rebell’s podcast Financial Grownup Hey Berna She Picks Up Pennies Penny’s Twitter How You Spend Your Days podcast Kara’s blog post,  I’m a Financial Professional and I Have Hella Financial Anxiety Tanja’s book Work Optional, specifically chapter 3  | In the era of the #MeToo movement, Black Lives Matter and a torrent of books on the subject, it’s a time when women’s anger at the inequality built into our financial, economic and social systems is finally being heard. Or at least some women’s anger is. In this week’s episode, we’re talking with emotional labor expert and author Gemma Hartley, and comedian and author Sarah Cooper, about the moment women’s rage is having, the steps that most of us must still take to function in a male-oriented career world, and the tired old stereotype of the angry black woman. \xa0 Links from the show:  CNBC story with “Tanja Hester and her husband” Gemma Hartley’s book, Fed Up Sarah Cooper’s book, How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings Rebecca Traister’s book, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger Soraya Chemaly’s book, Rage Becomes Her Burn It Down: Writing About Women’s Anger, edited by Lilly Dancyger  | Today we’re finally tackling the topic that we suspect some of you initially came to The Fairer Cents expecting to hear about: early retirement, financial independence and the FIRE movement or community. But because it’s us, we’re not just going to say “here’s how to retire early, now go buy some Vanguard funds and off you go.” Instead, we’re talking about how to broaden the conversation around FIRE, namely how to diversify it so more people feel welcome. Because it’s not just white tech bros here, and talking about it that way sells the whole movement short. Our guests today include Vicki Robin, the New York Times bestselling co-author of Your Money Or Your Life, and a panel of diverse voices from across the FIRE community who are all working to break down those stereotypes about who can achieve FIRE.

In part 2, we’re talking about how white women can do better about being allies to women of color, in particular by not being “white feminists TM.” That goes for in financial spaces, and just in general. Our guests are two women of color who've thought a lot about this: Kiona of How Not to Travel Like a Basic Bitch and Marivette Navarette of The Mujerista. Links from the show:  How Not to Travel Like a Basic Bitch The Mujerista  | Today we’re celebrating something HUGE in The Fairer Cents family: the publication of Tanja’s book, Work Optional: Retire Early the Non-Penny-Pinching Way! But we’re not just talking about that today. Instead we’re talking about everything that goes into women achieving creative dreams, from the glory of the finished product to the misery and messiness that can go into getting there, and even what creativity is in the first place.

In part 1, we’re talking about male allies: why we need them, and how men can be them. Our guests are Cord Jefferson, TV writer and outspoken feminist extraordinaire, and personal finance bloggers Matt Lane of Optimize Your Life and Brian of Done By 40. They’re all incredible allies to women, and they get vulnerable with us about how they speak up to help the feminist cause, as well as where they still struggle. \xa0 Links from the show:  Tanja’s new book, Work Optional: Retire Early the Non-Penny-Pinching Way  \xa0  Cord Jefferson’s Tumblr Cord’s Medium page Cord’s Twitter  \xa0  Matt’s blog, Optimize Your Life Matt’s post on  how advocating for women has helped his career Matt’s Twitter  \xa0  Brian’s blog, Done By Forty Brian’s post on  the wage gap and sharing salary with women Brian’s Twitter  | This week we’re doing something we’ve never done before on the podcast: recording live! This episode was recorded live at the first Cents Positive retreat for women interested in financial independence (so you’ll notice that we talk about financial independence and early retirement a little more than usual), and included wide-ranging conversations on the origins of the podcast, why women need safe spaces for all things but especially money conversations, how money and emotion are intertwined (and that’s okay!) and some great questions from attendees. \xa0 Links:  Cents Positive website Cents Positive Twitter  | The economic and social system we live in affects so much about our financial lives as women. So how do we change that? A big part of it is advocating for other women (and ourselves), and so today we’re talking to two incredible women from different generations who do exactly that, but in very different ways: Mary Beth Cahill, former executive director of Emily’s List, as well as long-time chief of staff for Senator Ted Kennedy and campaign manager for John Kerry’s presidential run in 2004; and Gaby Dunn, the writer and performer best known for her podcast and book, both titled Bad With Money. We talk about who they each see themselves fighting for, the economic impact of that and what it means to be an advocate in today's world. \xa0 Links from the show:   Gaby’s podcast Gaby’s book Linda Tirado’s book Hand to Mouth  | It’s 2019, and women are still being judged for jobs on whether we’re likable enough, whether we’re strong enough (but not too strong), and all the same old patriarchal bullshit. That’s why we’re kicking off the new year and the new podcast season with one of the strongest women we know of: personal finance author, TV personality and all-around unapologetic woman Suze Orman. She’s got a new book out, but we mostly don’t talk about that. Instead, we talk about her origin story, including how she earned the respect of the first boss in finance who hire her – with the intention of sleeping with her, not promoting her – what it means to her to be gay, and her advice for young people coming up in careers today.

It's a book all about a topic close to my heart (self-sabotage!) and\xa0in the book I investigate my own relationship with it and ask some experts too. Why do so many of us succumb to its temptation. Procrastination, jealousy, negativity, guilt: how can we overcome the obstacles that keep getting in our way? It's the evil stepsister to imposter syndrome and I couldn't find much on the topic so I decided to write something myself.So why did I partner with JP and the Pound Project?JP believes that reading and writing are incredibly valuable, and he set up an affordable, sustainable, democratic platform where content is paid for (starting from just £1) where writers receive an equal share.\xa0How does it work? To get involved and back SABOTAGE you pay just £1 if you want to read or hear my piece online. Or, if you would prefer it in print, for a mere £5 we will send you a beautiful pocket-sized book.

David also happens to be a 6\'9" former professional basketball player and a D-I athlete at Dartmouth. From discussion of stereotypical "broke athletes" who blow their sports earnings after finishing up their playing days to other athletes who take on the business world, this episode is all about reinvention and renewal. Certainly athletes must go through reinvention at a young age, but what about the rest of us?\xa0 We must know how to reinvent ourselves too in a time when it\'s common for people to have 10 jobs over a lifetime (and that number is climbing)! Come make the Big Jump with David Gardner and me on the latest, freshest episode of the Art of Likability! \xa0 \xa0 | Hey Family, So I have taken the summer off from the podcast as part of some deep reflection I am doing.  I wanted to update you on what\'s been going down in my head and join you to take part in answering this important question "What am I creating?"  I want you to know I\'m thinking about how to best serve you, the listener. So your feedback is super important. Please send me an email at info@artoflikability.com\xa0with your thoughts from this podcast.  Super important for the future of this programming.  You. Are. Awesome! -Arel | Today on the Art of Likability, I\'m overjoyed to have minister Darryl Strawberry dish on overcoming addiction and helping others to do the same. Darryl is a minister now, and in a previous life he was a Major League Baseball All-Star and World Series Champion for the New York Mets and the New York Yankees.\xa0\xa0 Away from the baseball diamond, Darryl had to go through life problems like everyone else.\xa0\xa0He could swing a bat with the best of them, but it was infinitely tougher to step up to the plate against his inner addiction demons...until he did. This is Darryl\'s story of how he was reborn from his previous life as a supremely talented yet immature athlete to a grown man of God, spreading the good word on beating back addiction. Remember: You Are Awesome! -Arel | Ever catch yourself wishing you had 500,000 Instagram followers, or dreaming that you were richer than some other person? These thoughts bring angst and take away from enjoying life; they really do. I think it\'s odd that we tend to focus on what we lack rather than what we have.\xa0 And if you think about what you have, oh boy.\xa0 The\xa0inherent value of what you have is immense.\xa0 Your smartphone, computer, home, cash on hand, medical care, even the access to clean drinking water. Jump in with me to the latest episode of the Art of Likability, where we realize that you\'re probably richer than you\'re letting on, and how we can have REAL joy from this revelation. Please help to spread this message by leaving a review and a 5-star rating, if you enjoyed this message! Remember: You Are Awesome! | Everyone\'s always talking about networking, forming new connections and new business opportunities.\xa0 I get it: new and exciting is...new and exciting!\xa0 Instagram, Twitter, and social media in general give you so much optionality: There\'s the small chance that an A-lister could retweet you, or that an industry leader might share your content. In this episode of the Art of Likability, we divulge the insider secret to your network that is staring you in the face.\xa0 That\'s really all there is to it: Your Network. Please let me know what you think of this episode and remember to like and subscribe!\xa0 This helps us to grow our audience and message. Remember: You Are Awesome! -Arel \xa0 | With the Art of Likability, we know that our relationships are one of our most valuable resources.\xa0 They come with a lot of potential for growth, but they also come with potential for conflict. In an argument, many people automatically are looking to impose their worldview and win over the other person, but that only causes long-term resentment.\xa0 Never mind that the other person is looking to win over you as well!

We hope by meeting our clients and learning from their experiences you can increase the value from our library of training programs. Another reason we are introducing this series is we hope that every FC member will be able to find an FC Insider showcased in this series with whom they can particularly relate and learn from. For many members, it is difficult to emulate a partner because the gap in development (and age difference) is so high. Meeting real FC Insiders who are closer to most members’ age and career development stage will hopefully help each member to find some practical advice, guidance, and inspiration that will make a material difference.

Clients like Bill Graca. FC content is streamed in over 150 countries around the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Bill is a remarkable person. He fits our value system, he is a wonderful father and husband, and he works every day to be the best he can be.

Whatever goal you’re chasing, it is all too easy to come up with a long list of reasons NOT to start: What if people don’t like my work? What if I’m not good enough? What if it’s simply too late? I’ve had all of those fears myself, many in the last few days. And the truth is, we’re never going to eliminate fear completely. But we CAN learn to appreciate where our fear is coming from and choose to take the next small step, despite our uncertainty. Today, I’m discussing how to get over fear and START. I share the importance of taking the first step to build momentum and explain why the people who ‘make it’ don’t let failure turn into unsurmountable fear. I also explore the value in teasing out the negative thoughts that inform your fears and dismantling them logically—with a little help from your rational brain. Finally, I walk us through some of the big fears that hold creatives back and offer advice on overcoming the fear of rejection, the fear that it’s all been done before, and the fear that we’re too late to the party.

The 4 elements are:  We have more data than ever before The cost of technology is decreasing The speed of technology is increasing Moore’s Law: the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year while the costs are halved.

As John puts it, The Academy is, “truly an environment where people can practice, where they can learn that goes beyond just the typical sort of learning environment into a really high-touch coaching environment and we\'ve really seen great results so far.” \xa0 John has been with Bank of America for about 16 years in a wide variety of roles, all of which have prepared him to lead The Academy.\xa0 \xa0 The Academy is used to onboard new employees, to support and train employees looking to move into a leadership position, to help employees enhance their current skills and more. They use a combination of web-based training and hands on practice. One example of training they have is a client engagement simulator that allows employees to practice using the online systems while having client conversations at the same time. This allows employees to get comfortable interacting with customers live on the phone before they officially step into their role.\xa0 \xa0 Since starting The Academy, Bank of America has seen a lot of benefits from the program. Their turnover rate is the lowest it’s ever been and their client experience rating is the highest it’s ever been. John and his team understand the importance of investing in their people.\xa0 \xa0 John says, “I\'ve heard a stat that I\'ve just sort of repeated over and over again, which is if you have a bad onboarding experience, you\'re six times more likely to leave the company within the first year. We saw a pretty high turnover amongst people within our first year and it just became a question of, were they onboarded well? Were they trained to do the job well? Did they get good practice?” \xa0 When you have great employee experience, you have people who want to stay at the organization a long time. And when you can have tenured employees who know what they are talking about and who can give great advice you get great customer experience.\xa0 \xa0 One set of skills that The Academy is focused on teaching is soft skills such as empathy, problem solving, good communication, adaptability, creativity, etc...And John shares that they actually teach the basics such as how to give a proper handshake, make good eye contact, and how to hold a conversation.\xa0 \xa0 “I think empathy is such an important skill in this day and age to really understand where the person sitting across the table is coming from. We have really put a lot of money where our mouth is on that front and through The Academy really invested in empathy. We feel like there\'s a lot left to do there. I believe talking about technology of the future, things like virtual reality are going to maybe help us with that, to put us in someone else\'s shoes or help us to see some of the challenges that our clients may be facing that we can\'t necessarily know or see on a daily basis. Lots to learn there and I\'m really excited about and hopeful for just continuing to build a more and more empathetic workforce.”  What you will learn:  What is The Academy and how does it work A look at how learning and development has evolved over the years How the program is impacting turnover rates How John and his team are leveraging AI for training How leadership has evolved over the years inside of Bank of America What skills will be needed for the future of work  | There are a lot of people who feel like they are the lone changemaker in their organization. You may be in that position right now. It can feel extremely frustrating and lonely at times, but that shouldn’t stop you. Changemakers are persistent, resilient, and determined--they have to be.\xa0 \xa0 As a changemaker you will probably get told ‘no’ a lot, you may be rejected, and you may find that people around you have a hard time keeping up. There is a price to pay to be a changemaker, but it is worth it.\xa0 \xa0 Don’t give up! Keep pushing your organization and the people around you. The change will happen, maybe slower than you want, but it will. | Michelle Murphy is the Chief Diversity Officer and VP of Global Talent Acquisition at Ingersoll Rand, a manufacturing and sustainability company that creates products and services for commercial, industrial and residential customers. Some of their products include heating and air conditioning systems, golf carts, and power tools. They were formed in 1905 and today they have 40,000 employees around the world. \xa0 Michelle recently wrote an article, titled  Truly Effective Diversity Training Can Be Measured in Goosebumps where she opened up about the moment when she realized the importance of diversity and inclusion inside and outside of the workplace. Her experience ignited a passion for creating a safe place to work inside of Ingersoll Rand as well as encouraging others to do the same in organizations around the world.\xa0 \xa0 With the current world of work, where we are all so connected and where we can interact with customers and coworkers from countries all around the world the issue of diversity and inclusion is more important now than ever before. It is crucial for all of us to have empathy and compassion and to be able to see the world through the eyes of others.\xa0 \xa0 Ingersoll Rand has some great programs in place to foster and develop a culture of diversity and inclusion. They include: \xa0  Relaunch--a program offering the opportunity to help qualified engineers in the community relaunch their careers after having to step away for a time Level Up--A 1 ½ day immersive and experiential learning forum tailored to bring leaders and high potential black talent together to learn, further a sense of community, and convene a discussion among other companies for strategic initiatives to advance black leadership Strengthen Economic Mobility--A commitment to achieving a workforce that is reflective of their community populations – a maintaining livable market-competitive wages and progressive benefits; including broadening community access to well-being services including food/nutrition, housing and shelter, transportation, education and climate comfort. Paradigm for Parity--Ingersoll Rand has pledged to bring gender parity to leadership roles by 2030\xa0\xa0  \xa0 The question is, is it possible to teach someone to be empathetic or to focus on diversity and inclusion? Michelle says, “When I think about how do you teach someone, I feel like what we do is we try to create opportunities to offer experiences for people, because I\'m not sure that there\'s a training you could go to, or that you could teach people what it\'s like to feel certain ways. So, creating experiences where people get to watch others describe their feelings, and share in that, tend to take us a little bit further than I\'ll call maybe a typical training class. Because what you realize in that setting is, "These are the people I see and work with every day, and I know them pretty well, and I think they\'re smart people and good people, and I like them, and wow, I had no idea that that\'s what they were dealing with." Sometimes that acknowledgment is part of what helps create the opportunity for learning, for maybe that person who doesn\'t demonstrate empathy easily or well. Sometimes creating those experiences where they have those opportunities is the best way to do it.”   What you will learn:  What events shaped Michelle’s view of diversity and inclusion How to teach diversity, inclusion, and empathy A look at some of the programs in place at Ingersoll Rand that help foster diversity and inclusion Michelle’s view on the current war for talent How to measure diversity and inclusion What skills will be needed in the future of work What Michelle looks for during the interview process\xa0 Some of the future challenges we will face when it comes to diversity and inclusion  | One of the most important skills to have for the future of work is learning how to learn, but a major component that goes along with being a perpetual learner is consistently reinventing yourself. It’s not just about learning new things, it’s about how the outside world sees you. \xa0 Reinvention is about how you position yourself, it’s about how you market yourself and it is about the brand that you build. This is something that should be taking place consistently, whether it is every 3 years or every 10 years. \xa0 So when did you last reinvent yourself? If the answer is never, it’s time to start. | My guest today is Maria Bartiromo, anchor and Global Markets Editor for FOX Business. Maria has been a journalist for 30 years, starting back in 1989 as a production assistant at CNN Business News. She has seen and reported on some of the world’s most major events which you will hear about in our discussion. Maria has an upcoming special debuting on September 22, 2019 tied to how Artificial Intelligence is changing the face of business and the workplace. Her research for this special included traveling across the country over the past year and interviewing the top tier CEOs leading the charge on this topic. In today’s conversation, you will hear some of her findings and what CEOs are saying about AI and technology. You will also hear Maria’s advice on how we should prepare for what’s to come, what assumptions she had at the beginning of the process that were proven wrong, what jobs will be most on-demand in the future, and how AI might impact leaders.  Maria Bartiromo is a FOX Business Global Markets Editor and Anchor. She has been a journalist for 30 years and has worked for CNN, CNBC, and FOX. She has received two Emmys and a Gracie Award and in 2009 the Financial Times named her one of the “50 Faces That Shaped The Decade”. Maria was the first journalist to report live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on a daily basis and she was the first female journalist to be inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame Class of 2011. She has written three books, The Weekend That Changed Wall Street, The 10 Laws of Enduring Success, and Use The News: How to Separate the Noise from the Investment Nuggets and Make Money in Any Economy. She has a one-hour special coming up on September 22, 2019, called Artificial Intelligence: The Revolution Happening to Our Work and Our Lives, which will air on FOX News. The report is based on research Maria has been conducting for over a year on how Artificial Intelligence is changing the face of business and the workplace. She has traveled around and interviewed the leading technologists of the world, people like Marty Schmidt, Provost at MIT, Peter Thiel, founder of Palantir and co-founder of PayPal, Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of IBM and Jim Hackett, Chairman and CEO of Ford Motors. After all of her in-depth research, what does Maria think will happen to jobs in the next 5-10 years? “I mean this is today in 2019, we have more job openings than we have people. I mean, the labor force is so tight right now with a 51-year low in unemployment, and jobs are plentiful. I think that will only get worse, whereas there won\'t be enough people for the jobs that we need, and the jobs that we have will be able to be filled by computers. I think longer term, you are going to see a massive displacement in work and in jobs. I think the most important thing that people have to do is first of all recognize that machines are getting smarter and smarter, and they will take your job. You need to make sure to arm yourself with the right information and education, where you are savvy with technology, because if you\'re not savvy with technology in the next 10 years, you will be left out.” There’s no doubt that AI is becoming smarter and smarter and implementing it into business can save money and time. It can also allow humans to get involved in more creative roles and it will free us up to do the things we actually want to do. So what can we do as individuals to prepare for the future of AI and technology? Maria says first and foremost we have to enjoy every moment of everyday because life is short and it is precious. Secondly she says that education is key. Things are changing in a rapid pace and it’s not going to slow down. We need to be perpetual learners, constantly growing, innovating, dreaming, creating, and learning so that we can keep up in this upcoming world of work.  What you will learn: How Maria conducted research for her upcoming piece on Artificial Intelligence A look at the assumptions she had in her mind before she started working on this report and how they changed in the process What Maria thinks will happen to jobs in the next 5-10 years How AI and technology will specifically impact leaders Who is responsible for upskilling? Organizations or individuals? What jobs will be in demand in the future Why some CEOs are worried about AI and some are optimistic Advice for what individuals should do to prepare for the future of work | There are two things about the future of work that worry me. The first is if executives at organizations will choose to use AI and automation to replace humans instead of using them to augment humans. The second is that if we as individuals take a passive role in our lives and careers. We cannot just sit back and watch from the sidelines as the world changes. That is a surefire way to ensure we get replaced by technology. If we can work on both of these issues, then the future of work is optimistic | Today I am joined by Ott Vatter, the Managing Director at e-Residency, an initiative started by the Republic of Estonia to encourage more people to start businesses in Europe and to make it easier for remote workers and entrepreneurs to work while on the move. E-Residency was the first digital initiative of its kind, and there are now over 55,000 e-residents worldwide, including Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Pope Francis, and Angela Merkel. It has been so popular that e-residency applications have been growing faster than the number of births in the entire Estonian nation. \xa0 Today we are talking about how e-Residency came to be--what made the government of Estonia start this initiative, the benefits that have come from it, what impacts the country has seen from the program, and the possibility of other countries creating their own programs. You will also hear some mistakes they made along the way and how they overcame them.   Ott Vatter is the Managing Director at e-Residency, an initiative started by the Republic of Estonia in 2014 to encourage more people to start businesses in Europe. It makes it easier for remote workers and entrepreneurs to work while on the move.\xa0 \xa0 E-Residency was the first digital initiative of its kind, and there are now over 55,000 e-residents worldwide, including Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Pope Francis, and Angela Merkel. It has been so popular that e-residency applications have been growing faster than the number of births in the entire Estonian nation.\xa0 \xa0 So why was it first formed? Ott says, “If we look at the population first of Estonia, we\'re only 1.3 million people. With the domestic market, we can\'t really develop or scale. We\'re also demographically losing people. People are moving away. Some people are moving back. But in general, the outlook in 50 years, 100 years is not that positive. We have to be clever in these ways that we can actually innovate. We\'re not a rich country in terms of national resources, or we don\'t have huge resources of oil. But what we do have is the basis of a digital country. We could really capitalize on that. The infrastructure of e-Residency was already there for our own citizens. We didn\'t have to invent anything new, but we could replicate the same model for foreigners. We use the same identity card, taking away the photo and making it available for others as well.” \xa0 Any individual is able to apply for e-Residency, even if they are not currently looking to start a company or work remotely. Some people just do it to say they are an “e-Estonian”. One of the main benefits of joining e-Residency is the ability to use your digital certificate to sign documents quickly and it allows remote entrepreneurs to let other people handle the basic administrative tasks which leaves the entrepreneur freed up to focus on more important parts of running a business.\xa0 \xa0 When thinking about the future of work Ott believes that being a digital citizen will have huge benefits. He says, “People are traveling around even more and more. I think remote work is growing immensely. Digital identity is something that makes your life easier. As a German citizen, you wouldn\'t have to fly back to your own country, for example, from Thailand and wait in line in the tax office to fill out a form. Or in the U.S., for example, the tax forms, I mean, they\'re crazy. You physically have to be present to actually present all of these documents. I think the future of work is about being location independent. Being able to submit or do your business from anywhere in the world. I think digital identity will play a very big part of this revolution.”     What you will learn:  What e-Residency is and why it was started Why the concept of a digital society is so important The impacts of e-Residency on the country of Estonia\xa0 The role of privacy and security in a digital society Some of the mistakes that were made in forming this program and how they were overcome What Estonia is doing as a country to encourage people to start businesses there  | Have you ever been asked a question that you don’t know the answer to? What was your response? Did you make something up? Did you talk around the question? One thing I have learned over the years is the power of saying three simple words---”I don’t know”. It might seem like a scary phrase, you might think people will lose respect for you or that they will think you’re an idiot. But I have found that the opposite is true. People tend to have more respect for someone who admits they don’t know everything. I think getting comfortable with this phrase is something that is going to be increasingly important in the days ahead as the pace of change gets faster and faster. We are never going to be able to know everything about everything. There is power in admitting you don’t have all the answers. | This week I am joined by Ann Anaya, the Chief Diversity Officer at 3M, a global company with 93,000 employees in 70 countries around the world.

Ann has been with 3M for six years. She actually began her career as a lawyer, first for the state court in Minnesota and then for the US Attorney’s Office focusing on major white collar and complex crime. Six years ago she was looking for a change in her career path and she applied into legal affairs for 3M. After working in legal affairs for four years she was asked to consider the newly opened position of Chief Diversity Officer.\xa0 \xa0 Ann gave advice to others who are looking to change careers, she said there are three pieces in figuring out the best industry and role.\xa0 \xa0  What is your passion? What are you good at? Figure out where your skills and passions make a difference and then take action  \xa0 She says, “we all know that we\'re really good at some ... a handful of particular skills and one of the things that I am fortunate to have as a skillset that I do well at is the ability to influence change and doing that through advocacy. Yes, those are skills for a trial lawyer or a litigator but those are skills that we use in so many other ways. Number one, is passion. Number two, what skills do we really have that we\'re really good at? Then, finally, I would say, where can we take our experiences and apply them in a way that there is a need to make change?” \xa0 Ann also had a mentor, who played a huge role in helping her figure out where her skills fit best. She believes everyone should have people in their lives who push them, challenge them, and stretch them in order to be better. As she puts it, “We all need champions. We can’t do it alone” no matter if you are a leader or an entry level employee.\xa0 \xa0 3M has been focused on intentionally embedding diversity and inclusion into their brand, their mission, and their goals. They are going through a “new culture refresh” and it will be a part of all 3M does. And they are finding that having a diverse and inclusive organization not only impacts the employees, it also impacts the customers.\xa0 “Diversity is all about demographics and inclusion is about our environment or the atmosphere we create in our workplace. There is no one without the other. You can\'t have an inclusive workforce if there isn\'t diversity within the workforce and you can\'t be inclusive without the diversity of ideas, perspectives and backgrounds. You won\'t benefit from diversity, inclusion unless you have both.”   What you will learn:  Why we should focus on skills rather than job titles Advice for people who would like to explore a new career path Why people outside of HR need to know about diversity and inclusion What is diversity and inclusion and why is it important Programs 3M has in place to embrace and promote diversity and inclusion ', 'chan_desc': "Join futurist, best-selling author, and speaker Jacob Morgan as he explores the leadership, the future of work, and employee experience.

Security. Risk. conference, it would be hard to argue that the California Consumer Privacy Act wasn\'t the general topic of conversation everywhere from the keynote stage to breakout sessions to happy hour. From a dressing room offstage at The Cosmopolitan Hotel\'s Chelsea Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada, Angelique Carson, CIPP/US, sat down with Tanya Forsheit of Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz to talk about the latest. Forsheit counsels all sorts of companies, big and small and in-between, to help them comply with CCPA. In this episode of The Privacy Advisor Podcast, Forsheit talks about industry\'s perspective on the latest CCPA amendments, the most difficult part of compliance to date and what she thinks about the bombshell Alastair Mactaggart dropped during this week\'s conference that he\'s introducing a CCPA 2.0.\xa0 | A surefire way to take the social temperature of a time period is to sample its art. For those who’ve been working in privacy for some time, it’s perhaps slightly surreal to now see aspects of the profession reflected in popular culture. In October, “The Right to Be Forgotten,” by playwright Sharyn Rothstein, will debut at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. It follows the story of a 17-year-old boy seeking to have his past misdeeds forgotten online and the obstacles he faces in doing that. Host Angelique Carson recently got a preview of the play and afterward interviewed director Seema Sueko in this episode of The Privacy Advisor Podcast. | Friday, Sept 6, was the final day for any amendments to the California Consumer Privacy Act to be introduced, per California Assembly rules. Lawmakers have since voted on those amendments and we now know what the final version of the CCPA looks like, subject to the signature of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. In this episode of The Privacy Advisor Podcast, Mary Stone Ross, who worked alongside Alastair Mactaggart to craft what we now know as the CCPA, discusses the last amendments to be introduced to the law before the California legislature adjourns today, Sept. 13.\xa0 | This week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced its settlement with Google and its subsidiary YouTube as a historic moment and a "game changer" for enforcement under the Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act. Google will pay $170 million and YouTube must implement various changes to the way it manages content creators on its site and the way they treat content geared toward children.\xa0It\'s the largest COPPA settlement ever obtained, but there\'s been criticism, including from FTC commissioners themselves. In this episode of The Privacy Advisor Podcast, Linnette Attai discusses COPPA enforcement to date and whether this settlement is in fact, as the FTC has touted, a "game changer."\xa0 | Remember when the GDPR was about to be signed into law and there was all sorts of chatter that the ePrivacy Regulation would soon be passed as well? That was years ago now. So what\'s happening within the EU government that we still don\'t have one. In this episode of The Privacy Advisor Podcast, Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, senior privacy counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum, takes us through the latest. She also discusses what went down in the European Court of Justice earlier this month when it heard the Schrems II case and how that might impact both the Privacy Shield and standard contractual clauses as viable methods for global data transfers.\xa0 | There\'s no question that the California Consumer Privacy Act has captured the attention of not only the U.S. but its global counterparts as well. What\'s perhaps even more concerning to companies aiming to comply with the law before it becomes effective in 2020 is the uncertainty surrounding the seemingly endless number of amendments being considered by California\'s legislature. How do you prepare to comply with a law that\'s not fully baked? In this episode, co-author of the CCPA ballot initiative, Mary Stone Ross, discusses how the law might differ, in the end, from its initial aims, and the impact industry\'s lobbying efforts is having on the end result.\xa0 | Recently, The New York Times announced it had hired journalist Kashmir Hill to its Business beat. Hill, most recently of Gizmodo, has long covered privacy in a distinct and unique first-person style, often through experimentation of her own with technology products and services. There was the time she tried to quit using the top five technology companies to see what her life would become, or the time she connected her entire home to the Internet of Things. In this episode of The Privacy Advisor Podcast, Hill talks to host Angelique Carson, CIPP/US, about covering the privacy beat and what she hopes to do with it at her new gig.\xa0 | It\'s been three years since journalist Angelique Carson, CIPP/US, was directed by her boss to start something called a podcast that could help serve the IAPP membership, allowing them in-depth insights from their peers on how to thrive in the privacy profession and detailed looks at some of the industry\'s most important news. Since then, The Privacy Advisor Podcast has grown by the thousands in downloads and listeners. To celebrate, in this fun-loving, 100th-episode special anniversary edition, Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\'s attorney and founder of Edelson PC, aims to give listeners some insight to the woman behind the microphone, grilling Carson on how she approaches interviews on the podcast, the massive shift in the privacy landscape since she started reporting in the space, and why she\'s so darn out-of-the-loop on pop culture.\xa0 | In this special edition of The Privacy Advisor Podcast, two of the people completely immersed in EU General Data Protection compliance discuss the last year of their lives. Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon describes the last year as "a washing machine stuck on the spin cycle; it’s been an incredible year of change for us as a data protection authority.” And Hogan Lovells’ Eduardo Ustaran calls the year “unprecedented.” The two talk about the ongoing struggles as companies and regulators sort things out, and opine as to whether individuals are genuinely better off as a result of the regulation. | While it\'s true privacy and data protection laws are undergoing shifts in many parts of the world, this is especially true for Latin America where there is no shortage of legislative action. Brazil approved its general data protection law last year, and it will come into effect in early 2020. Just as the U.S. is seeing with the California Consumer Privacy Act, Brazil\'s law is now being amended in all kinds of ways ahead of implementation. Amendments to the LGPD, the acronym used for its formal name in Portuguese, will also establish a new national DPA, and those approvals are expected to reach the country\'s Senate within weeks. In this episode of the podcast, Rosa Maria Franco, the IAPP\'s managing director for Latin America and based in Mexico, and Dino Santa Rosa of Brazil discuss the legal landscape in both Mexico and Brazil and what that means for the privacy profession in each jurisdiction.', 'chan_desc': 'The International Association of Privacy Professionals is the largest and most comprehensive global information privacy community and resource, helping practitioners develop and advance their careers and organizations manage and protect their data.

We offer niche services, work with niche clients, create niche products. We work hard to get as specific as we can in our business.   But when it comes to focusing in and getting specific, there is one area most entrepreneurs tend to ignore: Marketing. Their e-blasts and social media posts are all over the place, from inspirational quotes to stylized selfies to photos of their vegan and paleo lunch plate. They’re on every social media platform doing every possible tactic in the entrepreneur playbook.   This trap does not apply to today’s guest, Heidi Taylor, a business coach for caring business owners. Heidi has managed to not only niche down when it come to the marketing platforms she chooses, she’s also niched down on the type of content she delivers. Specifically, intake form reviews.   Every Wednesday in her Instagram stories, Heidi finds a coach or consultant and reviews their intake form, point by point. Not only does this serve her audience, it gives potential clients a sneak peek into how she works. The strategy is specific, strategic, and highly effective.   In today’s interview, Heidi shares how she went from floral designer, to life coach, to business coach, how she attracts her target clients through her messaging, and how we can all improve and better utilize our intake forms.

Continuing our Marketing Month, today’s episode will shed light on why email marketing is so important, how to do it well, and how we’re shifting our tactics and doing things differently. \xa0 I couldn’t do an episode on email marketing without ActiveCampaign.

Joanna is always on the forefront of new tactics and trends, so I asked her, What are you most interested in right now? Her answer:\xa0Voice First. My response? What’s that? As soon as I got home, I dug deep into voice marketing and voice SEO, and realized why she was so intrigued. With more and more people bringing smart speakers into their home, not to mention becoming more reliant on Google Assistant and Siri, voice marketing is the next big wave, a wave I wanted to be on. So I began searching to find the thought leaders and marketers at the forefront of voice technology, and not only did I find them, they happen to be based in Chicago.

In this episode, I share some of the lessons I learned over the summer, such as the importance of taking our own advice and not adding new things to our plates without taking something away.

And of course, I’m grateful to listeners like you for joining me on this journey. Today, I’m sharing the reason I decided to record seasons of the podcast rather than doing an ongoing show, and how you may want to take a “seasonal” approach to your business.

With all the ideas running through my head and big dreams for by business, it was hard to hone in on what was most important. Sometimes, I’d be too ambitious, trying to accomplish everything and as a result, accomplishing nothing. Other times, I set my sights too low, easily reaching revenue targets or launching new projects with little effort. It wasn’t until I started paying attention to my current stage of business and determining which areas of my business needed the most attention, that I was able to set appropriate goals for my business. It wasn’t until I met Todd Herman and participated in the 90 Day Year. If you’ve been listening to this podcast episode for a while, you may remember that at this time last year, I shared my experience in the 90 Day Year program. So what I thought would be fun for this week’s episode, is I’m going to share a portion of last year’s episode, before sharing where my businesses have gone from then until now.

On November 12, 2019, Harvard Business Press will be releasing a new version of my book Disrupt Yourself. As a countdown of sorts, we’re going to spend the next seven episodes focusing on the seven-point framework of personal disruption. These seven accelerants help you manage through – even embrace change - whether at work or at home. Today, we’ll be talking about accelerant one - taking the right risks. We covered this in-depth in episode 100, and we’ll link to that in the show notes, but in short, we take the right risks when we take on market risk instead of competitive risk and play where others aren’t playing. My guest today is a great example of a person taking on market risk - Adela Mizrachi, founder of the Podcast Brunch Club.

At the age of 15 he began working on computer simulations for the US Military. By the year 2000 he was working as the IT Chief for the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response program for the US Centers for Disease Control, and in 2001 he lead the response to the horrible anthrax attacks that followed 9/11 as well as the SARS outbreaks in 2003 and other public health emergencies.

These moments when the assumptions about your business change or become irrelevant are not always easy to spot, but, as Rita explains, they can make or break you. Rita gives some great insights into how organizations can plan for the future, as well as how they can avoid the pitfalls of short-sightedness.

Make a planned exit, cushion the landing, prepare for the change. But that is not the route Ali Brown took. After two years at a small marketing firm, she knew she was undervalued. She had so much more to give! Opportunities to move up were limited, and to top it all off, there wasn’t even a women’s bathroom! When a freelance marketer casually mentioned to her that he thought she had the skills to be a freelance copywriter, Ali started asking questions. What’s a freelancer? And, more importantly, can I take you out for coffee to learn more? Join us as we discuss how Ali went from a simple email list to business consultant, how you can find your lane in life and the types of risk worth taking.

A Thinkers50 globally ranked management thinker, he has authored or coauthored ten books. His most recent book, “Questions Are the Answer,” examines the fact that while people are pre-programmed to look for answers, the real catalysts for innovative change are questions. Join us as we discuss Hal’s early careers in photography and politics; what makes a catalytic question; and the question that best motivates him to take action. Complete show notes and links can be found at https://whitneyjohnson.com/hal-gregersen | To say that Karen Beattie is comfortable with change is a bit of an understatement. Her childhood was nomadic, with her father’s job taking her family to such diverse places as Trinidad, the Caribbean, Libya, Nigeria, United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines. It was not unusual for her father to come home and say, “We’re moving to a different country.” And Karen loved it. It hasn’t been easy; Karen compares her professional life to a roller coaster. Through it all, Karen has found that being comfortable with change has given her opportunities she never would have dreamed of as a kid. “[W]hat I did was I made a choice. Yes, do I want this. It’s going to be hard. So I intentionally stepped into it.” Join us as we delve into Karen’s early career, her pursuit of flexibility and freedom, and how she took the leap for the right kind of risk.

A primarily self-taught pianist, he has an amazing talent for composition, oftentimes performing on-the-spot “mash-ups” of famous songs for live audiences. His ability to effortlessly create melodies has led to multiple collaboration efforts, including producing the cinematic pop group GENTRI. Today’s podcast is unique for several reasons: first, Stephen composes a “mash-up” of two of my favorite melodies, and I am delighted at the result! Additionally (because we like to keep things exciting), you’ll get to hear Stephen collaborate with our very own producer, Macy Robison. Join us for an enthralling journey into the heartbeat of music and the world of collaboration.\xa0 Complete show notes and links available at https://whitneyjohnson.com/stephen-nelson | As the mother of two young children, all of Julie Berry’s focus was on keeping them safe, happy, and healthy, but despite loving them fiercely, Julie also felt intensely isolated. Walking around in maternity clothes with spit up and pieces of breakfast clinging to her, Julie couldn’t help but feel frustrated with her limited sphere of influence in the world. What had been the point of going to college? Was this really all she was made to do? Julie’s story is beautiful, and especially dear to me as Julie was a “late bloomer.” She may not have left college as a bestselling author, but her stories are made all the richer by the experiences that have led her to this point.

And Jason’s got a book out called The Soulful Art of Persuasion that a Harvard business professor has called the modern version of Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People. If you want to learn how to persuade through character as opposed to using numbers and debates, you’re in the right place. | The lead singer of O.A.R. clues Cal in to the business philosophies that have kept Of A Revolution thriving for nearly a quarter of a century. Any stereotype of dreamy artists is swiftly put to rest as Marc explains the constant vigilance all the band members throw into their work to keep the seats filled and their loyal fans coming back year after year after year. These lessons are applicable not only to Cal’s new business helping companies tell their stories. But they apply to anybody on the job . . . and even to parenthood. | Cal gets tips on getting all those dings, notifications and technological distractions out of his life from a man who has spent much of his career making people yearn for more technology. Many takeaways in this conversation with the author of the upcoming book, Indistractable, are about controlling your attention and leading a clearer and more focused life. It’s just the advice Cal needs now that he’s a CEO. Everyone who listens will come away a winner. | Cal poses the question after hearing the wondrous story of Dr. Sabrina Kay – who came to the U.S. from South Korea while in college without speaking English, started out as a janitor and began an entrepreneurial journey that took her to the cover of Fortune Magazine.\xa0 By the time she’d reached her 30s, Sabrina had amassed enough wealth so that neither she – nor any of her family members\xa0– ever needed to work again. But that was only the beginning. Sabrina went on to get a master’s degree at USC and a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. Now, after buying Fremont College, she’s reinventing the entire education system. This episode is packed with takeaways that will make you think about what you would do if never needed to work again. | Cal looks back on the most amazing thing he’s ever seen in his life, August 7, 1974, when a French street performer named Philippe Petit secretly rigged a wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center and walked on it 1,300 feet above the ground. There are many lessons to be learned from Philippe’s feat, which took place 45 years ago, and Cal has mined for them through at least a dozen viewings of the documentary Man on Wire and the feature film called The Walk. The British mogul Richard Branson also calls Man on Wire one of his favorite films, and Cal wraps up his thoughts with a short conversation he had with Branson about what we can all take away from August 7, 1974. | That’s right, Matt Pohlson. Cal sits with the founder of Omaze, a company that has helped raise $130 million for roughly 350 charities through donations made by people looking for a chance to win once in a lifetime experiences with the people they dream of meeting. Drink wine with Jennifer Lawrence. Get in a tank with Arnold Schwarzenegger and go crush things. Go on a double date with George and Amal Clooney. These events can lead to extraordinary stories. When Matt tells them they get better and better . . . and then Matt describes what it was like when he flatlined for four minutes, and came back from the edge of death, and how it changed his life. By the end, you’ll see why this is one of Cal’s favorite episodes. | Not long ago, the New Orleans Pelicans won the National Basketball Association’s draft lottery and selected one of the most unique young talents in the league’s history: Zion Williamson. As we see in this week’s episode, the executive in charge of putting together that team, David Griffin, has created a life out of being around the right people. How else would an intern in a media relations department rise to running an NBA team? Griff’s backstory makes us all wonder about the people we meet and choose to be around (and not to be around), and how those choices make us everything we become. This conversation will make you think about the choices you make in your own life and how they impact your own future. And that’s just for starters . . .\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'As a bestselling author, speaker and one of the greatest interviewers of this generation, Cal Fussman has sat down with some of the world’s most influential individuals: Muhammad Ali, Mikhail Gorbachev, Serena Williams, Jeff Bezos, Jack Welch, John Wooden, Al Pacino and hundreds of others, digging deep into their hearts and delivering their wisdom to the rest of the world.

But how can you be open and authentic without revealing too much—or the wrong thing? What makes the difference between an authentic moment and an awkward moment? How do you strike the delicate balance between “authentic” and “too much information?”\xa0In this episode, the Guys discuss the risks and rewards of authenticity, and explain how to make sure your openness and honesty work for you, not against you. | With all the criticism and negativity that surrounds us today, it can be hard to maintain a positive attitude.\xa0But when we tune out all negative-sounding comments, we risk cutting ourselves off from even the constructive criticism we desperately need to grow and improve. When that happens, you’ve become “bulletproof.” In this episode, the Guys discuss the reasons we all need to remain open to criticism, and explain how to tell the difference between constructive criticism and useless negativity. | Why are some people able to turn their great ideas into successful realities, while others allow their similar ideas to fade into distant memory? What marks the difference between a mere dreamer and someone who makes their dreams come true?\xa0Episode 158 of the Communication Guys podcast is “Give Your Idea a Chance to Live,” where the Guys discuss the reasons that we often ignore or reject our best ideas, and why your ability to communicate might make the difference between a good concept and a great reality. | At Stanford University’s prestigious Graduate School of Business, the most popular elective in their MBA program focuses not on business, but on Emotional Intelligence. Stanford’s best and brightest are taught that mastering this topic is crucial to their success in both business and relationships.\xa0In “5 Qualities of an Emotionally Intelligent Person,” the Guys describe 5 essential principles of Emotional Intelligence and explain its importance in our everyday lives. | In business as well as relationships, we sometimes make the mistake of focusing on the larger issues and forgetting that there are small things that have the power to make a remarkable difference.\xa0In this Communication Guys podcast, the Guys describe 6 simple, easy, but commonly overlooked practices that can greatly increase our ability to connect with others.

This episode is a replay of one of our 10 most-downloaded episodes, and was originally released as Episode 103. | There’s a new mantra among communicators today:\xa0“Connection before content.” It means: Before you attempt to impart that fascinating content of yours, make sure you’ve established a personal connection with your audience. Today’s listeners want to know who you are before they’re willing to consider what you have to say.\xa0In “Connection Before Content,” the Guys give 5 principles for establishing the kind of personal connection that will make any audience eager to listen. | Did you know that the average businessperson sends or receives 105 emails every day? Have you noticed how many of them you ignore—and have you ever wondered if your co-workers are ignoring yours the same way?\xa0Episode 153 of the Communication Guys podcast is “Email Fails,” where the Guys give 5 principles for composing an email that’s sure to get opened and read. | Have you ever wondered if you would make a good emcee?\xa0We tend to think of an emcee as a comedian, but the truth is, there’s a lot more to being a master emcee than just being able to tell a few jokes. When you’re called on to host an entire event, will you know what to do? In “How to Be a Master Emcee,” the Guys describe the 5 key responsibilities of a great master of ceremonies. You’ll rarely hear these principles taught anywhere else. | Did you see the story in USA Today?\xa0A woman named Alexa Bjornson put her 7 year-old son Landon on a plane to fly to Portland all by himself. But Landon is autistic, and Alexa was afraid her son might annoy whoever might be sitting beside him. So Alexa wrote a note, enclosed a ten dollar bill, and told her son to give it to his seatmate.

But if we ever hope to be healthy individuals and effective leaders, learning to embrace endings and see the opportunity they bring will be an essential skill to cultivate. Join us as we hear from Daniel Leavell, a wildfire expert and Oregon State University professor, about how forests need fire to stay healthy and promote growth, and how this natural relationship can help us better understand the necessary role endings can play in our lives and leadership.

Making the right decisions regarding people, money, organizational focus, and whatever else comes your way is impossible to do alone. And always turning to the same people for advice can lead to stale, repetitive action that doesn't lead to growth. On this episode, we dive into how involving a network of the right kinds of outsiders can do wonders for your leadership - if you're willing to accept the help.

It’s a simple word that serves as the source of so much fear, difficulty and confusion in our lives. This is especially true at work, where trust between team members isn’t always easy to come by. But research shows that trust is perhaps the number one thing that healthy teams have in common, and that unhealthy teams desperately need. But trust requires hard work, vulnerability and commitment. So how do you build it? Join us as we learn from Jeff Gibson—President of Consulting with The Table Group—about why trust is so important and how you and your team can start making it a priority. For more information, to subscribe, or to catch up on previous episodes, visit us at:\xa0 www.buildingchampions.com/podcast | Healthy teams function at their best when every member of the team is supporting one another and working together to make sure the best ideas and solutions are brought to the table. But whether you’re a leader or a team member, we’ve all had experiences where just the opposite occurs. A teammate dominates the conversation with their own ideas, or we become defensive when our own ideas are called into question. In these instances, our fears and insecurities create an unhealthy environment, one where the team stops working together to get things right and instead, we focus on being right and protecting our own egos. Join us as we learn from Adal Rifai—improviser, coach and teacher at Chicago’s acclaimed iO Theater—about what the practices of successful improv teams can teach us about how to focus less on being right and start focusing more on what you and your team can do to get it right and achieve better creativity, cohesion and results.

We run hard, pushing through without taking breaks, and we wear ourselves down to zero, thinking that whatever sleep we get will be enough to recharge us to 100 percent and prepare us for the next busy day. And we think this is the best way to get things done and succeed in business and in life. But what we don’t realize is that our bodies need moments to recharge throughout the day, and stopping to take efficient, purposeful breaks will actually help us to go further, faster in our lives and leadership. Join us as we learn from four-time Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey and wellness expert Patrick Khoo about how you can rethink recharging and start implementing practices that will set you up for success throughout your days and weeks.

And yet, many of us simply roll out of bed without any clear plan for how to effectively use our mornings. We sleep late and hit the snooze button multiple times, or we grab our phones first thing and dive right into the stress of work. But what if by intentionally setting aside time in the morning to invest in your physical and mental well-being, you could feel more confident and purposeful in both your life and your leadership? Join us as we talk with University of Oregon’s Curtis Taylor—Associate Head Coach of their distinguished Track and Field team—as we discover how the routines of competitive sprinters can shed light on how we can design and improve our own morning routines.

But unfortunately for our brains, life is usually never that simple. In many of the decisions we make, both at home and at work, there are often multiple variables at play, there is some important information we do not have access to, and luck can play a big role in how things turn out. And when we try to oversimplify something when it’s actually nuanced and complex, our decision-making suffers. Join us as we talk with decision-making expert and former poker player Annie Duke as she highlights the common gaps in our thinking, and what you as a leader can do to embrace uncertainty in your decision-making and get better results.

But unfortunately, many of us find this hard to do. In our increasingly fast-paced and complex lives, there are so many things vying for our time and attention that we can easily get caught up in the day-to-day stresses of life and lose sight of the bigger picture. These things add up to form what we call The Drift. The Drift is a subtle force that constantly threatens to pull us off course in our lives and leadership, and if we’re not careful, we can end up in a place where we never intended to be.

We have talked with dozens of people on the podcast that we have personally worked with to make these changes. But one thing we haven’t really shown you is the fact that change isn’t just a one-time event. As we continue to learn about ourselves and as we grow, our lives change. This is often in the form of changes in family (having more kids, kids growing up), moving to a different house or city, or developing new skills. This growth also results in changes in your goals and desires. You begin to see a bigger and better picture of what you want to do in your life. Over the next several months, we are going to be bringing some past guests back onto the podcast to catch up with where they are now and how things have changed since we last had them on the podcast. So this week, we are bringing Michal Balass back onto the podcast. Tomorrow, I’m going to share the recent conversation I had with her; but to help us understand where she is now, today we’re going to hear her story from the last time she was on the show. | By now you should have a decision!

Getting out of your comfort zone I do have the voice in my head that’s telling me “Stay where you are” on occasion, but I also will pause and take a step back and say, “Where do I know that I’d truly been at my best? Where have I been the happiest and most fulfilled in terms of my work?” It has always been when I am pushed and when I’m outside of my comfort zone. Find Your WHY Most companies and individuals are able to talk about the ‘what’ and sometimes they get to the ‘how’, but they’re very rarely actually able to articulate the ‘why’ – why are we doing what we’re doing. Servant Leadership As a leader, you’re not supposed to be bossing people around. You’re supposed to be in service of the team that you have. Your job is to actually really help bring your team together, but you are in service to them, as opposed to being directive. Tristan’s Advice to New Leaders Make sure you hire and grow and manage from a diversity perspective – diversity of thought, not just in terms of gender, race or age. 100% - don’t stop learning. Make sure that you remain curious. There’s a whole bunch of ways you can do that – consuming videos, podcasts, books, etc. Don’t try and boil the ocean – stick with one or two things that worked for you. \xa0 \xa0 Links and Resources Connect with Tristan: LinkedIn Start With Why by Simon Sinek Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek Ten Percent Happier by Dan Harris \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Be a student of your craft and of management.

Our guest for today is Andy Storch. Andy is a Talent Development Consultant and Partner at Advantage Performance Group based in sunny Orlando, Florida. He’s the host of two podcasts: Talent Development Hot Seat, and The Andy Storch Show. Today we talk about:  The importance of personal and professional branding Impostor Syndrome, Understanding and acknowledging your own strengths and weaknesses, Putting yourself (and your content) out there and a lot more.  Click that play button to listen! Don’t forget to subscribe and rate us on  Apple Podcasts! Impostor Syndrome I remember the first time I was an analyst at a large insurance company in California. I got promoted as a product manager, and I had an analyst reporting to me. I realized very quickly that she knew more about the job than I did, and that was an intimidating and humbling situation because I didn’t really feel like I should be her manager. I felt like she should by my manager. I know a lot of people end up in situations like that – whether it’s legitimate or not – because many people have a little bit of “impostor syndrome”, where you don’t think that you really deserve the title or the position that you’re in. I definitely had that then. What I’ve learned later on in life is that being a manager is not about being the smartest person. It’s not about knowing more than the people who report to you. It’s about being able to coordinate, put them in the right position to do their jobs, be there to coach them and help them with issues they’re dealing with. Personal and Professional Branding I really believe that in the future of work, things are changing. We hear about the so-called “gig economy”. It doesn’t mean that everybody’s going to be a freelancer or an independent consultant like me, but I do think that companies are going to be going to more project-based work. People are going to be moving around more, working remotely, working in different positions, different places, changing jobs a lot more often. Therefore, I think it becomes more and more important for people to understand their own strengths and the strengths of the people around them, and getting different roles based on what those strengths are. And they’re often going to assign those things based on what you’re known for. Everybody has a brand, something they’re known for, whether they take time to define it or not. Stay hungry Keep that mindset that you’ve never really reached your destination, or you’re on a journey of learning, of growth, even when you are 50 or 60 years old and pretty established in your career. That you don’t know it all, you don’t have it all figured out. That you could always learn from other people, and you have this curiosity, always. \xa0 \xa0 Links and Resources Connect with Andy: LinkedIn  Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter by Liz Wiseman Talent Development Think Tank 2019 http://www.talentdevelopmenthotseat.com/ http://bit.ly/AndyStorchShow  \xa0 \xa0 | Knowing who you are and knowing what drives you – that will allow you to be more true to yourself, and it will allow you to have a more authentic leadership journey. – Steve Kent Hi everyone!

Find a mentor When I found myself sitting in the council chambers for the first time, of course there’s a degree of intimidation that naturally goes with that. But very quickly, some of the senior members of the council took me under their wing and were able to provide advice and feedback and coaching and support. Some of those folks, for years, have remained close advisors and friends. I did a lot of listening than talking in the early days. It’s really important to not go in with guns blazing and really get the lay of the land, listen carefully, learn, demonstrate that you are interested in listening and learning, and pick your moments in terms of weighing in on the discussions and debates. That’s what set me up for success in local government. \xa0 Work-Life Balance I allowed myself to be completely consumed by the work, and it was hard not to be, because I was so passionate about the work we were doing. It consumed me. It affected my relationships, my health, and other aspects of my life – whether it was volunteering or my political life. I was still studying, and that proved to be challenging. That work-life balance thing is something that we’ll always struggle with, but I’ve had some wake-up calls in the early days about the importance of consciously trying to find that balance. When I failed to do so, I got myself in some tough spots. I still struggle with work-life balance, but I’ve learned along the way. You learn to make better decisions and take more time to reflect, plan, cope and seek support. Staying true to yourself I’ve spent a lot of time in public life and elected office, there were lots of difficult moments in politics – some I can talk about and some that I swore an oath that I won’t talk about. But the times when I got myself in trouble was when I wasn’t completely true to myself. The advice I have for any new leader: no matter what situation you’re in, don’t compromise your principles. Be true to yourself, lead with integrity, lead by example, be honest, be genuine, be authentic, be your own dog. If you are sticking out like a nail, someone will try to hammer you down and it’s important that you don’t let that happen. \xa0 Links and Resources Connect with Steve: LinkedIn Facebook, Twitter steve@stevekent.ca  Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip and Dan Heath  Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't by Jim Collins Lists Electronic Calendar | Fully understand where you are and maximize it. Welcome to the show, everybody! Today’s guest is Jared Kligerman, President of The Think Tank, a boutique integrated marketing agency based here in Toronto, Canada. Today we talk about the importance of networking as a new manager, and the power of those networking relationships. \xa0 We also discuss  Jared’s early leadership blunders lessons Networking tips for introverts Why and how you should be networking How to choose the right networking events Pruning your network, and a lot more.  Click that play button to listen, and don’t forget to rate us on iTunes! Come without expectations Some people go into networking with the objective of landing a job or a client. This is one of the reasons why networking “doesn’t work” – the expectation that you’re going to get something out of it. What really did it for me was meeting a bunch of people at networking events, who, from the beginning of the conversation, I knew there wasn’t going to be any business opportunity there. We hit it off around a bunch of different topics – some of them were around business, but a lot of them were about personal stuff or sports. Those were the people I’ve kept in touch with, who I call up on a regular basis. My perception and my objective now when I go to networking events is, when I go, I try to meet 15 new people. Truthfully, I very rarely hit that goal, mostly because along the way I end up meeting people I really jive with and I end up having a fantastic conversation with. \xa0 Find someone you enjoy talking to Don’t expect that everybody you meet will have a strong connection with you and will want to have a long-term relationship with you. That’s just not the case. You’re not going to have a rapport with every person you talk to. Once I start getting comfortable talking to three different people, I up it to four people, then five. Then I start saying, “Now I want to try and meet five people, and I’m going to see if I can get one of those to be someone who’s really worth connecting and staying in-touch with long-term.” Now I’ve built a new layer of objective where it’s still not about the sales; it’s about meeting five people, and meeting one who’s really going to be helpful in some way, or just someone I want to talk to. It’s OK to be Picky Being a dad, I want to see my little one more often, and recognizing how much time and energy my wife puts into it, I also wanted to be an active part of it. I’ve built my personal rule that I’m only out one night a week, sometimes two if I have a lot of heads-up notice. And usually that second one’s with my wife. Because I’m only allowing myself to be out one night a week, I’ve had to really get picky about which events I’m going to. There’s a lot of networking events hosted on any given night, in any big city, and I know a lot of people who bounce around all of them. I’ve done it, and it’s exhausting, with very low returns. \xa0 Links and Resources Connect with Jared: LinkedIn http://tttmrktg.com/ Fuckup Nights Lead, Follow or Get Out of the Way: The Ultimate Guide to Leadership in the New World of Business by Greg Witz  One Powerful Mind: The Complete Approach to Emotional Management at Home and at Work by Paul Witz  Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip Heath and Dan Heath Work-Life Balance Lists | Healthy and engaged employees, in concert with a strong Growth Mindset workplace culture, are the secret sauce for business success. When it comes to performance, it’s no surprise that the right mindset is critical to success. Today we’re going to talk with Dave Buzanko about how you can leverage a growth mindset to level up your results.

Click that play button to listen, and don’t forget to rate us on iTunes! Leading your Inner Circle To me, I always think, “I lead my family, my friends, and my co-workers around me.” I don’t lead thousands of people; I know that we can only manage so many relationships, so I try to focus on the ones that are closest to me. If I can teach those people how to care for the people in their charge, then my job as a leader is to pass that knowledge on. That’s how I approach leadership today. It’s Who’s in my immediate circle of influence? What can I teach them? How can I teach them? How can I be the leader that they hope that I would be so that when they run into a tough situation, not only do they not feel embarrassed or ashamed or scared to speak up and say “I don’t have the answers,” but they’re willing to speak up and say, “I need your help”? What is a growth mindset? A person who has a Growth Mindset is somebody who is open to learning and improving their skill sets, while somebody with a fixed mindset believes that they’re born with a certain set of skills; they can’t improve upon those skills so they spend their lives measuring those skills and competing against each other, trying to define what they can do, but believing that there’s a limit to it. In business and in life, we can easily be fooled into thinking that we are what we create for ourselves and we are nothing more. The Five Pillars of Growth For me, to make things actionable, I actually have five pillars of growth mindsets, and they’re based on five of the best scientific books.

Click that play button to listen, and don’t forget to rate us on iTunes! Leaders need to be self-aware You have to develop the skill of self-inquiry. “What is this?” “What am I feeling?” “Why do I feel it?” And stay with that train of thought. Don’t accept your first answer as true. If meditation is too woo-woo for you, that might be something you could do and achieve the same type of awareness and result. Be your kind of leader If you’re familiar with Myers-Briggs, I’m an INTJ. INTJ’s are always the villain. I’m Emperor Palpatine in Which Star Wars Character Are You?, I’m the butler from Downton Abbey. My boss, Bill, is an ENTJ. We approach things in very much the same way, except that he’s very much an extrovert and I’m an introvert in an extroverted job. One thing I was doing wrong (for me) for a long time was I was trying to be an ENTJ because that’s what was being modeled for me. And I was exhausting myself. I have things I bring to the table, but I can’t work as many hours, in the same hours, in the same types of hours – meaning, always with people – that Bill can, and be successful. It’s being honest about that, and realizing that to be at my best, I will have to approach things my way. Letting go of the belief that you have to be what has been modeled for you is really important. Sara’s advice to New Leaders I think when you first become a leader, you rush out to the bookstore or podcast menu and you look for “How do I fix other people?” “How do I get my team to do x?” “How do I get them to do y?” “How do we achieve results?” And those are really valuable skills, but it’s so easy to lose touch with your own growth and your own development, and to forget that you still have growing to do. Never invest more into someone’s personal development than they’re willing to put in themselves. Be others-focused, but also realize that that doesn’t mean you’re now the camp director over everybody’s professional development.

Palmer | Hi everyone! Welcome to the show. Today we’re flipping the format a little bit and we’re going to hear from the employee standpoint of what they look for in a new manager. If you’re an aspiring leader, this is a great perspective to hear. Today’s guest is Craig Rosenstein, a young man at the front end of his career. We talk about what’s important for a new manager to know from the eyes of someone they would be managing. In this episode, we talk about the two big things employees are looking for in a new leader, credibility being a two-way street, starting new work relationships on the right foot and a lot more. Click that play button to listen, and don’t forget to rate us on iTunes! Give your Employees Support I always see these posts on LinkedIn and they say, “Here are the things that are important to employees: Being compensated fairly, being recognized, having development” and they are all very valid and important points. But the one word I never see is “support”. At the end of the day, you want your employees to feel empowered and feel supported enough to succeed. Everyone’s human and we have motivations, challenges and doubts, and the way to work through those situations is if you have that support system. From a leadership perspective, what I look for is, firstly, someone who’s available, and secondly, someone who either has the information or tools to help me when I’m missing something, or at least could direct me to that avenue. Give your employees Vision/Direction Do I know what my manager, and specifically, what the organization is trying to accomplish and how they’re trying to accomplish it? Even if I feel supported in a role, if I don’t see the bigger picture, or I’m not able to really understand how what I’m doing day to day impacts the business or the organization, then 1) I might not be as effective in my role, and 2) it might be like I’m doing things without a direction. Consistently check-in As a manager, sometimes you assume that they’re (your employees) are good – you’re checking in, you’re meeting frequently. But even as a manager, you need to continually check-in when people are getting busier or have more on their plate. Oftentimes, especially with a high performer, you just assume they’re going to get it done and all is good, and they may or may not be of the communication style to let you know. So it’s really important to be constantly checking in and making sure your people, especially your high performers, are in a good place, and not just assuming all is well.

Today’s guest is Simon Brocklehurst. Simon is a commercial leader with a unique breadth of experience working in, and with, many of the world’s leading organizations. He established CommercialSolutions consulting, a different kind of consulting firm, to help you solve your commercial challenges: creating clear, pragmatic plans and supporting their delivery. In this episode, we talk about  His first leadership role, Staying true to yourself, How to create a strategy, Disruption, And a lot more.  Click that play button to listen, and don’t forget to rate us on iTunes! Stay True to Yourself I worked in an organization with a very controlling culture; there was always a culture of fear. There was a lot of inexperience and insecurity in the leadership. I was delivering the goals, but I think what I did there was I tried too hard to deliver how the people who were in charge wanted me to deliver, rather than how I should have done. I didn’t stay true to myself. What I realized afterwards was that the internal conflict there was perceived as inauthentic sometimes by some of the people I worked with, and they didn’t see how much I really cared for them, how I really wanted them to be successful. I think the lesson for me certainly is, whatever situation you’re in, you need to be authentic. Absolutely essential for any leader, new or experienced. What is Strategy? For me, strategy should be simple. It should be very practical; it should yield results quite quickly, because you need to have a clear vision and you need to make it happen. Strategy is a plan. That’s it. It’s a plan to achieve something. You need to do a couple of things: one, you need to have a clear vision. Obviously, you must have an idea of where you’re going. Pick a destination. The best way to do that is to do it with a group. Then it’s about what you are going to do to achieve that vision. What are you going to focus on? What are you not going to focus on? The final thing is who’s going to do what, when and how. Prioritization – don’t try to do it all in one go. Break it down into tasks and say, “Which one are we going to do first, second, and later on to get to where we’re going?” For me, it’s all about this continuous process of improving and moving towards your vision. VISTA I have a process, I call it VISTA – Vision, Strategy, Tactics and Achieve. It’s not rocket science, it’s pretty simple.  Create a Vision. Decide on what are your focus areas, your strategies. Get your tactics clear. What are the things you are actually going to do? Achieve them. Stay flexible, track where you’re going, keep the discipline, make sure you’re focused on what you’re doing action-wise and everyone knows what’s doing what and when.

He is a Senior Sales Consultant at Sales Performance International. In this episode, we talk about  How he lived through the Hudson River plane crash Empowering your subordinates Leading from the back vs Leading from the front Productivity And a lot more.  Click that play button to listen, and don’t forget to rate us on iTunes! \xa0 Empower your subordinates When I first moved into those leadership positions, about 80% of what I did was fly to various engagements and help close business. It’s always fun and always rewarding to be the hero. I could offer certain things that they couldn’t offer, so therefore, it behooved me to go in and close the deals. That worked very well until I got to the point where I had 125 sales people, 10 regional managers, and I realized that I was going to run out of time, energy and ability. At that point, a light bulb went off in my head. As a servant leader, you have to empower your subordinates. Help them understand that when they come to you, that they should ask the right questions about what they want or what they need to help close business. \xa0 Being a leader is an honor If you’re selected to be a leader, that’s an honor that transcends just about any compliment that could be paid to you. If you’re going to be a manager and you’re going to wear that mantle of manager or leader, you need to wear that mantle proudly, knowing that you’ve been bestowed with the ability to make someone’s life better. And you should do anything to make yourself better, to ensure that you do that. Leadership Advice It’s best to act now and early, than to wait until you have everything lined up perfectly. A moderate decision now is much better than a perfect decision 6 months from now. Actions and proper steps executed early can lead to a quicker decision.

Today we are going to talk about what to do when emotions come into the workplace. Specifically, what to do when someone cries at the office. As a new leader, what do you do when one of your employees or colleagues starts crying? I have gone through this firsthand with both men and women, so I am going to share four quick tips that will help you when you encounter this type of situation in the future (if you haven’t already). Hit that play button and don’t forget to subscribe and rate us on iTunes! \xa0 Don’t Get Weird Maybe you come from a family of “non-criers”, or you believe crying is not acceptable at work. But the moment you see someone’s eyes start to well up and they begin to lose their breath, it isn’t about you. It’s about them. Don’t make it about yourself. When somebody starts crying and they start to apologize for it, just say this, “It’s OK. It just means that you care.” Create A Safe Space Whether it’s your office or your employee’s office, let them know that the conversation is just between the two of you. Letting someone know that they have a safe zone for moments like this goes a long way. Listen I cannot emphasize this enough. This isn’t the kind of listening where you’re “listening” but you’re feeling awkward, you’re trying to find a solution, you’re waiting for that person to catch their breath so you can talk – I’m talking about genuine listening to what is, and isn’t, being said. Avoid Problem-Solving In highly emotional moments like this, your employee is not looking for you to solve their problems. If they are, they will likely ask you to. But it’s most likely that they just need an ear to listen to them.

How to Start and Grow a Successful Title Company and Real Estate Business in 2 Years Heidi Becker moved to Philadelphia 5 years ago and now runs 2 of Philly’s well-known title companies. Heidi made this move strategically knowing Philadelphia was a great investment area. “What is the motivation behind title?” Nicole asks Heidi during the interview. Heidi expresses her obsession with real estate since she was 16 years old which was her initial motivation. Thinking she wanted to be a real estate agent, Heidi found her true passion in title after working as an admin at another title company. She shares how her superior at that job at the time was a great teacher molding her into the title field. For those who may not be aware, ‘Title’ is to represent the contract and control all of the money in a real estate transaction. After being put in a position to do what she wanted and having a baby only motivated her more because she did not want to work a 9-5 job raising her child. She was recruited to do real estate settlements in Philadelphia and she took the opportunity to start her own title company. What is the process of starting a title company? Heidi explains this took over one year because\xa0you have to interview with underwriters and see who is going to give you the best support. What is an underwriter? Underwriters are the agents who backs up the contract and it is very\xa0important to choose someone who is reputable and to be around if something big happens. Heidi says “After hiring the RIGHT staff and keeping my overhead low, my business started to move rapidly”. How did you get into real estate? \xa0“It was always in the background… I just always had a passion for it. I went and got a partner, made an LLC, started looking for property, used hard money and was able to complete my first project” Heidi says.

He believes that you can do well by doing good. How to Build Your Residential and Commercial Real Estate Empire? Ken Weinstein starts off explaining how he got started in real estate by seeing problems and situations in the community and trying to find solutions to them. Blight was something Ken was 100% against which is why he started the Jumpstart program. He explains how he wanted to find developers to slow down or stop blight as a whole. “I am willing to take risks to make the world better” Ken says. In this episode Ken shares how he got into real estate. 30 years ago, living in Fishtown, Ken was really inspired by the city of Philadelphia. Watching his landlady at the time renovate 6 properties by herself gave Ken the assurance that he would be able to do the same. Although it took a while to aquire his first property after deciding real estate was an interest. “I saw a lot of opportunity in the Germantown area” Ken explains… “You need good market conditions, you need to see price points”. Ken then moves on to sharing how and why he was able to quit his day job and do real estate full-time. Having enough cash flow that it makes sense and to be able to hire staff is the only way he was able to pursue his real estate career. “It took me about 7 years to get me to the point where i want to leave my day job” - Ken Weinstein. Over the years Ken learned that real estate makes you better at your job and you are a better business owner/employer. One of the biggest points made in this episode is the difference \xa0 between residential and commercial real estate in the eyes of one the biggest developers in Philly. “You should ALWAYS start in residential, that should be your ground level… it’s an easier development for anyone to understand and commercial should be long term” - Ken W.

How does it change your company? How does it change your worldview? And how do you channel all of that change into something much more significant? In our season finale, we explore the great beyond of post-IPO success with Aneel Bhusri, Josh James, Maggie Wilderotter, and Aaron Levie. | This is it. The moment you’ve been waiting for. How nervous is everyone? Why IPO? Why now? In this episode, we talk with successful entrepreneurs about the highs and lows of taking their companies public—and everything it took to get there. You\'ll hear from Josh James, Fred Luddy, Julia Hartz, Ben Horowitz, Aneel Bhusri, and our very own Frederic Kerrest about the day itself and how it propels your company into an entirely new chapter. | You have one chance to make your shot. Every eye in the room is on you, there’s no room for self-doubt, and failure is not an option. As your company grows, you’ll go up against the buzzer and face your competition time after time. In order to consistently nail the game-changing shots, you have to learn to enjoy them. In this episode, 2015 NBA Finals MVP and Golden State Warriors shooting guard Andre Iguodala — someone very familiar with hitting clutch shots— teaches a master class on performing under pressure. Medallia\'s Amy Pressman comes in with the assist, sharing how even the best players in the game can improve. | You’re starting to get comfortable — dare we say, content — with your company’s progress. Hate to break it to you: it won’t last. The moment you realize that you’re settled in and basking in your glory should be a clear signal that it’s time to start reinventing yourself. In this episode, we talk to entrepreneurs who have mastered the art of keeping it fresh. Sebastian Thrun, Parker Harris, Melanie Perkins, and Marc Andreessen all share how you can continuously evolve and challenge yourself, your companies and your industries. | You always need another (cash) hit. In this episode of Zero to IPO, we discuss the rush that comes from getting an infusion of $30 million in capital, and the despair that follows when you realize it isn’t enough. Fundraising is essential to every entrepreneur’s success, and it can be addictive — the further you get from the last round, the more you need the next one. Join us as Aneel Bhusri, Josh James, Julia Hartz, and Fred Luddy tell us how to navigate capital raises and what it’s like to be “hooked.” | With every successful company, there comes a moment when things really start to click. But what happens when you hire 10, 20 or 200 new folks a week to handle the new business coming in? How do you inspire your team when you no longer know many of the people around you — at the company you founded? In this episode, we talk with Amy Pressman, Patty McCord, Melanie Perkins, Fred Luddy, and Carl Eschenbach about how to empower your people, scale your traditions and show employees you care — even when you can’t grab lunch with every one. | Company culture is hard to explain, harder to build and yet easy as hell to mess up. But here\'s what we do know: a business cannot succeed over time without a great culture. So, how do you foster the right kind of environment? How can it go astray, and can you save it when it does? In this episode, we talk with Carl Eschenbach, Parker Harris, Aaron Levie and Patty McCord about culture\'s impact on your brand and what it takes to build a team that can go the distance. | You aren’t hitting your targets, key team members are quitting, and you\'re being thrown out of board meetings. It feels like your company is falling apart and you don’t know how to hold it together. What do you do now? In this episode, we’ll discuss those "oh shit" moments, and how some of the most innovative founders discovered the will to persevere. | In this episode, we’ll talk about the first big win and what it did for the company. You’ve spent half your first round, hired a dozen employees, signed 20 customers. But be honest: Those “customers” were other start-ups, local companies, friends of yours. Then comes a cold lead, a different time zone, your first “mainstream” prospect. It’s the first deal that would legitimize you. You need the win, the money, the morale boost. Time to step up! | The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and you’ve launched your new company. Sure you’re working from a folding table in your uncle’s garage, but you still call it your own. Maybe you\'ve raised some money. You’re designing a website and recruiting your first employees. But how do you run payroll? And what do you do with lunch receipts? In this episode, we’ll get into the nitty gritty of the early days: renting your first office, landing your first customers, and how not to run out of money.', 'chan_desc': "Most business podcasts follow a similar format: find a successful CEO and have them tell their story. This is not that show. Zero to IPO gets granular: each episode focuses on one particular stage of a company’s growth cycle with perspectives from some of the world's most innovative founders, from Parker Harris of Salesforce.com, to Julia Hartz of Eventbrite and Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz. Every growing company faces similar challenges, but not every company talks about them. Zero to IPO is designed to give entrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs, and the public at large an unfiltered view into what it really takes to build a successful company — from start to IPO and beyond.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/1d/30/28/1d3028d7-3fbd-24c5-7c0e-2bf4a7522dee/mza_8723311277046732902.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-01-11'}}

But then we started looking into it and considered all the potentially good stuff about having employees, such as having more control over how they spend their time and when they work. On today’s episode, we want to talk about all the things to think about before hiring an employee, because the truth is, it is very different and a much bigger responsibility.\xa0 There are pros and cons to both, though, and that is why we share with you our experience over the last few years, so that you can be prepared for whichever scenario you choose. It’s all about looking at your business and figuring out whether you are in a financial position to take on a full-time employee and whether you are prepared to deal with the positives and negatives of you each option.

Therefore, we are calling it a profit report and we want to ask all of you, even before we start, to DM us feedback – whether this format worked and helped you in your business.\xa0 In this episode, you will hear more about our thought processes around profits and expenses, but it is important to keep in mind that there are many different ways in which to approach this, so we are not suggesting that you replicate exactly what we do. For the sake of transparency, we also want to let all of you in instead of just talking about the topic. Really sharing the truth about our business, we believe, will be of much greater value to you than simply giving you a blueprint for what it should look like. The focus should be profit and figuring out what your goal is in this regard is more important than being able to say you are a six-figure business.

We share with you a bit of background about our early lives and how it shaped our desire to work for ourselves and talk about the different pressures and circumstances that influence your perspective on entrepreneurship.

There are tons to learn from her seasoned and scientifically backed up approach, so today she will be dishing out straightforward facts, particularly as it pertains to productivity and how it relates to your profit. She shares time-wasting tactics that many of us are skilled at and pulls up some new studies that illuminate what distraction does to our day. A question we often think about is what we need to be doing to move our business forward, and it can be stressful to decide which of the dozens of things to take or leave. Lauren weighs in on the matter with some simple, no-nonsense advice.\xa0 Being overwhelmed with tasks can lead to decision fatigue, which prevents us from effectively prioritizing the tasks that are most important. Productivity and processes can make or break an entrepreneur because of burnout or be the demise of business due to revenue and profit leaks. According to the IDC, companies lose 20 to 30% in revenue every year as a result of inefficiencies. This is a staggering statistic!

As we continue to grow we are constantly asking ourselves, "What is the content that people want to hear about?" This goal of keeping you entertained, educated, and engaged is very important to us and we have always loved sharing our lives and work with all of you. When we started out, everything we did felt fun, fresh, and engaging and it was easy to share this with our listeners in a natural way. As we have grown things have changed and we have been more considerate in our choices but we want to carry on sharing stuff with you that is exciting, new, and informative. It has always been our best thing, being able to share something about a problem we solved or a strategy we discovered.\xa0 As we enter year four of our biz we have to continue to look for these opportunities when we have had a different reality from where started out and many of our listeners. We want to help you now and set you up for success in the future! We have a feeling that there may be some inaccurate perceptions out there of what is happening in our business. You are welcome to DM us on Instagram with your thoughts but we sense that people find us less relatable than when we started out and were smaller. There have been challenges in continually connecting with our audience as our situation has changed, our team has grown and so on but we want, more than anything, to stay relatable to all of you! We actually think we are probably in more similar situations to a lot of you than you may think! All this to say, we have resolved to let you in on some of this and share more of what is going on in our current lives than we have been! Thank you for listening!

Businesses go through different seasons and for a long time we had not been focusing on Instagram because we were otherwise occupied. But for some reason, our account remained semi-active and we were still slowly but surely gaining followers, even though we only really posted about the podcast and random bits in between. But the engagement was poor, so much so that we no longer saw the need to post at all or to have the account, and this set us on a rollercoaster of a journey of trying to figure out whether we should delete our existing account and start all over again. This might sound crazy, but we had what we believed were legitimate reasons for wanting to do that, and our intentions were so good!\xa0 We were absolutely convinced that this was the way to go, that is, until a comment or two from our audience and friends threw a spanner in the works and forced us back to square one. This was an amazing educational process that we came though as we learned a ton about ourselves, our business and what our approach to our followers should be. If you are thinking about deleting your account and starting off with a clean slate or just looking to grow your Instagram engagement, this episode is perfect for you, so be sure to listen in!

When we think about marketing, we tend to think about psychology in general and the things that inherently appeal to all people. But, there is a better way to approach marketing and it pertains to the different generations. Ever thought about why people of different ages think and behave so differently from one another and often bump heads, whether in families or in business? What we discuss today will shed a whole lot of light on this subject. We compare and contrast the generations, from the traditionalists up to Gen Z and everything in between.\xa0 Each new generation is constructed in a unique way with different things that impact how they view the world and what kinds of consumers they are. For this reason, marketing efforts should be adjusted accordingly to ensure that you speak to the needs of the generation you are targeting and so that you better understand why certain initiatives will be more effective than others. We have relied heavily on the research of the amazing Jason Dorsey for this episode, so a lot of the information provided here is from his work on the topic. Definitely check out his website if you want to find out more. Jason also speaks about a very interesting new thought about millennials, one which we will get into on this episode, so be sure to tune in! Thank you for listening!

This is more important than it may sound. A tactical worksheet is nothing more than a glorified checklist. Who needs that? If airline pilots use them every flight, maybe they should be in your arsenal also. They can prevent mistakes and protect you later if someone starts looking for blame. Here to explain the details is Bruce Evans. He’s is the fire chief and a paramedic at the Upper Pine River Fire Protection District in Bayfield, Colorado. Bruce is on the board of directors at the National Association of EMT's, and he is a National Fire Academy instructor. He’s also on the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine's Preparedness Committee. | The Fire-EMS community lost a vital member this week. Bryan Fass passed away suddenly on Monday. He was just 46. A former paramedic,  Bryan was well-known for his advocacy of first-responder fitness. His career was based on teaching injury-prevention and safety techniques. He ran Fit Responder, which he founded in 2007, and spoke frequently at EMS industry conferences around the country. Bryan was a prolific author, writing for multiple websites and his blog, as well as four books on fitness and wellness. With me today to remember Bryan is Greg Friese, Editor-in-chief of EMS1.com | There was a time when you were universally viewed as friends of the community. You were welcomed because people realized that you were there to help them. Sadly, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. Violent physical attacks on EMS personnel are becoming more common, with new incidents being reported just about every day. So now we have to think about how to prevent those assaults. In Austin, Texas, they’re taking steps toward doing that. Here to explain more is Ernesto Rodriguez, the EMS chief for Austin-Travis County EMS. | On September 11, 2001 our world changed. America was just getting to work when it was attacked by terrorists using commercial airliners as weapons. That was the day everything we knew turned upside down. And it was the day that the FDNY suffered 343 line of duty deaths in one incident. Many more would lose battles with cancer caused by working in the rubble. Some are still fighting cancer today, 18 years later. Here to talk about the impact the terror attack on America had on the FDNY is Chief Rick Lasky. He’s well known around the country for his seminars on Pride and Ownership. If you’ve not heard him speak live, you’ve missed an amazing presentation and you should book him to speak at your next event. Rick retired after being Chief of several departments, including Lewisville, Texas. He started his career 40 years earlier in Chicago, which is where I hail from myself. | One of the aspects of firefighting that we don’t often discuss is the role of the fire-cause investigator. Once a structure fire is under control, this job becomes critical to determining what insurance will pay to the property owner … and if arson was involved. There are a few things firefighters can do to make the fire cause investigator’s life a little easier, and today’s guest says they really don’t get in your way of extinguishing the fire. Rick Chase is a fire cause investigator with the Central Arizona Fire and Medical Authority in Prescott Valley, Arizona. He is also a division chief and the fire marshal. Rick started in the fire service as a member of a U.S. Forest Service hotshot crew. He joined the Central Yavapai Fire District (the precursor to CAFMA)  in 1995 and worked his way from a reserve firefighter to his current position. | We have discussed several times on this show the sad – and potentially disastrous –story of the declining numbers of volunteer firefighters. Everyone has their own theory of why no one wants to volunteer these days. But a Syracuse, New York newspaper op-ed column with a new explanation began showing up in social media in August. Maybe you’ve seen it. If not, we’ll link to it on our website. It was written by Jack Kline, of Lysander, New York. He has been a volunteer firefighter for over four decades. He remembers the good old days when people liked giving their time to protect their neighbors. His column’s title explains why Jack believes we’re experiencing a manpower shortage now. It’s “Make Volunteer Firefighting Fun Again.” | If you conduct training for firefighters, your teaching may be out-of-date. Now, you’re probably thinking, “That’s bull. I know how to throw a ladder.” Problem is, if you haven’t taken recurrent train-the-trainer courses, you may not be doing it right...the way it’s being taught now. If you’re a Baby Boomer or Gen X, your methods are probably outdated. It’s not your fault—it worked for you. But today’s new firefighters are different. Here to tell us why we need to update our training skills is Chris Garniewicz. He’s a captain with the Bluffton Township, South Carolina Fire District. An IFSAC certified Fire Instructor 2, Chris is an instructor with the SC Fire Academy and lectures throughout the East Coast on truck operations and instructor education. He began his career in the Metro Boston area as a volunteer firefighter and EMT. | If you’ve wondered what it would be like to be a newly-minted Fire Chief – it could be a turbulent experience. You may think you know what it takes to run a department successfully. Maybe you do, may you don’t. But there are a million details to consider that might not even occur to you. That’s why the IAFC has put out an e-book titled, “You're the Fire Chief--Now What?” It’s a guide for new and interim Chiefs from Day One to Day 100 and beyond. Here to tell us what’s important for a new chief to know is Al Yancey, Jr. Al headed up the committee that developed the book. He’s the Chief of the Minooka, Illinois Fire Protection District. It’s a combination department. | The late Vince Lombardi, famous Green Bay Packers coach, was known for his inspirational quotes. Today’s show is about this Lombardi quote: “Winning is not a sometime thing; it’s an all time thing. You don’t win once in a while, you don’t do things right once in a while, you do them right all the time. Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.” That applies to firefighting as well. It’s not just how you perform on the fireground that counts, it’s how you perform all the time that makes the difference. Here to explain why ... and how to build that winning leadership culture in your firehouse… is Adam Neff. Adam is assistant chief of training at the Nixa, Missouri Fire Protection District. He got into the fire service 25 years ago as a cadet volunteer and worked his way up. He also holds a Chief Fire Officer Designation. | There’s a certain mindset that says it doesn’t matter how you start, as long as you finish strong. That’s not always true, though. One example: when you pull your first line at a fire. How you do it sets the whole scene for the firefight. If there’s confusion about where those initial lines are going, you’ll end up with a bowl of spaghetti. Back with me today to explain how and why to best stretch that first line is John Lightly. He’s a battalion chief in the Youngstown, Ohio fire department with over 20 years on the job.", 'chan_desc': 'The twice-weekly podcast for and about firefighters, "Code 3" covers topics of interest to those in the fire service, through interviews with those who know it best.

Season 1 of A Call to Lead is in the books. We pulled together a recap episode for you this week, featuring short clips from some of the great moments in the podcast’s first season.

Michelle Yeoh grew up in Malaysia and England, gained her early fame in Hong Kong action films, and went on to star in mega-hits such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Memoirs of a Geisha, Star Trek: Discovery, and Crazy Rich Asians. Michelle played family matriarch Eleanor Young in that blockbuster romantic comedy. As a master of her craft, Michelle shared great advice that applies to leadership in business and life. Here are 5 Points that my team and I found particularly valuable.\xa0  Like every good leader, Michelle fuels her work with empathy. “Empathy plays a big role for all of us. If you can\'t empathize, how can you lead?That is how I approach the different characters they I played, like a geisha. I don\'t know anything about that world. It’s one of the most beautiful cultures, from Japan, and out of respect to that culture, I have to get it right.” Michelle speaks my language: lead with humility and vulnerability: “As a leader, a lot of the times you are personified in a certain way—be eloquent and give good advice and lead. God, that must be so tiring. Isn\'t it much more interesting if you can communicate and empathize and be able to have that moment of vulnerability? If I feel that you care for me—that you\'re vulnerable and you understand a loss of a child or a close family member—then I believe you will begin to understand me.” Never fear failure, Michelle says: “The more you fear that you\'re going to fail, you\'ve already failed. Because you\'re just going to conform to something that you are comfortable with and probably just do it the same old way and regurgitate the same things. And there will never be an improvement.” Ask for help, she adds. “I\'m never afraid to ask for help. I believe that I don\'t know enough. One of the reasons why I didn\'t use to come to these talks, apart from stage fright, was, ‘Oh my God, they\'re going to discover that I know nothing." And then I thought: It\'s okay to know nothing.’ If I knew everything, it\'s only downhill from there because then I would be so arrogant.”   Practice self-control: “I was a squash player, and I had one of the best teachers. Once, when I lost a match and threw my racket across the room, he said quietly, "What was the point of that?" I never threw another fit again. To be a really good player, learn self-control.

Mercedes Abramo is the President and CEO of Cartier North America, and I had the opportunity to sit down with her at Cartier’s Hudson Yards boutique in New York City this past April. Growing up in a retail household (her dad was a senior executive at Lord & Taylor), Mercedes had her sights set on becoming a lawyer. She majored in political science, worked at a law firm, couldn’t stand it, got a job in a hotel—and found her calling. After graduating from business school in Paris, where she focused on luxury brand management, it was a natural leap to high-end retail. In this podcast, Mercedes shares plenty of career advice (“you really have to be flexible”) and business-building insights. Here are five of our favorite takeaways:  I asked Mercedes what she learned as she rose through the hotel and luxury goods industries. Her answer is terrific and very wise: “Learning how to listen, learning how to hear what is being said, and picking up on both the verbal and the nonverbal cues is important. Because the first thing you\'re really doing is building a relationship with that person in front of you. It\'s not about what can I sell them right now; it\'s about how do I build a connection.” Leading a luxury brand company is about giving customers experiences as well as products. In her previous life as a hotel executive, Mercedes learned how to create extraordinary experiences: “There is so much similarity to retail. With a hotel or a spa or a vacation, you don\'t leave with a product—you don\'t leave with anything physical. You only leave with the memories that you created when you were there.” Mercedes gives great advice on changing a career path: “People struggle with wanting to find the perfect decision. There is no perfect decision. It’s about taking that leap and deciding what\'s a challenge that you want to embrace right now.” Get comfortable being uncomfortable, Mercedes says. “Embracing the unknown is where you grow and where you learn. There are going to be things around the corner every day that are going to challenge you, and the more that you exercise that muscle and you push through it, the more prepared you\'re going to be the next time.” How to become an authentic leader: “You can\'t copy yourself after somebody else, so I think you really need to learn the good parts of each person that you want to emulate and then figure out how to evolve your own style.\xa0  You can learn more by visiting: www.sap.com/acalltolead.

Sylvia has a remarkable path to success: As a young woman, she was discouraged from pursuing her interest in engineering. So what did she do? She went to school for engineering and became a rocket scientist at NASA. After stops at IBM and Apple and Dell, Sylvia is leading millions of Girl Scouts to places they\'ve never gone before—teaching them to code and about cybersecurity and other need-to-know things in the workplaces of tomorrow. In an episode full of leadership wisdom, here are five points that my team and I found particularly valuable:\xa0  Having learned, as a Girl Scout, how to create opportunity and how to sell, Sylvia still to this day follows the advice that her troop leader gave her: "Never walk away from a sale until you\'ve heard \'No\' three times." Sylvia has spent her life ignoring naysayers and being her own best champion."The first sale that you make is to yourself. If you believe you can do it, then you can do it. But you have to sell yourself first." Why the Girl Scouts teaches coding and other skills that next-gen workers will need: "If you\'re prepared, you can be fearless. We want to have that generation of fearless girls." When Sylvia went on a book tour to promote Path to the Stars, her memoir for middle school readers, she found that boys raised their hands much more readily to ask questions. "I had to make sure that I\'m only going to take questions if I\'m alternating between a boy and a girl. Then girls would feel like they could raise their hands." Increasing the Girl Scout population would have a dramatic impact on the female talent pipeline, Sylvia says. "We\'re less than 8% of the girl population, but half of all female elected officials in America were Girl Scouts. In the recent class in Congress, 60% were Girl Scouts; 75% of the U.S. Senators are Girl Scouts. All three former Secretaries of State were Girl Scouts. Almost every female astronaut in space was a Girl Scout. And 80% of female tech leaders born in the U.S. were Girl Scouts. So, imagine if we could be not just at 8%, but at 10%. Imagine what that would mean to our talent pipeline."  You can learn more by visiting: www.sap.com/acalltolead.

Sarah Hauser is a champion windsurfer who knows a lot about leadership and navigating your ideal career. Sarah talks about how a missed deadline forced her to delay her plan to pursue a math degree and gave her an unplanned year off to pursue windsurfing, which turned out to be her true calling. There are plenty of lessons here—such as, control what you can, embrace the moment, and adapt. Here are 5 points that my team and I found inspiring:  Sarah describes windsurfing as "a finesse sport" where, as in life, it\'s best to go with the flow. She explains: "You have to play with the forces of the elements—the wind, the current, the waves. So all of that can be against you, and you can try and force yourself and your equipment to make it through, or you can use it if you understand how to place your sail. I can windsurf without holding my sail." When she missed the deadline to apply to school for a math degree, possibilities opened. "I went from seeing life as those rails for your train to drive on, and you have to pick one path or the other, and suddenly they all exploded and there was no track. It was just an open ocean. I felt a sense of freedom and all right, I guess I can try anything."\xa0 Success happens when you are present, aware, and flexible. "Look at what\'s thrown at you and use it, not try to impose. And with the wind, you use whatever is happening at that moment to learn some things." Like a wave, life is unpredictable. "The wave is going to last a certain time, and you\'re going to do different turns on this wave. Obviously you want the whole ride to be satisfying, to be what you\'re dreaming of. But you don\'t know what\'s coming on the third or fourth section of the wave. You\'re only seeing how it\'s shaping. You\'ve got to stay think true to yourself." And as we accept the ocean for what it is, we should accept life with all its challenges. "The ocean is a good analogy, I think, because you cannot get mad at the ocean. You cannot just be like, "Why me? It\'s just the way it is. Shift your perspective and see this challenge as a new opportunity to use the powers that you have.

And on this week\'s podcast, we bring you the enlightening conversation. When the Prime Minister, who urged me to call him Tony, talks about the world or recalls his own experience as PM, he dispenses loads of wisdom about leadership. There\'s plenty in this episode. Here are just 3 points among many that make this show a terrific listen:  No matter what field you\'re in, the mark of a leader is the same, Tony says: "The thing that distinguishes someone who leads is that you step forward and other people step back. If you\'re going to lead, you\'ve got to understand you\'re going to step forward."  PM Blair reflected on the inherent contrast between governing and campaigning, saying “One of the things you learn about politics is that running for office and governing are two completely different things. One is about communication and persuasion, the other is about executive capability.” The hardest thing about leadership is making change, Tony says: "What I\'ve found about change is that everyone loves it in general. They just hate it in particular. And when you first propose it, people tell you it\'s a bad idea. When you\'re doing it, it\'s hell. And when you\'ve done it, you wish you had done more of it. So it\'s important to have people around you who are good and capable, but also prepared to challenge you, to make you think innovatively. Because keeping that spark of creativity around, whatever you do, is incredibly important."  You can learn more by visiting: www.sap.com/acalltolead.

She is teaching young women how to code at Kode with Klossy, her tech summer camps across the U.S. She is helping to discover the next generation of fashion designers on Project Runway, where she is the new host and executive producer. And she\'s constantly looking to hone her own leadership skills. Here are a few highlights from my interview with Karlie:  Karlie explained why she learned to code: "I really wanted to understand what all of these tech entrepreneurs, primarily men, knew that I didn\'t know. That was this kind of mysterious, hidden, secret language that the people who knew it were able to build ideas into billion-dollar enterprises. I felt like I was just seeing the world be transformed by technology and by these technologies built by a small handful of people. I was really inspired but also confused. Why weren\'t more girls being encouraged to see opportunities in that direction?" Here\'s why she started Kode with Klossy: "I was really inspired by the idea of being able to problem solve...to use coding to build solutions to problems. And to be able to help other young girls realize that they could learn that, even if you\'re not a guy in a hoodie." Karlie talked about her summer camps to teach young women to code: "Kode With Klossy is a drop in the bucket, but it\'s still an important drop. And I hope it inspires more people and particularly young women to realize that they can and should pursue [tech careers]. Even if they don\'t see as many women as there should be, it doesn\'t mean they can\'t be." What is Karlie\'s favorite coding language—Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS or Swift? "Ruby, because it\'s very intuitive. It\'s an easier beginner language and it was the first one I learned, so I think I have a soft spot in my heart for it." Karlie was inspired by Michelle Obama\'s book, Becoming. "Michelle Obama is the most incredible, classiest, smartest, most just inspiring human being. And yet, she\'s super vulnerable."

You may know Adam from his best-selling books including Give and Take and Originals, and his hit podcast, WorkLife. Professor Grant\'s classes at Wharton are also wildly popular, which isn\'t surprising because he is one of today\'s smartest, freshest, and, yes, most original thinkers on leadership and success. Adam and I tackled these topics from all angles. Here are 5 Points from this show that my team found especially compelling: \xa0  On a recent episode of WorkLife, Adam talked about how to remember things. I asked him about that. "If you want to remember specific things, I think there are three things [you should do]: The first one is, you should not reread stuff, or highlight it, or do any of the things that probably you did in college. What you want to do actually is quiz yourself on it, and what that forces you to do is practice retrieving the information. Second, you should summarize it and share it with somebody else. The third is, it\'s much easier to remember anything if you can connect it to experiences you\'ve previously had."  \xa0  The best leaders solicit feedback on their strengths and weaknesses. "Early in your career, your biggest challenge is to understand your own strengths and weaknesses, and figure out how you can help people work most effectively with you. There\'s a practice I love that a growing number of leaders are using, which is to go to the five to 10 people who work closely with you and have them write a manual for how to work better with you for."  \xa0  The problem is, veteran leaders tend to stop soliciting feedback: "When leaders are new, they seek a ton of feedback because they\'re orienting themselves to the role. They want to figure out whether they\'re meeting people\'s expectations. Then, as they get comfortable, feedback seeking starts to wane. And that\'s when they start needing it the most, because the less they ask for it, the fewer signals they\'re sending out to people around them that they\'re open to it. And then they gain more power and status, and people become more and more fearful of speaking truth to power."  \xa0  The best team-builders nurture givers: "The higher you climb, the more your success depends on making other people successful. This is one of the reasons I think it\'s so important to train people to think like givers early. By the time you get into a leadership role, if you don\'t understand how to help other people succeed, then your accomplishments are totally dependent on the amount of time you have available in the day."  \xa0  Culture wins, especially when it’s practiced and modeled when no one is looking. "It\'s really valuable for a leader to be clear about what the culture is and tell the stories about it from day one. If you\'re not clear, your firm\'s performance suffers. And if at some point you realize, \'Gosh, we have the wrong cultural blueprint\' and try to change it, you\'re even more likely to fail. It creates cultural upheaval. There\'s some evidence that the best stories are junior employees upholding the culture without anyone having to tell them what to do, and the worst stories are senior leaders violating the culture."

Laura knows leadership. In films like Jurassic Park and Wildand TV shows like Enlightened and Twin Peaks, she has captured the complexities and vulnerabilities of strong women. In HBO\'s Big Little Lies, Laura\'s award-winning performance as Renata Klein is a study of a tech CEO who is also a fierce and frightened mother. Laura and I covered a lot of ground including leadership, parenthood, and gender equity in the workplace. Here are 5 Points that my team and I found most interesting and relevant to what we do to succeed.  To portray tightly wound Renata in Big Little Lies, Laura talked with female CEOs who, she says, worked harder than most men "to even get invited into the room." I asked Laura what surprised her about these women. "I think there is a common theme of....how we work with integrity and protect ourselves and find a tribe in order to do the work we need to do." Laura believes that news and social media beat the drum too hard about women alone driving a fairer environment for women. "We should be "us-focused," she says. "It\'s about community. It\'s about changing things for the better of everyone. And that\'s a job that men and women have to do together." On the similarities between leading and parenting: "Great leaders and great parents ask questions constantly, are willing to learn every day, are willing to learn from their child, their followers, their staff—because it\'s a collaboration." Laura says we\'re in an era where anyone can step up to lead. "I think it\'s time for all of us to say, \'I\'m ready to be in the position of power\'—power meaning willingness to be vulnerable. And a willingness to lead with the strength of an interesting collaboration and insight into doing it differently than it\'s ever been done." Laura says she\'s learned about a different kind of leadership from her co-stars and colleagues on Big Little Lies. "One aspect to leadership that I never saw growing up was a kind of leader who can be even-toned and respectful while incredibly strong. Respectful and calm while saying \'No, I don\'t agree, I need something different from you.\'"  You can learn more by visiting: www.sap.com/acalltolead.

Jen co-founded Away on the notion that luggage—holding many of life\'s most important things when we travel—had become commoditized. Away injects style and community into travel. Jen and I talked about building great brands and thriving cultures, and about leveraging mistakes to learn and grow. Here are 5 Points that my team and I found particularly useful as we all work to build our own businesses:  Having worked at Warby Parker earlier in her career, Jen knew that core values are key to building successful startups. She and her colleagues crafted Away\'s core values bottom-up: "We waited til we had maybe 30 or 40 employees. We were on a fun team trip in Nicaragua, and we split up into groups and asked people to describe what they thought our core values were. That set the stage. Our core values include being thoughtful, being iterative, being customer-obsessed, being empowered, being accessible in terms of having all the context that you need." Now that Away has nearly 300 employees, Jen and her senior team constantly reevaluate: "Core values are very precious and they should guide what you do. But it\'s important to take a step back and say \'hey, the company\'s growing really quickly, do these still ring true? If they don\'t, what are the things we can be doing to make it feel true? And if we don\'t want to do any of those things, should this still exist as one of our values?\'" Jen and I believe in creating workplaces where it\'s okay to fail and make mistakes. Jen tells her team: "If you don\'t do it because you\'re scared, you\'re for sure not going to get it." And learn from each other\'s mistakes: "We encourage everyone to publicly share what they\'ve learned from mistakes or failures. And we\'re constantly iterating. So we say, \'If you aren\'t making any mistakes, then you\'re not thinking big enough or moving fast enough." Jen smartly notes that brand-building happens from the customer\'s perspective: "When you\'re building a brand, it\'s so easy for people to be like: \'This is our brand book, this is who we are, this is what we\'re doing.\' But nobody really cares what a brand says about itself."  \xa0 You can learn more by visiting: www.sap.com/acalltolead.

Kevin has been in the industry since 2011 and has trained various athletes including professional athletes from the MLB and NFL.To start, Kevin and Gerry discuss the ever-so-popular topic of being "strong enough," and Kevin explains what it means to him to reach the peak of possible returns when it comes to increasing your overall number on the barbell when lifting. The conversation then turns to the idea of bar speed and moving loads faster, and how it will never be "enough," when it comes to showing force in faster ways. The two then talk about how velocity based training can come into play when looking to improve these characteristics.From there, both talk all things related to speed. Building force, building the rate in which you can produce it and using plyometrics to build speed. Additionally, Kevin talks about the drop/false step and why it is far more effective than a traditional crossover step when it comes to baseball players running from a traditional baseball start.To finish up, Gerry comes to the realization that they share similar backgrounds (not attending college to become a strength coach) and the two touch on what they went through/experienced in their journey into the industry and how you can become a coach without a formal education. Lastly, Kevin walks us through some important factors when it comes to in-season training, arm care and team sport conditioning.All this and more on this episode of Muscles and Management!Support the show | In this episode Gerry has the chance to talk to Emily Waldon, prospect writer for The Athletic and Baseball America.Emily and Gerry briefly discuss Emily\'s journey into the industry and how she had an unconventional start circumventing college.

Daniel and Cody have experience working with more advanced and novice athletes alike, as well as some general population clients that gives them a refreshing and unbiased approach to all areas of programming and training.The episode starts as the three discuss the importance of looking beyond barbell numbers when it comes to helping an athlete achieve their goals in their respective sport. As coaches who place a great deal of importance on being strong and getting athletes stronger, Gerry guides Daniel and Cody through the things they look for in terms of the transfer of strength training to sport to ensure athletes aren\'t simply padding one rep max numbers. Is a metric or tested number yielding important results?From there, the conversation shifts to principle and philosophy based programming and the importance of not grounding your programming in an approach that is married to particular exercises or modalities. There is a time and a place for different types of programming, exercises and strategies and if we understand the main principles guiding programming we can have a better grasp on why they are being used.To finish, the three talk about sports specific programming and how sport is only activity actually done in games, practice or the field of play.

Both of which give the listener a good idea of how coaches can get involved and started in the strength and conditioning field.From there, the three discuss velocity-based training and how it involves far more than moving light loads fast, in addition to talking about different ways you can utilize velocity based training that goes beyond barbell lifting. Lastly, they discuss the importance of measuring loads!To finish things up, DJ, Bill and Gerry discuss how they use sleds for pressing power and how they apply VBT to these methods, misconceptions regarding arm care and baseball players and the importance of strength to building speed and how you can improve acceleration ability. They also talk the 60-yard dash and why it is a pretty useless and ineffective test for baseball players.All that and more on this episode!Support the show | In this episode Gerry has the pleasure of talking to sport scientist and coach Max Schmarzo.

That’s where today’s discussion takes us. You can read the full show notes at:\xa0Session207 | Today’s show is full of very practical tips that I hope will be helpful to you.

Sleep is a vitally important part of our lives that is often overlooked. We don’t usually think about the ways we cheat ourselves out of good sleep and how the quality of our sleep impacts every part of our day. Today’s show focuses on sleep as it relates to private practitioners and small business owners. Let’s explore how we can improve the quality of our sleep! Dr. Yishan Xu is a licensed psychologist in private practice in Los Altos, CA. She’s an expert on sleep and runs therapy groups on insomnia. Her podcast, Deep into Sleep, is launching soon, so she’s a great person to help us cover this topic. We’re discussing why sleep is so important and what an ideal night of sleep should look like.

One of those that you might not have considered is creating a conference. It may sound like an overwhelming task, but it’s one that can be effective and fulfilling. Let’s discuss it in today’s show! Mercedes Samudio, LCSW, does a lot of good work around all things related to parenting. She’s written Shame-Proof Parenting and has created The Diversity in Parenting Conference, which explores the diverse ways that clinicians work with parents and families. The conference is coming up soon on September 13-14 in Anaheim, CA. In today’s show, Mercedes takes us behind the scenes to learn what it takes to put together a conference of this magnitude. Mercedes is excited to share with all of us what she’s learned from this first-time experience. She’ll share about the planning process and why she chose a conference as the medium to share her message instead of a webinar. Mercedes also fills us in on how she selected speakers and set fees for the event, along with the biggest lessons she’s learned along the way.

Podcasting has made me more confident as a person and a speaker, and I’m thankful for the ways I’ve grown on this path. Today’s topic is one I’m very passionate about, and you’ve heard it mentioned many times on the show. We’re discussing what a clinician needs to have in place before scaling to multiple income streams. Nicole Liloia, LCSW, practices in New Jersey. She’s someone whose advice I trust regarding creating multiple income streams, which is becoming more and more common for those in private practice. We don’t often think about the groundwork that needs to be laid before we take that step, but systems and processes must be in place for things to flow smoothly. Each income stream brings its own level of stress, which must be managed. In today’s conversation, we’re discussing the biggest advantages to creating additional income streams, things to be aware of, and the most important things to have in place before branching out. You can read the full show notes at:\xa0Session200 | I never thought I’d have to do an episode like this one, but unfortunate events have brought me face-to-face with reality. One of my team members, Karen, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer earlier this year. Although she was undergoing chemo and radiation, she passed away a few weeks ago. Karen was an important part of the STC team who helped me a lot, especially in handling Facebook ads. The challenge for me has been balancing the grieving process while trying to carry on and pick up the pieces of Karen’s work. In this solo episode, we’re looking at things I’ve had to consider in new ways that might spur you to think about planning ahead in very practical ways.

I thought I could be Superwoman. I had no handle on my time management. I was breastfeeding, pumping, getting mastitis every week because my daughter had a tongue tie but we were determined to make it all work. I felt like a failure and was completely miserable. I may be smiling but I am one exhausted mama with a baby that would not sleep. I had too much on my plate as a new mom running the behind the scenes of my company, creating content and marketing. Thank God I had a support group of entrepreneurs to lean on at that time. They asked me, “How many hours do you want to work each week?” I said, “I have no idea.” They asked me, “What is your working schedule? I said, “I don’t know.” It was very clear that I needed some major help. This was my lightbulb “time” moment that I will always remember as a turning point in my life. This was the difference between quitting or thriving. This is when I discovered these tools. When I asked and got support from those other entrepreneurs, I learned that I needed to be more disciplined than ever before if I was going to make my business really work and complete my purpose and calling in this life. I also needed to ask for help more and change my mindset. I did not need to do everything around the house, and also, be a wonderful mom and a kick-ass CEO.\xa0 Something had to give and let me tell you, it wasn’t going to be the mom part or the thing I was called on this earth to do. I didn’t need to be Superwoman. This is important so I am going to say it again. I am not Superwoman. I can’t do it all. I need help. There is one more mindset shift I made through the past 6 years of building my business. It has to do with your calendar. Did you know that you are in charge of it? You have total control of it! I know other people like to schedule things on it and other people need you to do this and that all of a sudden it stresses you out to look at it on Sunday night. | For many years, Anna didn’t know what her calling was. She would go from job to job and just get stuck over and over again. Always thinking that maybe this was “it” without really truly assessing herself. She had to take the time to self-assess and really uncover what career was best for her. Now that you are prepared mentally to find your dream career from prep school (and your calendar is prepared too!) it’s time to get into the most important section. We’ll start by understanding yourself better so we can help you determine the career you were born to do. In this section, we’ll dive deep into figuring out the ideal workday for you, all of the essential elements that factor into your career satisfaction and your purpose and motivations, interests and personality.\xa0 We’ll look back at your work experiences, to ensure your next career move is the right fit for you and you don’t get stuck ever again. You will ask yourself some hard questions you may have never asked yourself before. So find a coffee shop, grab your favorite drink, hang the do not disturb sign on your door or wait until the kids are in bed (or wake up before them) and get ready to be alone to discover more about you. This is a very important part of the process and as always we’ll end this section with the key takeaways. Make sure you download the planning worksheets so we can help you brainstorm your ideas as you go along each section.

This not only benefits you as the REALTOR® but also benefits your client. An excellent REALTOR® and an excellent inspector is a fabulous combination to help create a better experience for buyers. Today’s guest, Scott Frederick, joins Monica on the show to talk about how we can foster better relationships between REALTORS® and inspectors, including what to look for in an inspector and communication skills. \xa0 The U.S. is about 50-50 between states that require home inspectors to have a license and those that don’t. Inspectors should be a member of ASHI or NACHI, especially in states that do not require a license. ASHI is the American Society of Home Inspectors, and InterNACHI is the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors. ASHI tends to be more credible, simply because of the guidelines and requirements it takes to become certified. When looking for a home inspector, you should look for at least one of those certifications. \xa0 Training for home inspectors involves a technical instruction background, but almost as importantly, good communication skills, good grammar, punctuality, and time management are key to becoming a good home inspector. There is usually a mentor/shadow period, where you train with an experienced inspector. As an agent, it’s important to do your due diligence to find an inspector to help with the real estate transaction. \xa0 The most important part of Scott’s job is to build the relationship between the client, the buyer, and the REALTOR®. He talks about some of the customer service standards they use on their team, starting from the first call to the systematic inspection of the house. During the inspection, they set up shop, go over what the client ordered in terms of the inspection, and get the expectations of the buyer upfront. Get an unbiased opinion from the beginning so the inspection can be thorough and honest. \xa0 The way you present yourself from the beginning of the inspection and instill confidence in yourself and your ability will put the client at ease. The inspection is also an opportunity for the client to do their own walk-through and identify anything they are concerned about. \xa0 Communication is key between inspectors and REALTORS®. Agents need to learn how to be facilitators of information between inspectors and buyers. To be a good communicator, you have to be able to give and receive. As a REALTOR® or an inspector, try to create a good dynamic between you and the other people, so collaborating is productive and easy. As REALTORS® and home inspectors work together over the course of their careers, it creates a camaraderie that leads to good questions and open communication. \xa0 If there is an issue with the house that comes up during the inspection, it’s important to engage the conversation so that the buyer can hear all the information from the inspector themselves. It is all about how you phrase the problem verbally as well as in your report. Scott’s team addresses issues in three tiers: 1. Safety 2. Structural Defects 3. Cosmetic Defects. When presenting issues, make sure to offer solutions as well. \xa0 Whether the agent is at the inspection or not, they are the ones who will be negotiating with the broker. It is important that the inspector leaves thorough comments about any necessary repairs so that the agent can effectively negotiate these. One of the worst habits an inspector can get into is deferring everything to another expert. Agents can help with this by providing feedback to inspectors on what they would like to see. A REALTOR® is just as important in creating a good inspector as an inspector’s time in the field. \xa0 Sometimes it may be a good idea for the inspector to come back after any repairs are made to ensure that they were actually done as the receipt says. Scott does this as a courtesy, but if the relationship is there between the REALTOR® and the inspector, hopefully, something can be arranged at a fair price to provide a level of comfort. \xa0 When it comes to older homes and inspections, you want to make sure you find an inspector who is knowledgeable about old homes. As a REALTOR®, you can ask questions to make sure you are going to hire a qualified inspector for the home in question. Cosmetic issues are going to differ between old and new homes, and that’s something to keep in mind during inspections. \xa0 When it comes to cosmetics, it comes down to dollars and cents. Depending on cost, cosmetic issues could become larger or more important issues. Scott brings awareness to cosmetic issues but differentiates based on the cost of repair. From there, it is up to the REALTOR® to negotiate price. \xa0 The final thing Scott reiterates for REALTORS® is the importance of building relationships with inspectors. The more that you know each other and what you want from each other, the better the work relationship is, which ultimately provides the buyer with the best customer experience. Developing open lines of communication is key; it is all a collaborative effort. \xa0 Some additional courses for more information on this topic: \xa0  ABR Designation  SRS Designation  New Home Construction Course \xa0 Guest Links: \xa0 Pillar to Post \xa0 Additional Links: OnlineLearning.REALTOR for NAR Online Education Training4RE.com — List of Classroom Courses for REBAC and REBI classes.

As REALTORS® in these cases, you can help your client navigate through the real estate aspects of doing what’s best for the family and the property. Laurel discusses her work as a court-appointed real estate expert and shares helpful tips for divorce cases that are also great tips for regular listings. \xa0 It’s important to note that the court has jurisdiction over most things in a divorce case. The first thing that needs to be established is whether the court has made any specific orders regarding the house and the client; the client would be whichever person is on the title. The orders can indicate anything from the list price to certain terms defined. The house often comes into play with other aspects of the case as well. \xa0 The title company usually disperses the proceeds, but as the REALTOR®, you want to make sure the title company gets a copy of an order that dictates how these should be dispersed. \xa0 Laurel has been involved in some legal work during her real estate career. In family law, the court and attorneys are accustomed to working with experts. In her work, Laurel is a real estate expert that is appointed by the court to handle the real estate aspect of the case, making recommendations and making sure the court orders are followed. Usually, an agent on the deal would be the court-appointed expert. \xa0 When you get a client who may be recently divorced, the first step is to do an intake to gather information, like who is and isn’t in the house, any court orders, who is on the mortgage, etc. After that, you would generally want to visit the property and do a walk-through; in divorce, there is often evidence of distress. There may be opportunities for improvement so they get the most money. These should always be suggested with discretion and sensitivity for the situation. Asking probing questions to get more information may be uncomfortable, but as REALTORS®, you must own your professionalism. You can’t best help your clients without all the information. \xa0 Proactive communication is especially important in these cases. When it comes to education, it’s really important to take the position of not being attached to the outcome. It’s not about trying to get them to list the house, it’s about giving all the information so the family can make the best choice for them. Communication helps establish trust and neutrality. \xa0 In Laurel’s practice, when they do the intake and the walkthrough, she never meets the clients twice. She meets with the parties separately and will alternate appointments. You want to avoid having too much communication with one client to make it look like you’re taking sides. Each situation will be different, but it’s important to gather all the information so you are considering both person’s needs. Laurel shares some best practice tips for when it comes to communicating through emails. \xa0 In these situations, it is very common to have pacing issues. One spouse may be ready to sell the house and get everything done, while the other is still grieving the loss of both their house and their marriage. You may have to slow down and get the other spouse on board before you get too far. \xa0 When getting a lawyer involved, you want to keep them reasonably updated, but don’t bombard them with too much communication. Some things to update lawyers on: when the listing agreement has been signed, the terms, once the house is on the market, when the house is in escrow, and when they are ready to close. Don’t involve the lawyers unless you absolutely need to. \xa0 There are some things to prevent early on in a divorce listing. Make sure you know who all is on the title, and make sure the title will respect a Power of Attorney in the situation that the client themselves is unavailable. This is helpful even for a regular listing. You also want to check loan payment amounts that may be affected by previous loan modifications. Laurel recommends ordering a mortgage payoff early on. Knowing how to prevent land mines is key — if you think or know something may be a problem, address it sooner rather than later. \xa0 Reverse mortgages can be used as a tool in divorce when one person wants to stay in the house or to help a buyer when they want to move into a new house. A spouse who wants to keep the house has to qualify all on their own. With all the expenses surrounding divorce, oftentimes they don’t qualify. Laurel is a proponent of not staying married to the mortgage. Reverse mortgages only apply to clients over the age of 62. In normal mortgage situations, you usually will have to refinance to get one person off the mortgage, or sell the house and take the proceeds to find a new living situation. \xa0 The rules for ownership and how things are dispersed vary from state to state. When it comes to listing agreements, some states take a listing agreement with whoever is on the title. In some states, you also need both parties to sign the listing agreements. It’s important to look up your state’s regulations. This determines who the client is — whoever you are taking the listing agreement with. \xa0 If you’re working with friends or people you are familiar with, it’s important to establish professionalism. You should treat it the same as a situation with a new client, and make sure all the education is provided and you’re still following through with all necessary procedures. \xa0 There are some warning signs when entering divorce real estate situations. One is to make sure your client has an attorney; as a REALTOR®, there is no legal pull, and your client may need help navigating the court system. If one party is trying to sway your allegiance, maintain boundaries and neutrality. Another big warning sign is that lawyers can write into orders a right of first refusal. This can affect the basic rules and regulations of real estate sales. If you take on a case where one spouse wants to buy out the other, make sure that option has been detailed out up front so you don’t run into anything later. \xa0 As REALTORS®, it’s not your position to create a sense of urgency to list and sell a property, but you can help motivate them if they are experiencing grief or anger. It starts by building trust with your client. If you can seek to understand their goals and concerns, you can help guide their actions. \xa0 Children are the unintended casualties in divorce cases. Sometimes parents will use the children as pawns to try to sabotage the sale. There is not an obligation to the kids, but you can help to advise your client on how they can help their children through the situation. \xa0 Divorce listings are very complex listings. They far surpass agents trying to hit their sales goals; it’s about meeting people on their worst day and helping them rebuild. \xa0 Guest Links: \xa0 Starks Realty Group  The House Matters in Divorce: Untangling the Legal, Financial & Emotional Ties Before You Sign On the Dotted Line, by Laurel Starks \xa0 Additional Links: OnlineLearning.Realtor for NAR Online Education Training4RE.com — List of Classroom Courses for REBAC and REBI classes.

This episode is a recording of the panel Monica hosted at the 2018 REALTOR® Conference and Expo. Guests TJ Pierce, Mor Zucker, Jamie Slough, and Dave Caskey speak about how they have utilized their social media marketing in their businesses. No matter where you are in your business, there will be a takeaway for you to apply to your work. \xa0 Content can be anything that you want to share, from photos to a blog, to videos; there is something for everyone. Multi-platform marketing uses the content you created and distributes it across several social media platforms. For example, content from this podcast appears on Instagram and a blog, and a video is uploaded to YouTube. Monica talks about some ways you can create content from your listings, and on which platforms you might want to share it. Sharing across several different platforms will allow you to connect with several different audiences and demographics. \xa0 Advice from TJ: \xa0 Start with the platform you are most comfortable with, and branch out from there. At Mid-Century Homes, they build their digital library with pictures from their phones and use an app called Canva that allows you to use your own photos to create a content layout. They also use professionally made content like photos, their website, and videos. \xa0 You can also share other people’s content and engage with other businesses on the various social media platforms. This has been especially important for Mid-Century Homes because they’ve been able to share other content with a niche audience they know will appreciate it. They can engage with their own audience while attracting followers from the audiences of other businesses. TJ talks about how they use the different platforms of Facebook, Instagram, and their website and about how much they budget for it. Some of the live events they have are home tours, Instagram, and a first-time homebuyer class. 45% of their business has been in off-market deals because they knew how to work their marketing platforms! \xa0 Advice from Mor and Jamie: \xa0 Don’t wait for opportunity — create it! They focus on using marketing and technology to sell homes, rather than selling homes and having to use those tools to do it. They create two main ways: their blog (The Denver Ear) and by using PR and relationships with the media. \xa0 Being intentional about fostering relationships with the media and creating news in your business is huge in getting your content out there. Jamie describes some of the content they’ve created, through community events, or stories about properties. When writing these, there always needs to be value for the consumer added. Once you have a press release, you can distribute the content across several platforms, and drive traffic back to your website. \xa0 Mor talks about The Denver Ear, which is a blog that focuses on community, lifestyle, and business, rather than real estate. When you’re selling real estate, you’re really selling the community around the property. As your blog gets more exposure, local businesses may start to connect with you about their news. This is a more indirect and long-term strategy, but Mor wanted to create the blog outside of their real estate website to bring people in the back door. The conversion seems to be higher for these people because they’ve taken the time to navigate to the real estate page from the blog. \xa0 The most important thing about blogging is that it doesn’t matter how often you blog, but each post needs to have high-quality content. Find unique things to write about, and be aggressive about making connections with businesses and media. When it comes to blog content, focus on your interests; people will want you to be their agent because they resonate with who you are as a person. \xa0 Eventually, you want to start connecting your blog to your real estate business, but there are several ways to get creative about this that aren’t necessarily just putting the real estate information on your blog each time you post. \xa0 Advice from Dave: \xa0 REALTORS® are connectors; we connect with people and then we connect those people with homes. Across the different platforms, it’s important to know your audience. This is not only for what you post but also how you engage with others on these platforms. Dave covers several different platforms and offers suggestions about what is appropriate on each. \xa0 Quality over quantity — while it is important to get followers, you want to make sure they are the right followers and actual consumers of your business product. Knowing your target audience will help you decide how to prioritize. Dave talks about the distribution of their content; they will post content and then each of their agents will post the same content on their professional pages and they’ve just increased the chances of people seeing this content. \xa0 Q&A: \xa0 You can “reuse” content — maybe you go back to an article once every year and update it with relevant information. \xa0 When hosting live events, you might consider offering door prizes or make it appear that it’s sold out so there’s some hype around it. The pre- and post- is usually the most important outcome of the event, especially how much it gets your name out during advertising. \xa0 Instagram is primarily for catching people’s attention visually. For residential real estate, it’s also about promoting the lifestyle. \xa0 There are often “sign-in walls” to get agents’ contact information, and this is usually for the agents to build up a database. As agents, it’s important to note what’s working for consumers and what’s not, so we can pivot if something isn’t working. \xa0 Video content between social media and your website should be different. On social media, you want videos to be fun and engaging. Videos on the website may be a little more professional and directed towards a specific purpose, like a 360-degree video of a property. \xa0 Guest Links: See additional bios below for guest links \xa0 PDF Handout:  http://funtentionalliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Multi-Platform-Marketing-for-Maximzing-Content-2018-Podcast.pdf \xa0 Additional Links: OnlineLearning.Realtor for NAR Online Education Training4RE.com — List of Classroom Courses for REBAC and REBI classes.

Today’s episode features two guests who are experts in land sales. Jeramy Stephens (Arkansas) & Justin Osborne (Colorado) are both members of the REALTORS® Land Institute (RLI) and join Monica on the show today to talk about how land sales differ from residential sales. They discuss the different types of land and the certification that’s available for land agents, as well as some of the important things to note about land sales in the East and the West. \xa0 Jeramy Stephens has been in land and real estate for many, many years. He is currently the president of REALTORS® Land Institute (RLI). RLI is part of the NAR family and provides expertise, camaraderie, and resources for real estate professionals. It also offers the Accredited Land Consultant (ALC) designation. \xa0 There are several different types of land: agricultural land, timberland, recreational land, and transitional land. The RLI promotes education to understand different land uses and purposes for these types of lands. Just like in other facets of real estate, there are different specialties in the land business, and they each have their own rules. \xa0 There are six required courses to get the ALC designation and 104 hours. The three core classes are Land Investment Analysis, Land 101, and Transitional Land. In addition to these three core classes, there are “elective” classes, depending on where your interests lie. A portfolio of $10 million is also required. \xa0 When looking at the value of land, it’s important to consider what it’s being used for or what it’s been used for in the past. As a residential agent, if someone comes to you with a piece of land, you can ask questions to determine its highest and best use. Then you can direct your client to an expert in one of those areas, who can appraise or assess the land appropriately. Some land properties are comped regionally, so they are compared with other similar properties in neighboring states or regions. When it gets to a specific activity, it needs to be priced as close in proximity as possible. \xa0 Jeramy’s passion is farmland, which tends to be a little bit easier to price than some other types of land property. Despite some of the struggles farmers are facing, the demand for ag land is still quite strong. Farm and ag land are also a potential investment opportunity. There is a lot of due diligence required for farmland, so it’s important to know what to do and who to ask when you need help. \xa0 Residential real estate agents and land agents can work together to meet their clients’ needs. If you’re not the one to help them, be the one to get them another agent. You want to make sure that as a Realtor®, you are operating in your area of expertise, and referring your clients to someone else when it’s not your area of expertise. \xa0 Jeramy is also interested in developmental or transitional land. This is taking raw land, usually on the outside of a growing community, and figuring out zoning, sewage, water, taxes, etc. This process can take a long time and varies from state to state. These properties can be a win-win for the agent and the community, but it’s important to make sure it’s done right so everyone benefits from it. \xa0 There are some new developments in technology in land sales, including better maps and more complete data. Having all of this technology makes things work a lot faster and smoother. The company Jeramy works for offers 360-degree land tours of properties, so clients can see properties on their computers before seeing the land. \xa0 In the Eastern United States, one of the biggest things to consider is wetlands and water rights. Mineral rights are also important, though maybe more so in the West. There are also many areas in the East that are developing and bringing more people in, and this is especially important for agents who work with transitional land. \xa0 Jeramy’s final word is to remind and encourage REALTORS® that we’re all professionals in what we do. Know what you do, what you do well, and what’s best for your client! \xa0 Justin Osborne is joining us from Durango, Colorado. He is currently president of the Colorado chapter of the REALTORS® Land Institute and an RLI instructor. \xa0 One of the biggest challenges in land real estate is figuring out how to price it. It can be on the market for a couple of years, and sometimes they have to travel over 200 miles to find comps for a similar piece of land. The potential market is pretty vast in the West, but Justin tries to remain within the same state due to changing property values. \xa0 As a buyer’s agent, it is important to do due diligence on a property, including inspections on the property and the infrastructure. Properties need to be brought up to code before closing or handled properly after closing. The permit process in Justin’s area is relatively easy, but all the different landscapes will affect how long it takes to get the property ready. Sometimes large transactions get held up because due diligence was not done before the property was listed. When the proper due diligence is done, those listings normally sell for higher than the listing price. \xa0 Recently Justin has noticed people coming from Arizona, California, and even Florida to purchase these large parcels. Location is important — people tend to want properties that are closer to national hubs. \xa0 In the West, especially, water is key. Just because water is on your property, you don’t necessarily have the right to it. It’s important to make sure you’re working with someone who understands water and the rules surrounding it. Mineral rights are the same way. The state of Colorado has a lot of laws in place that protect the property owner. \xa0 With the large tracts of land out West, there are cases where they are downsizing to make the properties a little smaller and more affordable for some investors. It is important to realize what your clients want, especially in terms of privacy, to determine which size property is best. \xa0 In the West, there are also several National Parks to consider. It is a risk to own a property that is sitting on leased land. Buyers should do their due diligence on the risk associated with ownership of this property before buying or developing that land. \xa0 Out in the West, there is a lot of opportunity for things that are hard to put a value on. Many buyers are looking to establish some type of family legacy, or find a place where they will be able to go and unplug. \xa0 Similar to what Jeramy says, Justin encourages REALTORS® to be prepared and know where to go to get the right information. If you don’t know, offer to find out or provide an additional resource for your clients. Don’t be afraid to be the source of the source. \xa0 Guest Links: \xa0 REALTORS®\xa0 Land Institute Website \xa0 Additional Links: OnlineLearning.realtor for NAR Online Education Training4RE.com — List of Classroom Courses for REBAC and REBI classes.

RPR® helps REALTORS® provide and analyze data for your clients when they request it. Today’s guest, Veronica McManus, is the director of industry relations with RPR®. In this episode, she and Monica discuss some of the benefits of this program for REALTORS® and their clients, as well the many reports available in the system and how to engage with them. \xa0 Veronica is in her 7th year with RPR®, and she works with MLSs and associations to encourage their engagement and usage of RPR®. She and her team are the connection between RPR®\xa0 and the REALTORS® that use it. Realtors Property Resource® is a parcel-centric property database that contains over one hundred million property records from over 300 data sources on commercial, industrial, residential, and land parcels across the country. \xa0 RPR® originated when the NAR noticed that clients were coming to their REALTORS® with this data already. They housed it in a central location so their REALTORS® can provide accurate data to their clients. The public seems to love this data, so it’s important to know how you can best engage with the product. For a basic beginning webinar, visit the blog: blog.narrpr.com. \xa0 One of the key benefits for the RPR® is that once their client comes to them about a house or a piece of property, the REALTOR® can immediately look up the address of the property and access the data. One of the things that sets RPR® apart from accessing information on your MLS is the report section where there are many different reports that can be created, how they can be shared with the consumer, and the quality of data they contain. \xa0 Some of the reports they have on RPR® are property reports, mini property reports, sellers reports, valuation reports, market activity reports, school reports, and property flyers that can be easily linked to other platforms. They also have neighborhood reports that share economic, demographic, quality of life, and market statistics. The REALTOR® is able to put up to 10 PDF documents into their reports. Veronica describes how we may use some of these reports in our marketing. \xa0 Many of the reports are very long, but you can go into the report details and pick and choose which information is most pertinent or most appealing to you and your clients. You can go in and create a custom template that will easily generate your reports going forward. This also makes it easier to create a report that suits your clients’ needs, in a very short amount of time! This has helped REALTORS® get a client because they are able to connect with them quickly. \xa0 You have the ability to go into reports and suppress some of the estimated values for values. If you’re responding quickly to a lead, they don’t necessarily need to have the RVM. This keeps people from getting too far ahead with pricing with the customer. \xa0 The AVM is the automated valuation model, and the RVM is the REALTOR® valuation model market. This was one of the biggest data points NAR hoped to deliver with RPR®. This can be compared to the data that other places are using, such as Zillow. There are some differences between RPR® and Zillow. To determine the RVM, RPR® uses the averages of three different algorithms and also looks to the MLS for accurate and up-to-date information on active and pending list prices. The RVM also show you details, so you or the client can know which comps were used to estimate the price. The reports are also very helpful to share with your industry partners, as they add value to both you and your partner. \xa0 The REALTOR® is bringing their wisdom and experience when they interact with the reports within RPR®. They know what is going on in the markets and have often seen the properties, so they are able to change and engage the data in ways other companies are unable to provide. \xa0 Some of the other tools RPR® has to offer are traffic counts, flood maps, and heat maps. You can also view distressed properties on RPR® and provide resources to those homeowners. Some other ways REALTORS® are using the resources provided by RPR® are while door knocking and during open houses; utilizing the app has been a game changer for many people! When you can have some of the general information available for people asking questions, it creates a strong initial impression and makes the REALTOR® central to the transaction. \xa0 If you’re not using RPR®, now is the time to start! Your competitors are likely using RPR®, and they are closing more business.

Before she joined RPR®, Veronica was a full-time agent, office manager, and education director. A REALTOR® since 1994, she was her association’s past president, REALTOR®\xa0of the Year, and Massachusetts Women’s Council of REALTORS® State President.

She also has her broker’s license. \xa0 | Today’s episode is the second part of a three-part series that highlights some of the major NAR programs being offered. The Commitment to Excellence (C2EX) program explores professionalism and its application to professional life. Monica and Hagan talk about some key points of professionalism, as well as breaking down the way the assessments work. All of this is so we can improve excellence in our own lives as well as in the industry! \xa0 The Commitment to Excellence program came from a strategic planning aim to look at what the REALTORS® of the future would look like. Professionalism needed to increase across the association across the country, to continue to keep the industry strong. C2EX is the initiative that gives members a voluntary pathway to the highest level of professionalism in ten key areas of the business. There have been 19,000 members that have signed up so far. \xa0 The program was designed for REALTORS® at any skill level to come in and learn key points from the ten areas. When you first take an assessment, the program puts together a personalized learning path based on the knowledge you already have and the knowledge you need to gain from the ten areas to be endorsed. Monica and Hagan talk about some of the specifics of the quiz, and why it’s important to have an open mindset while working through it. \xa0 Whenever they present the C2EX program, there is an influx of people who sign up for the program. A key part of the story is marketing and letting people know about it. People seem to enjoy the assessment to figure out strengths and weaknesses, and these assessments could also be done in a large group, focusing on each person’s result. It can be an important tool for team building. \xa0 One of the goals of the C2EX program is raising the bar and raising the goals for REALTORS® around the country. Professionalism is all thinking about the end user and being prepared in each action to make sure the transaction goes smoothly. Some of the traits that C2EX covers are: trust & integrity, client service, and professional reputation. It is meant to help improve everyone in the profession, not just those who are new. \xa0 Client service includes making sure the client has a copy of all the documents they should’ve signed and going over the contract with them. Communication is another aspect of professionalism. Getting to know which communication medium your client prefers will go a long way. Take the time to understand how your client best communicates and use that throughout the process. It is also helpful to have one day a week, or something set in stone, to catch the client up on what happened that week. \xa0 Reputation is another facet of professionalism. We don’t often get a chance to redeem ourselves when it comes to our reputation, but you have to keep it in mind so that you keep it untarnished. We have our experience, time, and reputation to offer for our clients. Having a good reputation in your market positively impacts the experience of your client. To manage your reputation online, be careful about what you post. You represent your clients in addition to just yourself. You want to make sure your reputation paints you as someone who is considerate, someone who understands our code of ethics. \xa0 The Commitment to Excellence program is split into smaller sections, so you can tackle them one at a time. It becomes a lifelong learning tool. You may receive a notification to retake a certification if something in that realm has changed. \xa0 Trust and integrity are incredibly important for professionalism. Our clients trust us with one of the largest financial transactions they will have in their lives. As agents, we need to look for ways to build trust by staying on top of communication, being prepared, and sharing all options with your client. Put building trust at the forefront of your decision-making when it comes to your client. You also want to develop a sense of trust with your clients, so they feel like you’ve also listened to them. \xa0 Hagan and Monica discuss some final thoughts on professional. Some of the things Hagan does are to connect with the REALTOR® when an offer is coming through, and also make sure that your voicemail reflects you as a professional. When it comes down to it, be respectful of your other colleagues in the business. We’re all working toward the same end goal for our clients. \xa0 Log into to take the C2EX assessment: login to www.C2EX.REALTOR®. Choose to be the best you can be in the business. This program will help you sustain your business in a professional manner! \xa0 Guest Links: TNREALTORS®.com/hagan-stone-2/ Parksathome.com/agents/HaganStone Commitment to Excellence \xa0 Additional Links: OnlineLearning.REALTOR® for NAR Online Education Training4RE.com — List of Classroom Courses for REBAC and REBI classes.

He is a recipient of the Nashville Emerging Leader Award for RE Services (2014) and a graduate of NAR Leadership Academy (2010). \xa0 Locally, Hagan also has chaired multiple committees including Professional Development, RPAC/Legislative, and Nominating, and he was named REALTOR® of the Year in 2010. On the state level, Hagan’s leadership positions have included RPAC Trustees Vice Chair (2014). Nationally, he has chaired NAR’s RPAC Fundraising Trustees (2017) and its Leadership Academy (2015), among other roles. \xa0 When it comes to his approach to real estate, Hagan credits his father’s influence. “He has been a small-business owner and entrepreneur for more than fifty years. The greatest lessons he has taught me have been accepting hard work, taking leaps of faith and never settling for the status quo.” \xa0 Born in Nashville, reared in Clarksville — which he considers home — and a 24-year Nashville resident, Hagan is a proud Tennessean who also loves to travel and experience different cultures and customs. \xa0 He is a 1996 graduate of Belmont University with a bachelor’s in Communications Studies and a minor in History. He and his wife, Laura (a nurse practitioner at St. Thomas West), are the parents of Catherine, 14, and Dawson, 13. | Now that you’re in the real estate game, what’s your plan for your money? What are your plans for retirement? In today’s episode, in an interview-style episode, Monica and her guest, Kasey Stewart, talk about defining financial wellness, how to achieve it, and what resources can help you manage your money for the future. \xa0 In 2017, NAR’s president wanted to help REALTORS® prepare for retirement. In a career where they get paid commission checks, planning can be hard for REALTORS®. The Center for REALTOR® Financial Wellness covers several different areas of investment. You can also set goals for yourself and explore the resource library. \xa0 Kasey shares some statistics about their members. 43% are not preparing for retirement and 42% are not prepared for a financial emergency. \xa0 What does financial wellness mean? For Monica, it means she is in a place where she doesn’t have anxiety about her finances. This includes having reserves, having some idea of retirement, and flexibility and finances to tend to personal or family issues. It’s a subjective term depending on your situation — it may be different for everyone. Think about what you need to feel financially healthy. \xa0 Every form of debt has interest that will compound. Debt can also cause anxiety and might even physically manifest itself. If you’re in debt, work on getting out of debt. There are people who can help you get out of debt, but be careful with the help you choose. Once you pay off your debt, it might be a good idea to roll those payments over into another account, maybe for retirement or a savings account. \xa0 As independent contractors, it’s important to keep your business reserves separate from your personal reserves. To create a budget as an independent contractor, write down all of your necessary expenses in your personal life. Also, do this for your business, so you have a number that you know you need to get by each month. At some banks, you can set up different accounts to set aside the money to pay your brokers, your taxes, and other anticipated expenses. \xa0 To build her reserves, Monica has a business checking account (you could also open a personal checking account for your business funds), and only uses it for business expenses. Monica also uses financial software to help her keep up with her finances. She uses QuickBooks, but there are many different financial software packages you can use. NAR members can get a discount on QuickBooks Self-Employed for $5/month. A couple of ways to build up your reserves are to take a percentage of each closing check and distribute it to your different reserves; if you find you’ve had a generous season, you can move larger chunks of money. \xa0 How do we prepare for retirement as independent contractors? Paying for retirement can be difficult if you don’t get consistent paychecks. One of the first things you can do for the future is to improve your amount of business today. You need to define what amount of money would make you feel comfortable for retirement. There are also different avenues you can use to fund your retirement: stocks, bonds, IRA’s, etc. Investing in stocks can be a good way to start funding an account to purchase real estate down the road. \xa0 The closer you get to retirement, the more conservative you should be. It would be wise to work with a financial investor that can help you modify for your level of comfort, and also help you understand how your real estate investments play into that. Invest in what you know! You can also determine which type of IRA you might want to invest in. \xa0 There are several different ways to invest in real estate: buy a rental property for long-term tenants, Airbnb-type rental, commercial properties, or a real estate investment trust. When considering these avenues, think about your tolerance for management and your tolerance for risk. \xa0 Estate planning is part of the financial wellness program. It’s incredibly important to have a will and a Power of Attorney, in case anything should happen to you. \xa0 For more information, visit financialwellness.REALTOR®. Financial planning is important for people just getting into the industry or people who have been in the business for a while and are starting to look ahead toward retirement. \xa0 Guest Links: Financialwellness.REALTOR® nar.REALTOR®/REALTOR®benefits \xa0 Additional Links: OnlineLearning.REALTOR® for NAR Online Education Training4RE.com — List of Classroom Courses for REBAC and REBI classes.

Nar.REALTOR®/REALTOR®-benefits-program Nar.REALTOR®/center-for-REALTOR®-financial-wellness  | Great customer service is one of the key ways we can set ourselves apart from other people in the industry. Everybody wants (and expects) a great customer service experience. Pete Blank joins Monica on the show today to talk about his customer service background working for Disney. They share ideas about customer service through a discussion of the seven guest service guidelines Disney uses, and fit them into the real estate industry. Now that so much is available online to consumers, customer service in real estate has become that much more important. The face-to-face connection is something clients value and the way we present ourselves and our product contributes to the customer experience. This is similar to the idea at Disney that employees are always in “the show.” For real estate, this would involve staging, materials, etc. At Disney, they teach that the relationship between you and the customer has to be number one. Pete discusses a little bit about these guidelines and relates them to the real estate industry. The first one is to 1) Make eye contact and smile. This is perhaps a bit easier in the real estate industry as much of the contact is one-on-one, but make sure you’re always presenting a good front when you’re meeting with clients, or in a situation where you may be around potential clients. The second is 2) Greet and welcome each and every guest. This one is also applicable for when you are out and about. When you’re out in public in your community, it’s important to consider that you may be around potential clients. Note how you want to present yourself to someone who knows you’re in real estate but you may not be having a direct interaction with. You are your own brand. The next guideline is 3) Seek out guest contact. This one is related to the second guideline in the fact that you may always be around potential clients. In terms of real estate, so many people own homes or want to own homes. There is a general curiosity about the market. As an agent, you can try to share some market research when you’re out in public (in appropriate situations). This will help you be top-of-mind for people that you’ve helped previously or they’ve heard of you through this sharing of knowledge in different environments. One of the most important reasons is 4) Provide immediate service recovery. Pete shares a story about something he experienced during his time at Disney. What’s important here is if a client brings you an issue, we try to fix it with service first. Rather than offering a discount or some sort of bonus item during the time of the transaction with your client, we look for a way to placate the issue with service first. This will make your client feel valuable. These standards (the rest to follow!) are non-negotiable. Big businesses may already have these established, but if you are a solopreneur starting your business, take some time to write down some non-negotiable standards for yourself that you will use to serve your clients. Getting back to the guidelines, number 5) Appropriate body language at all times. As with any industry, when you see employees who look disinterested, this can skew your whole perception of the business. In real estate, this could you be how you look before you meet a seller for a listing. You don’t necessarily want to be wrapping up previous business when your new client shows up. Your body language should show your client that they are the most important thing during your meeting. Number 6) Preserve the magical guest experience. We don’t want clients to see the nitty-gritty of how things work. This would involved keep the “backstage” parts of processes out of the customer experience. Monica mentions that in real estate there is a line between letting the public know what you’re doing (how much time it’s taking, etc) and also sharing too much. The important thing is how you’re sharing this information. It’s okay to express the work you’ve done, but it’s not okay to complain about the process, especially to your client. As a real estate agent, you can provide your clients with some information about all the different things you do for them, so they know you are creating value for them. The last service guideline is to 7) Thank each and every guest. At Disney when you leave for the night, people are stationed on the way to say thank you for visiting and provide salutations. In real estate, the close of the transaction is not always the end. You want to make sure you close the transaction with a thank you. This differs from agent to agent — some may prefer different gestures of gratitude. An important part of the close of a transaction is a review or a post-event survey. Some things to keep in mind are the length — you don’t want it to be too long or too involved; testimonials are usually a good bet because customers can put their own stamp on it. Even calling it a testimonial rather than a review, may get better results and more response. If you have an exceptional experience with a customer or someone involved in completing the transaction, you may want to consider a well-placed gift. A new development in the industry is working with real estate teams. Many teams don’t have the same longevity as Disney employees, and it can be a challenge to keep up team encouragement. One of the most important things when working on any team is to set up some expectations for team operations, communication, etc. The other aspect is personalities; when you get the team together, take some time to do an activity to get know your team members outside of the business transaction. The final topic Pete and Monica discuss is getting third-party vendors who share your customer service values and habits. This comes down to setting expectations and maybe also having a brief training with your third-party vendors so everyone is on the same page about the customer experience. One of the main focuses of the Disney model is savoring the experience. Once the experience is over, we want our clients to look back on it fondly and appreciate how simple it was. As a real estate agent, you want to try to create an experience that clients will look back on and tell others about.

One day, while walking down Main Street U.S.A. in the Magic Kingdom, he told his parents, “One day, I\'m going to work here.” In 1989, while attending the University of Florida, he spent a summer as a Disney Cast Member making memories for guests while working in the Magic Kingdom parking lot. That three-month adventure confirmed what he believed… that this was the right company for him. After a stint as a television sportscaster, he returned to Disney in 1994. Over the next 13 years, he managed various areas of Disney\'s theme parks and resorts, where he learned what it takes to run a world-class organization. Pete was blessed to spend the majority of his time working at Disney University. While there, he led the Traditions program, which is known worldwide as one of the premier employee orientation programs. He also facilitated college-level courses to thousands of Disney College Interns and was a Segment Learning Manager for Walt Disney World, Disneyland Resort, and the Disney Cruise Line. Today, he is the Training and Organizational Development Manager for the Personnel Board of Jefferson County in Birmingham, AL. In this role, he manages a department responsible for providing leadership and management training to over 7,000 local government employees across 23 agencies.

In addition, he works with organizations and associations all across the U.S., helping them achieve their goals in the areas of leadership, employee engagement and customer service. Some of his clients include\xa0 DirecTV, Southern Company, LG, Regions Bank, and Coldwell Banker. His first book is Employee Engagement: Lessons from the Mouse House. His next book, Pick Up the Roach! Why Great Leaders do the Little Things, is due out in 2019. | First-time homebuyers are a niche market among all buyers. They all have in common that they have never bought a house before, so the processes involved are new to them. So much of the journey in working with first-time buyers is about educating them and asking better questions to understand where they are and what they need to move forward. In today’s episode, Monica and her guest, Rich Sands, discuss many ways that we as agents can help our clients who are first-time homebuyers. Working with buyers and sellers are two different ends of the same spectrum. Having systems are true for working with both; you need effectiveness and efficiency. Thirty-three to 39 percent of buyers are first-time homebuyers. Some challenges that first-time homebuyers face in today’s market is that mortgages are harder to get and prices have gone up. The main thing that makes first-time buyers unique is that they have never done this before. As an agent, you have to have an educator mindset. For many first-time homebuyers, you have to figure out what the money situation is. Will they be paying cash or have you arranged for financing? Most will finance their first property, and you can usually find properties that are less than or equal to the cost of renting. One of the challenges of being an agent is working with people from different generations. Each one poses a different set of needs and desires. What is important for agents is finding a good lender for your clients. When looking for lenders, look for lenders who do the products that are most beneficial for first-time homebuyers (HomeReady and Home Possible®). You want someone who is able to effectively implement these programs, not just someone who knows about them. Some of the associated costs with owning a home are the transaction costs — closing cost, fees, etc. — as well as maintenance costs like electric and cable bills or regular service. A good idea for agents is to have a checklist of some of the other costs homeowners have in addition to their mortgage. This will help your clients be prepared for all costs so they aren’t blindsided. As we mentioned before, first-time homebuyers are not all young. There are first-time homebuyers from a wide range of ages; with that comes a wide range of experience, situations, and financial background. There are systems we can use to inform our clients. We can help explain the process of buying a home, both looking for one and then writing the contract. They also need help with financing and understanding the market. One of the best things we can do as a REALTOR® is to understand what they want and what they’re trying to accomplish. Working with first-time homebuyers also requires a lot of patience. Being a great listener and a great asker of questions is crucial to understanding what your clients want. The three most important questions you can use to clarify are “What do you mean?,” “Why is that?,” and “What else?” When we give ourselves permission to slow down and really be with our clients, we will be able to hear them better and determine their needs. An agent also has to be a great explainer. They have to be able to take any aspect of the process and make it concise and understandable and present it in a way that works for the recipient. Another requirement is that an agent be technologically flexible. It’s also important to have strong leadership qualities. If you are someone who really enjoys helping people and wants to help first-time homebuyers, you can market to your sphere of influence to find those buyers. As a REALTOR®, it’s important to be aware of what’s important to different generations, so when you’re introduced to them and you want to move into something new, you’ve already learned about some ways to adapt. Another way to find first-time buyers is to make sure you have a good website and have a social media presence. You can find the right platform based on your skill set; if you can write, make a blog. If you have a personality, maybe think about video. And if you have a lot of information, maybe the podcast route is the way for you. You can get started by sharing to a wider audience your answers to questions from clients. As a REALTOR®, we have to be the person that our buyers need. It’s not necessarily changing who we are, but being flexible so that we can understand and accommodate first-time homebuyers. Instead of thinking about them as a transaction, think of them as people who are going through one of the most fundamental aspects of the American dream.

There are several ways to consider using video in your business: to film an intro, open houses, to go live on Facebook, or connect with local businesses. Monica’s guest, Jeremias “JMan” Maneiro, joins her on the show to discuss these different ways to use video in your business, as well as what equipment to use. All of these discussion points can help you improve and strengthen your connections with your clients. As we’ve entered into 2019, it is a time of video. It is a great way to build rapport with your clients and get to know them before an initial meeting. Community video is a great place to start. You can share things about restaurants, amenities, accessibility; you want to make the communities where you live and sell appealing to others. Another way to do community videos is to interview business owners and share it with the people. This not only helps you but also helps promote the business itself; it’s a win-win! You can also stream live events going on. An even easier place to start may be listing videos. You already have all the content and the listing, and it could be a great way to do the marketing. JMan does a “coming soon” video where he does a live walk-through of the home and shares it on his business page. Everyone has equal access to the listing, and the clients can see when agents leave comments on the video, which boosts the quality. You do have to be careful when you do Facebook live videos — be strategic about how you are “conducting business” between personal and business pages. You also have to respect your clients’ privacy. It is the same as when you’re staging for photographs — you want to make sure only things that should be on display are on display. There are options for more formal videos. Animoto and iPhoto are great applications where you can import images and videos to produce a stylized video. You don’t have to be in these videos, but you should brand it so people know who you are and where you are. More recently, drone video has entered the video marketing strategy. They can provide some really awesome shots but it may an instance where you want to hire a professional to help you. There are so many different things the drone allows you to see. Some of the most popular business videos are virtual open houses. This allows you to take interested buyers on a virtual tour of the house and also leaves the option to provide feedback or questions via some sort of form, so you are reacting to the video you just saw. This also allows for live engagement. Nearly all social media platforms have the “story” feature — these are a GREAT way to start! They are short clips, but they also only stick around for 24 hours, so there’s a little bit less pressure. These story videos encourage you to keep your message to-the-point, as well as get frequent practice with pretty little effort. The goals of your videos should not necessarily be the number of likes, but rather about connecting with your audience (quality over quantity). You can work to create custom audiences, so the people that are seeing your videos have really been tuned into your videos previously. Now that you know all the benefits and different avenues for video, how can you incorporate it into your business? One thing to expect is that you won’t be happy with every (or maybe any!) take. It takes time to get used to how you look and sound on video and one thing Monica recommends is to give herself one take, even if it’s not live. Each video is a learning opportunity, so as you get started, you can learn as you keep producing more videos. One of the beauties of video in our culture is that it does allow for you to be authentic and gives room for your human mistakes. One thing JMan has is a quick introduction video for his team. He has a small team, but a short introduction video allows clients or even other agents you may be working with to put a name with a face so they can get to know the whole team, rather than just you. They can feel like they are connected with the team at all points of the transaction. You don’t need to have a ton of fancy equipment. If you have a smartphone, that’s a good place to start. There are some additional lighting options to enhance what your phone does. Next is the audio; they make external microphones. The lavalier is a style that both JMan and Monica talk about to get better-polished videos. You can use apps and tools to get better angles, and there are also devices such as gimbals that act as a tripod so you don’t have to recruit others to help. One final type of video is the Matterport. This is a camera that does a high-res 360-degree scan of every room in the house and creates a virtual, immersive, 3D experience. If you’re ready to get started on video, just remember to be you. Be authentic, and focus on building relationships.

You're probably more likely to have heard of these as superbugs. Their rise has been described as a silent tsunami of catastrophic proportions. We travel to countries on the frontline of the crisis, and explore how hospitals and doctors around the world are fighting back. Prognosis’ new season launches Sept. 5.\xa0 | The Pay Check is back with a bonus episode on gender equality in women’s soccer. A few months ago, the US women’s soccer team filed a pay discrimination lawsuit alleging that they do not get equal pay for equal work. The US women’s team is far more successful, by many metrics, than the men’s team, but they make half as much. Globally, the story is much more complicated. Rebecca Greenfield talks with Eben Novy Williams about the fight for equality in the US and then heads to Bloomberg’s UK Equality Summit for our first ever live taping to talk with English soccer legend Kelly Smith, head of the Women’s Super League Kelly Simmons and Lenah Ueltzen-Gabell about the fight for equal treatment in the UK. | During World War II, the influx of women workers into the workforce solved one problem—the labor shortage—while creating another: Who would watch the kids? To address it, the U.S. government created high-quality, publicly-funded childcare centers for working moms. In this season’s final episode of The Pay Check, we explore the long term effects of this brief government experiment. We ask what it would take, short of a war, to generate a similar groundswell of public support for mothers in the workforce. And we question the assumption that mothers alone are responsible for creating the infrastructure that enables them to work. | For the last few weeks, we’ve been talking about how having kids makes it hard for women to work for pay. But there’s a flip side to that: Because it’s so hard for women to work for pay when they have kids, more and more just aren’t having them. This is a problem all over the developed world, and since population growth is a big part of economic growth, these countries are desperately trying to boost fertility rates. China in particular is in deep trouble: after almost 40 years of the One-Child Policy, the population could start shrinking within a few years. We head to China to see how the country is attempting to get women to have kids — and why it’s not working. | These days about one in three bites of food you eat wouldn’t be possible without commercial bee pollination. And the economic value of insect pollination worldwide is estimated to be about $217 billion. But as important as bees have become for farming, there’s also increasing signs that bees are in trouble. In the decade-plus since the first cases of Colony Collapse Disorder were reported, bees are still dying in record numbers, and important questions remain unanswered. On this new miniseries, host Adam Allington and environment reporters David Schultz and Tiffany Stecker travel to all corners of the honeybee ecosystem from Washington, D.C., to the California almond fields, and orchards of the upper Midwest to find answers to these questions. | When we talk about the gender pay gap, we’re talking about a ratio: how much women make compared to men. We’ve spent the last three weeks talking about what happens to women’s earnings when they become moms. This week, we look at the other side of the ratio: Men—or more generally, secondary caregivers. When men become dads, their earnings get a boost, a phenomenon known as the fatherhood bonus. But if they try to do more at home than established gender norms say they should, they too are penalized. Susan Berfield tells the story of Kevin Knussman, a police officer whose career suffered when he tried to take time off to care for his wife and new baby. Then we talk to Alexis Ohanian, aka Mr. Serena Williams, about how we can actually get men to be more involved dads. | We know working moms make less than men partly because they work fewer hours, and one of the main reasons for that is: childcare. Because, well: someone has to take care of the kids. In this episode, we dig into the economics of childcare, which are bad. Women either get pushed out of the workforce altogether, or have to take lower paying jobs to meet childcare needs. There are places, like Singapore, where childcare is cheap and plentiful, allowing women to stay in the workforce. It’s great for working women, but what about the women taking care of the kids? Tomoko Yamazaki reports from our Singapore bureau on the life of Romina Novato, a domestic worker in Singapore.\xa0 | On this new show from Bloomberg, hosts Mike Regan and Sarah Ponczek speak with expert guests each week about the main themes influencing global markets. They explore everything from stocks to bonds to currencies and commodities, and how each asset class affects trading in the others. Whether you’re a financial professional or just a curious retirement saver, What Goes Up keeps you apprised of the latest buzz on Wall Street and what the wildest movements in markets will mean for your investments.\xa0 | In this episode, we begin at the beginning: with pregnancy. Women with kids get sidelined at work even before they arrive. From the moment a woman gets pregnant—or reaches the age when she might get pregnant—she's seen as a financial liability. Companies would rather not have to deal with pregnant women at all—and sometimes, they don't. Claire Suddath delves into the history of laws against pregnancy discrimination and explains how they can still fail to protect women. And Jordyn Holman tells the story of Brittany Noble Jones, a TV anchor who says she was pushed out of a job because of her pregnancy. | In the season premier of The Pay Check, we take a close look at the single biggest reason for the gender pay gap: Motherhood. Women start out their careers earning about as much as men, but the pay gap widens to a chasm after a woman has her first child. Host Rebecca Greenfield talks to Bloomberg economics reporter Jeanna Smialek about what having a kid does to pay and why certain countries have bigger wage gaps for moms than others. We also hear from Senator Tammy Duckworth about what it’s really like to “have it all.”", 'chan_desc': 'It’s a big, expensive, global mystery. Why do women still make less money—a lot less—than men? In the US, the average woman makes 80 cents to every dollar a man makes. The Pay Check is an in-depth investigation into what that 20 percent difference looks like. In this miniseries we show you how the gender pay gap plays out in real life. We hear from Lilly Ledbetter, Mo’Nique, and a lot of other women who weren’t happy to be paid less. We find out what happens when a whole country tries to tackle the pay gap. And we see how some women are taking things into their own hands.

Kelly resides in\xa0Lakeville, MN with her husband, Scott and her two sets of identical twins!\xa0 Kelly participated in Organize 365\'s mentorship program and in addition to being a Sunday Basket Workshop Organizer, she also represents the Direct Sales Workbox and the Entrepreneur Workbox.\xa0 She was a stay-at-home mom thinking about what she wanted to do when I went back to work when she found Lisa\'s podcasts.She has always loved organizing, it comes easily to her and gets her excited. When she lived at home, she completely organized her parent\'s home and offices, top to bottom just for fun and would jump at the chance to help family and friends. Once she realized this was an actual industry, she knew she wanted to be an organizer instead of going back to a corporate job. She loves helping people and creating systems that make their life easier.\xa0 \xa0 Her advice for anyone considering becoming\xa0a Professional Organizer is two fold.\xa0 1) Just start and don\'t worry about having everything ready. You learn as you go and you improve and tweak along the way.\xa0\xa0 2) Say yes and do it afraid.\xa0 If someone asks you to speak or organize something you haven\'t done before, just say yes and go figure it out. Allow yourself to stretch beyond your comfort zone. It\'s how you learn and grow.\xa0 Just act "as if" you\'ve done it many times before and nobody will be the wiser. \xa0 \xa0 Listen in to learn more about Kelly and the Organizing Advantage!\xa0 | Suzanne Lindsey of Lighthouse Organizing is a Professional Organizer in Canton, Mississippi, nearby to Jackson and has owned Lighthouse Organizing for almost 2 years.\xa0 When she started looking for a business she could start, she had no idea that Professional Organizing was a business.\xa0 She was looking for something she could do to serve others and make a difference in their life.\xa0\xa0Around that same time she started to "binge listen" to Lisa\'s podcast.\xa0 She has a long time friend that mentioned the Sunday Basket while they were exercising together.\xa0\xa0 She started at the beginning and listened all the way through.\xa0 She learned that Professional Organizing was a business she could start that would also help people change their lives.\xa0 She learned about the mentorship program Organize 365 had at the time and she decided to invest. Since then she has become a Certified Sunday Basket Workshop Organizer and is also Certified to teach all four (4) binders through Organize 365 - the Medical, Financial, Home Reference and Home Operations. She has also attended both boot camps!\xa0(She\xa0just hired this same friend that introduced her to the podcast 2 days prior to this podcast recording as a contractor to help on a large job and she could not believe how well they worked together.) When asked for her advice to anyone considering being a Professional Organizer, she says, "I would suggest 2 things.\xa0\xa0First, offer to organize a friend’s space for free and see that you love it. Then if you decide to start your own business, you could possibly use before and after pictures from that job.\xa0\xa0Your friend could give you a review as well. Second, I wouldn’t go at it alone.\xa0\xa0Learn as much as you can from the leaders in the industry.\xa0\xa0Listen to podcasts, read books, read POTT Facebook posts- join in and ask questions.\xa0 In addition to doing those things I made some great friends at the first Bootcamp you had in Cincinnati. From that circle of friends I have 2 mastermind groups where we meet regularly to set goals, discuss business issues and hold each other accountable." Suzanne and her husband, David, have been married for 26 years, and they have 5 children - ages 21, 19, 17, 16 and 14 along with 2 dogs and a cat and she focuses on helping people during a home renovation or move.\xa0 | In this week\'s podcast episode, Lisa Woodruff interviews Lauren Wolf of Her Kind By Design. Lauren has been a Professional Organizer for almost a year, is Certified by Organize 365 as a Sunday Basket Workshop Organizer and she is Certified to teach the Direct Sales Workbox and all of the Organize 365 Binders. She lives in Leland, NC with her husband and two pre-teen children, Jack and Lily.\xa0 Lauren found Lisa when she was Googling how to organize kids school papers and stumbled upon her blogpost and podcast. She has been a faithful listener ever since. When asked what her advice is for anyone who is thinking about starting a Professional Organizer, she says, "Just start. Right where you are. Live the methods you teach and talk to people. The websites, logos, newsletters, etc. will come. Just go for it!" Lauren is passionate about helping parents of children with medical needs, helping them find "control over the chaos." Listen in this week as Lauren shares her story of her first year as the CEO of Her Kind By Design!\xa0 | Holly is a Certified Sunday Basket Workshop Organizer, promoting her Professional Organization Business, as a partner with Organize 365.\xa0  In this week\'s podcast episode Lisa poses many questions to Holly,\xa0who is now in her second year in business. Holly decided to become a Professional Organizer working full time for a\xa0corporation, doing a job she loves. She never intended to set out to own her own business,but has been inspired by women who retired "from corporate life" in their 50s to work on their own businesses full time. She was a huge fan of Lisa Woodruff and Organize 365. She was feeling good and getting her house under control, and it made her curious to see what other organizing podcasts were out there. She stumbled on this podcast, when it was first released, was a listener and thought it would be fun as a career after she retired. Inspired by Organize 365, she decided to take the plunge!\xa0 Her advice for anyone considering becoming a\xa0Professional Organizer? "Listen to POTtank and suck up as much knowledge from that as possible to get started. Come to Lisa\'s live events to hear her motivate you in person and network with other POs. But really if you\'re starting a business yourself and you want to be your own boss you have to look inward, find your passion/your "why" and everything else can fall into place. Like Lisa says \'you are enough\' - you have it in you to be what you want to be, so you have to find the confidence to know you\'re worth it and deserve it. Get to know yourself so you can develop a unique personal brand and go after clients that you will work with well. Having your own business means you don\'t have to work with anyone and everyone. Hiring a coach you can have one-on-one sessions with really helps with this personal development. Oh and don\'t compare yourself to the what everyone else is doing. There is no \'right way\'. It does help to find a mentor/model who is only a tiny bit further than you in the process of starting the business." One thing that Holly feels is unique about her business/services\xa0is her name. "I picked my name HAP Organizing Solutions to mean various things. On one hand it stands for my initials Holly A. Perez, but it really stands for Happy and Productive. This is the emotional base for what I\'m offering to clients. It also can abbreviate Home offices and Paper. :) I use my corporate experience to focus on efficiency and streamlining the home\'s operations as if you were improving processes at work. It\'s about gaining savings of time and money. My philosophy is that we don\'t need to waste time/money on organizing products in order to make a significant impact. It\'s all about prioritizing the client\'s most impactful\xa0project to build momentum and experience the benefits right away."

His success is owed to his ability to be extremely clear on what’s important to him in the business. After having success early in his real estate work, he transitioned into a leadership role. He brings a high level of credibility to his coaching, and he has become a master at communicating at a higher level with versatility. He has built a successful career around building a business he’s passionate, and helping train and grow a strong crop of talented salespeople.\xa0 \xa0 Jeff Glover started his Real Estate career at the young age of 19. With a strong focus on learning how to sell, prospecting and presenting, Jeff quickly became the top agent in his office. After selling 30 homes in his first year in the business, he was sought out by largest Coldwell Banker firm in Michigan to manage one of their offices. After becoming the top recruiter two years in a row in that office, the 17 office firm with over 600 agents promoted Jeff to their Director of Training and Recruiting. After a few years in that role, Jeff started what is known today as Jeff Glover & Associates, and in 2009, Jeff took his team to Keller Williams. That team is now composed of over 25 agents selling over 1,000 homes a year. Jeff is known industry-wide as a top sales trainer and professional speaker. From his years of experience, trial and error, Jeff has learned the best practices for taking a real estate business from 0-100 and making his associates as successful as possible. Jeff not only talks the talk, he also walks it, at an average of 150 closings per year for himself personally. In addition to selling Real Estate, Jeff enjoys coaching his Team Leaders and the Agency Manager of the title company he founded Titleocity, and participating in his foundation, Glover's Heroes. \xa0 In the real estate industry, having a long career and a business with long term success comes down to prioritizing the right things, and never taking the foot off the gas when it comes to our goals. We should only grow the business when the leads and transactions force us to grow, and we should always be teaching our agents to be good salespeople. Gimmicks, trends, technology\xa0 and marketing ploys come and go; but if we want to keep competing, we need to put sales excellence at the core of everything we do and teach.\xa0 \xa0 In Today’s Episode, We Talk About; \xa0 - Jeff’s experience of being a new agent at 18 and the simplicity of success in real estate. - Transitioning from running a sales organization to managing, recruiting and training. - The right way to grow a business and why we don’t grow by adding more people. - Why ISAs need to have transactional experience. - Expanding into training and coaching and why sales should be at the forefront of our activities. - Jeff’s top 3 tips for living a kickass life.\xa0   Guest Info   Jeff is a broker, coach and the founder of Jeff Glover & Associates, and Glover University.\xa0 \xa0 Website: https://www.gloveru.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GloverU/ | 📞Time to change it up   ❓Are you stepping away ? \xa0  ❓Taking the time to unplug?

Economists and agents offered different opinions on how the 2nd rate cut of the year will impact housing market \xa0 The Fed is cutting interest rates 25 basis points from between 2 percent and 2.25 percent to between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. It had previously signaled it would not hike rates at all in 2019 – after\xa0four rate hikes in 2018\xa0– but now it actually cut rates for the second time. \xa0 \xa0 ***Foreclosure starts plummet to 18-year low Loans in active foreclosure sinks to lowest level since 2005 \xa0 Foreclosure starts in August sank to their lowest level in more than 18 years, according to the latest First Look report from\xa0Black Knight. \xa0 Foreclosure starts fell to 36,200 for the month, down more than 23% from the same time last year, the report showed. This is actually the lowest number for any single month since December 2000. \xa0 In fact, the number of loans in active foreclosure continued to improve, dropping to 253,000. This represents the smallest level since 2005. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ***Compass launches new consumer search tools, says IPO 'likely'\xa0\xa0& Compass opens West Coast tech hub 2 blocks from Amazon’s headquarters Robert Reffkin announced Monday that Compass has new, artificial intelligence-driven tools that will give consumers home recommendations and let them collaborate with their agents \xa0 Compass, a real estate brokerage and tech company, opened an office in Seattle that’s two blocks from\xa0Amazon’s headquarters and a mile from\xa0Zillow’s main offices. New York-based Compass now has three floors of a new building at 503 Westlake Avenue that will eventually house over 100 engineers and 70 operations staff.

Airbnb’s IPO is expected to be better received than the recent public offerings of some tech behemoths, including Uber and Lyft. And if special equity-sharing with hosts is part of the deal, the IPO could also chart a new way to cut more stakeholders in on the success of gig economy companies. “Airbnb has something Uber and Lyft don’t have: a proven, sustainable business model,” Matt Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist with Renaissance Capital, told the\xa0San Francisco Chronicle. “It will be a refreshing change of pace to actually get a $30-billion-plus company that has some profits.” Airbnb was valued at $31 billion by its investors in September 2017,\xa0Inc. reported. \xa0 *Airbnb invests $25 million in Bay Area affordable housing | About the Episode On this episode, I talk to mega-influencer, media and entrepreneurship powerhouse, Gary Vaynerchuk, a man who has revolutionized how business owners communicate and operate. Through his business ventures, Gary has been able to build massive companies that aren’t just successful in terms of social media popularity, but also run as well oiled machines operationally, something many entities struggle with.

Gavin Newsom after state's two legislative bodies both approved the measure. \xa0 The bill will cap annual rent increases by 5%, including the rate of inflation. In addition to the rent cap, a bill known as AB-1482, the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, will allow “just cause” eviction policies to qualified housing in California.\xa0 \xa0 California, one of the nation's\xa0priciest housing\xa0markets, is following\xa0Oregon’s\xa0footsteps in enacting rent control.\xa0In March, Oregon approved a law\xa0placing an annual limit on rent increases of 7% plus inflation. The bill appears to have Newsom's support, as the governor tweeted that “The rent is too damn high -- so we’re damn sure doing something about it” and “Because there should be a cap on how much you pay for rent...Because your landlord shouldn’t be able to evict you for no reason.”\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Zillow Offers is live in San Diego San Diego is the 17th market to offer homebuyers quick-close, all-cash offers from the real estate tech giant - San Diego is the 17th market for its 17-month old iBuyer platform Zillow Offers. WOW! \xa0 \xa0 Ben Kinney partners with early mentor for new real estate coaching service Forward Coaching is the joint effort of Debbie De Grote and Ben Kinney Companies.  https://forwardcoaching.com/ \xa0 \xa0 Average FICO scores hit all-time high The credit reporting firm said this week that the average score has now hit 706, marking a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when average scores bottomed out. FICO vice president for scores and analytics Ethan Dornhelm wrote that “there have been nine consecutive years of increases in the national average FICO Score” to bring this year’s average to 706. Average scores had previously bottomed out a decade ago, in October 2009, during the housing and financial crisis. At that time, the average score fell all the way to 686. \xa0 “The key driver of this trend,” he explained, “is the improved consumer financial health that has resulted from the steady economic growth that the U.S. has experienced since the\xa0Great Recession.” | About the Episode On this episode, I’m joined by inspirational entrepreneur, speaker, podcast host and co-founder of GoBundance, Pat Hiban. He has built an incredible legacy that goes beyond real estate and business. He has put work into helping other entrepreneurs build legacies and inspired the masses by showing what it takes to have staying power in entrepreneurship. Pat has done the leg work in the real estate business, including being a pioneer in the realm of building a real estate team, growing a team of 54 members, losing almost all his savings in the stock market crash, and building it all back up from the ground. Now, he’s on a mission to inspire people and provide much needed mentorship to those who need it. He wrote “6 Steps to 7 Figures, A Real Estate Professional’s Guide Building Wealth and Creating your Destiny.” He co-founded GoBundance, a mastermind organization that has grown to 200 members. He has taken this further by writing a second book Tribe of Millionaires, in which Gobundance members share valuable life lessons.\xa0 In our industry, one of the things that’s really lacking is the combination of hard work and consistency, and as a result, many agents are failing to build businesses that have long-term success. Another big issue is the lack of mentorship for all of the agents. Pat and other top-producing entrepreneurs are evidence that success requires us to roll up our sleeves, stay consistent and persistent, put ourselves around the right people. “Proximity is power, and it does matter who we hang out with. We can all get better from the sum of our parts.”\xa0 \xa0 In Today’s Episode, We Talk About; \xa0 02:54 - How Pat grew a team of 54 people.\xa0 08:19 - Marketing campaigns, main lead levers and the value of follow-up. 16:53 - How Pat lost $800k in retirement savings in the stock market crash and bounced back.\xa0 22:06\xa0 - Pat’s new book, Tribe of Millionaires\xa0\xa0 27:50 - The value of masterminds   Guest Info \xa0 Pat Hiban is an Author, Speaker, Podcast Host of Real Estate Rockstars and Co-founder of GoBundance.

However, to create one inside our own company is much easier said than done. That’s why we’re digging into the specific elements required for a talk trigger to be activated. With so much noise in the marketing and advertising spaces, the opportunity to set yourself apart from the competition lies in the customer experience. Listen to this episode to understand the anatomy of a talk trigger, so you can implement them into your brand experience! You can order Talk Triggers here And learn more about Daniel Lemin and Jay Baer “Talk triggers are all about giving your customers a consistent story to tell.” - Daniel Lemin (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Most of those who are good at word-of-mouth are good at it by accident. Talk triggers must align with the brand’s positioning and be operationally feasible. It is most difficult for companies to operationalize human interaction. Look at UberConference’s hold music as an example of a talk trigger. Word of mouth is directly responsible for 19% of all purchases, and influences as much as 90%.  | \xa0“Our job, as performers, is often to break the rules. That’s what an artist does.” - Michael Port (click to tweet) On today’s episode of Steal the Show, we explore a listener’s question: how do we make the technical appear in technicolor? Well, he doesn’t exactly ask that. But how does a performer compel on a subject matter where the subject matter is dense, slides are expected, and a podium is the norm? Where’s the balance between what’s expected and breaking the rules to create a memorable experience for the audience? There’s a difference between being a critic and being a performer. One asks you to purely look at things from the top-down, pointing out what is wrong and what needs fixing. The other asks you to build an entirely new experience from scratch, subverting whatever’s wrong with the old by transcending it with something entirely new.   Listen to this episode to hear how to apply these principles to your own high-stakes moments. “Audience interaction should be proportionate to the amount of trust you have earned.” - Michael Port (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Work to music that has the same emotional sensibility you want the work to evoke. Break rules by creating an experience that defies expectations. Develop unconventional, creative ways to relay the data to the audience. Just because something is done a particular way doesn’t mean it’s the most effective way. Self-expression is the name of the game, as long as it serves the audience in the room.  | “You have to make it easy for other people to communicate the transformation. Not for you to communicate it for other people.” - Giovanni Marsico (click to tweet) Thanks to social media, we have the opportunity to engage with audiences before, during, and after events. When we do this, the in-person experience becomes something entirely different for the viewer: it’s the beginning of a performance. Because audience members participated in the conversation online, they feel like a contributor to the show—a member of the tribe. On today’s episode of Steal the Show, Giovanni Marsico speaks to us about how to build a following. Giovanni—a talent scout, curator, and connector of superheroes—is the founder of Archangel: a private membership community of mission-driven entrepreneurs that are making the world a better place through purpose-driven entrepreneurship and philanthropy. Listen to this episode to hear Giovanni’s insights on keeping focus while building a tribe for your personal speaking brand. You can attend Giovanni’s Archangel Summit 2018  here “When you control your body, voice, and mind in high-stakes situations, then you feel powerful and capable.” - Michael Port (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Ask yourself how your paradigm would change if you had to deliver results before you got paid. Simultaneously build a tribe and solve a problem. Keep your eyes on the big picture by maintaining a wide shot on the landscape. Focus on the larger movement and mission of the event and how attendees will change the world after attending. Be cautious when structuring a company growth strategy under affiliate marketing  | “In this business, you are not doing anything alone.” - Amy Port (click to tweet) On today’s episode of Steal The Show, we are joined by Amy Port for Part 2 of our conversation. Amy is the Co-Founder & President of Heroic Public Speaking, and today she unpacks the mechanics behind the keynote we delivered at the National Speakers Association Influence 2018 conference. Tune in to hear the principles we apply to rehearsal, so you too can deliver the same caliber performance. Last week’s episode, 115 Amy Port on Writing and Performing a Killer Keynote, can be found  here. “It’s not interesting watching people do easy things. It’s interesting watching people do challenging things.” - Michael Port (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Meaning comes from fulfilling commitments beyond what we think is possible. Find the line between self-expression and respect for the character. Surround yourself with collaborators and helpers to empower you to do more. What’s interesting is what’s important. Try to speak and write about that. The level of success is directly proportional to how much responsibility the person is willing to endure.  | “If you’re having to decide whether you should do A or B with your time—you should just wake up earlier.” - Amy Port (click to tweet) We’ve all been to the convention, where we spend our days sitting in lectures back-to-back, listening to speakers read from their slides. It’s undeniably forgettable, yet we find most abiding by this template when they’re on stage. So the question becomes: how do you abandon this formula to make a memorable speech. \xa0 On today’s episode of\xa0Steal the Show, Co-Founder & President of Heroic Public Speaking, Amy Port joins the show to deconstruct the keynote we delivered at the National Speakers Association Influence 2018 conference. By exposing the process, we reveal the approach necessary to build a killer keynote speech from the ground up. Or in this case, from the diner table up. \xa0 Listen to this episode to learn how to apply these principles to your next speaking gig, no matter how big or small. “Every choice we make—right down to what we wear—tells the audience how we want to be seen.” - Amy Port (click to tweet) Steal The Points  People lash out in when they feel that their status is questioned. Every artistic process has somebody at the helm. Write scenes that use contrast and high-stakes to fill the room with energy. Stay inside the lane of your strengths when collaborating. Find creative challenges to demonstrate to yourself what you’re capable of.  | “If you look at the past decade, I’d be challenged to see another industry as disrupted by technology as speaking.” - Mitch Joel (click to tweet) Today, most brands and businesses are also trying to be a media company. Selling a product or service is no longer enough. Whether it’s an engaging social media presence or valuable email marketing campaign—this new expectation of content creation provides an unprecedented marketing opportunity for companies all over the world. However, if we’re not careful, we can fall into the abyss of marketing noise; following templates and sticking to the norms will mask your authentic voice and have you hidden in the crowd. That’s why on today’s episode of Steal the Show, we are joined by Mitch Joel live at Heroic Public Speaking HQ to discuss content creation. Mitch has been called one of North America’s leading visionaries and the “rockstar of digital marketing” by Strategy Magazine. When brands like Google, Starbucks, Shopify, and GE want to leverage technology to better connect with their customers, they call Mitch. His first book, Six Pixels of Separation, named after his successful blog and podcast is a business and marketing bestseller. His second book, CTRL ALT Delete was named one of the best business books of 2013 by Amazon. Listen to this episode to learn the intellectual significance that Mitch brings to the table, and how you can apply Mitch’s wisdom to your brand.  “You have to find the thing that makes you want to create content.” \xa0- Mitch Joel (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Create content that is you, rather than what you think the audience wants. Find a talent agency with speakers who speak on similar topics. There will always be opportunity to write and speak about what’s next. Be mindful of when criticizing other work takes the place of working on your own. Watch the best speakers and read the best authors if you want to speak or write.  | “Rethink your discovery process so that it’s based on uncovering stories.” - Mike Ganino (click to tweet) In improv, with just a prompt, the actors on stage create an entire scene out of thin air. To the audience, this looks like magic. … But to the person who has adopted a “yes, and…” mindset, improv can serve as a guide to improve corporate culture and performance. On today’s episode of Steal the Show, we are joined by Mike Ganino to discuss what happens when we take the principles of improvisation into our real life. Mike is a culture and storytelling expert who helps executives, teams, and thought leaders to better communicate, connect, and engage. And, Mike also happens to be the Senior Performance Faculty member for Heroic Public Speaking Graduate School. Named a Top 30 culture speaker by Global Guru, Mike is the author of Company Culture For Dummies. Tune in to hear Mike’s insights, and how they help business and brands move towards both a better customer and employee experience. “We have to play in order to find new ways of being.” - Mike Ganino (click to tweet) Steal The Points  The rigid day-to-day motions of the office constrain our being. Adopt a ‘yes, and…’ mentality to accept the input of other people and explore unintended consequences. The world is VUCA - Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous. Meetings should end with the leaders exhausted, and the team members excited. Bring bricks to the conversation by making statements instead of asking questions. In performance reviews, leverage what’s working instead of critiquing what isn’t. The core of company culture boils down to relationships and communication.  | “The gift is supposed to represent the value you place on the relationship.” - John Ruhlin (click to tweet) Why is gift giving such a challenge? We know the people around us; we know their likes, their interests … but when we want to celebrate them, all great gift ideas go out the window. Amazon becomes our search engine. Wine and chocolates are a go-to. On today’s episode of Steal the Show, we are joined by John Ruhlin to unpack the performance of gift-giving. Yes, gift-giving is a performance--one that has true craft and technique. John is the founder of the Ruhlin Group, a company that develops relationship-building strategies and VIP-gifting programs to increase referrals and strengthen retention with their most important employees, clients, and prospects. John’s clients include the Chicago Cubs, San Antonio Spurs, DR Horton, Morgan Stanley, St. Louis Blues, and hundreds of other industry leaders and high-end service firms. His second bestselling book Giftology: The Art and Science of Using Gifts to Cut Through the Noise, Increase Referrals, and Strengthen Client Retention can be found  here Listen to today’s episode to hear John’s insights about gift-giving, and how we can best approach the often difficult task of finding that great gift for the people in our lives. “In business, we call it marketing. And we don’t realize we’re spending money to damage relationships because we’re making it all about us.” - John Ruhlin (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Marketing is typically not gift-giving because we make it about us. Don’t give gifts with a transactional mindset. Try to give gifts that people can use every day rather than those that are consumed and disappear. Treat gift-giving as an opportunity to inspire the recipient, rather than just hand off a possession. Understand what the recipient wants, and then align the gift with that.  | “All that matters is that you are delivering quality content that’s truly transformational and authentic to you.” - AJ Harper (click to tweet) A book is obviously different than a speech. But that’s not to say we can’t use the stage to test the ideas for our written work. \xa0When we lean too heavily towards one medium, we corner ourselves to the constraint of that delivery system. Instead, when we embrace all opportunities and let each speech or article inform what write or say next, we create that artistic synergy that audiences and readers latch onto. On today’s episode of Steal the Show, we are joined by AJ Harper. AJ is a developmental editor and publishing strategist who has helped hundreds of authors, from newbies to New York Times bestselling authors, write and publish game-changing books, develop significant and loyal followings, and build their brand. As executive editor for Collaborative Books, AJ has worked with Lisa Nichols, Les Brown, Barbara De Angelis, Dr. George Frazier, and many more. Listen to today’s episode to hear what AJ has to say about the speaking and writing mediums, so you can thoughtfully utilize each in your advancement as a thought leader. “Speaking is a very big part of developing the content for a book.” - AJ Harper (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Very few people have the skills to implement a message-based speech or book. When writing, use the word “you” to connect with the reader. Trying to make things clever usually results in things being more complicated. Simplicity comes with mastery over time. Write every day. It doesn’t matter how much, just keep a consistent habit. Use the stage as testing grounds for written content.     | “The more systematic you are about it—the faster you can increase fees, get more gigs, and turn this into a real business.” - Andrew Davis (click to tweet)  Between knowing what to charge and handling client relations, a workload can quickly become overwhelming before the actual work even starts. For the novice speaker, negotiating with event organizers and creating fair but profitable proposals can be a steep learning curve—one that can take serious time away from what the focus should actually be: the performance. That’s why on today’s episode of Steal The Show, we are joined by Andrew Davis to discuss his systems for bypassing these hurdles. After all, life doesn’t get in the way, it IS the way. Andrew has many credits to his name, all of which have helped him land big-time public speaking deals. He has written for Charles Kuralt, produced for NBC, and worked for The Muppets and MTV. And as one of the most influential marketers in the world, Andrew has appeared on The Today Show and in The New York Times. Tune in to today’s episode to learn his method of tracking his speeches and email inquiry, so that you can start to do the same and land stage time at exciting events and conferences. “Remember your business model isn’t their business model.” - Andrew Davis (click to tweet) Steal The Points  Be as systematic as possible with creative endeavors to allow for more creativity. Small business owners comprise one of the most engaged audience demographics for public speakers. Speeches should come from a place of vision, not “expert-ville.” Set fees based on the FEE Model: fame, entertainment, and expertise. Track your demand over time by aiming for a high loss-rate over a high close-rate. Accept free gigs as a way of testing material to get to that referrable speech faster.

However, there is still widespread ignorance about neurodiversity and relatively little discussion about it in our industry. My guest this week is Theo Smith, recruitment manager at The National Institute for Healthcare Excellence. Theo draws on personal experience and some in-depth research to share his insights into how and why companies should attract, include and retain a more neurodivergent workforce. In the interview, we discuss: • What is neurodiversity and how is it misunderstood • The challenges neurodivergent people face in the workplace • Empowering superhuman abilities • The importance of sharing stories. Theo also talks about the companies who are getting this right and shares his advice on the steps companies can take to improve the employee experience for neurodivergent people.

I always tell my clients that transformation is impossible without evaluation and strategy, but how do you build and measure an effective strategy in talent acquisition. My guest this week is Rebecca Carr, SVP of Global Success, Consulting and Strategy for SmartRecruiters. Rebecca talks in detail about the Hiring Success methodology and how it can help employers understand where they are now and where they need to be in the future. In the interview, we discuss: • Why the Hiring Success model was developed • How do you measure talent acquisition effectiveness • Reinventing legacy metrics • Key pillars and the 4 level maturity model • Strategic steps for transformation and improvement Rebecca also shares her thoughts on who is doing this well and what\'s next for talent acquisition. SmartRecruiters Hiring Success Podcast Subscribe to this podcast in Apple Podcasts | In recent times there has been an explosion in the number of conferences, webinars and indeed podcasts aimed at the talent acquisition audience. The kind of peer to peer learning these platforms are driving is incredibly useful and therefore, extremely popular. However, this only all works if there a steady flow of practitioners who are prepared to step up and share their story and I know this is something that many people find challenging. My guests this week are Audra Knight, senior manager of employer branding at Foundation Medicine and Katrina Kibben the founder and CEO of Three Ears Media. Audra and Katrina are both fantastic speakers who have some brilliant advice to share with anyone who either wants to get started or be better at speaking. In the interview, we discuss: • Why a talent acquisition professional would want to get involved with speaking • How to get started • How to find speaking opportunities • How to pitch to speak • Should speakers be paid? • How to prepare • Dealing with nerves • Most common speaking mistakes • The importance of preparation Audra and Katrina also talk about the favourite presentations they have given. Subscribe in Apple Podcasts \xa0 | Flexible working is a hot topic at the moment. Despite all of the recent publicity around companies moving to four day weeks and other flexible initiatives, the reality is that flexibility is nowhere near the norm in working life. I feel very strongly that there needs to be a fundamental change in the way we think about work. Too often, mental health and productivity are impacted by ways of working that are no longer relevant to the world in which we now live. My guest this week is someone who feels the same way. Anna Whitehouse is the founder of Mother Pukka, a digital community for people who happen to be parents. Anna is also the driving force behind Flex Appeal, a campaign which is lobbying both government and employers to drive a shift in thinking about flexible working. In the interview, we discuss: • What is Flex Appeal? • The huge benefits to employers of embracing flexible working • The need from a fundamental shift in the way we think about work • Evidencing increased productivity • Agile Working and Job Pairing • Leaving loudly • Why recruiting and HR should embrace transparency to promote flexible working Anna also talks about the future of Flex Appeal and shares her advice to individuals on the best way to persuade employers to let them work flexibly. Subscribe to this podcast on Apple Podcasts | My guest this week is Matthew Syed. Matthew was formerly the British table tennis number one and is now a journalist the best selling author of books such as "Bounce" and "Black Box Thinking". Matthew\'s new book, "Rebel Ideas" has just been published. In the book, he explores a topic that we\'ve looked at a few times on the show, the importance of diverse thinking in teams and organisations. In the interview, we discuss: • When and why diversity matters and how it contributes to success • Diversity of background, perspective and thinking • Rebel ideas that challenge, cross pollenate, diverge and augment. • An example of the CIA being individually perceptive but collectively blind • The danger of assimilation to the dominant assumptions of a business. Matthew also shares his advice for recruiters and suggest ways we can all have more rebel ideas Subscribe to this podcast in Apple Podcasts | Following on from my conversation with Megan Butler about the state of the market for AI in recruitment, for the second part of this mini-series explaining AI and Machine learning, we are taking a deep dive into the technology and terminology itself. My guest is Jon Krohn, Chief Data Scientist at recruiting technology company Untapt. Jon is also a lecturer, researcher and author in the field of machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. This interview goes into a huge amount of detail into the definitions and mechanics of AI (in an understandable way!) as well as exploring current and future applications for recruiting. In the interview, we discuss: • The role of a data scientist • AI and sorting the mail • Building predictive data models • Machine learning versus deep learning and how Siri got clever • Data engineering • Adoption and bias • Current and future applications of AI in recruiting  Subscribe to this podcast in Apple Podcasts | The role of AI and machine learning in recruiting technology continues to provoke both debate and confusion. What benefits do these technologies current bring and how much of the current narrative is just marketing spin? What will they make possible in the future, and what are the risks and dangers we need to be aware of right now? To help answer these questions, in the next two episodes of the show I\'ll be asking two genuine experts in AI for recruiting to share their knowledge. First up is Megan Butler, a research analyst in AI for HR. Megan was part of my live panel back in episode 200, so it is brilliant to have the chance to talk to her in more depth. In the interview, we discuss: • Is AI in recruiting what it is hyped up to be? • How to get the benefits and mitigate the risks • The fine line between analytics and machine learning • Matching and assessment • The importance of process • Bias Megan also shares her thoughts on the future of AI in recruiting and the importance of taking controlled risks. Subscribe to this podcast in Apple Podcasts | One thing that I\'ve noticed recently is the increasing traction behind the concept of talent experience. The reality is that employer brand, candidate experience and employee experience don\'t exist in silos when you are the employee experiencing them. So what can employers do to ensure the kind of joined-up thinking that creates a seamless talent experience and, at the same time, develops workplaces that prioritise belonging and inclusion? My guest this week is Charu Malhotra, a highly experienced global employer branding leader. In the interview, we discuss: • How employer branding is changing • Why EVPs tend to get overshadowed by other employer branding outputs • Joining up candidate experience, employee experience, employer brand and EVP • Moving culture and values from talk into action • Inclusion, belonging and psychological safety. • The importance of listening and two-way communication • The role of technology Subscribe to this podcast in Apple Podcasts \xa0 | After about 15 years worth of articles and conference presentations about Millennials I\'m sure I\'m not alone in finding generational stereotyping a bit annoying. However, research-based insights into changing attitudes to technology, work and careers are incredibly useful. My guest this week is Pranam Lipinski, Co-Founder and CEO of Door Of Clubs. Pranam has spent the last few years conducting research to uncover insights into the mindset of the newest generation in the workforce, Generation Z. In the interview, we discuss: • The validity of generational stereotypes • Smartphones in 4th grade and growing up in the era of fake news • Attitudes to work and careers • Inclusion, Stability and Loyalty • Providing unique employer experiences • Becoming an input focused as an employer • How to market to a generation that avoids commercial attempts on their attention. Pranam also talks about the importance of personalization and shares details of how to get his one-page Generation Z research summary.

My guest this week is someone who can give us a hiring manager\'s perspective from one of the most competitive locations in the world for this type of talent. Angie Jongejan is a Director of Sales for SurveyMonkey in San Mateo, California. It was great to hear her share some insights into SurveyMonkey\'s approach to recruiting and retention in their highly competitive talent market. In the interview, we discuss: • SurveyMonkey\'s three main recruiting challenges • The importance of providing a fantastic candidate experience • Ensuring alignment between the recruitment team and hiring managers • Sourcing jams • The role of surveys and acting on feedback Angie also shares her thoughts on what is next for SurveyMonkey.

Now, private companies are leading today’s “space race” and will help us enter a new era of growth—with satellites. In our season finale, we look toward the stars to see how the satellites of the future could help improve life here on Earth.\xa0We start in Washington State with Chris and Libie Cain, a husband and wife fishing team, whose albacore tuna business is strained by illegal fishing practices — one of the many problems that may soon be solved by satellites. Then, we talk to Mike Safyan, the V.P. of Launch at Planet Labs, a start-up that’s revolutionizing how satellites scan the Earth. Planet currently has over 150 satellites capturing data that it licenses to scientists and industry leaders who want the latest information on everything from forest fires to fish migratory patterns.

But what about your favorite shop around the corner or even the malls of your childhood? With the growing convenience and efficiency of online shopping come questions about the future of traditional retail. Are brick-and-mortar stores fated to crumble under the weight of the e-commerce boom? Or will online and traditional stores find ways to coexist?On this episode of the Ideas Podcast, we’re going to one place where the future of retail is already in full swing: Tokyo. Akira Ito, CEO of Itoya, takes us on a tour of the stationery company’s 115 year-old flagship location. As we explore Itoya’s twelve-story playground of paper, we learn how Japan’s oldest stationery company has continued to thrive by curating experiences that keep customers shopping in their store. Then, Masahiro Ito, an executive director at ZOZO, Japan’s largest online apparel retailer, brings us into a future where that personalized, face-to-face shopping experience will be replicated on the Internet.

But are markets overlooking some potential bad news? | In the future, we’ll all still need a place to live. But as rents continue to rise and the housing market changes, we might need to adjust our vision of home. Instead of living in a tiny, expensive apartment or funneling our savings into a down payment for a single-family home, we might choose to live together for the sake of space, money, and, above all else, community. This type of housing model, known as co-living, has existed throughout history, but new iterations of co-living are becoming real housing options for all different types of people across the globe. In this episode of \u200bIdeas,\xa0\u200bwe’re going to explore different versions of co-living to understand why it might help solve some of the housing market’s greatest challenges.We’ll start in London at The Collective: Old Oak, the world’s largest co-living complex, where young, mobile workforce is learning “how to have it all”—community, leisure, and an apartment in one of the world’s most expensive cities—by trading in personal space for communal luxuries. But, as history has shown, communal living isn’t just limited to one demographic. We’ll also travel to Portland, Oregon, for a tour of PDX Commons, a co-housing community for 55-year-olds and older, to see how some members of the Baby Boomer generation will participate in the housing market of the future and, simultaneously, combat some of the stigma attached to aging. Finally, we’ll make our last stop in Copenhagen, Denmark, where Almenr, a startup that matches co-living tenants with financial advisors, architects, and designers, is helping niche communities create the co-living spaces of their dreams. Along the way, we’ll hear from Richard Hill, the head of commercial real estate research a Morgan Stanley. He’ll explain some of the fundamental changes in the traditional housing market, the challenges within the current market, and why co-living might be a viable housing solution for all.The host Ashley Milne-Tyte is a contractor of Pineapple Street Media.\xa0\xa0The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.

These new vegetable breeds, all created by Row Seven Seed Company, are bursting with new flavors that come straight from the earth. But what about those wasabi seaweed snacks? Or something like beer chips? Or crazy ice cream flavors that seem to come from natural sources but are most-likely made in a lab? The flavor industry is worth billions of dollars, but with new technology, our changing environment, globalization, and a better understanding of how to invent new types of food, the future of flavor is being pulled in two very different directions. As different players the food industry invent new flavors, consumers will have to make new choices about what flavors they want: flavors from the farm or the lab.In this episode of the Ideas podcast, we explore these two different locations to understand the future of the flavor industry. First, we travel to the Fingerlakes region in upstate New York, where we’ll tag along with Michael Mazourek, a plant breeder and co-founder of Row Seven Seed, as he delivers his produce and spreads Row Seven’s mission: to change our agricultural system by breeding for flavor. We then head to a lab across the country in Portland, Oregon, where we’ll meet Sarah Masoni, a flavor designer with a “million dollar palate.” There, Sarah will tell us why the future of flavor isn’t as subjective as we might think. And, finally, we’ll hear from Vincent Sinisi, a food retail analyst at Morgan Stanley, about how both consumers and food retailers are creating new opportunities for both farm and lab-made flavors to appear on your supermarket shelves.The host Ashley Milne-Tyte is a contractor of Pineapple Street Media.\xa0The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.

Our world is made of plastic. It’s one of the most affordable, versatile and indestructible materials we have. But the very properties that make plastic perfect for so much have also made it problematic. Most of that plastic is still here, and it will be for hundreds of years. But in the future, we might be able to replace the plastic we’ve come to rely on with a plant-based material that holds all the promise of plastic, without the environmental costs. We\'re talking about something called "bioplastics."In this episode of the Ideas podcast, we take you to a laboratory in England to see these bioplastics in action. First, Vincent Andrews, Chemicals and Agriculture Equity Research Analyst at Morgan Stanley helps us understand how traditional plastic has become an integral part of both the economy and our daily lives. Next, Cole Rosengren, Senior Editor of \u200bWaste Dive \u200bexplains how a little-known international policy has thwarted our the recycling system as we know it. We then sit down with David Rachelson, the Vice President of Sustainability at Rubicon Global, a startup that connects plastics producers, consumers, haulers and cities to tackle some of the inefficiencies of the current recycling model. Finally, we travel to a laboratory in Southampton, where we meet Paul Mines, the CEO of Biome Technologies, a company that is using materials such as cornstarch, potatoes and algae to create a sustainable, compostable plastic of the future.\xa0\xa0The host Ashley Milne-Tyte is a contractor of Pineapple Street Media.

But the future is now, and the innovative transportation systems of today are surprising in their own right. The best among them are reimagining infrastructure design and project funding to get people moving across town and around the globe.\xa0In this second episode of the new season of the Ideas podcast, we head to a place where the future of transportation is already in motion: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. There, we ride a DART bus, one of the most advanced bus rapid transit systems in the world. Steven Higashide, Director of Research for TransitCenter, helps us understand the road blocks between U.S. cities and better public transit, and we learn from Sarah Kaufman, of the Rudin Center Transportation at NYU, about ways to move beyond ride sharing and fill the gaps that existing transportation can’t cover. Finally, Michael Zezas, Managing Director and Chief US Public Policy & Municipal Strategist at Morgan Stanley, helps us imagine a future of interconnected services—autonomous vehicles linking riders to mass transit on rails and roads—that respond creatively to the city’s existing infrastructure challenges.The host Ashley Milne-Tyte is a contractor of Pineapple Street Media.\xa0 The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.

The cashless economy is already starting to take shape, and as we continue to create innovative ways to exchange money without pulling out our wallets, cash might become a thing of the past. And while some countries struggle with questions of fairness and inclusivity as governments and businesses forgo cash, others have already stepped into a cashless future where digital transactions are the only way to pay.In this episode of the Ideas podcast, we travel to Sweden, a country where cash makes up just one percent of the entire economy.\xa0First, we hear from Charlie Warzel, a senior technology reporter at Buzzfeed News, who literally puts skin in the cashless game while on a trip to Stockholm and receives an RFID chip implant that allows him to pay for anything with his hand.\xa0We also follow Swedish journalist, Asa Secher, as she navigates her daily routine in a society that has already embraced a nearly-cashless economy. Next, we go to Lisa Servon, the chair of the City and Regional Planning Department at the University of Pennsylvania, to understand the potential impacts of going cashless here in the U.S.: who wins, who loses, and who gets left behind.\xa0And James Faucette, leader of Morgan Stanley’s Payments and US Comm Systems research efforts, explains what it takes for a country to go cashless, and how such a dramatic shift will affect more than just our bank accounts.The host Ashley Milne-Tyte is a contractor of Pineapple Street Media.\xa0Certain guest speakers may be\xa0neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC or its affiliates (“Morgan Stanley”).

But for many key players in today’s financial world, the future of climate action isn’t relegated to one week. At Morgan Stanley, there is a whole team of researchers and financial analysts dedicated to helping investors and consumers make environmentally-sustainable, lucrative financial decisions.\xa0In this bonus episode, we sit down for an exclusive interview with Jessica Alsford, Managing Director and the head of Morgan Stanley’s Sustainability Research team. Alsford reveals how environmental, social and governance factors -- or ESG -- impact the way businesses in every sector are thinking about the future of investing. But these aren’t just concerns for investors. Alsford explains why purchasing everything from a t-shirt to a tomato means climate change is not just an ESG issue, but an everybody issue.DISCLAIMERThe host Ashley Milne-Tyte is a contractor of Pineapple Street Media.\xa0The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.

If you don’t know the rules, it is practically impossible to win the game. In this first chapter of Money, People, Deal, Stefan shares the four fastest ways to profit in the real estate industry. In this chapter, you will discover why speed has won all battles throughout history: from the Roman Empire to Lawrence of Arabia’s tactics in the pre-Second-World-War. Speed and distance are the most powerful strategies on the business battlefield nowadays. The four fastest ways to profit, according to Aarnio are: Flipping real estate and joint ventures as limitless resources and the two fastest because of the abundance of real estate, local marketing/branding for other people and public speaking. “At any crossroads in life, there are always two paths: the common road and the road less traveled. When it comes to money, most people take the slow way by going to school, getting a good job, and saving for retirement. Like most people, I traveled on the slow road”.

Great entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Henry Ford and Donald Trump have all understood very clearly how to assemble Money, People and Deals together.

A chance meeting with Ludacris led to a recording contract, and opportunities to produce for stars like Chris Brown and 2 Chainz. The business deals Garrain made excluded him from the financial rewards of much of his work. Before long he was $200K in debt with nowhere to turn. Burnt out and discouraged, he quit the music industry and became homeless and attempted suicide as his life spiraled out of control. After committing to a massive overhaul of his lifestyle, Garrain spent four years building himself back up, defying the odds of failure that were against him.  Now a successful millionaire, he speaks and writes on how to undergo transformational life changes, and is an inspiration to those who feel like they have no options left.

A good man is the one who gets the job done, and sometimes this may require the use of strength and power. This is why a “nice man” can never be a leader, because it is a form of weakness. Men and women are always on the lookout for strong men to lead them. Women can do it, but they become masculine in the process. To lead the tribe is a masculine trait. In this chapter of Hard Times Create Strong Men, Stefan discusses the difference between what being a “good man” and a “nice man” is. The systems of power in our society may have changed over time and the need for strong men has decreased. However, the fact that physical power is no longer needed, does not mean that we don’t need our strong men in modern-day society.

He dropped out of High School at 17 and met his wife at the age of 18. He moved in with her to live in a little shack behind a Mobil home park for 5 years. He sacrifices his teens and 20's to work on his future instead of partying and having fun. He worked at a job making $8.50/hrs and was fortunate enough to buy over a small hair extension kiosk in the mall at the age of 20. Now, he's working 2 jobs, from the age of 20-27. He bought his first house at the age of 23 and got into real estate at the age of 27, without knowing anything about the real estate industry. Without any construction background, NO connections, NO Experience, NO Real Estate Vocab, NOTHING, he started out as a fix and flipper. It took him 6 months of hard work before he did his very first deal, making himself 50K NET in the process. After about 3 years of flipping, he had gotten to the point where he was pretty much tabbed out to buy any more. He was working 15-16 hours a day and realized that the reason he got into real estate was not just to make money but also to have time freedom. That is how he discovered wholesaling. He completely stopped the flipping game and went full time into wholesaling, making 28K on his first wholesale deal that took about 7-10 days to close. Now, he's doing about 250K/Month wholesaling houses virtually, working 2-3 hours/day! | What does it mean to be a man? A man’s purpose is his work and any man that shies away from work or doesn’t take his work seriously is… unmanly.

Achieving your labor of love may not be possible under your current circumstances, but with enough hard work and perseverance, anything is possible... “It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations There is no shame in taking a day job, especially if that work takes closer to your passion.

But failing can’t be the only thing he is good at since book publishers like McGraw-Hill Business, companies like Cisco Systems, Keck Medicine of USC and Salesforce, universities like USC, UCI, Cal Poly Pomona and ArtCenter College of Design, large media publications like Forbes, CMO, Fast Company, Fortune, Adweek, Entrepreneur, and hundreds of others, and more than 500,000 followers think otherwise. Leonard’s story began in 2010. He stopped paying his electricity bill for six months, had to shower in the dark, then was served an eviction notice. He thought he would spend the rest of his days living under a bridge until he called his mother who then called his grandmother, about how Leonard was about to be homeless. Surprisingly his grandmother took him back in (even though she originally disowned him when he was 16). According to his TEDx Talk, Why You Should Let Your Fears Guide You (recognized as a top TED Talk by Inc., Forbes and Mashable), by the end of 2011, he was so fed up with constantly failing year after year, that he wanted to end it all. Luckily for us, that didn’t happen. One thing Leonard does extremely well is within the niches of marketing people and professional development, most commonly referred to as personal branding. He holds workshops at companies, speaks at conferences, works hands-on with executives and entrepreneurs who run 8 figure+ businesses, provides consulting and teaches his craft through online courses.\xa0 Leonard also coauthored a book with his business partner at InfluenceTree, Ryan Foland, called Ditch the Act: Reveal the Surprising Power of the Real You for Greater Success and runs a weekly radio show called Grow Your Influence Tree, where he does free personal brand consulting live on the air. | What is wrong with masculinity in modern-day society? A generation of snowflakes raised by television and a lack of purpose in a world devoid of hardships has driven our culture meaningless and vicious. The lack of mentors and father figures has brought up men that are addicted to pornography and video games, and that lack the virtues of the great American heroes that led us through two World Wars and the Great Depression. The warrior spirit has succumbed to hedonism and become distracted away from the pursuit of his dreams. Thankfully, there is still a chance to do something about it... Hard times create strong men, and weak men create hard times. It is the inevitable cycle of life where great empires are built and destroyed. Unfortunately, millennials are currently living in the era of weak men that drown in ephemeral pleasure and limited desires.
