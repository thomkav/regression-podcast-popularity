This task might prove difficult for\xa0those representing districts that have supported the president in the past, like Democratic Congresswoman Elaine Luria from Virginia.Representative Luria joined Politics with Amy Walter to discuss why she decided to support the impeachment inquiry and the response she\'s received from constituents in a district that voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\xa0DC-based reporters Yamiche Alcindor\xa0of PBS and MSNBC and Rachael Bade\xa0of The Washington Post contextualize the ongoing impeachment proceedings. Tim Alberta from Politico chronicles the transformation of the Republican Party and historian Timothy Naftali demonstrates the role of bipartisanship during past impeachments.\xa0Amy\'s Final TakeThis week, we also got our first polls taken since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House was starting a formal impeachment inquiry. Here’s what they show: Even as support for impeachment has grown, opinions about how the president is doing his job are virtually unchanged. In other words, as we’ve seen over the last 2 plus years, voters are pretty locked into how they feel about this president and there’s nothing that has been able to alter that.\xa0This is different from what we saw back during the Nixon impeachment. Back then, as support for impeachment rose, Nixon’s approval rating dropped. While support for impeaching Trump is basically at the same point it was with Nixon in 1974, Trump’s job approval rating is 41 percent Nixon’s was just 25 percent.\xa0 It is a testament to just how much more polarized the electorate is today than it was 45 years ago. And, a reminder that even as more and more information about Trump’s interactions with Ukraine are revealed — much of it is getting to Americans through partisan, biased filters like social media and cable news - making it harder and harder for any sort of ‘consensus’ to be found either among members of Congress - or the electorate.\xa0And, we end up where we’ve been all along. A divided country, more deeply and firmly entrenched than ever. And, those who aren’t as politically engaged or aligned, struggling to make sense of it all.Opening music:\xa0I Think Like Midnight | U.S. Asylum Policy is Sending Migrants to Mexico, Where They Face Kidnapping, Assault and ViolenceThe Migrant Protection Protocols policy sends asylum seekers to Mexico to wait for their day in court.Can \'Joker\' Turn Internet Outrage into Box Office Success?The Takeaway speaks with Newsday’s Rafer Guzman and New York Magazine’s Alison Willmore about "Joker" and whether the outrage surrounding its release is overblown or justified.Other segments:Bahamas Continues Hurricane Dorian Recovery Efforts as Haitians Worry About their Future in the CountryIt has been one month since Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas.

"I have every reason to believe, that they have done everything by the book, and followed the law."The inquiry revolves around the Ukraine controversy, in which President Trump asked the Ukranian government to investigate political rival Joe Biden’s son.But at the center of this saga is a whistleblower report that the Trump Administration allegedly attempted to suppress. On Monday, the president told reporters his administration is trying to find out more about the whistleblower, saying his administration was "trying to find out about a whistleblower." Last week, Trump implicitly threatened the whistleblower, in\xa0leaked audio published by\xa0The\xa0L.A. Times,\xa0calling them a "spy.""The spies and treason — we used to handle it a little differently than we do now," Trump said.This public display by the President and others has brought about questions of the treatment of whistleblowers in both the public and private sectors. In many cases, whistleblowers face retaliation for speaking up about potential misconduct.Tom Mueller, journalist and author of the forthcoming book,\xa0Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud, joins\xa0The Takeaway to discuss the risks whistleblowers face when speaking out about state and corporate wrongdoings.But sometimes speaking up and blowing the whistle can save lives\xa0— and may be worth the risks. For two other Takeaway guests, moral and ethical dilemmas are not just abstract concepts. These are daily battles they have been going through since they first blew the whistle in their respective departments.Robert MacLean\xa0is\xa0a twice-fired TSA Federal Air Marshal, who blew the whistle on practices by the Department of Homeland Security back in 2003.\xa0MacLean\xa0found out the DHS would be cutting Federal Air Marshal personnel on long-distance flights that were at risk of terrorist attacks.Brandon Coleman\xa0is a former counselor with the Department of Veterans Affairs, who blew the whistle in 2015 about the lack of treatment for suicidal veterans within the VA. Coleman documented the VA’s neglect of suicidal veterans in Phoenix, who were often not being given necessary treatment. As a veteran himself, Coleman also found out VA staff were inappropriately accessing his own records. | How Should the Media Be Covering Impeachment?\xa0The latest Trump administration scandal has pushed the impeachment news cycle into overdrive, as mainstream media and right-wing outlets battle over control of the narrative.A Growing Catalog of Hate SymbolsThe Anti-Defamation League added 36 entries to its online catalog of extremist symbols, from logos of extremist groups to numbers that carry secret codes. | This week, President Donald Trump was accused of enlisting the President of Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Vice President Joe Biden. A whistleblower\'s complaint alleges that the White House tried to hide the transcript of the conversation between the two leaders.For many, the allegations leveled against President Trump this week broke the dam. Several Democrats from purple districts who previously had not supported impeachment decided to back an impeachment inquiry announced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday. Shortly after, an unclassified version of the whistleblower\'s\xa0complaint was released and the acting Director of National Intelligence went before Congress.\xa0Purple-district Democrat, Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, joined Politics with Amy Walter to discuss what changed his mind on the impeachment inquiry.\xa0 Guests:Representative Colin Allred, Democrat, Texas-32John Bresnahan, Congressional Bureau Chief for PoliticoMargaret Taylor,\xa0Senior Editor and Counsel at LawfareDoug Heye, Republican Strategist and CNN Contributor\xa0Joel Payne,\xa0Democratic Strategist and Former Aide to\xa0Harry Reid | The Changing Landscape of ImpeachmentToday, the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is testifying to Congress about the whistleblower complaint that started this all.What the Republicans Think About the Push for ImpeachmentThe Republican response to the latest news about Ukraine, the whistleblower complaint, and moves to impeach President Trump.The National Conversation Around Sexual Assault, One Year Since the Kavanaugh HearingsAna Maria Archila\'s confrontation of Senator Jeff Flake became a rallying cry for women across the country and still\xa0resonates a year later.\xa0 |  | More Democrats Call for Impeachment Amid Whistleblower ReportsTwo members of Congress join to discuss whether or not impeachment is inevitable.Athletes and Sexual Assault: Why Survivors Should be Centered in the ConversationIt is a tremendous risk for women to publicly come forward with their experiences of sexual assault.How Libraries Are Bridging the Digital DivideWhen people don’t have internet at home, or don\'t know how to use digital tools, they turn to their local libraries.Other segments:President Trump\'s Fraught Relationship with UkraineThere\'s a lot of confusion over what exactly Ukraine\'s role is.', 'chan_desc': 'A fresh alternative in daily news featuring critical conversations, live reports from the field, and listener participation.

Elizabeth Warren battle over whether the government ought to break up big tech.\xa0 With little appetite for Warren\'s big government intrusion or Zuckerberg\'s pathetic efforts to protect user privacy and free speech, Jim and Greg plan to enjoy watching these two liberals devour each other.\xa0 They also slam President Trump for cheerfully congratulating China on it\'s 70th anniversary since the communists took hold in 1949, making no reference to China\'s brutal repression of people and freedom that continues to this very day.\xa0 And they hammer the Washington Post for running an op-ed fantasizing about impeaching both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence so Nancy Pelosi can become president. | We\'re off to an all-crazy start in what promises to be a crazy week!\xa0 Jim Geraghty of National Review and Greg Corombos of Radio America throw up their hands as President Trump goes on a Twitter rant demanding House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff be investigated for treason and quoting allies suggesting that impeachment could lead to another civil war.\xa0 They also unload on Joe Biden and his campaign for demanding that the media stop interviewing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.\xa0 And they almost start to feel sorry for Hillary Clinton as she keeps talking about winning the popular vote and accusing Trump of being "an illegitimate president" almost three years after the election. | Jim Geraghty of National Review and Greg Corombos of Radio America are surprised to see prominent Trump critics David Brooks and John Kasich saying Democrats are moving way too quickly on impeachment.  They also get a big laugh out of New York Times podcast host Michael Barbaro demanding that people leave the children of political candidates alone - while specifically referring to 49-year-old Hunter Biden.

Meanwhile, the negotiations over the state budget are going down to the wire ahead of the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, and the prospects of enacting a budget and avoiding a state government shutdown don’t appear bright. The combination of those two storylines isn’t good news for Michigan’s economy. On today’s show, we hear from Charles Ballard, an economics professor at Michigan State University who has written extensively about the state’s economy. Ballard says the economics of a prolonged GM strike, coupled with a state government shutdown, would particularly hurt the Lansing region, which has a GM plant and is the state capitol. And it could definitely push Michigan back into recession for the first time in a decade. And Michigan’s economy hasn’t been doing all that great to begin with, Ballard says, with a major slowdown in the number of jobs created since 2017, and any economic gains mostly flowing to the top earners.

But as Mobb Deep took over the world, something was happening to Prodigy behind the scenes, a piece of his life set apart from his legendary lyricism and New York realness. A pain so excruciating it could make Prodigy feel like his bones were on fire; a pain that landed him in the Vegas hospital where he died last year.The Realness\xa0takes you behind Prodigy’s music to his life with sickle cell anemia, revealing how his condition touched almost every part of his life: from the sound of his rhymes to the circumstances of his death. | One day in February, a group of staff packed up Arnaldo\'s belongings, moved him out of Carlton Palms and into a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood. On its face, it\'s the type of setting disability advocates strive toward. Arnaldo has his own bedroom, more autonomy, a staff that looks after him.At the moment, Arnaldo is the only resident. He\'ll eventually share the house with two other men, but just days before the first is slated to join Arnaldo, he dies - under suspicious circumstances in the care of Carlton Palms. | For decades, Carlton Palms\' elusive founder, Ken Mazik, has wielded his power and influence to sway members of Congress and state legislatures into bending the rules in his favor\xa0--\xa0from scuttling laws that would limit the use of physical restraints, to securing permission from the state of Florida to amass a fortune in Medicaid funding.As one of his former employees told us, "Ken Mazik made millions of dollars tying up little kids." | A cup of hot water thrown on a developmentally-disabled resident. Another kicked in the ribs. A tooth knocked out by a staff member. Carlton Palms is known for abuse and even death. So why is the state of Florida so reluctant to close it? | A year and a half after the shooting, there are signs of trouble at Arnaldo\'s new home, Carlton Palms. The staff isn\'t keeping an eye on him. There are unexplained injuries. His mother isn\'t allowed to see his room and he\'s being restrained in a full-body mat for getting out of bed at night.And yet, his family continues to hold out hope that this is the right place for him. | The day of the shooting wasn\'t Arnaldo\'s first encounter with the police. In fact, they\'d loomed large in his life for years before that. Even as he bounced from one group home to another, the people that consistently showed up for him, often in the worst way, were the cops.\xa0(Aneri Pattani)\xa0 | Since the beginning, Arnaldo\'s mother struggled to find adequate care for her autistic son. Her memories are often painful: the doctors who wouldn\'t diagnose him; the staff who punched him, drugged him, tied his hands behind his back in a classroom chair.These early experiences shaped Arnaldo. In this episode, we talk with a number of people who\'ve cared for him. They recount a sweet, affectionate young man who was also capable of violent outbursts and fits of rage.Hidden beneath Arnaldo\'s story is a disability-services system starved of funding; facilities trying to squeeze every dollar out of their residents; and staff members willing to restrain their clients by any means necessary. | The shooting left Arnaldo severely traumatized, unable to remain in the group home where Charles Kinsey had taken care of him. Shortly after, Arnaldo was involuntarily committed to a hospital psych ward, where a typical stay of just a few days stretched into well over a month as the state of Florida struggled to find a new home for him.Eventually, Arnaldo finds himself in a new facility with a well-documented track record of abuse and neglect. It\'s Halloween when we first meet Arnaldo face to face. Ironically, after everything he\'s endured, the staff have dressed him in a police costume. | Just before 5pm on Monday July 18th, 2016, a 26-year old autistic man named Arnaldo Rios Soto walked out of his North Miami home. He had a silver toy truck in his hand. Hours later, his life would be changed forever.A passing motorist mistook Arnaldo\'s toy for a gun and called 911. Police and SWAT arrived and the confrontation was captured in a cell phone video. The encounter left Arnaldo\'s behavioral aide - a black man named Charles Kinsey - severely wounded, and it left Arnaldo in need of round-the-clock care.As a result, three police officers lost their jobs, including the now-former North Miami chief of police, Gary Eugene. In his words: "We blew it."\xa0Thank you to Sara Luterman of NOS Magazine and reporter Eric Garcia for pointing us to Arnaldo\'s story.

Essa é a média do governo Jair Bolsonaro até agora. Desde a posse, já caíram quatro ministros e 31 funcionários de segundo escalão. Parte das demissões está ligada ao alinhamento ideológico com o governo. Até hoje, ninguém foi afastado por causa de denúncias de corrupção. Quais os critérios para as demissões no governo? Que áreas foram mais afetadas? Quais são as consequências políticas dessas demissões? O repórter Daniel Gulino, que cobre o dia a dia doPalácio do Planalto em Brasília, e o editor de País, Thiago Prado, analisam o tema. | Tendência no mundo inteiro, as assistentes de voz residenciais estão chegando ao Brasil, falando português. Nesta quinta-feira, a Amazon anunciou o lançamento da sua assistente, Alexa, em versão brasileira. Nos Estados Unidos, 1 em cada 4 americanos usa assistente virtual. Analistas estimam que neste ano o mercado chegue a quase 200 milhões de unidades vendidas, uma alta de 82% em relação a 2018. Como funcionam os assistentes virtuais? Qual o potencial econômico desse mercado? É seguro usar essa tecnologia? Esses são os temas do Ao Ponto de hoje, com repórteres de economia Sergio Matsuura e Rennan Setti e o colunista Pedro Doria. | Diante das divergências entre os ministros do Supremo Tribunal Federal, o presidente da Corte, Dias Tóffoli, adiou a votação sobre o alcance da decisão que pode anular sentenças da Operação Lava-Jato. Os juizes chegaram ao entendimento que réus delatados têm o direito de fazer suas alegações finais depois dos réus delatores. A dúvida agora é se isso vai valer para outros processos em que já houve condenações. O ministro Dias Tóffoli propôs critérios de ajuste para esses casos.  Quais votos devem ser decisivos? Quais são os possíveis cenários e seus impactos sobre os réus da Lava-Jato? E o ex-presidente Lula pode ser beneficiado? A repórter Carolina Brígido e o diretor da sucursal de Brasília, Paulo Celso Pereira, analisam. | Até 2023, o governo federal pretende implantar 216 escolas cívico-militares em todo o país, administradas em parcerias com Polícia Militar ou Corpo de Bombeiros. Ontem o Planalto anunciou que 15 estados e o Distrito Federal aderiram ao programa, lançado no mês passado. A gestão compartilhada entre civis e militares deve ser implementada em 54 escolas já no próximo ano. O custo é elevado, R$ 1 milhão por escola, e especialistas fazem críticas à eficácia do modelo. Afinal, como vai funcionar o projeto? Quais os prós e contras? O desempenho de alunos escolas militares é superior? De onde virão os recursos para o projeto? No Ao Ponto de hoje, a repórter Renata Mariz, da sucursal de Brasília, e o colunista Antônio Gois, especializado em educação, discutem o tema. | Preso desde o dia 7 de abril do ano passado, o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva já cumpriu os requisitos para ter direito a deixar a prisão durante o dia. Sua defesa, no entanto, rejeita a progressão de regime. Ontem, após uma longa reunião com Lula, seus advogados leram uma carta em que o ex-presidente diz que não aceita "barganha". O Ministério Público Federal, por sua vez, solicitou à Justiça que Lula passe a cumprir pena em regime semiaberto. A decisão caberá à juiza Carolina Lebbos, da Vara de Execuções Penais.Qual a estratégia da defesa de Lula nesse caso? Por que o Ministério Público é a favor da progressão? Que decisões do Supremo Tribunal Federal ainda podem afetar a Lava-Jato? Como está o clima na Corte em relação à Operação? O repórter Sergio Roxo, da sucursal de São Paulo, e o coordenador em Brasília, Francisco Leali, analisam as últimas notícias sobre o ex-presidente. | Mais Israel, menos Nordeste. Mais esquerda, menos direita. Mais nióbio e grafeno que Amazônia. Quais são as palavras mais usadas pelo presidente em seus discursos desde a posse? As repórteres Janaína Figueiredo e Maiá Menezes contam como garimparam os termos corriqueiros nos pronunciamentos oficias de  Jair Bolsonaro. E analisam a estratégia por trás dessas escolhas. | Cem dias após comandar o primeiro treino do Flamengo, o técnico Jorge Jesus acumula 12 vitórias, quatro empates e duas derrotas. Um aproveitamento de 74%. O time vem de oito vitórias consecutivas no Campeonato Brasileiro e tem 100% de aproveitamento como mandante. O que o Flamengo de Jesus tem de diferente? O que mudou após a chegada do técnico português? O repórter Diogo Dantas, que cobre o dia a dia do clube, e o editor de Esportes, Marvio dos Anjos, contam quais são os segredos do sucesso do time, e quais são os desafios no caminho de possíveis títulos, no Brasileiro e da Libertadores. | A história do Rock in Rio começa em 1985, com a antológica primeira edição do festival. De lá pra cá, muitas lendas surgiram. Algumas fruto da imaginação. Outras, nem tanto. O que é mito e o que é fato na história do festival? O idealizador do Rock in Rio, o empresário Roberto Medina, passa em revista histórias saborosas nessa trajetória de mais de três décadas. Já o editor assistente Bernardo Araújo conta o que o público pode esperar desta edição e revela e histórias dos bastidores da cobertura do Rock in Rio. | "Ainda mais que vou comer um podrão", disse Jair Bolsonaro para a repórter do GLOBO Jussara Soares, em Nova York. Horas depois de seu primeiro discurso na abertura da Assembleia Geral da ONU, o presidente brasileiro parecia bem humorado. Abordado no hall do hotel onde se hospedou, ele avaliou que seu discurso tinha sido "objetivo e contundente", mas não agressivo. Analistas e diplomatas, no entanto, consideram que Bolsonaro perdeu uma oportunidade de construir pontes nas Nações Unidas, com uma fala ideológica e voltada para o público interno. Por outro lado, acenou aos investidores estrangeiros, ao dizer que pretende "reconquistar a confiança do mundo". Jussara e o colunista Guga Chacra trazem os bastidores da participação de Bolsonaro na ONU e a repercussão do discurso no círculo próximo ao presidente e em âmbito mundial. | O colunista Bernardo Mello Franco e o repórter Paulo Cappelli analisam os desdobramentos da morte de Ágatha Félix , de 8 anos, atingida por uma bala perdida no Complexo do Alemão, no Rio de Janeiro. Antes do crime, o governo de Wilson Witzel vinha preparando uma cartilha, com orientações para que moradores de comunidades se protejam durante confrontos, a fim de intensificar o número de operações policiais. No Congresso, o grupo de trabalho que analisa o pacote anticrime, do ministro da Justiça, Sergio Moro, analisa a proposta de excludente de ilicitude, que prevê a possibilidade de absolvição de policiais que atuem "sob escusável medo, surpresa ou violenta emoção".

All six party leaders will be on stage — including Maxime Bernier. The two-hour live debate will be divided into five segments, each with their own theme: affordability, environment and energy, Indigenous issues, leadership and Canada on the world stage, and lastly, polarization, human rights and immigration.Co-host Amanda Connolly is back with another special episode from the Parliamentary bureau. She’s joined by communications strategist Barry McLoughlin, who has worked with Canadian leaders across the political spectrum, to discuss how party leaders prepare for these debates. She also talks to Global’s chief political correspondent David Akin on the hot topics to watch for tonight. | The transition from high school to whatever comes next is always hard . . . and it’s been that way, for as long as we can remember. But the generation of kids in high school now, and those who’ve just entered the next phase of their lives feel like they’re especially underprepared to make this transition.Host Tamara Khandaker is joined by Global’s lifestyle reporters Meghan Collie and Laura Hensley to discuss their four-part series about the transition between high school and “the real world” — whether that's college, university, the workforce or something completely different. Failure To Launch examines the gaps in Canada's education system. | Health care is a top election issue for Canadians. A poll conducted on behalf of Global News found that for 37 per cent of respondents name it among the top three issues in deciding whom they’ll vote for in the upcoming federal election. So it makes sense that almost all the major parties have made health care a priority in this campaign.Host Tamara Khandaker is joined by Global’s politics reporter Rachel Browne to take you\xa0 through all the major parties’ promises on health care, and help make sense of it all. | On Tuesday night, Canadians were supposed to get an election debate devoted to foreign policy. We haven’t heard much about foreign policy at all in this campaign, with most of the conversation focusing on topics like affordability, health care, and climate change. Three party leaders agreed to attend, but the debate was canceled by organizers when Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau refused to participate.What’s at stake when we neglect to talk about foreign policy during an election campaign? Host Tamara Khandaker discusses with Bessma Momani, a professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Waterloo. They deliver a primer on some of the issues that seem to be on the back burner right now. | WeWork, a shared-workspace company with rentals available around the world, withdrew its IPO on Monday amidst concerns about the startup’s governance and business model, and its ability to turn a profit.

He recently wrote a profile about Adam Neuman, and is going to walk us through the story of WeWork from its very start, to where the company finds itself today.\xa0 | Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced his party’s platform on Sunday during an Ontario campaign stop. And while a lot of the platform had been coming out bit by bit over the last couple of weeks, including promises on things like climate change and home buying, there were some new items worth talking about today.Global’s Parliamentary bureau is back with a deep-dive into that platform. Co-host Amanda Connolly is joined by Global National correspondent Mike Le Couteur. They dissect what the Liberals are promising, how much will it cost, and what’s in it for you. | In the spring of 2018, a rented van barrelled down a busy street in Toronto, mowing down pedestrians. Ten people died in that attack, and eight of those killed were women. The man accused in that attack, Alek Minassian, faces 10 counts of murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. He hasn’t entered a plea yet or been found guilty in a court of law.\xa0Late last night, videotaped footage of the police interrogation that took place just hours after the attack was released. In the video, Minassian references his connection to the incel community and calls his alleged attack a “day of retribution.”Host Tamara Khandaker walks through the tape with Global’s investigative journalist Andrew Russell. She also talks to Stephanie Carvin, a national security expert and a professor at Carleton University, about what people in the national security space are making of this video — and what we can take away from it. | Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg completed her 15-day voyage on an emission-free sailboat to attend a climate summit at the United Nations earlier this week. The 16-year-old delivered an impassioned speech that made international headlines. And on Friday, she’s scheduled to attend the Montreal climate change march, which Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May are also expected to attend.Thunberg has inspired a ton of think pieces, been all over the media, and just yesterday won what’s known as the “Alternative Nobel Prize.” But not all the attention has been good . . . and a lot of the criticism she’s faced have been personal attacks.Host Tamara Khandaker talks to Amanda Marcotte, a senior politics writer for Salon. They discuss why Thunberg isn’t the only women in the fight against climate change who deals with this kind of criticism, and what is it about her and others like her that inspire such visceral reactions. | Today, a full, unedited conversation between Global's Dawna Friesen and Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau. In Trudeau's first interview since the blackface controversy, they discuss not only those incidents, but also the Liberals' platform, touching on everything to the opioid crisis to their climate policy. | A scandal that’s been brewing in Washington DC for over a week has culminated in the House of Representatives launching an official impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.
