Thanks Christian. I’ve had several emails back and forth with Christian.\xa0 His English is very good. Through the emails I’ve learned a little about his life and horsemanship in Germany. He gave me permission to share some of his story. Horsemanship in Germany is different.\xa0 According to Christian,\xa0 women and girls dominate the horse industry. Now, I\'m not saying that like it\'s a bad thing, only to show that\xa0Christian had a few more hurdles to get to where he is today.\xa0 His family was not wealthy, either.\xa0 For him to pursue his passion for horses as a teenager was definitively a challenge. And, when you pursue a dream, sometimes luck has a way of finding you too.\xa0 After college, Christian worked for an international company that sent him to their plant in Evanston, Wyoming.\xa0 While there he visited a ranch where he found himself on the back of a horse once again.

It can be about anything - your favorite trainer, your biggest "ah ha" moment, or the story of your horse.\xa0 Email to John@WhoaPodcast.com\xa0and I\'ll do the rest.  Hi John, I discovered your podcast recently, and thanks to an 11 hour drive that day, got to listen through for most of the trip. I thought I’d share with you a story, whether you’ll read it or have any interest in it, I have no idea. But perhaps there’s a piece of it you may want to\xa0share with someone that needs inspiration. My story is about coming back from an injury and redefining myself as a horse(wo)man in the wake of an accident. I’m 32 years old, and my horsemanship background is a little unique. I grew up very poor, in a family that did not (nor was able to) support my passion for horses, but I always found a way to be around them. Occasional rides on friends horses, hanging around barns to work for rides, and devouring every book I could get my hands on eventually found me with the opportunity to exercise a backyard horse for my teenage years, and then through good grades and good fortune I was able to go on to college for Equine Business, eventually changing to Agricultural Business Management, and ride on an IHSA team. This college program was really the foundation of my formal riding education, even though I’d spent years researching and learning through trial and error on my own. I went on to manage a summer horse camp, trail and lesson program, eventually building a show program. After graduating college, I moved on to a career outside the industry but continued to coach an Interscholastic Equestrian Program team, lead a 4H club, and teach lessons on the side. It was exhausting but deeply fulfilling. As my outside career progressed, I pulled back from teaching, and spent a few years on the paying side of the industry, leasing a horse, riding with a trainer, and competing in the jumpers. I had a lot of fun being the customer, but I found myself slightly unfulfilled in that role. Along came marriage and a baby, and another job change, and I pulled back even farther. After having my daughter I gave lessons again occasionally at another barn, but I felt more and more disconnected. As I closed in on my daughter’s first birthday, I was lessoning and leasing half-heartedly, and I had just made the decision to begin pursuing an MBA along with my full-time career. Three weeks before my daughter turned one, and five before the start of my MBA program, I was letting a young horse catch his breath after a warm up, when a car pulled into the parking lot. I remember the blinding flash of light as the sun hit the windshield just right; the mane disappearing out from underneath me, and then the realization that I could not get up. Throughout the ambulance ride, I was certain it couldn’t be anything serious, but as I lay in the ER, I overheard the diagnosis over the nurse’s radio, and I vowed then and there\xa0I was done riding. I had broken my pelvis in four places, including the base of my spine. After surgery, it was six days in the hospital before I could l lift myself out of bed. By the time I got home, the shock had worn off, and the first thing I did was rope a friend into driving me back to a barn. My daughter learned to walk by holding onto my crutches, and within a few months I was able to drag myself onto a mounting block and onto a horse. That’s when the real pain started. Physically I was fine, secured with plenty of hardware. Mentally, though, I was broken. Trying to push through riding, I began having panic attacks, nightmares, anxiety, and eventually depression. The thing I loved most in life had become a source of fear and pain. For anyone who has ever been in this place, here’s what you need to know: this story can have a happy ending. It takes perseverance, pro-activeness, and self-advocacy.  Do not worry about anyone else but yourself. I have always been very conscious of the feelings of others, so this was hard. The first and hardest thing I had to do was leave the barn where the accident had happened and ride somewhere else. As much as I didn’t want to hurt the feelings of the trainer, or risk damaging their reputation in any way (especially since it was in no way her fault), being in the same atmosphere was too much for me. I moved back to a barn I had ridden at earlier in the area and had always felt safe, and got a few rides under my belt, and slowly started to feel progress. Don’t expect your progress to be linear. I would make progress and then have setbacks. Within my first half dozen rides, I sat a few small spooks, that set me back, and each time I wondered if I should just give up. If I would go too long between rides, I would start to\xa0wonder if I would have the nerve to get back on. These setbacks became fewer and farther between over time, and less impactful. Surround yourself with cheerleaders, whatever that takes. I am so fortunate to have a lot of good horse people in my life, that I’ve accumulated from my various adventures. Every time I felt like I couldn’t do it, I reached out to one of them, and they cheered me on from every corner. Their belief in me sometimes is all that pushed me forward. I didn’t want to let them down as much as I didn’t want to let myself down. Remember why you fell in love\xa0in the first place. Despite the progress I was making, I was still struggling. About 9 months after the accident, I had the opportunity to travel to Arizona for school, and decided on a whim to spend two extra days there, by myself, at a dude ranch. By good fortune, the one I found on google was just reopening, so I got a lot of one on one time with the wranglers there. By the second day, I was loping through the desert, and doing some team penning with the other guests. The spark had been reignited. Find something that makes you hungry to keep going. I came home from Arizona, and after riding hunter jumpers for most of my adult life, I went at the recommendation of a friend and took a reining lesson. In the first fifteen minutes I found myself laughing for the first time in a very long time, and by the end of the hour I was hooked. I haven’t looked back. Around the same time, I stumbled across the documentary “Down the Fence,” and as corny as it sounds, it changed my life. It fueled a new fire, stronger than ever. I knew it was the challenge that I needed. I watched it again, and again, and started making phone calls. I now own two quarter horses, riding several times a week at multiple places, reining and working cows. While wrapping up my MBA is still taking a good chunk of my time, I plan to compete this coming year.  Most importantly, my now two-year-old daughter has fallen in love with horses and riding\xa0as well. I don’t struggle to get out of bed. I’m back and more determined and focused than I’ve ever been. My next goal in life is to meet Doug Williamson, and while I don’t know how I’m going to do that yet, I’m sure that I’ll make it happen. Watching him tell his story, the challenges he’d faced, and his straightforward determination changed the way I thought of myself. I know there have been many who were not as fortunate as I have been, to be able to\xa0return from an injury. At\xa0the same time, there have been others who have had it so much worse than I and didn’t let it stop them from pursuing their dreams. To steal the phrase from Doug, I’ve been given the chance to ride a few more good horses, and I don’t intend to waste a minute of it.

If you look up the words "vesicular" and "stomatitis" on Google, you\'ll find vesicular means blister.\xa0 Stomatitis is an inflammation of the mouth.\xa0 Vesicular stomatitis usually presents in horses with blisters in the mouth, lips, and coronary bands.\xa0 The disease spreads several ways, but most commonly through flies and mosquitos.\xa0 Some of those flies can move 150 miles in a day.\xa0 I wasn\'t able to find a good answer about a vaccine for VSV.\xa0 It is a summer disease and spreads up from the gulf in Texas. Dr. Tolley gives us the details on vesicular stomatitis.\xa0 He talks about suspected origins and why the Federal government keeps a close eye on the number and location of animals affected.\xa0 Good horse-keeping practices and staying away from horses afflicted with the disease are currently\xa0the main preventative measures.

Let me tell you about a recent rabbit hole I followed. A notification arrived from YouTube telling me that the Clinton Anderson Channel posted a new video.\xa0 Often I don\'t have\xa0an opportunity to\xa0check them out. I spend much of my YouTube viewing time watching audio or video editing tutorials. The title of this video caught my eye, it was something like Natural Horsemanship vs Real or competitive horsemanship.\xa0 I\'m not sure why, when I went to check on the exact title for this podcast, it was no longer available less than a week later. (https://youtu.be/H37xLVxINQQ\xa0) In it Clinton was comparing natural horsemanship to the horsemanship you need to have in the competitive arena.\xa0 Now, he wasn\'t running natural horsemanship down, but he wasn\'t talking about it in glowing terms either.\xa0 This series of videos that Clinton produces I believe is meant to inspire and I think he was trying to motivate his followers, of which I am one, to step up their horsemanship.\xa0 This wasn\'t the first time I had heard the term natural horsemanship used as almost a negative term. When I thought about this, I could not remember where I first heard the term.\xa0 It had to be around 2005 when my cable service picked up RFD-TV and they had a two-hour block of horse training shows.\xa0 I remember, thinking highly of the term natural horsemanship.\xa0 I didn\'t know what it meant, except perhaps working with what came natural to the horse.\xa0 But, I knew it was approaching the horse differently, and I very much needed a different approach. More Investigation of Natural Horsemanship From Clintons video, I went to Google and typed in the term.\xa0 There was a slew of articles about the topic.\xa0 One trainer stating emphatically her method was NOT natural horsemanship.\xa0 I read her reasoning, and it kinda made sense.\xa0 I won\'t try to explain it here, I\'ll just muck it up.\xa0 If you would like to read her explanation go here: The Willing Equine There was a link to Wikipedia.\xa0 I read on.\xa0 The complaints about natural horsemanship are:\xa0 It is not new or unique.\xa0 True, people have been using the techniques for a while.\xa0 It is\xa0 over-marketed.\xa0 Again, that\'s true.\xa0 As with anything being sold, let the buyer beware.\xa0 I was thankful the term came along because it lead me to believe there was another way.\xa0 That there was a better way to communicate to the horse what I needed him to do.\xa0 It was a starting point to learn from.\xa0 It was a suggestion that much more could be gained than I was getting from my horse. I hung around this search page for a while reading different opinions, when I came across an article written by Tom Moates, The Myth of Natural Horsemanship.\xa0 Now, here was a name I recognized.\xa0 Tom had been on the show.\xa0 It\'s a good one, I recommend you listen.\xa0 Here\'s the link:\xa0 \xa0Tom Moates on the Whoa Podcast. Tom Moates on Natural Horsemanship In his article, Tom says natural horsemanship casts a wide net that at most means very little and likely means nothing at all.\xa0 Parelli coined it in a book he wrote (although I doubt that is the first use of the term) and the public latched on.\xa0 Tom breaks down the main issues he has with the term natural horsemanship one by one and does a fine job of supporting his hypothesis.\xa0 He concludes "that natural horsemanship is if anything\xa0a shift in the language of horsemanship. How people change the language of horsemanship at large and share ideas as an attempt to impart ways of improving the horse/human relationship is where some consistency may be found under this heading.\xa0 But the frequent application of the term "natural horsemanship" to all kinds of people and methods muddies the waters." The term has been around for a long time now.\xa0 I am thankful it came around and got me thinking about different ways to interact with my horse even though I may not have been able to tell you exactly what was natural about what I was doing.\xa0 Terms - labels- of any kind, if one tries to define them exactly, can be extremely confining and limiting if you keep them that way.\xa0 For me, natural horsemanship, is just one of the many stepping stones I needed to learn to get me across that river of knowledge dealing with horses.

Earlier in the season as people looked for answers, an article in the Paulick Report, and racing magazine, journalist Natalie Voss looked into the possibility that the drug bisphosphonate was a factor. Jeff Goertzen of the Southern California News Group wrote a good article explaining horse racing fatalities at Santa Anita (published in the Mercury News June 30. 2019) Talk to an Expert Natalie Voss has been a journalist in the equine industry for years.\xa0 she is the features editor for the Paulick Report and also has bylines in Chronicle of the Horse, The Horse magazine, The Blood-Horse, Quarter Horse News, American Racehorse among others.\xa0 She has won journalism awards for her writing in the racehorse industry.\xa0 When I requested an interview, she was quick to respond.\xa0 She speaks clearly\xa0in a language laypeople can understand.\xa0 She has a love of horses and cares about her industry.\xa0 Her insights into the horse racing fatalities were invaluable to producing this episode.

Mary Ann developed her philosophy of relationship based horsemanship because she feels people need to be honest to the horse.\xa0 She tells people, "Your outside needs to match your inside".\xa0 Sometimes, she says, people have the belief that they must dominate their horse, even if they don\'t have a dominate personality.\xa0 According to relationship based horsemanship, it\'s okay to be who you really are.\xa0 And, Mary Ann tells us the horses really respond to this honesty.\xa0 \xa0 Check Out Relationship Based Horsemanship with Mary Ann Brewer Her company has several programs.\xa0 visit InTheCompanyofHorses.com At\xa0MaryAnnBrewer.com you\'ll find Mary Ann\'s horsemanship and mentoring programs.\xa0 To talk to her directly, call (609) 330-2444 or email her at\xa0Maryann@maryannbrewer.com Join Us on this Journey We want you to be a part of the show.\xa0 Tell us about your horse.\xa0 Share your challenges, triumphs, or just everyday items that make horse ownership unique.\xa0 Create an audio file using the memo app on your phone.\xa0 Or, contact me and we\'ll set up a time to talk by Skype or phone.\xa0 Perhaps what you have to share can help someone in THEIR horse journey.

Progress? Well, it\'s difficult to tell.\xa0 The vet stated that her lameness score went from a "3" to a "2".\xa0 The doctor wanted us to move forward to the MRI.\xa0 Jessie is an aged horse not used in competition.\xa0 We enjoy trail riding and trail trials.\xa0 We generally\xa0do both activities at a walk.\xa0 There is no guarantee the MRI would provide a definitive diagnosis.\xa0 The most prudent approach seems to enjoy her for as long as we are able.\xa0 I suppose we could breed her.\xa0 She has good bloodlines, a good mind, and the lameness is a genetic defect.\xa0 It\'s something to consider. For now, we have changed her medication from Bute to\xa0Equioxx.\xa0 I\'ll still take her out for exercise 3-5 times a week.\xa0 If she doesn\'t improve, I may try swim therapy.\xa0 There is a place in town that offers it may help. I\'ll keep you updated on our progress.

We are encouraging all those participating to use any/all of these colors for your sweater. We are asking\xa0#bipocdyers\xa0to use these colors to create your inspired colorways for this KAL/CAL.

Finally got our answer to "how much sunscreen is enough?" Answer: 7 days, 2 people, 3 spray sunscreens (plus something for face). Rashguard and hats are a must.   Traveling with own water bottle was great. Dan and I filled with ice and water at breakfast lunch and dinner to always have water with us. I brought small container dish soap and cleaned in room with a face cloth.   Have a pen handy for immigration and custom forms. Pack an extra for a friend too!

It\'s fun when its a game and a good way to learn more about what my body actually needs.

After a long and arduous Hogaak summer, the metagame has finally slowed enough to potentially reward a strategy of flooding the battlefield with green permanents. Core 2020\'s Leyline of Abundance has been waiting in the wings, offering explosive starts with mana dorks, as well as a few sneaky infinite combos. Also, did somebody say two free pips for Nykthos? The crew breaks down fresh new takes on Leyline Combo, Unbound Flourishing, and Green Devotion. \xa0Plus: a host of spicy previews from Throne of Eldraine, including bonus decklists!\xa0\xa0\xa0Roundup: Niv-Mizzet Takes Flight\xa0\xa0\xa0It was a big week for Niv-Mizzet Reborn, as this Faithless Brewing Original has officially ascended to Tier 2 status (at least, according to the wise sages at the Arena Decklists Podcast). But don\'t just take their word for it.

Not all is lost, however: the Saffi combo proved strong enough to possibly become its own version of the deck, and Emry, Lurker of the Loch means that help is on the way for dedicated Kethis Kombo.\xa0\xa0\xa0Project Keth-eX: 3-7 practice matches, curve felt too slow, Kethis combo less well integrated than Saffi combo\xa0\xa0\xa0Kethis "KCI" (Matt Nass, test deck): 0-5 practice matches, deck folded to everything, mana was horrendous\xa0\xa0\xa0Emry Kethis Combo (Sam Black, test deck)\xa0\xa0\xa0"Hogaak-less Hogaak" (test deck): re-built for speed and to maximize Saffi combo, with potential for turn 2 kill (Carrion Feeder -> Stitcher\'s Supplier into Unearth on Renegade Rallier, return Saffi, attack for lethal).\xa0\xa0\xa0Throne of Eldraine Previews\xa0\xa0\xa0Specter\'s Shriek (Bonus list: BW Processor Eldrazi) -- Bonecrusher Giant (Bonus list: Bonecrusher Kiora) -- Grumgully, the Generous (Bonus list: Grumgully Goblins) -- Torbran, Thane of Red Fell -- Drown in the Loch -- Faeburrow Elder -- Merchant of the Vale (Haggle) -- Irencrag Feat -- Fires of Invention -- Vantress Gargoyle -- The Magic Mirror -- The Cauldron of Eternity -- Witching Well -- Oko, Thief of Crowns (Bonus list: Faerie Foodies)\xa0\xa0Brew Session: Leyline of Abundance\xa0\xa0\xa0Sketch #1: GW Leyline Elves\xa0\xa0\xa0Sketch #2: Unbound Flourishing\xa0\xa0\xa0Sketch #3: Nissa Devotion\xa0\xa0\xa0Sketch #4: Genesis Wave (designed by u/Cube_)\xa0\xa0\xa0Reference lists:\xa0\xa0\xa0Leyline Combo (PVDDR, test deck)\xa0\xa0\xa0Leyline Combo 2 (PVDDR, test deck)\xa0\xa0\xa0Devoted Elves (tagosaku, 5-0 league)\xa0\xa0\xa0Bant Abundance (Jon Stern, MC Barcelona; Jeremie Ross, 5-0 league)\xa0\xa0\xa0Steel Leaf Stompy (Ryan Robinson, 1st place SCG IQ)\xa0\xa0Contact Us\xa0Twitter: @FaithlessMTG\xa0Email: faithless.brewing@gmail.com\xa0Homepage: faithlessbrewing.podbean.com\xa0Don\'t forget to subscribe and leave us an iTunes review. We want to hear from you!\xa0 | Faithless Brewing, Episode 20: Kethis, the Hidden Hand\xa0Throne of Eldraine is around the corner and the previews are coming fast and furious. Some look sweet, some look strange, and some look downright broken, including a certain strange woman lying in a pond distributing swords. That\'s no basis for a system of government.\xa0In the meantime, though, we\'ve got unfinished business with Core Set 2020. Kethis, the Hidden Hand had a surprising breakout late in the Standard season, anchoring a slick combo deck full of powerful legendaries. Modern has even more enticing options, but can this bizarre strategy withstand the transition to the lightning-fast eternal format? Or should Kethis be reimagined as the centerpiece of a midrange build? The crew has some ideas, so let\'s discuss!\xa0Flashback: Kiora and Niv-Mizzet\xa0Ramp-less Niv-Mizzet (cavedan): Top 8 SCG IQ\xa0Ramp-less Niv-Mizzet (Ihavethefire): 12-0 Modern Playoffs\xa0Kiora Dragons: 10-10 leagues\xa0Kiora Eldrazi: 11-4 leagues\xa0Bonus list: Cat Jesus Returns (sketch)\xa0Throne of Eldraine Previews\xa0Dave has eight spicy hot takes on exciting new contenders for Modern, and Damon and Dan are eager to prove him wrong.

Tournament results are trickling in, but in the Magic Online leagues, it\'s the Wild West: everyone has dusted off their midrange decks, hoping that strategies that have always fared poorly will finally get a chance to breathe in a graveyard-free Modern. It is a great time to be a brewer.\xa0With seemingly endless possibilities to explore, this week the crew revisits some old favorites: Faithless Brews that were powerful before Modern Horizons, but couldn\'t keep up with the madness of Hogaak Summer. We discuss new builds of RG Kiora Dragons, Rainbow Niv-Mizzet, and old school Grixis Control. Are these old challengers ready to compete for the top tier of the new Modern?

Faithless Looting, the best card in Modern, breaker of formats and giver of value, was struck down in the prime of its life, taken from us by a cruel stroke of research and development. Dear Looting, you shall be missed.\xa0There is no rest for the weary, however, as a new powerhouse has been unleashed upon the Modern format. Stoneforge Mystic has arrived to thunderous applause and is already dominating the MTGO leagues, with no fewer than 27(!) distinct Stoneforge decks appearing in the first 5-0 deck dump. It is a time of wild experimentation, and we are here to guide you through all the different ways to make Batterskull and friends. You won\'t want to miss this one!\xa0\xa0*****\xa0Flashback: Elementals\xa0Bant Vesperlark: 5-5 leagues, an acceptable combo deck with a good ability to grind thanks to Risen Reef. Lack of interaction makes it difficult to keep up with aggressive strategies.\xa0\xa0RB Thunder Forger: 5-5 leagues, Thunderkin is massively defanged by the loss of Faithless Looting, and this deck can never defeat a Batterskull.

He is also the proud recipient of the Paul Bartsch Award for Distinguished Contributions to Natural History. Bird Watcher\'s Digest subscribers will recognize him as the author of "Birders Question Mark," a Q&A column that has featured in the magazine since 2015. Mark reveals what sparked his interest in nature and birds early in life, and how it evolved throughout his lifetime. He ends with advice for aspiring naturalists: Be persistent, follow your heart, and in the end, it will all work out! | In July and August, This Birding Life will feature two episodes that Bill Thompson, III, recorded before succumbing to pancreatic cancer on March 25, 2019. In this episode Bill interviews longtime friend Jeff Gordon, president of the American Birding Association, and his wife, Liz. Bill\'s guests discuss how they met, how their relationship evolved through their love of birds, the accomplishments that they value most in their work with the ABA, current trends in birding, and what the future holds for the hobby we all love. | As you may know, our beloved TBL host Bill Thompson, III, died on March 25, after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. What you may not know is that Bill\'s mother, Bird Watcher\'s Digest founding publisher Elsa Thompson, died in a fire in her home in Marietta, Ohio, on May 25. We know you share our grief in losing these two wonderful people who have contributed so much to the world of birding. In honor of BT3 and Elsa, we\'re re-airing this episode from 2013, when Bill interviewed Elsa about the early days of Bird Watcher\'s Digest, why the family started the magazine, and what it has meant in their lives. | Originally recorded in 2010, this episode of TBL features host Bill Thompson, III, interviewing Jonathan Meiberg, a birder and leader of the indie-rock band Shearwater. Both a musician and a bird watcher, Jonathan Meiberg sparked on music at an early age, but he did not catch the birding bug until his college years, while on a visit to the Falkland Islands. In this episode Bill and Jonathan discuss a range of topics including songwriting, bird behavior, life birds, and the vagaries of small travel guitars. Interspersed throughout the interview are short samples of Shearwater\'s music. This was one of Bill\'s favorite episodes! | In this popular episode from 2011, TBL host Bill Thompson, III, interviewed Greg Miller, an Ohio birder who served as inspiration for the character played by actor Jack Black in the feature film The Big Year. In this episode, Greg tells the story of his own birding life. | Bill interviews Ohio birding legend Jim McCormac about his lifelong fascination with nature, his career preserving special places and creatures in Ohio, and his many other accomplishments. Jim is the author of several books; he guides birding and photo tours; and he is one of the few people to see both a red-cockaded woodpecker and a Bachman\'s sparrow in Ohio! Listen to the banter of these two old friends. | TBL host Bill Thompson, III, will be away from the BWD home nest for a while. We hope soon to resume new episodes of the podcast we all know and love, but in the interim, we\'re taking a trip down memory lane and replaying some of the most popular episodes. In this episode from 2007, tropical birding expert Alvaro Jaramillo recounts a side trip to Rapa Nui (Easter Island), which became one of the best experiences of his birding life. | TBL host Bill Thompson, III, will be away from the BWD home nest for a while. We hope soon to resume new episodes of the podcast we all know and love, but in the interim, we\'re taking a trip down memory lane and replaying some of the most popular episodes. In this episode from December 2017, owl expert Scott Weidensaul joins Bill for a discussion of the winter\'s invasion of snowy owls from the Arctic. Through Project SNOWstorm (co-founded by Scott), a volunteer field research program studying these magnificent, mostly white owls, we are learning a great deal about their behavior, population dynamics, natural history, and how they interact with us humans, and vice versa. Scott also shares his tips for watching a snowy owl respectfully, without disturbing it. | Melissa Groo joins Bill to talk about her life and the late start she got to her amazing career as a “wildlife biographer.” Though she is most famous for her captivating bird and wildlife photographs, Melissa strives to convey more than that, capturing the personality, soul, and essence of her subjects in hopes of inspiring empathy from humankind for the plight of the natural world. | During a recent trip to South America, Bill collected stories from six of his fellow travelers and shares them here.

Each week Skye and a guest go deep into the background of a Mystery or Conspiracy or dive deep into a historical event.

Emily covers it all from mental well being to sexual frustrations. The thing I love about Emily is she always tries to approach every situation from a non judgmental perspective and give the best advice for every situation. From how to deal with bad lovers, how to speak up for what you need from your partner and even how to break down the walls you have made or society has put on you. Things like how to explore your body and learn what turns you on and off physically and mentally along with how to make sure that it translates to an intimate relationship with your partner.If you enjoy this episode please take a moment to follow Sex with Emily on social media and subscribe to them wherever you’re listening to Podcast Junkie.Sex with EmilyTwitterFacebookInstagramYouTubePodcast JunkieTwitterDiscordPatreonFacebookInstagram | This weeks review and recommendation is for Our True Crime Podcast, Hosted by Jen and Cam two close friends who take lesser known crimes from across the globe and try their best to pay respect to the victim while lifting the heavy feeling with a little comedic twist.\xa0The cases they cover like I said earlier tend to be on the less publicized cases which I prefer because let's be honest we don't need another BTK or Golden State killer episode there's a million out right now.If you enjoy this episode please take a moment to follow Our True Crime Podcast on social media and subscribe to them wherever you’re listening to Podcast Junkie.Our True Crime PodcastTwitterFacebookInstagramPodcast JunkieTwitterDiscordPatreonFacebookInstagram | This week we’re boarding a Gated Galaxies OZ spaceship holding roughly 50,000 sleeping passengers and a handful of highly intelligent…..or at least sub par staff members on the OZ-9.

Lastly, should GMs tailor the campaign to the characters or should players create characters built around the campaign they are about to play.

It is told it must explore, and so explore it does. The other cube conquers, but that is not this cube\'s concern. They met once at a party. It seemed nice, but that was long ago, and the cube must explore, not mingle. Sometimes it does not explore; sometimes it scores for some quantity of non-explore things. These things it does not understand, but it knows that points are good, and so it does those things. The explore cube also cares about farms, for some reason, and mushrooms. Near the end of its track, it pauses--not for lack of mushrooms, this time, but out of an uncharacteristic self-doubt. Why does it do these things, it wonders. What mad god intersperses these random tasks so? And down from Olympus comes the pronouncement of the cube\'s controller--perhaps that very mad god, or perhaps merely a lesser divinity in thrall of some yet more powerful, some yet more capricious deity--"BECAUSE THEME."Games Played Last Week: -Shards of Infinity 2m38s (Gary Arant & Justin Gary, Stone Blade Entertainment, 2018) -The Bridges of Shangri-La 4m33s (Leo Colovini, Uberplay, 2003)-Vengeance 9m22s (Gordon Calleja, Mighty Boards, 2018)-Slide Quest 12m03s (Nicolas Bourgoin & Jean-François Rochas, Blue Orange, 2019)-Gaslands: Refuelled 14m02s (Mike Hutchinson, Osprey Publishing, 2019)News (and why it doesn\'t matter):-Walker deploys facts, CMON travels in time 18m00s-More Warhammer Underworlds 21m58s-More Sidereal Confluence 24m20s-Foundations of Rome 25m44s-Mark must resist Obsidian Protocol 26m07s-Blacklist Games\' Hour of Need 27m19s-Root RPG 28m34sFeature Game: Tapestry 29m06s (Jamey Stegmaier, Stonemaier Games, 2019) | Mark thinks it is colossally unfair that he gets so much flak for speaking French when mediocre game designers get to throw around a word like "tableau." Then again, Mark and Walker can\'t quite agree on what a tableau constitutes. Mark seems to define it the way that American judge famously defined pornography--he knows it when he sees it--whereas Walker is more conspiratorial about tableaus (Tableaux? Tableausies?), seeing them everywhere and lurking behind every player board or suite of special powers. Nothing seems to inspire disagreement among geeks like a taxonomy.

"GIVE ME YOAR COOOBS" bellow the aliens upon arrival. "POINTZ 4 COOOOBS." A robot obliges, and a sonorous "cha-ching" resounds through its programming. But the robot is now a drifting derelict, its home ship long gone. It is now doomed to tumble through inky pinkness until its energy reserves burn to nothing. It begins to wonder, "Why have I done this? What is my purpose? What is this all for?"

But sometimes it's nice to hear those voices on a more...literal level. In this episode, Kyle asks a group of four listeners to answer five hobby-related questions. | In this episode, Kyle addresses the influx of investor advice platforms that have sprouted up on social media over the last year. In the process, he attempts to answer the question: what does misinformation look like and how can one recognize it in order to steer clear? In the second half, he examines the recent #noslabmovement and the collector dialogue that came with it. | It might be the most recognizable basketball card in the hobby's history: the 1986-87 Fleer Michael Jordan rookie. But is this card actually his true rookie? In this episode, Kyle talks about Jordan's place in the hobby. Along the way, he takes a closer look at both the 1984-85 Star card and the 1986-87 Fleer release. This includes a discussion of the logistics of each set and the abundance of counterfeits that come with it. Is there a true Michael Jordan rookie card? Is there one that you favor over the other? At the end of the episode, Kyle encourages listeners to take to social media to state their case. | The call for grading reform is loud and clear. But is any company going to answer? In this episode, Kyle talks about his attempts to have dialogue with PSA and BGS, and then unexpected guest SGC. Additionally, Kyle recaps a crazy week of Zion-mania that followed the release of the #1 pick's first certified autographs in Panini Contenders Draft. | In this episode, Kyle talks listeners through the discovery of yet another altered Steph Curry RPA. In the process, he outlines the incompetence of the grading industry that let this particular card slip through the cracks. At the end of the show, Kyle encourages collectors to contact these companies and let their voices be heard. | Basketball cards are insanely popular in 2019, but there was a time when collectors wanted nothing to do with them. In the late 1960s, Topps experimented with a 22-card test issue that played a major role in creating the vintage cards collectors flock to today. This is the story of the 1968 Topps test set. | In this week's episode, Kyle takes a look back at one of the most popular parallels from the 1990s: E-X Credentials. As a part of this year-by-year summary, he discusses a couple of 1/1s that vanished and left collectors wondering what happened to them, as well as a Michael Jordan card that ended up in pieces (before later being made whole again). | What's better than a well-designed basketball card? A well-designed basketball card with a nice looking signature. Between 2011-2013, Kyle lived in an NBA city and had the opportunity to see the game up close and personal. A large part of this experience involved trying to get basketball cards signed in-person. In this episode, he recalls a few of the successes, mishaps (LeBron James), and bizarre moments along the way. | As 2018 drew to a close, countless collectors dug out their old cards in search of one thing: the 1990-91 Hoops Mark Jackson base card. But what caused this to skyrocket in value after all of these years? In this episode, Kyle gives a little background on the set, talks about the Menendez Brothers case, and examines the causes for the card's unforeseen rise to fame. | In this episode, Kyle takes listeners through his event-filled two days in Chicago at the 2019 National Sports Collectors Convention. At the end of the episode, he discusses three things he thinks he did right, as well as three things he would do differently next time.", 'chan_desc': 'A basketball card podcast that discusses the hobby’s past, present, and future.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/84/96/c5/8496c594-6020-0ede-1935-7459b0cee635/mza_202929287596400683.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-03-16'}}

He spent a year or so traveling around the country, burying small ceramic boxes two feet underground. He wrote a few poems, and had a friend of his paint some images. The goal was to get the reader to match a poem with a verse, produce a treasure map of sorts, then go dig up the treasures.\nHe thought it would be easy.\n40 years later we are finding out he was wrong.\n\nSo far two treasures have been found. One in Chicago, and one in Cleveland… so at least we know they are real. That’s about all we know for sure.\n\nThis project started with Byron recruiting a bunch of his friends. Sean and Ted to write some descriptions of strange creatures that Byron’s friend JoEllen sculpted out of clay and cloth, which were photographed by his childhood friend Ben. Then Byron’s friends John Palencar, John Pierard, and Overton Loyd made a bunch of images with the sole purpose of confusing all of us.\n\nThe project was created by a community of friends, and it is my opinion that a community of friends is the only way to solve it.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/5f/88/96/5f8896e9-9be5-529a-af14-cc807367568a/mza_1382744875394257421.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-12-07'}}

for you this month.\xa0 This feature has always existed, but the good folk at Ravelry have now spruced up the feature a little to make the suggestions more prominent.\xa0If you have a favourite designer that you like and a favourite design of theirs, click into that pattern page and on the right-hand side, at the bottom of the page you will see thumbnails of suggestions for other, similar patterns and a link for “More that people also like…” which takes you through to lots of other pattern suggestions.I think this is a really great way to search for patterns and come across new, smaller designers that may struggle to get known.\xa0Photo: Shows the Ravelry screen having searched for my Criss-cross pattern.\xa0Photo: At the bottom right-hand side some thumbnails will appear showing alternative patterns.Photo: By clicking through to more suggestions, you will see a page of other suggested patterns that have been favourited.\xa02 – CAL UpdatesThis podcast is titled “Tardy” because that is what I have been!\xa0 If you aren’t familiar with the word, it means delaying or delayed beyond the right or expected time.\xa0 About 12 months ago I was running the #sockalong2018 and 11 months ago I should have drawn for prizes from Instagram and the FO thread that was hosted in Kathryn from Crafternoon Treats podcast group on Ravelry.\xa0About three months ago I found the prizes in my Stash Palace and figured I may as well wait and mark the occasion a full tardy twelve months later!\xa0So, if you have won a prize, I have already been in touch with you.\xa0 On Instagram, the winners were @yarn.adventurous and @fizzcrail.\xa0 Over on Ravelry, the random number generator picked Woolwoman2k8, NinaCamilleri and Stasiacrochet.\xa0Sorry, it has taken me this long to do the prize draw, it very much speaks to the reason why I haven’t been doing CALs this year.That said, I am co-hosting a #wiprip2019 with Sophie from A Spring Snowflake Podcast (link) albeit, Sophie is doing most of the work because she is hosting the chatter thread over on her Ravelry Group Page.The whole idea is that you have from now until midnight on the 31st December to finish up or rip out some or all of your WIPs so that you go into the New Year with fewer projects.On Instagram, you can use #wiprip2019 for chatter and #wiprip2019FO to show off your finished or frogged projects.\xa0Go to Sophie’s Ravelry group for chatter and I will open and host the FO thread.\xa0From my end, these are the projects that I will be finishing up:1 – Chapman Socks (knitted)2 – Verity Vest (crochet)3 – Anything else I have started and need to finishI have less to go through because I have been trying to be quite a monogamous crafter over the last few months, but there may be projects lurking that need to be sorted out!Come and join us and let’s carry fewer projects into 2020.\xa03 – Final DestinationOkay, so whilst I don’t have any finished crochet objects that I can show you, I do actually have some knitted ones.\xa0 This month I finished off two commission projects for a yarn company, but I won’t be able to show them off properly until well into next year.However, I have been finishing up a load of knitted socks.\xa0 I quite often have a sock on the go because I leave them in yarn bowls when I am at shows to show off their potential and also to talk through my sock patterns.\xa0 \xa0Now, instead of three single socks, I have three pairs all finished and ready to wear this winter.\xa0ALT TEXT: Three socks on a grey background.\xa0 Left is a striped sock in light grey, forest green, bright green, purple, steel blue and hot pink.\xa0 The middle sock is also striped and is a dark rusty copper and dark verdigris colour.\xa0 The sock on the right is cream with blips of brown, yellow, peach and blue.\xa0 This sock has a contrast cuff, heel and toe in soft peachy pink.The colourful striped socks are in John Arbon Textiles Exmoor Sock Yarn (link).\xa0 I was using up the ends from my Kinbaine shawl (link) and Acanthium Mittens (link).\xa0 The pattern is my own and it’s called Mini Mania (link).The copper and green Mini Mania socks are also in John Arbon Textiles Exmoor Sock Yarn but were dyed up by RiverKnits and the colours are no longer available.The beautiful speckled pastel socks are the Pebbles and Pathways pattern by Marceline Smith (link).\xa0 In the pattern, Marce encourages you to go your own way and add your own elements and I definitely did that – mine are cuff down and I added all sorts of extra bits!\xa0 The main colour is ‘Orchard’ by Bernie at Bear in Sheep’s Clothing (link) and is 100% Corriedale with no nylon or superwash.\xa0 I will be reporting back on how well these wear.\xa0 The contrast colour was an unnamed mini by Desiree at Abercairn Yarns (link) and I think is 75% Merino and 25% nylon.I also attended an eco-printing workshop at my local Weavers, Spinners and Dyers Guild.\xa0 You place leaves and flowers on pre-mordanted material, roll it up and steam it.\xa0 This sets the vegetation print onto the material with varying results and takes a lot of trial and error.\xa0 The below photos show some of the results I got.If you are interested in the subject of Eco-Printing and creating plant-based inks, I have just listed a book in my shop by Babs Behan called "Botanical Inks" (link).\xa0ALT TEXT: Collage of three photos. Left - a square of undyed silk with Japanese Maple, ferns and purple Heuchera leaves and flower stems laid out on a table.\xa0 Below the silk is the broom handle that he silk will be rolled onto for steaming.\xa0 Top right - cream wool fabric after steaming.\xa0 Eucalyptus leaves have left a rust orange print from the eco-printing process.\xa0 Bottom right - another sheet of silk with Japanese Maple and fern.\xa0 The second half of the silk has been placed on top to create a \'ghost\' print.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa04 – En RouteThe only project on my hook is the Mya Shawl by Helda Panagary (link).\xa0 This is my entry into #RhineBIPOCSweater K/CAL – I can’t link to the bundle within Ravelry, but you can get details via Lady Dye’s Instagram post (link).\xa0After a bit of fiddling around with hook sizes and the number of rows, I settled on using ‘Pisces’ by Cosmic Strings (the dyers are Phu and Bea (link)) as the main skein and some Rico mohair as the sort of background colour.\xa0I had been hoping to finish this up and be wearing the shawl as I listened to Helda do her talk on ‘Being a Crochet Designer’ at Yarndale on Saturday.\xa0 I didn’t quite manage it and settled instead for crocheting on it whilst she talked.Had I just stuck to the pattern and not fiddled (I will never learn), then I would have had an FO.\xa0 However, because I am doing 4 rows of mohair laceweight (100m per 100g) to 2 rows of 4ply, it’s taking a little longer.\xa0 My plan is to use up all of the mohair, which I suspect will leave me with a little bit of the Cosmic Strings teal.\xa0My reason for fiddling is a good one though.\xa0 The pattern makes quite a deep, but short shawl and I have quite wide shoulders.\xa0 By changing the number of row repeats, I am able to make a bigger shawl that will better fit my body shape.\xa0 \xa0\xa0I am calling it my Slythermort shawl and also entering it into Clarisabeth’s (Crochet Cakes podcast) Mischief Managed CAL (link).\xa0 I have until the 31st October to get this finished!\xa0ALT TEXT: Image shows a dark background with a cake of a dark/dirty teal coloured yarn to the left and a flattened mohair cake of stormy grey yarn to the right.\xa0 At the fore are a blue metal crochet hook and a striped shawl in the yarn.\xa0\xa0\xa05 – Feeding the HabitDid I got to Yarndale and manage to not buy any yarn?\xa0 Yup, yes I did!\xa0 This is totally aided by the fact that I picked up two loads of yarn from vendors which is yarn support for my patterns.\xa0So, what did I buy instead of yarn? \xa0I bought a knitted pattern book by Jimi Knits (link), some pin badges from Bear in Sheep\'s Clothing (link) and Nerdbird Makery (link) and a small sewn project bag by Border Tart (link).\xa0ALT TEXT: grey background with Jimi Knits A4 pattern book to the left, linen project bag with sewn scraps of blue fabric overlapping the book.\xa0 To the right are folds of soft cashmere tweed and in the fore are two pins on cards, one is the back of a polar bear wearing a kilt and the other is head and of a BIPOC knitter with yarn and knitting needles in her hair.\xa0I’m not really missing buying yarn.\xa0 I have so much in my stash and I am really enjoying shopping in my own Stash Palace and using up deep stash in particular.\xa0\xa06 – Quick News Beats1 - Global Hook Up – I have set the dates for the next few months and will stick to the 8 pm GMT/BST on a Saturday night and 9 am GMT/BST on a Sunday morning.The details for the next sessions are already up in the Ravelry thread, can also be found below and will be put out on Instagram in advance.The meeting ID number is\xa0475-047-5819\xa0and you will need to join via Zoom which you can do here:\xa0\xa0https://www.zoom.us/joinIf you are joining on your phone or tablet you will likely need to download the software in advance.\xa0 If you are joining from a PC or Mac, you can join via the link above.\xa0 Everyone needs to use the same ID number to get into the session.\xa0October - Saturday 19th and Sunday 20th \xa0November - Saturday 23rd and Sunday 24th \xa0December - Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th \xa02 –\xa0I promised in the last podcast that I would write a quick blog on what apps and podcasts I use to help to run my business.\xa0 You can find that blogpost on my website (link).3 – I had three copies of Eilidh’s print (link) to giveaway and the winners are:Instagram – @craftybritabroad (Amy)Podbean – Marce (BrownBerry Podcast)YouTube – Patty CrochetsWell done everyone.\xa04 – I did the catwalk at Perth Festival of Yarn!\xa0 It was a lot of fun and definitely showcased crocheted garments.\xa0 However, I had an epic fail on getting photos or video footage.\xa0 It was a lot of fun and luckily, Laura from The Lonely Knitter Podcast recorded it all, so you can see all of the lovely crocheted and knitted items that went down the Gala Dinner catwalk (link).To celebrate the fact that I managed to finish my Blurred Lines jumper in time, I bought three kilted bear pins from Bernie at Bear in Sheep’s Clothing.\xa0 These pins are made in the UK and I love them.\xa0 I already own one that Bernie gave me at Perth and I thought some of you may want to try to win one too!\xa0If you would like to be in with a chance of winning, leave a comment on the threads of this episode of YouTube, Podbean and/or Instagram.\xa0 It’s open to everyone across the globe.\xa0 I will draw winners just before I record the November podcast.\xa0 Start your comment with “bare bear” so that I know you are entering to win.\xa0 Why bare bear?\xa0 Bears are true Scots – no knickers!\xa07 - J’adoreI had an absolute ball at Yarndale.\xa0 I went with a bunch of friends, we laughed, wore pyjamas for most of the weekend, drank gin and generally had a great time.\xa0I met lots of my lovely yarn colleagues and friends and made new friends.\xa0 Plans have been hatched, new business ideas have formed and 2020 is shaping up rather nicely.\xa0My sleeves are bulging with all of the ideas, projects, interviews and designs that I want to do in the coming months.\xa0 \xa0\xa08 – Big UpI already mentioned that I went to see Helda give her talk at Yarndale on being a crochet designer.\xa0 Before she started her talk, she was nervous and had no reason to be.\xa0 Her talk was genuine, from the heart and fab!\xa0 Big Up Helda you were great!Fay x\xa0Instagram:\xa0Crochet_Circle_Podcast\xa0Instagram:\xa0KnitithookitInstagram:\xa0FayDHDesignsYouTube:\xa0The Crochet Circle PodcastRavelry Group:\xa0Search for The Crochet Circle Podcast in Groups | Hello there and welcome to The Crochet Circle Podcast and the show notes for Episode 46 – Tipsy Crocheting!\xa0My name is Fay and this is my audio and video podcast for those that love fibre crafts, particularly crochet.\xa0 It’s a community for people that like to support their fellow humans regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, size or age.

I just need to add some final photos.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Fay stands in her dining room, in front of an open fireplace with a small table and lamp to the left.\xa0 She is looking down with hands in pockets, wearing jeans and her newly finished Blurred Lines Jumper which is a grey/teal blue main colour (top and bottom) with a middle variegated section in cream/pink with little pops of yellow, teal and blue.I also have a couple of little things that I have crocheted up.\xa0 These are samples for the online shop and for shows. \xa0I have started selling craft books, but only wish to sell ones that I have worked from personally and can therefore recommend.\xa0 It’s not about fads, it’s about well-written books and patterns.\xa0I finally managed to make something from my Crocheted Succulents book by Emma Varnam (link).\xa0 I had this book on pre-order last year but just couldn’t find a window of time to make something from it.\xa0 I crocheted up a Mexican Snowball succulent using 50g of Rowan cotton glace that I had in my stash.\xa0 It was really easy to make, and the instructions were lovely and clean.\xa0 It took me about 5 hours in total and I can see many more cacti and succulents in my future because I struggle to keep house plants alive!ALT TEXT: Corner of the Crocheted Succulents book by Emma Varnam is in the bottom left.\xa0 In the middle sits a white pottery reused candle holder with a sage green crocheted succulent (Mexican Snowball) on top. At the bottom of the pot lies a pink crochet hook, little worm of the left over sage green cotton and a pair of snips shaped and decorated to look like a crocodile.\xa0Another book that has been sitting on my crafting shelves waiting for some attention is Laly Lalas Beetles, Bugs and Butterflies book (link).\xa0 Of all of the gorgeous little creatures in this book, I chose to hook up a moth!\xa0 I was working on the basis that this is the only moth that is actually allowed anywhere near my yarn! \xa0This took me about 7 hours to make and used up lots of little odds and ends of cotton from my stash.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Two images - both with very dark grey backgrounds.\xa0 Image one shows the Beetles, Bugs and Butterflies book by Laly Lala.\xa0 The front cover shows lots of crocheted bugs as examples and to the right of the book is the front of a moth I have crocheted up from the book.\xa0 The moth has detachable wings and har with antennae.\xa0 Image two is the back of the moth, which shows clearly that the top of the wings are off-white edged with grey cotton and the bottom is blue.\xa0 The main moth body is a green/yellow and the hat id a mustard yellow.\xa0\xa0It was really nice being able to quickly plough through a couple of crochet projects, even if they are small.\xa03 – My LifeThis is not going to be a regular segment, but I thought I would just offer up a little slice of what this year has been like so far and how I dearly want the last three months to unfold.\xa0Most of 2019 has been spent bombing up and down the UK road and ferry network, attending yarn shows all over the place.\xa0 It had been a busy year so far which I love because I get to see so many of you Crochet Clanfolk and it really helps to put my business on the map!The downside though is the impact that it has.\xa0 I. Don’t. Stop.\xa0If you have ever met me in real life, when you watch my face, you can literally see the cogs turning.\xa0 Most conversations make neurons ping in my brain and the ideas flow immediately.\xa0 My brain is always on, it is never quiet.\xa0As you listen and watch this podcast I will be up at the Perth Festival of Yarn – my last yarn show of 2019!\xa0 I am really excited to be vending at this show but if truthful, I am just as excited about life calming down a little.\xa0 I am planning on having a relaxing week, next week after I have counted the stock back into the shop.\xa0Relaxation for me means audiobooks or courses and sitting with my feet up, crafting.\xa0 I may even set myself a little crochet goal.\xa0 See what I mean?\xa0 I have already set myself a goal for my time off!\xa0 There is just no hope for me.\xa0When you are driving and sitting on ferries you get a lot of time to think.\xa0 My main focus for this year was ‘structure’ and I have done a lot around that for the business, podcast and design work this year which has really helped to streamline my work focus.\xa0My recent motorway mile shave given me time to think about what I need to concentrate on in 2020.\xa0 It feels like it will be a big year, even if it’s just because of the repetition of the numbers!\xa0 My focus for 2020 is going to be around the word ‘centre’. \xa0It is ‘centre’ because “no” or “selfish” just felt too negative!\xa0 So, my focus is about saying no to things that other people want me to do for them, so that I can say yes to the things that I need to do for myself.\xa0 My problem is that I want to be helpful and supportive and therefore take on too much because I hate letting people down.\xa0 So, by saying no and centring back to what I need for my business, my family and me personally.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0Saying to something is never saying yes to just one thing because there are always mini-tasks that lead to that final completed yes.\xa0 My theory is that saying no to one thing is actually more like saying no to ten mini-tasks, which frees up ten things that I can then do for me or my business.\xa0 It’s not all about saying no, it’s also about focussing some time back to me and creating a strong personal core from which to work.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0Would anyone find it useful for me to write a blog post on what software I use to help with this and what podcasts I listen to for business/creative inspiration?\xa0 Ping me a message if it would be useful and I will pull something together.So, if you need me in October, November, December 2019, I will be chilling a little, drinking more tea and hopefully doing a lot more crafting and designing.\xa0\xa04 – En RouteAs I record this podcast, I have no crocheted project on the go.\xa0 However, I have two that I want to start:\xa0The first is the Mya Shawl by Helda Panagary (link).\xa0 This is going to be my entry into #RhineBIPOCSweater K/CAL – I can’t link to the bundle within Ravelry, but you can get details via Lady Dye’s Instagram post (link).\xa0 As for the yarn that I want to use, I think I am going to crochet the shawl with ‘Orion’ by Cosmic Strings (the dyers are Phu and Bea (link)) as the main skein.\xa0 As you know, I am on a yarn ban until 21st December, so I can’t buy any mohair which is what the pattern calls for.\xa0 Instead, I took to my stash (deeeeep stash) and found some Rico mohair that I can use instead.\xa0 Whilst this isn’t strictly within the parameters of the CAL, I’m not going to break my yarn ban when I already own something suitable!\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Image one shows crochet designer, Helda Panagary standing side on in front of cream tiles, holding a\xa0 ball of dark arn in her left hand and a crochet hook in her right.\xa0 Helda looks beautiful long dark hair that curls at the bottom.\xa0 Image two shows a dark background with a skein of a dark/dirty teal coloured yarn to the left (ball band reads \'Cosmic Strings\' and two flattened mohair cakes of yarn piled to the right.\xa0 These are is a very stormy grey colour.\xa0ALT TEXT: Image three shows the same model twice, (Back and front), showing off Helda\'s Mya Shawl.\xa0 It is triangular and shows subtle stripes in pinks where different yarn blends have been used.\xa0 Each corner has a corresponding tastle.I am off to Yarndale the last week of September and have a ticket to see Helda talk on Saturday afternoon.\xa0 I would love to be wearing my version of Helda’s Mya Shawl when I sit and listen to her talk on life as a crochet designer.The second is the Bark Sweater by Sidsel Sangild (link).\xa0I will be using John Arbon Textiles British Breeds 80% Romney/20% Corriedale blend and a 5mm hook. \xa0I can’t link to the wool because it was a special and only available to Mill Members on their website. I have a ridiculous self-imposed goal that maybe I could be wearing this at Yarndale too…\xa0If I whizz through that, then I will also try to work up Claudia’s Encanto Wrap (link) which is her first-ever design!ALT TEXT - A split image showing a very smiley Claudia from Crochet Luna on the left, wearing her first design around her neck.\xa0 The textured wrap shows stripes fo bright green and purple leading up to her neck and a more solid purple around her neck.\xa0 \xa0The second side of teh image shows the wrap on a mannequin that has a black dress on.\xa05 – Feeding the HabitStill no stash additions and my Solstice to Solstice yarn ban is going well.\xa0 I am still tempted by things but have managed to just say no!There have been other things though:Last month I showed off a lovely print that I received in the post from Lorna (@neveratalooseend).\xa0 It was done by her daughter Eilidh (@by.eilidh on Instagram) and I love her style.\xa0 I contacted Eilidh to say that I wanted to buy some prints from her to pass to friends and unbeknown to me, some more just arrived in the post!\xa0 Needless to say, when I see Lorna at Perth Festival of Yarn, I will be passing her money to pass to Eilidh so that I can properly purchase the prints.\xa0 More on this in Quick Newsbeats.I have started selling Yael’s crocheted necklaces in my online shop and at shows (link).\xa0 Her work is beautiful and I want to be able to support a fellow crafter.\xa0 Because Yael is naughty, she snuck a notions pouch into my order – and it’s beautiful.\xa0 Yael also makes beautiful linen project bags and I encourage you to check out her Etsy shop (link).ALT TEXT:\xa0 Black background with a patchwork linen notions pouch in grey/browns, pink and a navy with white dashed fabric and pastel yellow zip to the top left.\xa0 Colourful print to the right in purples and corals, saying "All wool is yarn but not all yarn is wool" on a scarf that is wrapped around fibre giving animals (bison/Alpaca/goat/sheep/rabbit). Two large paper clips with material covered tops to the bottom left.\xa0 One has a black and white cat on the fabric and the other has the head of a sheep.While I was vending at Yarnfolk in Northern Ireland, I met Jean and not only did she bring me a can of pop to keep me going in the afternoon, she also gave me two large fabric button clips.\xa0 One has a sheep on it and the other a black cat – not unlike Pom!\xa0 These are perfect for marking which page you are on in a pattern!\xa0\xa06 – Quick News Beats1 - Global Hook Up – I have set the dates for the next few months and will stick to the 8 pm GMT/BST on a Saturday night and 9 am GMT/BST on a Sunday morning.The details for the next sessions are already up in the Ravelry thread, can also be found below and will be put out on Instagram in advance.The meeting ID number is\xa0475-047-5819\xa0and you will need to join via Zoom which you can do here:\xa0\xa0https://www.zoom.us/joinIf you are joining on your phone or tablet you will likely need to download the software in advance.\xa0 If you are joining from a PC or Mac, you can join via the link above.\xa0 Everyone needs to use the same ID number to get into the session.\xa0September - Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th – NOTE THAT THIS IS A DATE CHANGE! \xa0October - Saturday 19th and Sunday 20th \xa0November - Saturday 23rd and Sunday 24th \xa0December - Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th \xa02 –\xa0Over on Instagram, I was showing off a vegan soup I was making on Stories and some of you asked for the recipe.\xa0 I have created a blog post for it (link) and it’s a really hearty spicy tomato soup that is made mainly from store cupboard ingredients. \xa03 – I have three copies of Eilidh’s print (link) that I want to give away.\xa0 It looks beautiful framed (I have one up on my studio wall).\xa0 To enter, simply respond on YouTube, comment in Podbean or on Instagram.\xa0 I will draw one winner from each platform and get in touch with you to say that you have won.4 – I still have an unclaimed prize of one of Deanne’s patterns.\xa0 Angee Stitch 78 from YouTube, you were a winner but haven’t responded, so could you please get in touch to claim your prize.5 – I always provide links within the show notes, but sometimes people struggle to find them.\xa0 From this month onwards, anything that I talk about and provide a link for, just look for “link)” and that is where to click to get to the relevant web page.\xa07 - J’adoreThere is a very definite Autumnal nip in the air.\xa0 I can feel my hibernation senses tingling and I am excited about woolly socks, fires, endless cups of tea and lots of crafting.\xa0As I said earlier, it has been a very long year so far and it’s time to take life down a few notches and recharge my batteries.\xa0I love the excuse to snuggle up under a blanket with an audiobook and my crochet.\xa0 Also, the colours of Autumn are my jam – I am so inspired by these few months of all things earthy!I will be back on Friday the 4th of\xa0October.Fay x\xa0Instagram:\xa0Crochet_Circle_Podcast\xa0Instagram:\xa0KnitithookitInstagram:\xa0FayDHDesignsYouTube:\xa0The Crochet Circle PodcastRavelry Group:\xa0Search for The Crochet Circle Podcast in Groups\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 | Hello there and welcome to The Crochet Circle Podcast and the show notes for Episode 45 – None (Yarn) Shall Pass.\xa0My name is Fay and this is my audio and video podcast for those that love fibre crafts, particularly crochet.\xa0 It’s a community for people that like to support their fellow humans regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, size or age.

quick top on how to satiate that thirst to start a new project when you still have a bit to go on an existing project.\xa0 Before you have finished the existing project, do the swatching and wet blocking for your new project.\xa0That way, if you have to play about with gauge, you have time to do that and hopefully be ready to start your new project the moment you have finished the other one.\xa0\xa02 – Perth Project Runway updateProgress is going really well on my Blurred Lines by Deanne at Addydae Designs.\xa0 This is one of the best patterns I have ever worked from and the fit is really good, even though I came down to a 3mm hook.\xa0I have been keeping my project notes up to date on Ravelry, so you can see any changes I have made.\xa0\xa0I am currently working on the sleeves even though I haven’t yet finished the main body.\xa0 I have chosen to do this because I have now finished using the contrast colour on the main body, which freed up the yarn to do the sleeves.\xa0 I find it bulky and cumbersome to add sleeves when you have the near full weight of a jumper and you are constantly moving it about to complete the short rounds of the sleeves.\xa0 So, I am doing the sleeves before I finish the rest of the body.\xa0 This also means that I won’t be stranded on sleeve island!The other thing I would like to highlight and encourage you to do is swatch with your different cakes of the same yarn.\xa0 Even is the same colourway is from the same batch, there can still be differences.\xa0 By swatching with all of them, you will quickly see if there is a difference and whether you need to alternate skeins in your project.\xa0 This is particularly applicable to garment making.As I mentioned in the podcast. there is a slight but noticeable difference between two of my contrast colour skeins and it seems very likely I will have to rip back about 350m of crochet.\xa0\xa0Will this be finished for Perth Festival of Yarn?\xa0 Hell yeah!\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Blurred Lines jumper progress is shown on an old mannequin \xa0 Semi tonal blue yarn with a real halo to it and it’s called ‘Sprucey Bonus’ because it is the colour of the underside of a Spruce Tree.\xa0 It is paired with a yarn called ‘Sulk’ and is on an ecru pink base with small patches of teal blue, acid yellow, sea green and plummy purples.\xa0 \xa0You can see the difference betweek the two variegated skeins.Remember that there is a very informal MAL.\xa0 You have from now until 7th September to make or finish off a garment.\xa0 WIPs are allowed, it can be in any craft and any garment pattern, you just need to use the #crochetcirclemal and I have also opened a Ravelry thread for you to add to.\xa03 – Final DestinationI only have one FO to show you.\xa0 By the time you hear and see this podcast, I will be busy setting up my stand ay Yarnfolk festival in Northern Ireland.\xa0 I was fortunate enough to be asked to create a crochet design for the festival and came up with Kinbaine.\xa0 I talked about it in Episode 43 and showed off the saturated colour version.\xa0I wanted to make a second version using just two colours and used a collaboration yarn between John Arbon Textiles and RiverKnits.\xa0 This yarn has now sold out and the shawl is with Becci and Markus at RiverKnits, but I can at least show you the shawl and the yarn colours caked up.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT:\xa0 White background with a vintage mannequin covered in the Kinbaine shawl.\xa0 The shawl is thick stripes, using two different semi-variegated colours.\xa0 The main colour is copper and the contrast is green with hints of teal and brown.\xa0Kinbaine is now live on Ravelry and up on my website.\xa0 It’s the standard price on Ravelry and I have the pay what you can option on my website.\xa0\xa04 – En RouteMonogamous me means that I am just working on the Blurred Lines jumper at the moment as a personal project, but taking my own words of advice, I have swatched for a new crocheted garment – the Bark Sweater by Sidsel Sangild.\xa0I tested out the John Arbon Textiles British Breeds 80% Romney/20% Corriedale blend on a 6mm and a 5mm hook to see which gave the best stitch definition and gauge for the project.\xa0 I definitely preferred the 5mm hook stitch definition and also as a size of hook I my hand.\xa0 The 6mm just felt a bit cumbersome and slow.\xa0The swatch is now dry and now I can work out what size of Bark Sweater I need to make and whether I want to make any alterations.\xa0ALT TEXT:\xa0 Black background with a ball of wool top right in a mushroom brown colour.\xa0 In the foreground is a crocheted swatch showing lines of front post treble crochet and chains that make up a bark pattern.\xa0 This is the swatch for my Bark Sweater.\xa05 – Feeding the HabitMy Solstice to Solstice yarn ban is going well.\xa0 I have been tempted by things but have given myself a good talking to and remembered why I am doing this!\xa0 I have enough yarn!\xa0 I actually feel a little overwhelmed by how much yarn I have and all the things I want to make with it.\xa0So, there have been no stash additions this month and I am clearly working my way through some of the garment quantities that I have bought recently, which is great.\xa0Whenever I see something that I *must have, I pop it into a list and if I still feel that way about it on 21st December 2019, then it may be a contender for my first skein after six months of no yarn.\xa0So whilst I haven’t bought anything, I did receive a lovely print through the post from Lorna (@neveratalooseend).\xa0 It was done by her daughter Eilidh (@by.eilidh on Instagram) and I love her style.\xa0 I suggest checking out both of their accounts.\xa0 Lorna also has a blog which is jam-packed, full of the many, many crafts she does.\xa0 I am hoping to see Lorna when I am at Perth Festival of Yarn.\xa0ALT TEXT: Black background with a pink, coral and purple print featuring goats, sheep, alpacas and rabbits.\xa0 Text is placed over the animals saying “all wool is yarn but not all yarn is wool”.\xa0I was also given a lovely watercolour painting by Charlie (@love.charlie) for my birthday present.\xa0 It\'s a particulat view that I love - Glencoe.\xa0ALT TEXT: Framed painting in soft greens and blues.\xa0 Deep sides of a grassy glen with a road and a small cottage.\xa0 Clouds in a blue sky.\xa06 – Quick News Beats1 -

Southern Wool Show. I will pick a random winner on the 9th August.\xa0 I will also be vending at the show, so do come and see me for a hug if you are coming.\xa07 – Big UPThere is an amazing collaboration between Lady Dye Yarns (Diane will be vending at Perth Festival of Yarn) and Jasmin from the Knitmore Girls.\xa0 To create some proper inclusion at Rhinebeck (New York Sheep and Wool Festival) they have devised the #RhineBIPOCsweater CAL/KAL.\xa0 There is a massive bundle of designs to choose from in a Ravelry bundle.\xa0 You can filter that bundle to show just crocheted designs and every single design has been created by a BIPOC designer.\xa0 You use or buy yarn from a BIPOC dyer/ producer and ideally in the following colours: purple, green, blue, golden yellow, and black.Use the #RhineBIPOCSweater and show off your make and support for inclusivity with pride!I will be crocheting up some form of garment and looking to my stash to promote BIPOC/BAME dyers that I have already purchased from.\xa0 The festival is on the 19th and 20th October, so although the dates of the CAL/KAL haven’t been nailed down yet, but working towards the 19th of October is a good call.\xa0Our friend Claudia from the Crochet Luna podcast has started a twitch channel.\xa0 Twitch is an interactive platform and you can interact with Claudia when she is on her twitch channel doing crochet.\xa0 You can send her messages and links and she can respond live.\xa0 The sessions stay online, so if you wanted to join her or go back to old videos and have somebody crochet alongside you, then it’s perfect.\xa0 \xa0I didn’t have to set up an account, I could just go straight into twitch and search for Crochet Luna.\xa0 It’s never a bad thing to sit and spend time with Claudia!\xa0I will be back on Friday the 6th of\xa0September.Fay xInstagram:\xa0Crochet_Circle_Podcast\xa0Instagram:\xa0KnitithookitInstagram:\xa0FayDHDesignsYouTube:\xa0The Crochet Circle PodcastRavelry Group:\xa0Search for The Crochet Circle Podcast in Groups\xa0\xa0\xa0 | Hello!It has been a while since I released an interview episode and I think this one is really helpful.\xa0 I had great fun chatting with Lyndsey outside in my back garden.\xa0 That does mean that there are some background noises (breeze, birds tweeting, and aggressive magpie and a small child singing down the lane).\xa0 Nonetheless, this interview is full of great tips on how to keep your self healthy while you crochet and craft.\xa0\xa0PLEASE NOTEThe information contained within this interview is intended for your general knowledge only and is not a substitute for medical advice or treatment for specific medical conditions.\xa0Here are the links to the resources Lyndsey (https://www.phoenixoh.uk/) spoke of:\xa0\xa0Hand and wrist exercises.. https://www.summitmedicalgroup.com/library/adult_health/sma_wrist_tendonitis_exercises/https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/exercises/exercises-for-wrist-hand-and-finger-problemshttp://www.relievus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hand-and-Wrist-Exercises.pdfhttps://ahpsuffolk.co.uk/Portals/1/Documents/Exercise%20Sheets/Wrist%20and%20Hand%20Pain.pdfExercises to manage all sorts of pains https://www.versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/managing-symptoms/exercise/exercises-to-manage-pain/Exercises for lower back https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/lower-back-pain-exercises/\xa0Lovely viewer Claudia watched this interveiw and recommended the follwoing: "I find it very helpful and relaxing to use gel frio relax from Naturales Canarias.... a gel which cools, relax the muscles and helps against pain and inflammation with aloe, arnica, devil‘s claw , camphor and menthol. The devil‘s claw is very good against arthritis. We all use it in the family when we feel a bit stiff or have neck and shoulder pain."So, you may want to give Naturales Canarias a try.\xa0Fay x | Hello there and welcome to The Crochet Circle Podcast and the show notes for Episode 44 – Go Garment Go.\xa0My name is Fay and this is my audio and video podcast for those that love fibre crafts, particularly crochet.\xa0 It’s a community for people that like to support their fellow humans regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, size or age.

3.5cm per stitch using a 3mm hook4 ply/light fingering weight htr (US hdc) uses about 4.5 - 5cm per stitch using a 3mm hook4 ply/light fingering weight tr (US dc) uses about 6 – 6.5cm per stitch using a 3mm hookDK dc (US sc) uses about 5cm per stitch using a 4.5mm hook.DK htr (US hdc) uses about 7cm per stitch using a 4.5mm hook.DK tr (US dc) uses about 9cm per stitch using a 4.5mm hook.So, next time you are thinking about buying a variegated yarn in person, you can measure the length of each colour change (you will need to take a little measuring tape with you) to see whether the colour changes are right for you.As a general rule, I prefer variegated yarns with quick colour changes for crochet.\xa0 I think that it leads to a nicer looking, more cohesive finished project.\xa0 You may prefer otherwise, and either way, it’s good to understand where your preference lies so that you buy yarn that you are more likely to want to use.\xa0Please don’t just walk into a yarn shop or to a yarn vendor at a show and start opening out their skeins of yarn.\xa0 If you ask them nicely, they will most likely be happy for you un-skein the yarn and take a look at it.\xa0 Often there are hidden colours inside anyway that you may not see when it is all twisted up.\xa0\xa02 – Perth Project Runway updateThe votes are now closed on the five garments that I short-listed (I have kept the list below in case you want to take another look at them).\xa0 The top that won by one vote (between Instagram and Ravelry votes counted at midnight on Thursday 13th June) was Blurred Lines by Deanne at Addydae Designs.\xa0 This was a pattern that was suggested time and time again by many of you and so I am unsurprised that it came out as the favourite.\xa0 The Citizen Pullover by Kabila Sri Punnusamy (Tunisian crochet) was the next favourite.ALT TEXT: Blurred Line jumper is being worn outside.\xa0 It is a light grey with a faded core down the trunk and arms of a light grey/teal variegated yarn.ALT TEXT: Citizen Pullover is being worn outside beside a city building.\xa0 It is a light grey with coral pink stripes running on diagonals.\xa0 Quite a long pullover with short sleeves.1 – Citizen Pullover by Kabila Sri Ponnusamy2 – Liza Pullover by Yuliya Tkacheva3 – Blurred Lines by Addydae Designs4 – Bark Sweater by Sidsel Sangild5 – Bruni Top by Elven Handmade\xa0On the Friday of Woollinn Festival of Yarn I scooted over the marquee to see Bernie at Bear in Sheep\'s Clothing to choose a variegated yarn to go with the teal blue that she had custom dyed for me.\xa0 This was the day that Bernie was launching this new base which is called Corrie Halo (50% Corriedale and 50% Mohair).\xa0 \xa0ALT TEXT: Semi tonal blue yarn with a real halo to it and it’s called ‘Sprucey Bonus’ because it is the colour of the underside of a Spruce Tree.\xa0 It is paired with a yarn called ‘Sulk’ and is on an ecru pink base with small patches of teal blue, acid yellow, sea green and plummy purples.\xa0 \xa0I know that when Stasia made her version of Blurred Lines, it took three weeks and she was working on it almost constantly.\xa0 Although I have until the 6th September to get this jumper crocheted, it’s still going to be a tall order with all of the other things I have going on at the moment.The lovely Catherine asked whether I was going to host a make along for this project.\xa0 I wasn’t but I am now!\xa0 It’s all very informal and you have from now until 7th September to make or finish off a garment.\xa0 WIPs are allowed, it can be in any craft and any garment pattern, you just need to use the #crochetcirclemal and I have also opened a Ravelry thread for you to add to.3 – Final DestinationI only have one FO to show you, my latest version of the Arria shawl.\xa0 I finally finished this just before I headed up to Cumbria to vend at Woolfest last weekend.\xa0This version is in John Arbon Textiles Harvest Hues (4ply/light fingering 400m/100g) in shades Russet and Blue Spruce and I am loving the shawl in solid colours.ALT TEXT:\xa0 White background with a vintage mannequin covered in the Arria shawl.\xa0 It has a deep V front with dark petrol blue triangle segments running in a spine up the centre of the shawl.\xa0 The rest of the shawl is in a russet brown/orange colour.\xa04 – En RouteMonogamous me means that I am just working on the Blurred Lines jumper at the moment as a personal project.\xa0 There is a design project on the go at the moment but I will show you that in a future episode.\xa0So, for the next couple of episodes, it may just be all about Blurred Lines because it needs up to 600g of 4 ply yarn\xa0 - that’s 2,400m of yarn to crochet!\xa0So, here’s my progress so far.\xa0 I have completed the neck ribbing and the second round of increases.\xa0 I keep on trying the project on to make sure it fits nicely.\xa0 If you are interested in making one of these, I am making notes for each stage that I pass through in my Ravelry project.\xa0 If you want to take a look, simply search for ‘Perth Project Runway Blurred Lines’ under projects.\xa0 I will also be adding updates to Ravelry.ALT TEXT: The collar and beginnings of a yolk in a mid teal blue sit on a grey background.\xa0 To the right is\xa0a small ball of the same coloured yarn and above is a cake of the variegated pinky/ecru yarn which is the contrast colour.\xa0I am hoping to get to the contrast colour in the next couple of days and am intrigued to see how the variegated skein will work up.Deanne, the designer of Blurred Lines is an absolute star and has offered up some free patterns.\xa0 To be in with a chance of winning one of her brilliantly written patterns, simply leave a comment in YouTube, Ravelry (there is a specific thread called Garment Make Along in time for Perth Festival of Yarn) or on the Instagram post for Episode 44 over @crochet_circle_podcast\xa05 – Feeding the HabitOooh, it has been a bit of a month and all of my purchases probably seem ridiculous, but I have plans, oh yes, I have plans!! Mwahahahahahahaaaa!My biggest plan of all is that I have signed up to a solstice to solstice yarn ban with a friend.\xa0 So, design yarn aside, I won’t be buying any yarn until the winter solstice on the 21st December.\xa0 \xa0\xa0In 2017 I only bought design yarn, so know that I can manage 6 months.\xa0 It is time to work through some of my stash!\xa0ALT TEXT: Two handmade bags on a grey background.\xa0 The one on the left has a deep brown base and the top is bold autumnal coloured flowers and seed heads with a drawstring.\xa0 Little balls of different coloured fibres are spilling out of the top and some ocean-inspired stitch markers are nearby.\xa0 The bag to the right has a material handle and is cream with shop fronts of cafes and coffee shops.These two bags were lovely gifts from friends.\xa0 Marceline and I agreed way back at Edinburgh Yarn Festival to do a bag swap as we both aim to improve our machine sewing skills.\xa0 The date was set for when she was over vlogging Woollinn Festival of Yarn. You can catch up with Marce’s trip to Dublin and the festival from her YouTube Channel.\xa0 While I was vending at this festival – one of the friendliest I have ever been to – I was also given a bag by Sophie from A Spring Snowflake Podcast.\xa0 I am so spoiled!Then there is some yarn!\xa0 I have been at the John Arbon Open Mill Weekend, Woollinn Festival of Yarn and Woolfest in the last month.\xa0 Here is what has come in.\xa0 The John Arbon wool is a mill special; before the open weekend they spin various colours together, so they are one-offs and sometimes move into a bit of a fade.\xa0 I bought a jumper’s worth of this in a 4 ply and it will fade from a blue and cream into teal and cream. I also have a jumper’s quantity of the undyed Romney that I initially bought for my knitted Canisp jumper.\xa0 I finished Canisp and the shape didn’t look right on me but looked fab on Juliet and she insisted on replacing the finished jumper with the means for me to make myself another. The Romney Sportweight is now destined to become a Bark Sweater which will be my next crocheted garment after I have finished Blurred Lines.\xa0ALT TEXT: Four skeins of marled yarn on a grey background.\xa0 The skeins are all marled with a grey/cream but fade from teal to blue.ALT TEXT: THree skeins of a mushroom brown wool lie on a grey background.\xa0 The labels have sheep on them and sat Romney.\xa0 The twist of the yarn is obvious and squishy.At Woollinn I picked up a couple of skeins for a one-skein shawl design that I am working on.\xa0 The first is a beautiful blend of Alpaca and silk from Tara at Irish Artisan Yarns.\xa0 I love that Tara is inspired by the colours of her home turf of the Antrim Coast in Northern Ireland.\xa0 The second is a skein of Alpa-Si-Li (50% Alpaca, 25% silk, 25% linen) in colourway Passion, by Dye Dye Done.\xa0 I was vending along from both of these lovely vendors at Woollinn which was an absolute delight.\xa0 Dye Dye Done is a husband and wife team.\xa0 Hanna is an extremely talented knitwear designer and Daniel is the yarn dyer – what a duo!\xa0 They also have vegan yarns.\xa0 \xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Grey background with a skein of pale, delicate and luxurious yarn at the front from Irish Artisan Yarns.\xa0 It is pink, purple and grey.\xa0 Behind it sits a ball of yarn with the tail pulled forward.\xa0 It\'s plummy purple/scarlet with silver slivers running through it.On our way up to Woolfest in Cumbria, we stopped off at Blackwell Arts and Crafts House.\xa0 It is a stunning example of arts and crafts architecture and interior design and well worth a visit.\xa0 It’s right beside Lake Windermere.\xa0 While I was there, I picked up a Japanese book on embroidery called ‘Simply Stitched’ by Yumiko Higuchi which is stuffed full of beautiful projects that you can use odds and ends of wool and cotton for.\xa0ALT TEXT: Grey background with the \'Simply Stitched\' book lying flat.\xa0 The front cover shows examples of embroidery motifs (trees, flowers, a chicken), all sewn with wool thread.\xa0\xa06 – Quick News Beats1 - Global Hook Up – I have set the dates for the next six months and will stick to the 8 pm GMT/BST on a Saturday night and 9 am GMT/BST on a Sunday morning.The details for the next sessions are already up in the Ravelry thread, can also be found below and will be put out on Instagram in advance.The meeting ID number is\xa0475-047-5819\xa0and you will need to join via Zoom which you can do here:\xa0\xa0https://www.zoom.us/joinIf you are joining on your phone or tablet you will likely need to download the software in advance.\xa0 If you are joining from a PC or Mac, you can join via the link above.\xa0 Everyone needs to use the same ID number to get into the session.\xa0July – Saturday 20th and Sunday 21stAugust - Saturday 17th and Sunday 18thSeptember - Saturday 21st and Sunday 22nd \xa0October - Saturday 19th and Sunday 20th \xa0November - Saturday 23rd and Sunday 24th \xa0December - Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th \xa02 – The good folk behind The Craft Bank on Ravelry, Lisa and Sophie are hosting a gift-along.\xa0 You just need to go to The Craft Bank Group on Ravelry and fill in the very quick online survey that is linked and then you will be paired up with a partner.\xa0 I have already signed up, so some lucky, lucky soul will be getting a dodgy project bag from me…3 – \xa0I have a handful of yarn shows left that I am vending at in 2019 and the next one to let you know about is Yarnfolk in Northern Ireland on Saturday 3rd of August.\xa0 It’s a one-day show in Whitehead (accessible via train from Belfast) and is such a friendly show.\xa0 This will be my third year vending there, which says a lot really.\xa07 – J’adoreWhile I was up in the Lake District with my friend Annabel, our lovely hosts Sarian and Andrew took us for a picnic to Derwent Water.\xa0 It was a cracking evening by the lakeshore and I went swimming! In the lake!ALT TEXT: A lake with mountains in the background.\xa0 Some stones are in the foreground with various people out swimming and a man and his dog on a paddle board.\xa0 I am one of the swimmers!I am now a little obsessed with the idea of wild swimming.\xa0 It wasn’t as cold as you might think!\xa0 My very lovely Papa Bear has asked me to go to Iceland with him in November, so I see a lot of trips to geothermal plunge pools and outdoor pools in my future.\xa0\xa0I will be back on Friday the 2nd of\xa0August.Fay xInstagram:\xa0Crochet_Circle_Podcast\xa0Instagram:\xa0KnitithookitInstagram:\xa0FayDHDesignsYouTube:\xa0The Crochet Circle PodcastRavelry Group:\xa0Search for The Crochet Circle Podcast in Groups\xa0\xa0 | Hello there and welcome to The Crochet Circle Podcast and the show notes for Episode 43 – Monogamous Me.\xa0My name is Fay and this is my audio and video podcast for those that love fibre crafts, particularly crochet.\xa0 It’s a community for people that like to support their fellow humans regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, size or age.

Citizen Pullover has a main colour of light grey with diagonal stripes\xa0 in both directions in a dark coral.\xa0 Short sleeves.2 - Liza Pullover - all in grey with a grid like/basket weave construction and short sleeves.3 - Blurred Lines has main colour at the top and bottom in a light grey and fades into a central yarn of variegated teal and grey through bust, waist and arms.\xa0\xa04 - Bark Sweater is in a light grey and has clear open/ lace sections that are leaf shaped.5 - Bruni Top is in a dusky pink and is lacy all over with a hollow at the base of the back and ties at the base.\xa0Now we are ready for the next stage – you get to vote which garment wins.\xa0 I have created a thread in Ravelry and will pop a poll up on Instagram during the weekend.\xa0 Whichever pattern is chosen, that is the pattern I will crochet for the show.\xa0 So, get voting!\xa0 It’s a short vote because I will be getting the yarn from Bernie at Bear in Sheep\'s Clothing when I see her at Woollinn Yarn Festival on the 14th of June.\xa0 \xa0\xa03 – Final DestinationI have been a monogamous crafter of late.\xa0 My work-life is pretty full on at the moment and I know that having lots of WIPs fogs my mind, so I have been trying to only have one crochet and one knitting project on that go at any one time.\xa0 It’s amazing how quickly you get through projects when you just concentrate on them one at a time!\xa0Part of what spurred me on with this is that it has taken me eight (!) months to complete my Fallen Leaves socks and I have quite a lot of guilt attached to that.ALT TEXT: A pair of socks on a grey background.\xa0 They are crocheted from the same pattern which has a waffle type effect. The sock on the left is a light blue with pops of green and grey.\xa0 The sock on the right is a bright raspberry pink and some striping can be seen where the skein has slightly darker patches.\xa0The pattern is by Vicki Brown and I used two different yarns from Kathryn at Crafternoon Treats.\xa0 The pink is called Darkly Raspberry and it’s a non-superwash blend of 80% Corriedale and 20% nylon.\xa0 The blue speckled one is called Forest Skies and is Superwash, 80% Corriedale and 20% nylon.\xa0 I deliberately did the other sock in the same pattern but using a different base from Kathryn so that I could investigate any differences with superwash and non-superwash and durability.\xa0 I have enough yarn in both colours left to knit a pair of socks (also different colours) so that I can test the yarn for knitted socks too.\xa0\xa0I am always on the lookout for yarns that are suitable for socks and aren’t super-wash or have a reduced nylon content.\xa0\xa0The second item I finished was the latest version of Doppio Colosseum in the birthday yarn colourway ‘The Moor’ that RiverKnits dyed up for Kate at Northern Yarn in Lancashire.\xa0 This is proper woolly wool – it’s a Poll Dorset breed (Jennett 4 ply is Poll Dorset Lambswool) and it has a real plumpy squish to it and because of that, I moved up to a 3.5mm hook so that the fabric didn’t become dense and rigid.\xa0 This shawl will be heading up to Northern Yarn next week or so, so if you are ever in there, you will be able to give it a squish.\xa0My final FO is a new shawl design that I have been working on.\xa0 This will be my third year vending at Yarnfolk in Whitehead Northern Ireland.\xa0 Louse runs the show and also has a gorgeous yarn shop – Lighthouse Yarns, in the middle of town.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT:\xa0 The tip of a striped shawl in three colours (dark stormy blue, raspberry pink and seaweed green).\xa0 At the end of each colour stripe is a point, representing a rooftop.At the end of the festival last year, Louise got talking about crochet designs for the 2019 festival and she asked whether I would like to do one.\xa0 Well, I have never known so many crocheters as there are in Whitehead (far more crocheters than knitters in fact), so it is a complete honour to be able to create a pattern for the festival.\xa0\xa0I decided on a shawl because almost every crocheter I know loves a shawl, but I also wanted to represent the town of Whitehead in some way.\xa0 Whitehead is a Victorian seaside town and has pretty coloured houses along the shorefront – that is absolutely perfect for pulling into a shawl design.\xa0\xa0On the same timeline, John Arbon Textiles released their new sock yarn – Exmoor Sock and the range of colours is fabulous.\xa0 They come in 50g skeins, which makes them perfect for adding colour to shawls without having to break the bank.\xa0 Et voila, Kinbane (Gaelic for Whitehead) was dreamt up as three colour striped shawl with pointed rooftop edges based on the shorefront houses of the town.\xa0 I didn’t think that naming the shawl after a spot was a good idea 😉\xa0The shawl uses 150g of the main colour and 50g each of two other colours, so has real potential to be a stash buster.\xa0 I can see this being worked up with variegated yarns too.\xa0\xa0The stitch used is a Half treble herringbone stitch (half double in the US) and it creates a lovely thin fabric that is perfect for shawls.\xa0 I was also consciously trying to create a shawl that is gender neutral, which I think I have achieved?\xa0If you are coming to the festival (Saturday 3rd August), Whitehead, Northern Ireland, then you will receive a download code for the pattern in the event programme.\xa0 John and Juliet will also be bringing Exmoor Sock with them, so you can look at all of the colours and ask me for colour combinations.\xa0 \xa0\xa0After the show, the pattern will go live on Ravelry, on my website and hard copies will be available too, but I will let you know all about that in the August podcast.\xa04 – En RouteI only have one crochet thing on the go at the moment – see – I’m being monogamous.\xa0 Because I am ridiculous, I thought I could quickly crochet up another sample of my Arria shawl before I head down to vend at the John Arbon Open Weekend on Friday.\xa0 It’s not going to be finished on time but will at least be there for folk to squish and see even more crocheted items in their lovely yarns.\xa0 I also love standing and crocheting as I talk to customers, so that’s what I will be working on this weekend.\xa0ALT TEXT: Grey background with the beginnings of a triangular shawl and three cakes of yarn at the top.\xa0 The main colour is russet brown and the small triangles making up the spine of the shawl are in a deep teal colour.\xa0This sample is in Harvest Hues (4ply/light fingering 400m/100g) in shades Russet and Blue Spruce.\xa05 – Feeding the HabitIt has been a very quiet month for purchases, mainly because I’m off to the mill weekend and we all know I will be incapable of coming back without wool from there, and also, I am vending at Woollinn the week after and pick up the yarn from Bernie for the Perth Runway.\xa0 So, I curbed my will to buy all the things this month.\xa0That said, I did receive some yarn through the post from Kim at Town End Yarns.\xa0 I was talking to her at Yarndale back in September about sock yarn no, or reduced nylon but using alpaca for strength instead.\xa0 Kim specialises in Alpaca based yarns and also knows a thing or two about socks.\xa0She sent me two cakes of her Cumbria Sock Yarn natural and pink.\xa0 The blend is 47% British Alpaca, 43% Bluefaced Leicester which is local to her and 10% nylon and it’s all made in the UK.\xa0\xa0I plan to knit these up so that I can test out the durability of a reduced nylon blend of sock yarn.\xa0 It is beautiful to touch.\xa0\xa0I want to get to a point where I can test out lots of different reduced/no nylon yarns to see how they perform.\xa0 I generally stand up all day long, so I know I can put them through some hard work.\xa0\xa06 – Quick News Beats1 - Global Hook Up – I have had to change the date of the June Global Hook Up because I am now vending that weekend. \xa0The new dates and times are Saturday 22nd June at 8 pm (BST) and Sunday 23rd June at 9 am BST.2 – Thank you to those that are taking me up on my ‘Pay what you can pattern pricing’.\xa0 It’s available on my website for electronic versions and if you are unable to pay the lowest amount of £2 then please get in touch with me using the details given in The Craft Bank group on Ravelry and I will send you the electronic pattern for free, no questions asked.3 – The carpet moths are back in my living room. \xa0We haven’t used that room for months, so these are very likely moth eggs that were lying dormant all winter until the rise in temperature.\xa0 Just a quick reminder on how to protect your stash from the moth larvae.\xa0Put your yarn into a sealable bag.Freeze the bag for five days.Take the bag out of the freezer for five days but leave the yarn sealed inside.Freeze the bag for a further five days.\xa0The initial freeze should kill off the larvae.\xa0 If there are some particularly hardy ones, they will survive the freeze and come to life during the defrosting period, and then be killed off during the second freeze.\xa0 Then choose to either store your yarn in those bags or in a moth free room of your home. \xa0\xa0My Stash Palace is 100% moth free which is why I freeze all yarns before they go in there.\xa0\xa0\xa07 – Big UpThis month’s Big Up goes to Lyndsey from Phoenix Occupational Health.\xa0 Lyndsey gave up her time to come and be interviewed and answer all of your questions on how to craft and look after your bodies.\xa0She is great fun and very knowledgeable.\xa0 We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours out in my garden talking about crochet.\xa0\xa0Lyndsey has just started cooking curries and as a thank you from us to her, I used some of the money that you have kindly added to the Kofi account to buy her three, second hand (of course) curry recipe books from my favourite Indian recipe write, Anjum Anand.\xa0It was also Claudia’s birthday this week – happy birthday my friend!\xa08 – J’adore\xa0My laser cutter!\xa0 I got a proper kick up the backside when I realised that I have had it for a year and not produced half the things I wanted to.\xa0 I have learned a lot with this machine and really love the quality of goods I am getting as a result.\xa0 This weeks’ efforts have centred around needle and hook gauges and Kitchener and crochet stitch reckoners.\xa0 I am trying to produce things that are practical, functional and look good.\xa0 Watch this space for more things to come.\xa0Even better, do you have any suggestions for tools that would be useful? Sock blockers are a given!\xa0I will be back on Friday the 5th of\xa0July.\xa0Fay xInstagram:\xa0Crochet_Circle_Podcast\xa0Instagram:\xa0KnitithookitInstagram:\xa0FayDHDesignsYouTube:\xa0The Crochet Circle PodcastRavelry Group:\xa0Search for The Crochet Circle Podcast in Groups\xa0 | Hello there and welcome to The Crochet Circle Podcast and the show notes for Episode 42 – The Craft Bank.My name is Fay and this is my audio and video podcast for those that love fibre crafts, particularly crochet.\xa0 It’s a community for people that like to support their fellow humans regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, size or age.

I can stretch to 6 x 100g of 4 ply, but I would prefer something around the 4-500g mark.Let’s talk about granny stitch and granny squares.\xa0 I know lots of you love them, but I just don’t and that isn’t the image that I want to portray for contemporary crochet going down the Perth Festival of Yarn Runway.\xa0 So, without being rude, please don’t send me ideas of crocheted garments that have these elements.\xa0 I really want to show how crochet is moving on from what people already perceive it to be.So, here’s what to do if you want to be part of Perth Project Runway:1 – Respond with YouTube comment or Podbean comment or DM me @crochet_circle_podcast (on Instagram).2 – Let me know what the garment is called and who the designer is.3 – Don’t worry if the design is for DK or worsted weight rather than 4 ply.\xa0 I can make changes to the pattern to make it fit and be able to use Bernie’s yarn.\xa0In next month’s podcast, I will have looked at all the options sent to me and whittled it down to 3-5 patterns that I would be happy to make and wear.\xa0 You then get to vote on the final pattern choice and your decision is final, not mine!I will make a bundle of all of your suggestions in Ravelry so that you can easily see all of the suggestions in one place.I will pick up the yarn from Bernie in June (it will likely be a custom dye lot) and then get hooking away from mid-June, ready for Perth Festival of Yarn on the 7th & 8th September.\xa0Festival tickets went on sale last weekend and it is looking like a fantastic show.\xa0 I think there is still a handful of tickets for the Gala evening – it would be lovely to have some Crochet Clan folk there if you fancy it?It’s all very exciting!\xa04 – Final DestinationThis is my one and only FO this month and I finished it at the beginning of the month when I was in Scotland!\xa0 I was vending at two, weekend shows, which has taken up most of my time.I don’t seem to like this jumper until I put it on and then I like it.\xa0 I seriously considered ripping it all out this morning and then I put it on to record the podcast and though “you’re not so bad!”ALT TEXT a flat lay of my Esja Sweater on a wooden floor.\xa0 The sweater is crocheted using a mid-blue grey yarn as the main colour and a speckled mid-blue, teal and rust yarn for the crocheted brioche areas of the yolk. \xa0\xa05 – En RouteI don’t have much to show here either – sorry.\xa0 I am just about to finish off another Doppio Colosseum that I have crocheted for Kate at Northern Yarn in Lancaster.\xa0 She is keen to have more crochet in her shop and as part of her 3rd Birthday celebrations this Friday, she has had some of her Poll Dorset lambswool custom dyed by an indie dyer.\xa0 Two skeins of the wool were passed to me to crochet Doppio Colosseum.\xa0 The colours and indie dyer are under wraps until Friday night, so I won’t be able to share it with you until then.\xa0 Needless to say, I will show it off as an FO in the June podcast and post about it on Instagram this weekend.I have also made a start on my Canisp jumper using the Romney/Corriedale yarn that I showed off in last month’s podcast.\xa0 It’s just rounds of knitted stripes for now, and so I won’t show you that until I am a bit further in.\xa0\xa0 The Romney/Corriedale is working up a treat though and I plan to have this off the needles, ready for the John Arbon Textiles Open Weekend at the beginning of June.\xa0 If you fancy coming to that, just follow the link above – it’s a great day trip out, but you have to book.\xa06 – Feeding the habitI’m trying to slow down on my wool purchases.\xa0 My Stash Palace is bulging at the moment and it’s starting to make me feel a little uneasy.\xa0 That said, I still have some Feeding the habit for you this month, but a fair amount of it was given to me as presents.If you watch my Instagram stories, you will know that I was at the New Lanark Mill in Scotland at the beginning of April.\xa0 I first went there as a Conservation student, about 23 years ago.\xa0 If you want to know more about the mill, follow this link. It’s a very interesting place and happens to now spin Scottish wool on their original machinery.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: New Lanark Mill in the sunrise/set, nestled by the river at the bottom of a steep valley.\xa0 Lots of mill buildings glowing orange with green trees surrounding the site.ALT TEXT: Inside New Lanark Mill with arched windows and vintage macjinery the length of the long hall.\xa0 Old tiled floor and a worker keeping the machinery going.I had promised myself a jumper’s quantity of wool from there are my birthday jumper wool this year.\xa0 What I didn’t expect was to find such an utter bargain.\xa0 There was a random hank of 4 ply yarn that was labelled up as £22.50.\xa0 I asked them to check whether that was right, because it seemed like a lot of wool for such little money, and I was assure that it was correct.\xa0 When I got it home, I discovered that it was a 450g hank!\xa0 So, this is destined to be some form of colour-work birthday jumper – probably knitted because of the low twist on it.\xa0 See photo from ball winder cakes for New Lanark wool purchased (Donegal Silk Tweed 4 ply ‘Light Limestone’ 90% wool/10% silk)I also had a very good discussion with them about crochet and crocheted samples.\xa0 They don’t have any out in their shop, but I am going to design something in their yarn – probably next year.\xa0 Think – thistle based colour-work shawl and you will be spot-on.When I was vending at Wonderwool Wales last weekend, my stand neighbour was a lovely lady called Helen from Nellie and Eve.\xa0 We share the same environmental ideals and Helen’s naturally dyed British breed yarns quite honestly took my breath away.\xa0ALT TEXT: Photo 1 is of Helen at her stand surrounded by lovely skeins of pastel, soft wools.\xa0 Photo 2 is a close up of the two skeins of 4ply British wool I bought from Helen.\xa0 The light siege green skeins lie on a grey background with white skein bands.\xa0Helen is keen to have crocheted samples on her stand and I want to help her achieve that.\xa0 So, I bought two skeins of wool (75% BFL/25% Masham in a 4 ply) from her and the ideas for them are starting to filter through.\xa0 It may be next year before any of these designs come to fruition, but I am happy to be able to support companies that really want to have crochet as part of their offering.I also received some very lovely, surprise gifts through the post from Tania and Edwyn.\xa0\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Photo 1 - three skeins of creamy Dorest Down wool.\xa0 One lies on top of the other two, with white/green labels and the black TJ Frog logo.Photo 2 - Grey background with a linen, zippered bag with a print of large Dorest Buttons on oranges, browns and black.\xa0 Green TJ Frog tag lies to the left.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Photo 3 - grey background with a "crochet Workshop\' book by James Walters.\xa0\xa07 - Quick News Beats\xa01 – Winners of 3 year podiversary were announced and I have been in touch with everyone.\xa0 Thank you for entering and giving so many great comments on what crafts you would like to master in 2019.2 – Thank you to everyone that is supporting me through the Ko-fi account.\xa0 I was really quite bowled over by the response.\xa0 During the course of the weekend I promise to go and grab a coffee on you and sit in my local town, crocheting and chilling out.\xa0Thank you also for leaving comments, tagging me on Instragram, following me.\xa0 It all makes a massive difference to the algorithm and helps to wide our community.\xa03 – May Global Hook Ups are on Saturday 11th May at 8pm BST and the 12th May at 9am BST.\xa0 Everyone is welcome.4 – I am recording the interview with Lyndsey from Phoenix Occupational Health in a couple of weeks, so you still have time to get some questions in.\xa0 The interview will likely come out in July because of other time pressures.5 – Happy 50th Birthday to Katherine- you know, the one with all the cats on Instagram!\xa0 \xa0\xa08 – J’adoreI have a new to me podcast for you - Quirky Monday Craftcast by Caleisha AKA @nadiratani\xa0Caleisha is based in Florida and is primarily a crocheter but dabbles in lots of other crafts too.\xa0 She is bright, positive and full of energy!\xa0 Go watch her, she will most definitely help to top up your positivity batteries.I will be back on Friday the 7th June.Fay xInstagram:\xa0Crochet_Circle_Podcast\xa0Instagram:\xa0KnitithookitInstagram:\xa0FayDHDesignsYouTube:\xa0The Crochet Circle PodcastRavelry Group:\xa0Search for The Crochet Circle Podcast in Groups\xa0 | Hello there and welcome to The Crochet Circle Podcast and the show notes for Episode 41 – Three Years Old.My name is Fay and this is my audio and video podcast for those that love fibre crafts, particularly crochet.\xa0 It’s a community for people that like to support their fellow humans regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, size or age.

So, here’s what I hate about my old ball winder and love about the new one:1 – OLD: it creates a very tight cake which means that my yarn is being held under tension.NEW: the cakes are taller and wider, so the yarn is not under the same amount of tension and pressure.2 – OLD: it’s mainly made of plastic and is flimsy.NEW: It’s predominantly made of wood with a little plastic and some metal.\xa0 It feels very substantial and durable.3 – OLD: the metal finger that your yarn is placed through stopped standing on its own after about the third use.NEW: The metal finger is very firmly in place and does not move as part of the ball winder set-up.4 – OLD: the cakes almost always get tangled at the bottom of the spinner towards the end of the skein wind.\xa0 I have had t o cut my yarn before now, to release it.NEW: The wooden base that the yarn caked up from is much bigger and can more than cope with the job.5 – OLD: The ball winder struggles to create neat mini cakes.NEW: The cakes are neat and seem to be staying in place.\xa0 I need to test whether they work well or not though.6 – OLD: It’s really difficult to get a nice centre pulled ball that doesn’t get knotted up.NEW: There is a space big enough to get your fingers into to pull the centre yarn from.\xa0 The cake seems to have more space in the core, so I am hopeful that the centre pull will be easy and not tangled.The KnitPro ball winder also makes really pretty looking cakes – I know this isn’t really important, but when you have to photograph yarn as part of your living, it does factor in.\xa0ALT TEXT: two photos, both with grey backgrounds.\xa0 First shows two cakes of identical yarn, the left was wound with the plastic crappy winder and is shorter, denser and messier and the second cake is taller and prettier.\xa0 Photo two shows 3 mini skeins (2 pink and a marroon), a green with neon colour pop cake and the brown tweed one from the first photo.The wooden ball winder is clearly much bigger than the plastic one, so you will need more space to operate it, but the proof is in the pudding.If you are often caking up yarn, then I wholeheartedly recommend this bit of kit.\xa0 I bought mine from Nikki at Ewe Felty Thing and it arrived within a week.\xa0 It’s not a cheap option at £105 + P&P, however, this is a piece of essential equipment for my hobby and job and I expect to be using this until the day I die.\xa0 Caking yarn is now a joy and not a task, especially when they come out in such a pretty shape!\xa0\xa02 – Crochet inclusivityLast month, I said that I was only going to purchase yarns from vendors that had crochet samples out.\xa0 I spent much of Edinburgh Yarn Festival diligently asking whether yarn dyers and vendors had crochet samples that I could see.\xa0 I got mixed reactions!\xa0 Some stall holders had some crochet, but the vast majority did not.\xa0 That isn’t specific to EYF, I find that to be the case at most yarn festivals.\xa0Beyond the snobby reactions that I sometimes receive around crochet, there is a fundamental lack of understanding around our craft.\xa0 That may be because the vendors don’t crochet or they did it years ago and associate it with blankets, acrylic yarn and clashing colours.There are also the urban myths that surround crochet – such as it’s yarn hungry; done by grannies, or that there are no contemporary crochet designs coming through!\xa0 In the podcast I reference a piece of research I did on knitting v crochet for grams used.\xa0 You can access that research via my blog post here.\xa0\xa0With most things in life, I am more carrot than stick.\xa0 I am willing to put the work in to help educate people on crochet as a craft.\xa0 My plan is to do this by writing an open letter to yarn shops, indie dyers, yarn vendors, yarn festival organisers that don’t currently give consideration to crocheters.As part of the open letter, I will point them towards resources that dispel the urban myths and showcase the fantastic contemporary crochet that we have.\xa0 In the long-term, I plan to pull together a Crochet Collective whereby, yarn shops etc. can call upon a list of crochet designers that have beautiful crochet patterns that have been fully tech edited and deserve space and attention in yarn shops, at shows and on Instagram.\xa0Needless to say, this is all going to take time, so watch this space.\xa0 I always say to Matthew that “if I haven’t helped to change the face of crochet by the time I die, I simply didn’t work hard enough!” \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa03 – Final DestinationI can finally share my secret projects with you!\xa0 Before Christmas, I started working on a shawl called Drucilla.\xa0 It was kept a secret because it is one of the patterns in the new John Arbon Textiles publication, The Annual.\xa0 There are three knitting patterns in The Annual and my crochet pattern.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT for four clsutered photos: Top left has a\xa0 grey background with some beach pebbles placed to the left of The Annual front cover. with skeins of yarn on a wooden table, mill bobbins on the floor.\xa0 Top right is a blue wall with a dusky mauve shawl with a marroon border on a mannequin.\xa0 Bottom left has a grey background with The Annual opened at a page with a triangular version of the shale in a marroon colour and dark browny/black border.\xa0 Modelled out on Exmoor by a young female.\xa0 Bottom right is the same but the shawl is now shown as a C2C version in a very light grey/blue laceweight yarn.\xa0All yarns are from John Arbon Textiles.\xa0 Top right used 2 x 100g skeins of Knit By Numbers DK KBN90 and 1 x mini skein DK in\xa0 KBN75Bottom left used 2 x Devonia 4ply in colourway \'Bleeding Heart\' and 1 x colourway \'Cinder Glow\'.Bottom right used 2 x 100g skeins of Alpaca 2-3 ply (heavy laceweight) in colourway \'Sea Spray\'.Drucilla is a great all-rounder shawl, using V stitch.\xa0 You can do it with one or two skeins, keep it as a triangular shawl or make it into a C2C shawl as I did with the heavy lace version.\xa0 I have also just finished off a DK weight version to show that it can be crocheted from laceweight up to DK.\xa0If you want to get your hands on the pattern, The Annual can be purchased via the John Arbon website.\xa0 It costs £5 plus P&P.\xa0 The whole thing is packed full of information and fun elements, like a spot the difference game!\xa0I have also finished off some knitted socks.\xa0 A pair for my best friend, Jenny and a pair for my Dad.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT:\xa0 Two photos both with a grey background.\xa0 The first shows a charcoal grey pair of socks with hot pink stripes, heels and toes.\xa0 The second is a plain tealy/ blue pair of socks.Striped socks are in Dragon Hill Studio 4 ply \'Metro Pinstripe\'. Second pair is in Lang Jawoll, colourway \'Peacock\'.\xa04 – En RouteThe saga of my Esja jumper continues! I had hoped to be showing you how to work the sleeves as part of the podcast, but I ran out of yarn! \xa0We are heading up to Scotland on Friday, so I will pop into Blacksheep Wools on the way and pick up an extra skein and hopefully finish it off in the car on the way to Ben Nevis.\xa0Next month, I WILL be wearing my Esja jumper!\xa05 – Designs in ProgressLast month I showed off a Barcelona inspired long cowl that I had been working on.\xa0 It now has a name – Rocamora, after the family that lived in the building of the same name that inspired the cowl.\xa0 I have actually submitted the design into a newish online magazine called Yarn People.\xa0 I really like the inclusive nature of the magazine and the fact that they aren’t fussed about whether the pattern has already been published or talked about within the yarn community.\xa0Whilst I wait to hear whether the submission was successful or not, I am busy working up another version of it that is much short and only uses three colours.\xa0 There may be a third example in the offing which is a fade option too…ALT TEXT: Grey background with wooden ball winder at top with mid grey yarn sat, balled up on it, foxy orange yarn in a skein to the left, a partial cake of dark grey yarn and a work in progress ribbed cowl with a green metal crochet hook.\xa06 – Feeding the habitMy friend Nic was in Australia, visiting family.\xa0 We agreed to do a yarn swap whereby, she brought me back some lovely yarns from that side of the world, and I brought her back yarns form Edinburgh Yarn Festival.\xa0 I failed to bring anything back for her that was suitable but will work on it when I vend at Spring Into Wool next weekend, but Nic brought me back two amazing yarns.\xa0 One from White Gum Wool in Tasmania and one from Great Ocean Road Mill in Australia.\xa0 They are so lovely and squishy!I spent a lovely day over at Ewe Felty Thing in Llandudno, North Wales, helping Nikki celebrate her shop’s 1st birthday.\xa0 There was a lot of yarn to squish (and buy).\xa0 I came away with a skein of the special birthday colourway that Nikki had dyed and some minis from Abercairn that will become sock toes, heels and cuffs (and already have in one case). I also pre-ordered my ball winder when I was there.Obviously, I brought stuff back from EYF too, but because of my point about not buying from stands that don’t have crocheted samples, I didn’t buy as much as I could have. That said, I did buy four balls of wool from Jamieson’s.\xa0 I was having an interesting discussion with one of their team and plan to recreate one of their classic Fair Isle patterns in crochet to really make that point that crochet can be beautiful and just sticking to marketing to knitters doesn’t need to be the way forward.\xa0Mainly, I got yarn from John Arbon Textiles.\xa0 My love of their wool continues, and I wasn’t really up for buying any indie dyed yarn.\xa0 So, I bought the yarns that they had created as show specials.\xa0 There is the Cocktail Yarn in colourway Dark & Stormy which is destined to be a trial for a new, simple design that I want to create (perfect for yarn shops and vendors to show off crochet with) and then a jumper’s quantity of their breed special yarns.\xa0 I bought the Romney breed because I really love how squishy it is and the soft colours that I bought.\xa0One of the real highlights of EYF for me was the Make::Wool event on the Sunday.\xa0 I didn’t get much time in sales area because I was off listening to a couple of talks.\xa0 I did, however, make a beeline for Shilasdair Yarns.\xa0 Kirsty and Simon are due to open their version of the Shilasdair Yarn Shop on the Isle of Skye this Easter.\xa0 They are still using traditional natural dyeing methods and I am very pleased to say that they have converted to using British breed yarns.\xa0 I am excited to see how they develop the company and watch with eager anticipation!\xa0\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Seven different photos all on bright yellow backgrounds, showing each of the yarn makers, dyers or designers. 1 -

She has created a permanent list in her Instagram ‘BIPOC Crochet Designers’ Highlights.\xa0 From that list, I have created a ‘BIPOC Crochet Designers’ blog post giving you the designers names, Instagram handles, Ravelry Designer names and other selling platforms.\xa0 If the designers have a podcast, website or Etsy shop, these have also been listed.If you are looking for a decent article on the topic of inclusivity in the fibre community, I encourage you to read this one: The Knitting Community is Reckoning with Racism by Jay Saxena. \xa0If for whatever reason, you have been in the fringe of the conversation or come to it late, this article gives a very good breakdown of what has been going on.\xa0 I meant to talk about this article in the podcast and through lack of organisation on my part, it slipped through the net.\xa0You will notice from the show notes below and video podcast (if you watch rather than listen) that I have started to show the makers behind the goods that I am buying. My intention is to create a greater connection between the makers and those watching the podcast and/or reading the show notes.\xa0 I want to show case the faces that put all the hard work into the fibre community whether they are designers, spinners, dyers or yarn shop owners.\xa0I continue to use ALT text on my Instagram posts and within the show notes. My intention is to also expand this out to my website photos and blog posts (which I have started the process of).\xa0\xa02 – Old Dog New TricksI want to touch briefly on gut instinct and using that to shape your colour choices and pattern following.\xa0You know that feeling when you have pulled colours together for a project, but your gut is bubbling, telling you that something isn’t quite right?\xa0 I have had that quite a bit recently.\xa0 I tend to think I am pretty good at choosing colours but of late, I have been asking for second opinions, mainly because I knew they weren’t right.\xa0The same can be said for a part of the pattern design within my Esja jumper.\xa0 I could see that the short row shaping was creating a different look within my jumper but I persevered with the pattern.\xa0 My gut told me I was wrong to do so but I ignored it – I won’t do that again.Here’s a quick trick for testing your gut feeling on something.\xa0 Using colour choice as an example; you have two choices, grey and yellow or grey and pink.\xa0 You assign each choice with a side of the coin.\xa0 Toss the coin high in the air and before you move your hand to reveal which choice has been made, listen to the voice that is telling you which one you are actually hoping for.\xa0 That is your gut reaction and the one you should actually listen to, regardless of what the coin toss actually tells you.I use this for all sorts of decisions that I make.\xa0 It’s a surprisingly easy way to make decisions and stop procrastinating!\xa03 – Final DestinationI have some quite varied finished objects this month.\xa0I finished off my latest version of Doppio Colosseum in ‘Worn Denim’ (4ply 50% Merino/50% Silk) by The Wool Kitchen.\xa0 It was a great reminder of how much I enjoyed designing this pattern and wearing it.\xa0 \xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: Mannequin against a white and teal painted wall.\xa0 The shawl draped over the shoulders of the mannequin is in denim blue colours and you can just make out some of the lace lines of the pattern.Did I mention I was in Barcelona?\xa0 Whilst I was there, I was completely taken with an amazing building on Passeig de Gracia – Rocamora Houses.\xa0 There is a ceramic turret that inspired my latest design. \xa0I wanted to capture the colours of the turret and the transition between them.\xa0 \xa0ALT TEXT: Roof top of Rocamore Houses, Passeig die Gracia, Barcelona.\xa0 Bright blue sky with three ceramic tiled turrets showing on the skyline.\xa0 The tiels are in earthy shades of brown, orange, yallow and cream.\xa0\xa0ALT TEXT: White surface with crocheted cowl doubled over .

Then my plan is to throw it out to you to see which logos speak most clearly to you of inclusivity.Recognition of makers/dyers – my plan is to seek permission from makers and dyers to show a picture of them within the video podcast and show notes.\xa0 Websites and Instagram handles don’t necessarily show the diversity within our community.\xa0 I also know that when I have seen somebody’s face, it creates more of a connection with that dyer/maker and somehow cements them in my mind.\xa0 I am also keen to do this from a business perspective because to me, seeing the face behind a small indie business is a very good for me to support them over big multi-national companies.\xa0 Let me be clear, that this is not about tokenism.\xa0 No matter who you are, if I am showing your product or yarn on the podcast and you’re are a small indie maker or dyer, I will be asking to show a photo of you in the video podcast and show notes. \xa0You have every right to decline and a photo will only appear if I have your permission.Increasing diversity in my Instagram feed – I thought that my feed was already pretty diverse.\xa0 I have a general policy of following people back unless their account is set to private.\xa0 So, I am not an account that has thousands of followers (I don’t anyway) and only follows a handful back.\xa0 That means that my account is full of lots of lovely diverse folk.\xa0However, it wasn’t until I started following #blackcrocheter #blackcrocheters #blackcraftersofinstagram #diversknitty #spooniecrafts #lgbtqcrafts #lgbtcrafts #that my feed really became diverse.\xa0 I encourage you all to do that same.\xa0 Following hashtags is a great way of finding new people on Instagram, introducing yourself and making new connections.\xa0 If you have suggestions for any other hashtags to follow, please let me know.Highlighting under-represented groups – Back in November 2018 , Jeanette Sloan was asking the fibre community to point her towards BIPoC designers.\xa0 She has done a lot of time consuming work to pull together a list from the details she was given.\xa0 A similar piece of work is being done by Marceline from the Hey BrownBerry Podcast and she has highlighted BIPoC dyers and yarn makers. \xa0Claudia from Crochet Luna podcast has been beavering away pulling together a list of BIPoC crochet designers.\xa0 \xa0She is going through the painstaking work of communicating with the designers to ask whether they are happy to be featured.\xa0 I am hoping to help Claudia to pull this list together in whatever way I can.\xa0 The list of BIPoC crochet designers is going to be on my blog over at KNIT IT – HOOK IT – CRAFT IT – because Claudia has asked me to host it there.\xa0My hope is that in time, this will also feature dyers and makers form other under-represented groups.\xa0 However, this needs to be looked at in a sensitive manner and only undertaken with the backing and permission of the people within these underrepresented groups.\xa0If you would like to be added to the work that Claudia and I are doing, then I would be really interested in having a discussion with you about what the parameters should be.Creating a more accessible podcast and Instagram accounts – I have had some very helpful and interesting Instagram discussions with Sarah from @SarahDawnDesigns.\xa0 She has been brilliant at pointing me towards ways that I can make changes to the podcast to make it more accessible for people with hearing or visual impairments.\xa0If you have a hearing impairment, I always try to face the camera and not show things in front of my face, in the hope that people are able to read my lips.\xa0 I always create show notes, and link to them from the dropdown box on YouTube.\xa0 If you are watching the video, the section place markers correlate to the different sections in the show notes which can always be found at www.thecrochetcircle.podbean.com\xa0 and I believe are in a suitable format as a text transcript.\xa0If you have a visual impairment, I try to be very descriptive with textures and colours.\xa0 Again, I believe that the show notes are in a format that are suitable for assistive technology.\xa0 In addition to the written part of the show notes, I will start adding descriptions to each photo and the caption will start with Photo: \xa0\xa0I have also started using ALT text within my Instagram feed.\xa0 I have gone back through the posts from the last month and added ALT text to those posts, but from now on, anything I post on @crochet_circle_podcast, @knitithookit or @faydhdesigns, will have ALT text attached to each of the images.The final thing I would like to add is that twice a month there is the Global Hook up.\xa0 I run it on a Saturday night and then again on the Sunday morning (both GMT/BST) so that the crafting session is available to different time zones.\xa0 Everyone is welcome in the Global Hook Ups.\xa0If you just want to check out what happens, you can join the crafting session and put something over your camera.\xa0 You also have the option to mute your microphone.\xa0 It’s really up to you how much you join in, which hopefully makes it a great crafting space for people that may be nervous about joining in. \xa0For some people, they started out by just sitting and listening and moved onto joining the conversations in the next session.\xa0 It’s free to join, you just need a decent wifi connection.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa02 – Old Dog New TricksIt feels like many people are working on crocheted garments, or plan to in 2019.\xa0 One of the factors that you may come across is wording like “increase/decrease by 12 stitches evenly across round/row”.\xa0 In my opinion this is a little unfair of a designer to leave it at that.\xa0 It isn’t hard to work out how you increase or decrease stitches, but if you haven’t done it before, then you should be getting more guidance within the pattern.I am going to use one of my en route projects as an example.\xa0 I have deliberately stopped this project where it is so that I can show you how I am going to tackle the bust decreases that I want to add in. \xa0This isn’t a feature of this pattern, it is one that I am adding in to give some shaping to the finished piece.\xa0 That said, when the pattern did call for increases it didn’t give the calculations required…I would like to think that if I ever design a garment for crochet or knitting, this is the kind of detail that I would add.\xa0If\xa0 you want to see this is video form, take a look at this video from Very Pink Knits – she is one of my favourites for giving simple hint and tips video tutorials.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Rather than using Very Pink Knits numbers, I want to use my jumper as the example piece.\xa0 I have crocheted down to just below the bust area and now I want to decrease the overall number of stitches to pull the jumper inn and give some definition.\xa0I have 269 stitches which gives me a circumference of 116cm.\xa0 I want to get down to a circumference of 104cm for under the bust so need to do an initial calculation:\xa0269 stitches/116cm means that I have approximately 2.32 stitches per cm.\xa0I want the circumference to be 105cm, so I need 244 stitches (105cm x 2.32 stitches).\xa0 My pattern requires an odd number of stitches, so I am actually going to decrease down to 243 stitches (because I rounded up to 244 in the first place).Overall, I need to reduce my number of round stitches by 26 from 269 to 243.\xa0So, my next calculation is to work out how I can decrease 26 stitches evenly across my round.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0I start with my existing total stitch count (269) and divide it by the number that I need to decrease by (26):269/26 = 10.35\xa0Again, I am going to round that number down so that I will use 10 as my answer.\xa0 Had the answer been 10.5, I would have rounded up to 11.So, next I need to multiply the number of stitches to be decreased (26) by the number of decreases (10):26 x 10 = 260 which leaves a remainder of 9 stitchesBecause I would be decreasing two stitches together, those two stitches have to be factored in as part of the two stitch decrease every 10 stitches.\xa0 This means that I will crochet 8 stitches and decrease over the last 2 stitches – giving one decrease over every 10 stitches.\xa0 The remaining 9 stitches are simply crocheted at the end.\xa0You may find it easier to attach a stitch marker at the beginning of every decrease section.\xa0 This can help to make sure that you got your maths right and keep you on the stratight and narrow when you are counting and decreasing.\xa0PHOTO: Esja Jumper (crocheted) in pale blue (main colour) and pale blue variegarted with rust and teal as a contrast.\xa0 Around the bottom of the jumper, each decrease section has been marked with a black bulb pin.\xa0Now, life isn’t that easy for me because my Esja sweater is in linen stitch which is a two stitch pattern repeat of 1dc and 1ch.\xa0 That makes the calculation a little more difficult.\xa0But here is how I have done it:269 stitches need to be reduced by 26 down to 243 stitches.To create an even decrease across the fabric without getting holes in the decrease area, I want to decrease in the following way:\xa0Hook through first ch-sp, yrh, pull up a loop, hook through next ch-sp, yrh, pull up a loop, yrh, pull through all three loops.\xa0 This action adds a bit more yarn bulk to the area and makes the decrease look less obvious.\xa0 In doing so, you are using three stitches to decrease down to one.So, I started looking for the number of stitches required per decrease section, remembering that each decrease will reduce the round by two stitches, not one.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So, here is where I started:269 stitches / by 18 stitches gives 15 decrease sections and when you multiply that by the actual number of stitches per decrease section after the decrease has been made, 16, then you would be left with approximately 240 stitches with a remainder of 3 stitches which would simply be worked at the end of the round.\xa0 You are basically looking for the division that will give you the least number of remainder stitches.\xa0Here is how a linen stitch decrease will work for me over 18 sts:Ch1, \xa0hook through first ch-sp, yrh, pull up a loop, hook through next ch-sp, yrh, pull up a loop, yrh, pull through all three loops, *ch1, skip 1 st, 1dc in next ch-sp; rep from * six (6) more times. (16 sts)I would repeat the sequence 14 more times and finish off with ch1, skip 1 st, 1dc in next ch-sp ch1 as the stitch sequence for the remaining three stitches.Clear as mud?After the podcast, I will attempt to add some progress photos so that you can see how I have marked the shawl out every 18 stitches and worked the first decrease section.\xa0\xa03 – CAL Updates\xa0The #ChristmasEveCAL is done and dusted! Once again, I had very little time to respond to the hashtags on IG.\xa0 I want to be able to, but life is crammed.\xa0 I am making some huge steps with the businesses this year and a lot of my time energy has to be on that.\xa0\xa0So, I’m going to take a little break from running CALs – mainly because I know I won’t have the time and I won’t be doing you the justice you deserve.\xa0 Things may shift by the end of the year, but for now I will try to concentrate on promoting the CALs that my fellow crafters and podcasters are running.\xa0\xa04 – Final DestinationI only have one proper finished object, because I don’t think I can legitimately show 1.5 socks as an FO!Last year I started a bag and my intention was to add to every January with my ‘Word of the Year’.\xa0 When I have previously seen people talk about their word\xa0 of the year, I have dismissed it as a load of old tosh!\xa0 Having lived with ‘Clarity’ as my 2018 word, I can now say that it definitely gave me grounding point throughout the year and gave me a flag to keep on coming back to.\xa0Clarity was meant as a word for me to stick to my core goals and not stray.\xa0 To keep on the path that I had set for the year.\xa0 Given that it was so helpful for 2018, I have now added ‘STRUCTURE’ to me bag as my word for 2019.This is the year when I hope to move KNIT IT – HOOK IT - CRAFT IT and Fay Dashper-Hughes Designs up a few notches and to do that I need to put more structure in place.So now, I think about clarity and how I can structure my work flow to achieve what I want to achieve in 2019 and beyond.\xa0Here’s what my bag looks like now.\xa0 Every year I will add to it in a Scrabble format.PHOTO: Ecru coloured linen bag with dark grey ribbon tie lying on a dark grey surface.The word CLARITY has been embroidered across the bag horizontally and STRUCTURE, embroidered vertically as if a game os Scrabble has just been started.\xa0 Three bows of linen are at the base of the bag, in a dark grey, light fawn/grey and dark mustard.The bag was made from Scottish linen that I use in some of my products.\xa0 I thin just draw around a wooden Scrabble tile to get the right size for each letter.\xa0 Using a 3 ply linen thread from Namolio https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/237661664/linen-yarn-thread-25-grams-3-ply?ref=shop_home_active_1\xa05 – En RouteI have finished one of my Fallen Leaves socks and am ready to turn the heel on the other.\xa0 I will show them off properly in the next podcast…Pattern: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fallen-leaves-socksMy Esja\xa0jumper (to be made with yarn dyed by my friend Bec of\xa0Black Horse Yarns\xa0and\xa0Socks Yeah!\xa0in the colour \'Chryso\'.\xa0 This has been really quick to crochet up so far and I only stopped to be able to use the jumper as an example in this month’s Old Dog New Tricks.Pattern: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/esja-sweater \xa0Main Colour Yarn:

distinction in colours made between the main colour (light blue) and contrast colour (light blue with rust and teal).\xa0 The contrast between the two yarns in the brioche section is very subtle.I am also working on another Doppio Colosseum shawl.\xa0 Originally, I used a yarn that Helen from The Wool Kitchen no longer dyes and she kindly gave me two skeins of yarn to make a new sample with.\xa0 The yarn is 4ply (light fingering weight), 50% Merino and 50% silk and it is beautiful to work with.\xa0 The sheen and drape are just incredible.\xa0\xa0\xa0 By the time I podcast again, I hope to have this finished so that Helen can use it on her stand at her next two festivals (Unravel and Edinburgh Yarn Festival).\xa0 It’s great to see another yarn dyer that wants to fly the crochet

to buy in 2019.\xa0 The difficulty comes when I enter yarn shops.\xa0 I want to be able to support Bricks and Mortar shops by purchasing from them and highlighting them on the podcast.\xa0So, this month I have been a bit naughty.\xa0 I went over to visit the Laxton’s spinning mill in West Yorkshire and on the way back, I ‘popped’ in to see the good folk at Black Sheep Wools.\xa0 It’s probably my most local yarn shop (about 45 minutes away) and I always like having a good natter with Sara and the others.\xa0When I was there, I picked up some of the ‘Pip Colourworks’ from Baa Ram Ewe.\xa0 I had a little mini skein of this given to me as a test skein and couldn’t really do it justice with 10g.\xa0 I have since knitted another Curlew hat with it and plan on hooking something up with it too, so that I can do a proper yarn review on it for the podcast.\xa0PHOTO: Dark background with a blurred foreground of a dark dusky rose ball of yarn.\xa0 At the back from left to right is the same

Dark grey background with a close up of Reggia Nautic Color sock yarn.\xa0 Self striping in a white and mid blue.\xa0 The ball band is yellow and shows a white sock with thin blue stripes.I also came across and had to buy the latest Regia sock yarn called Nautic Colour, which creates sailor striped socks.\xa0 I am an absolute sucker for sailor striped anything!\xa0Local Yarn Shop:

It’s a really beautiful shop that is easy to get to.\xa0 Kate works really hard at developing both the shop and her relationships with local shepherds and shepherdesses.\xa0 She only sells British yarns and many of them are local.\xa0 That is definitely something worth supporting in my opinion.PHOTO: Five balls of wool all in a horizontal row on a dark background and each with a cream "Jamiesons Shetland Spindrift" ball band.\xa0 The colours from left to right are:\xa0 a vibrant mid green, rusty red, rusty orange, bright rusty mustard and a bright mid blue.Whilst there, I picked up

This week I’m looking at feeders for getting those all important stores into our colonies in time for the coming Autumn and Winter.Catch up with more of my beekeeping journey by checking out the continually growing content list on my Patreon page www.patreon.com/norfolkhoneyWelcome back everyone to another podcast and a special hello to everyone studying at Penn State University over in the USA, particularly, hello to my daughter Beth who’s studying at Penn State and who I’ve not seen since last Christmas although with Skype and FaceTime it sometimes feels like she never went away. Hi Beth, stay tuned cos I know you’re desperate to hear how I’m going to be feeding my bees this Autumn!Before I get into the detail of the feeders here’s this weeks beekeeping update, a quieter week last week, colonies appear to have realised Summer is over and are settling down in preparation for the months ahead, not a single queen cell to be seen in any colony inspected and all of them appear to be queen right at long last. I did spend a hot sunny morning with Pete cutting away brambles from a neglected tractor at the Alpaca apiary. The tractor sits at the entrance to the apiary but for various reasons it hasn’t been used for a few years and Pete has had his eye on it for a while so I suggested to the owners they might like to move it on and that’s why Pete and I spent an hour cutting away brambles and nettles to reveal the tractor in all it’s glory. I have to say, I wouldn’t mind have a run around in it myself to cut down some of the nettles and thistles that have grown so high this summer, some of the thistles are six feet tall! I think they’ve done so well because the apiary also happens to be beside the alpaca poo pile, plenty of fertiliser feeding into the ground so everything is looking very lush.Anyway, the plan is to get the tractor working again, it currently has a dead battery, and to then get the nettles, thistles and brambles around the apiary all chopped down before Pete makes off with the tractor, then at least I might be able to get a mower in and keep on top of it. The apiary also happens to be the last remaining orchard area of the old farm that once stood here and it’s full of pear trees, I’m hoping that if I can clear a few more trees we might get a crop of nice pears for next year. Maybe I’ll be allowed to have a drive of the tractor too, if that happens I’ll be sure to get the camera running as it’s likely to end badly, probably knocking hives and feeders full of syrup off stands!With that thought in mind I should turn my attention to the main topic of today’s podcast that of feeders and feed for the bees in the Autumn. I guess firstly it would be useful to discuss why we feed at all during the Autumn months and it is fundamentally as a result of removing a honey crop from our bees. For me, it provides an income, albeit relatively small compared with many commercial bee farmers, and as such is an important part of my beekeeping practices. I know there are many hobbyist beekeepers who leave a super full of honey on their bees to overwinter and that’s fine, if you are one of those beekeepers then a lot of what I’m discussing simply won’t be relevant as you already have food stores set up on your hives. For other beekeepers who do want to take a honey crop from their bees for personal use or for friends and family it will probably mean reducing the amount of available food stores for your bees to what remains in the brood box unless of course you have had a good year and want to remove maybe just one or two supers and leave one behind for the bees. As with many tasks and processes in beekeeping there are many ways of doing things and provided you’re not reducing the bees to a level where they may starve out I don’t think any one method should |  | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 79 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet. I’ve got lots happening this week, wasps robbing, starving bees, an emergency location system and it’s pizza night at the beekeeping group.I recently posted a 60-second video to my Patreon page showing some wasps raiding a very weak colony, so weak in fact that the bees could do nothing to prevent the robbing. The colony was in fact a drone laying queen colony and was one I had decided to unite but the wasps got in first and fast! Within a week of checking them, they were all but dead and the wasps were on every frame stripping it bare.The question then comes of what to do with the hive, I think I’ve mentioned before about leaving it, as removing it runs the risk of just having thousands of wasps suddenly finding themselves without a location to rob and moving on to the next unsuspecting colony, so that’s what I’ve done. I had the same situation at another apiary, the wasps do seem to have enjoyed a very good year this year, I suspect it was the very early start that we all benefitted from. Anyway, at this other location, I decided to shut the entrance and was going to remove the hive but at that time was suffering from a rather sore back so left it in place. When I returned a week later, I found that the wasps were able to squeeze through the varroa mesh floor and get inside. They were amazingly small wasps but even so, I was surprised that they were able to get in. I had decided to remove this colony from the apiary instead of leaving it because all of the other colonies were very strong and I don’t think the wasps would have had any chance of getting in at all. And this is a good point to dwell on and mention, particularly for beginner beekeepers, there are lots of books out there giving advice and even more so-called expert beekeepers giving even more advice and sometimes it can be difficult to see the wood from the trees, but no two situations will be exactly the same, or at least very rarely the same, and making a decision as to what to do can seem quite confusing. The advice I would give is to do nothing, well, at least to start with. If you’re unsure as to what you should do just pause and grab a drink, have a sit down and think about what you’re actually seeing, take on board all the words of wisdom you’ve read and advice you’ve been given and set it against what you actually have in your apiary and then make a choice about the course of action you what to take and the reasons why you’re doing what your doing.You won’t always get it right but at least you will have had a good think about it and arrived at a reasoned decision. If it doesn’t go to plan, add it to the growing list of things you’ve tried, save the experience for the next time you’re confronted with a similar situation and give something else a go.Still, on the subject of wasps, I’ve decided I’m not going to use any wasp traps anymore, of any sort, in fact, I don’t think I’ll use any traps of any sort, I’m thinking here of Asian Hornet traps as well.I did put out a couple of wasp traps this year but they seem to gather in a wide range of insects other than the targeted wasps, it appears I’m killing a whole range of insects that really don’t deserve to be killed and as I’ve mentioned before, strong colonies don’t suffer from wasp problems. The reason for not using hornet traps is the same, and I’m not able to visit my apiaries on a daily basis to check them so it makes the exercise pointless really. I think I have more chance of spotting an Asian hornet hawking in front of the hives than catching one in a trap. It’s just my decision but I would say that most beekeepers would probably do better concentrating on making their colonies stronger than setting out traps to catch the Autumn wasp population along with a myriad of other innocent bystanders!All the colonies that needed treatments now have the Apivar strips in | This week I’m in the honey room preparing cut comb and chunk honey, cleaning up after extraction week and I’ve also been in the kitchen cooking up a fabulous Honey, Taleggio Cheese and Red Onion Tart so keep listening for the recipe.I’ve definitely seen a change in the activity within our colonies this last week, the local forage has all but disappeared and quite a number of our bees are now heading into urban gardens to seek out the strange and the unusual for those last few drops of nectar and tiny bundles of pollen.One of the most unusual plants I’ve seen honeybees foraging on here locally is a giant spike of a flower which must measure at least three metres tall and is the thickness of a telegraph pole. It turned out to be a tree Echium, it was huge, if you get a chance to take a look online then do, it was enormous. It was actually at a local garden centre which specialises in exotic plants and while many of our native plants such as bramble are all but finished a lot of these plants seemed to be in full flower still. A real blessing for many different pollinators.I’d like to plant one of these giant Echium’s but I don’t think my garden or wallet will take the strain, maybe I’ll stick with native varieties, Vipers Bugloss being the most well known I suspect.It’s meant the bees are currently chasing around finding tiny amounts of forage and waiting for the Ivy to flower, I’ve actually seen some Ivy at the allotments apiary almost in flower, certainly, the buds are very swollen and ready, it won’t be long I’m sure. This presents a challenge to the bees and beekeeper where it is in large quantities. It’s a much needed Autumn, nectar and pollen source for the bees and they do really well on it until the temperatures cool down and at that point, the Ivy honey granulates solid in the comb making it quite difficult for some colonies to utilise effectively. In some colonies, it can form a solid block preventing bees from move over or around it to get to liquid honey. And this is where beekeepers who heft and don’t notice the hive hasn’t really become lighter through the winter find the bees had a full brood box of solid Ivy honey but starved.Not all colonies struggle with Ivy and some seem to not only work it well but thrive on it through the colder months. It can also provide a late Autumn surplus for the beekeeper to harvest, I know a lot of beekeepers dislike the taste but actually, I find it a really nice flavour, strong tasting with a slightly medicinal finish, that sounds like a wine tasting! One trick you can use to reduce the strong flavour is to either blend it with other honey or leave it in the bucket for a few months when the strong taste seems to mellow somewhat. Either way, I really like it.Back to this week though and some of my colonies have become quite grumpy, in fact, horribly grumpy, so much so I would class a couple of them as “double glovers”, it’s an expression that refers to the need to put on two pairs of nitrile gloves instead of the usual single pair. I made the mistake of picking up some supers for extraction without putting my boots on and cracking the supers off the clearer boards really wound them up and you just know they’re going to find the one vulnerable place you’ve left exposed! After several minutes of collecting supers with bees stinging my ankles I looked like I was walking barefoot across sun-baked sand, hopping and cursing as I went, funny now, but at the time, not so amusing!The colonies will calm down again quite quickly, it’s that sudden loss of forage and this immediately followed by the beekeeper removing surplus honey that seems to get them a little feisty. We have the remaining treatments to put on this week, as I mentioned in previous podcasts we’re using Apivar and this needs to go in the hives after the honey has been removed hence the slight delay in some apiaries as we remove supers for extraction.As we sorted  | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 77 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet.Who’d have thought we’d be extracting honey so soon, the Summer season has flown by and I’m heading into the honey room to get set up to extract the Summer supers over the weekend? Listen on for a rundown of my extraction set up and how I extract from over sixty colonies in a room that measures just 3 metres square.Check Out my Patreon Page HEREEquipment discussed in today\'s Podcast:Stainless Steel TablesScalesApimelterBrush UncapperExtractorDouble Strainer100kg Settling TankHoney CreamerBottling MachineBefore we head into the honey room I wanted to say a big thank you to Craig from Jedburgh, one of our Patreon supporters who very kindly drove down to Norfolk this week to spend a few days helping out and inspecting bees. Craig is new to beekeeping and has been absorbing all or my videos and podcasts on Patreon and offered to lend a hand for a few days so not wanting to turn away any help I swapped around the workload a little so we could get over to the workshop and clean up the rather large stack of frames and boxes that needed cleaning instead of extracting honey.\xa0A lot of the boxes are left over from the early season oilseed rape extraction where we had to cut out the comb and honey as it had granulated in the frames and couldn’t be extracted in the normal way. This leaves lots of frames that need to be roughly scrapped and tied into bundles before being boiled and cleaned ready to take fresh foundation in the Spring next year before going back out onto the hives. We also scrape out the supers and scorch them lightly as part of our ongoing disease management and this also entails removing frame runners and either washing them before replacing or if they’re too badly damaged we replace them. I think I might have mentioned before that I’m switching my super frames over to Manley frames, these are the straight, wide sided frames instead of the more traditional SN1’s or SN4’s, SN1’s are the narrow straight sided frames for supers and SN4’s are the Hoffman style spacing. It’s interesting that there are so many different types of frames that you could use and each beekeeper no doubt has a favourite. The same applies to the frame runners in the supers, I’ve always used castellated runners with set spacing for ten frames although I have tried eleven and nine frame runners. The point here is you start of using frames with foundation that have eleven frames meaning the frames are placed closer together and hopefully the bees draw out the foundation perfectly straight before progressing to ten frame runners and finally nine frame runners thereby getting more honey per frame which ultimately means less frames to extract.The trouble with this is if you have more than a few supers it can get a bit confusing when you think you’ve got ten frame spacing and it’s eleven or nine. Add toSupport the show | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 76 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet. August has arrived and it’s time to start thinking about jobs that need to be completed in order to prepare the colonies for the colder months ahead.Another week and it’s been a period of changeable weather, a few more thundery showers mixed in with some bright, warm Summery days, fairly typical for the time of year really. We seem to have moved on from the heatwave and I don’t think we’ll see temperatures of that order again this Summer, never say never of course but the next few weeks look like being “Unsettled” as the weather presenters on tv would say.The ongoing saga of the newly mated queen that was attacked and recovered to mate and start laying eggs continues. I inspected the nuc a few days ago and found the queen had settled down and was laying, but not as rapidly as I would have hoped and there were a couple of frames that had plenty of space but no eggs. I actually spotted her and watch for some time and she wandered around the frame of empty cells dipping her head into an occasional cell but seemingly unimpressed with it walked on without laying. She did this for several minutes and I didn’t see her lay a single egg. Now, this could be down to several reasons but on the very next frame, I found a partially drawn queen cell with a growing larvae inside and on the next frame a sealed queen cell. Both queen cells were in what would be traditionally viewed as supercedure queen cell positions, about a third down from the top bar roughly central in the frame. It then becomes a guessing game to decide what the bees are up to. Is there a problem with the queen that isn’t visible to me, has she an issue in laying eggs, there were certainly eggs in cells so she hadn’t stopped entirely and they were definitely fertilised eggs producing workers. Sometimes we just have to accept the bees know best and let them get on with it. So I took the decision that indeed the bees know best and that these were in fact a supercedure cells and not swarm cells and left one of them to see what happens. I posted a video of the inspection to my Patreon page so do take a look at it there.I also discovered a potential problem with some of the other newly emerged virgin queens last week. These were the ones we’ve been holding back in the hair roller cages as part of the Nicot system. It was time to release the queens from the cages and having experienced the attack on the first queen when I used the sugar syrup dunk method I decided to simply plug the end of the cage with fondant and let the bees gradually eat their way through to release the queen. Well, I checked last weekend and to my horror, the cap on the end of the roller cage, which is permanently attached to the cage by a small tab, had managed to curl back round and block the bees from getting to the fondant. This obviously meant the queen couldn’t get out either so I took the decision to release them onto a frame by uncapping them and running them down onto the brood frame. It worked fine, fine in all cases except one. This particular queen was in a super hurry to get out and no sooner than I’d opened the end of the cage, she was out, wings beating furiously, and in a flash, she was gone! She took to the air and disappeared over the blackberry bushes. I did that, desperate, childlike jumping in the air trying to catch her with my hands kind of move but she was too fast and was gone. It must have looked quite comical looking back at it. Oh well, these things happen.The remaining queens all released without incident so I’m anticipating there will be eggs and young larvae the next time I inspect. Not like the earlier season matings which had been very protracted and in a lot of cases unsuccessful. I’ve mentioned it before but this year has seen a lot of Drone Laying Queens again but predominantly from the Spring matings, the Summer bred queens have all mated succ | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 75 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet.I’m sat in my office preparing this week’s podcast in 32 degrees heat which for us beekeepers here in Norfolk in the UK is somewhat uncomfortable but as I gradually melt my thoughts are turning to Late Summer Treatments in preparation for the coming Autumn and Winter months ahead. I’d like to share with you my plans for treating my bees against varroa and talk a little about preparing my bees for the colder months ahead.Veterinary Medicines For Honeybees can be found listed HEREThorne Beekeeping Supplies for Apivar Varroa TreatmentCheck Out my new weekly podcasts each week as they are released hereIt’s been another interesting week of beekeeping, the hottest so far this Summer and it’s seen me heading out super early to carry out inspections before dashing back to shade and shelter away from the burning sun. It’s no over-exaggeration to say it can be quite dangerous being out beekeeping in such conditions and while I understand many beekeepers tend their bees in these kinds of conditions on a regular basis when you’re not familiar with this kind of heat and humidity it can catch you out quite quickly. Dehydration being the number one problem I think, so having plenty of drinks has helped. Of course, if you only have a couple of hives to inspect you can delay inspecting until the cooler part of the late evening or perhaps get up a little earlier and get started before the sun gets too hot. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing, inspecting from 6:30 in the morning until about 10 o’clock or thereabouts. By that time the heat is really starting to hit home and I struggle to see the bees through the sweat in my eyes! Even with the 70’s style bandana, I struggle so it makes sense to just stop and go back another time.Most of my colonies will be fine if left alone, not many are attempting to swarm now so I’m happy to leave them an extra day or so.You might recall from last week’s podcast that I had to reduce a virgin queen from a queenless nuc colony that set upon her and would have surely killed her if not for my intervention, I popped her back into the hair roller cage with a plug of fondant and crossed my fingers in the hope she would be uninjured and able to be accepted, get out and mate and settle into building a colony of her own. Well, I went back at the weekend and had a look fully expecting her to be either dead or too seriously damaged to be able to mate but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that not only was she alive but she had indeed been out to mate, had successfully returned and was already laying eggs by the frame load. It must have been a very quick mating from being released from the cage, especially when compared to quite a number of queens this year who seem to have taken forever to start laying. But I’m so happy she survived and I’ll now need to move them over to a larger box so she can continue to build the colonies strength.In other news, my queen mother that was donating all of the eggs for my queen rearing program disappeared last week, she finally got the better of me and swarmed. It’s the first few weeks I’ve seen swarm cells in that colony and thought I had removed all of the swarm cells but obviously missed one. I can’t be too disappointed as she was a yellow dot queen and it was the first time this colony had tried swarming in almost three years, I guess I must have become complacent in thinking they were never going to swarm. The good news is, I’ve been able to raise several batches of queens from her so she lives on in her daughters, all that remains now is to assess how these qu | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 74 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet.Catch up with the latest episodes HEREThis week I’m following up on a question posted by one of our Patrons regarding swarm management and general inspections through the active season. If inspecting your bee hive gives you a feeling of impending doom each time, stay tuned and I’ll hopefully give you some pointers to make the whole task more relaxed.Before we get into the detail of Ben’s question I thought I’d recap on another busy week. Queen rearing has been interesting this week, we had half a dozen emerged virgin queens trapped in the Nicot hair roller cages that needed to be moved into queenless nucs and I attempted a new method of introduction which involved liberally covering the virgin queen with sugar syrup and simply letting her run onto a frame whereby the workers would get stuck into the sugar syrup and start cleaning the new queen thus accepting her and not attacking her.This is the first time I’ve attempted something like this but the benefits of a successful introduction means saving a few days compared to a normal caged introduction. Having set up the nuc as queenless the day before I did as instructed and pretty much covered the queen in syrup, bless her, she really was covered, the syrup ran down onto the frame where the workers immediately started cleaning it up. I took this was the opportunity to run the virgin queen onto the same frame in the middle of the syrup and sure enough, the workers immediately set about licking the sugar syrup off the queen and generally cleaning her up. Success, I have to say I was feeling pretty smug about the whole operation and particularly glad that we had chosen to capture the exercise on video to post to the Patreon site for everyone to see.That was until about twenty seconds after I ran the queen out of the cage and into the syrup. It all seemed fine but then one worker took exception to this new queen in their presence and started harassing her, first the worker climbed all over her and then started curling down her abdomen to try to sting her, I left it for a couple of seconds longer as it was only one worker but this worker obviously didn’t like her proposed new queen because when she couldn’t get enough purchase to sting her she started to bite her and it became more and more vicious and frantic. Then another worker decided to join in and that for me was enough. I wasn’t going to stand by and watch them attack my beautiful new virgin queen. The problem was the instigator of the attack had now got such a strong bite of the virgin queen\'s wing when I picked up the worker the queen came with her. I actually had to walk away from the nuc and spend several seconds encouraging the worker to let go which she did eventually and I was able to get he virgin queen safely into a cage for her own protection.Now as I said, I’ve not attempted this before so it’s all been very new to me. Having considered everything I did, I have come to the conclusion that firstly, the nuc was far too large for the introduction of this virgin queen in this manner and secondly maybe I should have left them queenless for a longer period of time before trying to introduce a virgin queen who’s pheromones are not as strong as a fully mated queen, who knows. Suffice to say, the rest of the virgin queens for introduction were put into cages and introduced in a more traditional way. I’ll be back to check on them over the weekend so we’ll see if they’ve been released and accepted or not.It’s been the last push to getting supers on colonies where needed, always a tricky proposition as I don’t like giving them too much space now we’re heading to the end of the Summer nectar flow. I want the bees to fill every last space in the supers they have before they move on to another one otherwise they’ll have supers half-fill | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 73 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet.It’s our monthly Questions and Answers session today so stay tuned for some cracking questions and hopefully my helpful replies.Before we get into the questions my weekly round-up has the distinct taste of disaster about it and not really about beekeeping! As you may have seen by the pictures I’ve posted, the Ranger pick up has had yet another major malfunction, this time it’s the clutch. I was driving along quite happily, had to change down a gear and that was followed by a bang and very rough grinding sound and feel as if I had missed putting it into gear properly. So I took it out of gear and it wouldn’t go back in. I pulled over to the side of the road and discovered a puddle of what I guess was clutch fluid beneath the engine bay. It’s beginning to feel like I’m rebuilding the truck this year, anyway, I was lucky to be able to get the truck transported back to the local garage where it remains currently waiting to have a new clutch fitted. Another major hole in my wallet, oh well.I must get back to the queen rearing apiary by the weekend though as I have six developing queen cells in one of the queen rearing colonies and they will be well capped and getting ready to emerge. The last thing I want is for those to emerge and destroy each other before I get a chance to sort them out. As with most things in queen rearing, once you start the clock ticking you can’t easily put everything on hold.\xa0First up is Simon Rice, who asksWhen queen rearing with larvae transfers, how do you stop the wax builders from creating burr comb between and around your queen cells please? I have had a number of attempts to raise queen cells this summer and each time they have enveloped the queen cells in this way.Thank you.Hi Simon and many thanks for your question;This is an all too familiar issue when queen rearing and I’ve struggled with this problem myself including this season where I had three perfectly viable queen cells completely encased in brace comb. I spoke to a fellow queen rearing beekeeper who suggested putting a frame of foundation in a couple of frames away from the queen cells to give them something to draw out and the last time I tried it they worked the foundation and not the queen cells, so it might just be the answer! Give it a try and see how you get on.Next up is a question from\xa0 Ben Hoen who says,For me as a new beekeeper, this year has been hard.\xa0 I overwintered all three of my hives, but two swarmed early in the year when I was at work, and then both threw after swarms too while I was away.\xa0 One of those did not successfully re-mate so it is hopelessly queenless currently, and the other I am waiting to find out if it mated successfully.It would be helpful to get a general description for swarm management.\xa0 For example, how often do you inspect the hives?\xa0 How thorough of an inspection to do you make?\xa0 (every frame, or just by tipping the box up)\xa0 Do you shake the bees off the frames during an inspection, or do you find you can do what you need while still having a frame covered with bees? Other than queen cups, what are you looking for?\xa0 If you find any queen cups do you knock them down?\xa0 Is there anything else you can do to reduce the likelihood of swarming? For example, if you learn to "give them more space" do you find that swarm pressures are usually eliminated?\xa0 Finally, on this last point, can you outline some of the methods you rely on to "give them more space"?\xa0 Thanks!!!Wow, Ben, that’s quite a question, and one I’m going to save for next week. You ask some really important questions and it would take up an entire podcast to go through all of your questions with the fullest of answers. So, all I would say is, be patient, hold on until next  | Hi, I’m Stewart Spinks and welcome to Episode 72 of my podcast, Beekeeping Short and Sweet. It’s July and the final month of our Summer nectar flow, the bees are busy filling Supers and we’ve been hit by another bout of CBPV. There are jobs that need attention for this month too, so keep listening for this week\'s updates.Welcome back to another weekly podcast and we somehow find ourselves in July and what is for me the final month of our Summer honey production. I’ve moved all of the bees back to their permanent apiary sites and were in the process now of assessing colonies in preparation for the Autumn shutdown. It might seem a little early to be thinking of the coming Autumn and Winter but believe me, it will soon be here and if you’ve not got yourself prepared those precious few weeks in the late Autumn will become a panic as you try to treat and feed bees to ensure a successful Winter period.If you\'re interested in submitting honey samples to the National Honey Monitoring Scheme check out their website hereThere are, of course, jobs to do this month too but they all lead to setting up colonies to survive the darker months and ensure strong colonies for next Spring.I was visited this week by a fellow beekeeper from Australia was explaining that they have active bees foraging for around 11 months of the year, imagine that! To have flying bees pretty much all year round and no really cold months seems on the face of it a perfect scenario but I’m sure it brings its own challenges. This past week has also brought some interesting beekeeping letters through the post, I recently signed up to the UK’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology’s National Honey Monitoring Scheme, looking at their website for some details to share I found their introduction pretty much explains exactly what they are doing.\xa0The National Honey Monitoring Scheme aims to use honeybees to monitor long-term changes in the condition and health of the UK countryside. However, we need the help of beekeepers if this scheme is to work. Initially set up in 2018, the Honey Monitoring Scheme is a long-term programme that uses advanced analytical techniques to identify the species of plant pollen present in honey samples. This will tell us what bees are feeding on in different parts of the country and at different times of year. This information will help us identify possible threats to bees linked with floral resources.The CEH website goes on to explain what the scheme will do:State-of-the-art analysis: using DNA metabarcoding and high precision mass spectrometry of honey samplesSample archive: for future research developing new analytics, such as disease detection\xa0Provide feedback to participating beekeepersGenerate robust scientific data to inform future policy decisions\xa0So I received a submissions pack which contains a couple of tubes that they need filled with honey samples and from that they can identify exactly the plants my bees have been foraging on. What’s is really exciting is that they will share this information with me onece the testing has been completed. Due to the size and complexity of the project I won’t get the results for some time but as soon as I do I will share them with you. If you’d like to take part in the National Honey Monitoring Scheme do check out their website www.ceh.ac.uk and look for the link to the relevant page, I’ll leave a link in the podcast notes to help direct you to their site.The other letter I received was from a university student called Amy who is carrying out a third year dissertation project involving Varroa mites and was a request for samples.

Nach über einem Jahr meldet sich das selbsternannte Traumduo in ihrem selbsternannten Narrencast zurück: mit alter Leidenschaft, ja, ja. Aber vor allem mit noch mehr Mülleimern, noch mehr Formel 1, noch mehr Uli Hoeneß, EINEM WELTMEISTERTITEL!!!!!! OOOOOOOOLÉÉÉÉÉÉ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Und: uns. Apropos: wir beide sind ab morgen, dem 1. August auf der AnimagiC anzutreffen – wir freuen uns auf DICH!   Wir wünschen viel Spaß und sagen DANKE dafür, dass Du uns noch kennst. Oder gerade kennen gelernt hast. Wolltest du eigentlich gar nicht hier her, kannst du hier klicken und zu Google zurückkehren, um dir einen besseren Zeitvertreib zu suchen. | Unbeschreibliche Freude! Jedes Mal, wenn es einen neuen Narrencast gibt. Dieses Mal ist aber, wie ihr am Anfang hören werdet, alles anders: Wir haben nämlich den neuesten ConanCast, welcher ebenfalls vor wenigen Augenblicken erschienen ist, aufgenommen und beschlossen, noch ein bisschen weiter zu quatschen: Gott und WL eben. :)  Demnach gibt es heute den ConanCast mit dem Gott und WL-Anhängsel: Aber uncut! Wer alles professionell und seriös möchte, hört sich lieber nur den ConanCast an, der Rest bleibt hier und erlebt unverblümte und unverbindliche Narren-Power. Mit allem, was dem ConanCast fehlt und.. mit Gott und WL #7!   Insgesamt ist die reine Gott und WL-Zeit leider etwas kurz, wir hoffen trotzdem, dass euch alles gefällt. Und da wir alles in einem Rutsch aufgenommen haben, konnten wir nicht mehr so viel reden – uns fehlte der Power-Snack!  Wir wünschen viel Spaß! Liebste Grüße!  Mario-WL | Halli, hallo; Narri, narro! Hier sind wir wieder! Die sechste Ausgabe des legendären Narrencasts ist verfügbar.  Oft hält man uns für tot, wir melden uns mit diesem neuen Podcast allerdings zurück: Und zwar so lebendig wie selten zuvor! Und jetzt am Besten sofort reinhören! :)   Heute diskutieren wir über alles, was ihr kennt und einiges, was völlig neu in den Podcast hereingeflitzt kam. Neben Gewohntem haben wir auch ungewohntes für euch. Es wird also spannend!  Wir wünschen euch jetzt GANZ GANZ GANZ viel Spaß beim Hören! Ich bin wirklich froh, dass der neue Cast endlich draußen ist. ♥ In 7 Tagen sehen wir uns auf dem Japantag, wenn ihr mögt. Selbstverständlich auch mit Philipp, unserem liebsten Gott! Auch in dieser Ausgabe durfte er einfach nicht fehlen. :) | HOHOHO! Es weihnachtet sehr! Und ENDLICH habe ich das größte, kleine Geschenk für euch, was ich bieten kann: Gott und WL #5! Der neueste Ableger der gar nicht mal so unbeliebten Reihe ist endlich da und liegt unter eurem Weihnachtsbaum.  Was bleibt mir denn da noch zu sagen? Geschenk aufreißen und SOFORT anhören!   Philipp S. und ich wünschen viel Spaß beim anhören und ein frohes Fest! :) | Moin, moin! Es ist Montag. Manche Menschen mögen Montage nicht. Auch ich gehöre normalerweise auch zu dieser Sorte! Allerdings habe ich Urlaub. Bämm. Die Hälfte von euch liest aus Frust gar nicht mehr weiter, aber so konnte ich ein bisschen filtern. Nach welchen Kriterien ich jetzt gefiltert haben soll, weiß ich allerdings nicht so genau. Ist doch auch egal! Nach sooo langer Zeit ist es tatsächlich soweit! Gott und WL #4 ist DA! Ist ECHT! Habt ihr uns vermisst? Über all die Zeit, die wir und vor allem ich vertrödelt haben, hat sich \'Gott und WL #4\' übrigens so sehr eingebürgert, dass ich beschlossen habe, diesem Narrencast keine \'Unterüberschrift\' oder so zu geben. Erkältungsbedingt zwar nicht ganz so witzig wie sonst, allerdings genau so tiefsinnig, privat und tiefgründig und tiefenergründerisch. Müll ist auch wieder mit dabei! :) Ihr werdet euren Spaß haben! Die Aufnahmen mit Philipp S. und mir fanden übrigens am 4. November 2012 statt. Jetzt aber ENDLICH viel, viel Spaß beim anhören! :)Wir hoffen inständig, dass euch unser neuester Podcast gefällt. :) Mit herzlichsten Grüßen! Mario-WL |  Hallo, liebe Leute!Schön, dass ihr an diesem herrlichen Samstagabend hier seid!So viel könntet ihr machen! Stattdessen lest ihr diesen Text! Und in eben genau diesem Text kündige ich feierlich und stolz die Dritte Podcast-Episode von Gott und WL an! Philipp und ich haben uns kürzlich wieder zusammen gesetzt und haben uns dieses mal mit Rumänien befasst. Alles weitere und viele, viele andere Themen (wir schweifen wie gewohnt ab) sind ab JETZT zu hören!Viel Spaß beim hören! Ich bin so glücklich, dass er jetzt endlich released ist!Es ist definitiv ein guter Tag! Für euch und für mich!Ganz besonders heute freuen wir uns über jede Art von Resonanz, die ihr zu bieten habt! Entweder hier unten oder auf der Gott und WL-Seite. Wir brauchen eure Kritik, um noch besser zu werden, euer Lob, um an unserer Arbeit festzuhalten und ... wir wollen einfach wissen, wie wir ankommen. :)Mit herzlichsten Grüßen!Mario-WL | Hallohallo, liebe Leute!Die Detektive unter euch wissen, dass der neue, zweite Podcast eigentlich gestern seinen Release feiern sollte, aber besser a biserl zu spät als goaned präsentieren wir euch Nummer 2, welcher sich thematisch an Ostern bedient, sich dann aber doch wieder weit davon entfernt, hehe!Mit einer Namensänderung von "Die Viertelstunde der Narren!" in "Gott und WL" haben wir, denke ich, einen guten Schritt in eine bessere Personalisierung gemacht. So viele meiner Projekte stecken bei Teil 1 fest, aber dieser Podcast hat den Sprung wahrlich geschafft! Wirklich ganz viel, viel Spaß beim anhören wünschen Nachtgott und ich! :) Jetzt auch auf iTunes verfügbar! :) Oder hier herunterladen.Ich bin sehr stolz und froh, dass das alles so gut klappt. :) | Hallo Leute!Hier meldet sie wie immer euer Mario-WL!Der Titel dieses Posts sagt es schon: Tada, hurra! Mein erster Podcast!Natürlich wäre der alleine ziemlich langweilig... weswegen ich mir ganz frech den Philipp S. von DetektivConan-News.com gekrallt habe, welcher auch fürs dazugehörige Forum sowie das Wiki Verantwortung übernimmt.Der Name ist noch nicht final, wir mögen ihn aber bisher beide. "Narr" ist nunmal mein Wort und in Verbindung mit der Übersetzung des 15. Detektiv Conan-Filmes, der ja noch nicht in Deutschland erschien, wird ein "von den Machern vom ConanCast" unterstrichen.Wir beide würden uns extreeemst über euer Feedback dazu freuen!Eins vorneweg: Ja, die Viertelstunde ist leicht überzogen, dennoch haben wir doch nicht ganz die Stunde geknackt, ich bin von der falsch angezeigten Skype-Zeit ausgegangen. :DLiebe Grüße und viel Spaß bei 50% Conan und 50% alles andere!Mit Philipp S. und Mario-WL aka Kevin. Wuahuu!Hier könnt ihr den Podcast bei iTunes anhören und runterladen! :)Und hier könnt ihr ihn euch ganz normal herunterladen, sollte der Player nicht funktionieren.Danke an Kafei von Triforceseekers für seine Hilfe wegen dem Player!Es ist die Nummer #1 ... was sagt ihr zum Versuch? :)', 'chan_desc': 'Mario-WL spricht bei Gott und WL mit Nachtgott über Gott und WL!', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts6/v4/ad/dc/b4/addcb424-e969-c313-7c82-9d4e6f06a2e9/mza_3105378117653997712.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2012-04-03'}}

This is something that I’ve thought long and hard about.\xa0 When you’ve listened, I hope you will feel it speaks more about the kind of things that are important and central to the podcast and to me. I’m a different crafter and person since I did that initial\xa01 year blog challenge to knit with only British wool\xa0and while I feel reverence toward everything that meant and means, I feel the podcast title ought to speak to other levels.

The development of this technology is divided into two parts: First the plastic is dissolved and the enzymes as catalyze whereby the plastic becomes highly malleable fractions. These components are placed in a biodigester station, where they behave as if they were leftovers of food. The project runs in just 24 hours, to move from plastic to water, really promising. http://bit.ly/RNNnewsPeter77  Tip of the week: Complete any warranties that your equipment comes with, print a copy of the receipt and keep in the box for each piece of equipment. If something arises this will at least take away some of the stress in a tough situation.  Main Topic: Maintaining your equipment is one rung in the ladder to a successful long-term reef system that is often stepped right over or only touched on at a cursory level. We noticed that with recent vacations and more trips / commitments on the horizon that taking a few minutes to ensure all your equipment and system plans are in tip top shape can make all the difference. Simple maintenance is not just about keeping things neat and tidy but also ensuring the efficacy and lifespan of your equipment.

Ecotech has mastered the science of creating water flow inside the aquarium with their Vortech Pumps, they're building the standard in high performance centrifugal pumps with the Vectra, so it's only natural that Ecotech designed a dosing pump system of their own in the Versa.  Jeremy: A phenomenon that makes coral spawn more than once a year is improving the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef. The discovery was made by researchers investigating whether corals that split their spawning over multiple months are more successful at spreading their offspring across different reefs.  Listener Call: Rebecca called in to ask our advice about moving a tank.  Main Topic: DIY can be fun and help save money and when it comes to the aquarium hobby there are endless numbers of DIY projects from the simple to the extremely advanced. Today we are going to discuss a few of our favorites that cover all bases of skill and ability. As with everything in this hobby there are a million ways to do a single thing and DIY is no different, what we discuss here is by NO means the only way to do these projects and there are endless amounts of resources from YouTube to forums to help you get ideas and find how tos. CAVEAT: Please understand RNN is not responsible for any failed DIY projects, attempt any and all of these at your own risk!  1. Water Making Station: for most people water changes are imperative for a successful reef tank, having premade salt water and a surplus of fresh can prove invaluable for water changes, ATO containers and spare water for dipping corals and fish. a. Method to be used: Brut Can b. Required Equipment: 2 Brut Cans(size based on amount of water you make), various pvc pipe and fittings(size based on size of cans), pvc glue, 3 valves, RODI float stop(optional),Uniseal bulkheads(size based on plumbing size), external pump, remote plug c. Setup: 1 can for fresh, 1 can for salt, both cans plumbed to pump with valve in between each can and pump, pump outlet to top of salt can with T and valve in between. T has valve attached and either threaded or quick connect fittings for fresh or salt output. RODI can be plumbed directly into fresh can with float valve or run into can when needed. d. How to use: RODI water is pumped into fresh can, water from fresh can be pumped into salt can for mixing through the use of valves and pump. Once water is in salt can, RODI can be isolated and then recirculated to mix salt. Hose can then be connected to outlet T and pumped into containers or directly into tank. Through the use of valves both fresh and salt can be isolated and pumped out of system.  2. Invert/Fish Trap: Everyone gets a jerk invert or fish, while commercial products exist they are often pricey and sometimes complicated, while certainly better for inverts than fish this simple bottle trap can prove effective to get rid of that jerk crab or fish. a. Method to be used: Plastic bottle b. Required Equipment: Soda bottle(size depending on what you are trying to catch) c. Setup: take bottle and cut top off, invert top and using reef safe adhesive glue the top inverted into the bottom creating a bottle neck into the larger body of the bottle. d. How to use: Place food of choice into the container and fill with water. Submerse and place in area that invert or fish frequents, check regularly.  3. Sump from Tank: Sumps are very desirable for a successful reef tank, not only does it add water volume it allows you to hide or run various pieces of equipment such as skimmers, reactors and pumps. Inaddition you can utilize sumps to help breed pods and deal with nuisance algae through a refugium. Sumps can get costly fast but don't need to be cost prohibitive to get the benefits of having one a. Method to be used: Standard tank sump b. Required Equipment: Off the shelf tank of desired size for display, baffle kit(various sellers available), glue/silicone, filtersock holder or rollermat(optional) c. Setup: determine the layout of the sump you want, most are simple 3 chamber setups(inlet, skimmer/fuge chamber, return chamber), some kits include a filter sock holder(if not they can be purchased separately or this is a good opportunity to use arollermat). Using 2x4 scrap build 2 L blocks ensuing they are square to be used as baffle holders for gluing. Measure and mark where each baffle will go and begin your glue up. Put baffle into tank where it will be glued, add a dot of silicon to bottom of tank and insert first L bracket and bring it up against baffle. Ensure it is in right location and straigt and then add drop to base of tank and add second racket. Once held in place you are ready to glue up the sides. Run a bead of silicone up each side where baffle meets tank wall, using a wet finger or caulking tool run it up along the silicone to create an even and clean bead of caulk. Let dry for appropriate time and them pop out the brackets, clean up any silicone on base of tank and seal in bottom of baffle. On pieces that require a gap for water to run under, make a spacer of appropriate height to place under to hold off bottom. Rinse and repeat panel by panel until allbaffles are in and sealed. Let all silicon fully cure before use. d. How to use: Place sump under tank and plumb drain pipe into the drain chamber(into filter sock or rollermat), install required or desired equipment(heater, skimmer, pumps, etc), plumb return pump to return line, fill and test levels for power outages.  4. APEX Automation(Cabinet lights, Fans, any on/off): APEX and controllers in general are one of the best pieces of equipment you can get for creating automation and adding safety nets to your tank. Through the use simple logic and switches you can easily automate anything from tank stand lights, fans or anything else that requires on/off actions. a. Method to be used: APEX fusion b. Required Equipment: APEX, break out box, requiredswitches(float, pressure, push) water ever you want to automate(for this example we will talk about adding lights to turn on when you open your stand door). c. Setup: Install magnetic switches on your stand doors, if you have 2 doors, switches can be wired in series to only consume 1 breakout box port. Enter APEX Fusion and find the breakout box switch port or ports(be aware these may be hidden in the unused port setion) click on the lock icon on your Fusion dashboard and drag the correct module widget to your dashboard. Clicking on the setting (gear icon) button you can use the drop downs to select the functions(such as If Door OPEN the ON) define the ON plug on your power bar and then plug lights into the proper port on the powerbar. Ensure you set the FALLBACK to OFF and Set to OFF, save all your configs and test! d. How to use: Simply open door and lights should come on, close and they should go off.  5. Algae Reactor: Reactors are becoming far more widely available commercially but is still a fun DIY project if you are the tinkering type! While there are many different way you can build and do this project we will cover just one particular methodology in this discussion. a. Method to be used: Repurposed media reactor b. Required Equipment: Off the shelf up flow media reactor like 2LF phosban reactor, waterproof LEDs(spectrum is debatable so research to see what you want to try, but common practice is more reds than whites), various plumbing bits and power head if manifold is not available. c. Setup: Using a hot glue gun, start by gluing the dead end of the LED strip to the base of the reactor, begin to wrap the LEDs in a spiral manner up the reactor. Glue every couple inches and try to keep the gap to around an inch and even all the way up. Once you get to the finish the wrap along the op edge and attach your end plug and seal with shrink wrap. Plug in and test to ensure your LEDs work properly, if lights are too intense a dimmer can be put in line and if you are extra techie you could make them dimmable through a voltage regulator module attached to your 0-10V port on your controller(this is too advanced for this discussion). At a basic level you can put LED plug on timer or configure a plug on your controller to simply turn on and off on a schedule. d. How to Use: Plumb reactor to power head or manifold, ensure to add an inline valve to adjust flow to get turnover rate dialed in. Add water to reactor(remember to have fresh salt water ready for this), add your seed macro to reactor, plug LEDs into controller or timer and turn on pump or open manifold to start flow. Monitor growth and adjust flow and or lighting as needed until you see solid growth. Be sure to check regularly and empty as needed.

The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy's sharktivity app indicates that there have been more that 161 shark sightings off the coast of Massachusetts since June 1. The same shark can be spotted multiple times, scientists note.  This summer, however, did create something of a perfect stormwarming oceans attract both sharks and beach goers, and something does need to be done. Instead of killing more sharks, though, repelling them seems to be a much smarter idea.  That's where a company called Surf Safe comes in. For around $400, a guy named Dave Smith will sell you a simple device that you can install on your surfboard that might just prevent an attack. https://nbcnews.to/2MQ2ilw https://bit.ly/2MaC2CK  Peter: The scourge of plastic in our oceans has received lot of publicity in recent years, especially in the UK where TV documentaries (notably the Blue Planet series) have brought the issue into the nation's homes. It seems the country is doing well in saying no' to one of the major culprits, the disposable plastic bag.  With the amount of plastic entering the oceans estimated at a worrying 8 million tons, any news story that shows a bit of good news is very welcome. The British press is reporting that plastic bag use has halved within a year, according to usage at major supermarkets. https://bit.ly/33kZDWL  Main Topic: Aquascaping and the companies that make the goods you need!

So, although it was challenging, I managed to count and read at the same time. They say you should keep your mind active to keep sharp. Now, there\'s a knitter\'s exercise for the noggin!The swatch above shows how I inserted eyelets within the pattern, and how the ribs turn into mini lace cables. Below is the sweater in progress (back and left front). The pattern and yarn will be available in December. Cute, isn\'t it?You can see the button band already added to the left front. Just couldn\'t help myself. I had to work it out of sequence (although, really, is there a knitting law that says in what sequence to knit sweater pieces?). Since I often design as I go, I like to see NOW how things will look in the end. Even after knitting for umpteen years, I am still refining my skills: I  now pick up over one whole stitch instead of over half a stitch (which  I\'ve always done up to now). It really makes a neater finish. Old dog, new trick.In the following swatch, each section shows a new version/progression of a burgeoning idea. The swatch, changing from right to left, is explained in the podcast. Note how the lace sections at the top are biasing. After experimenting, we found a way to counteract this: Row 1: * K2 tog, yo. Row 2: Purl. Row 3: * Yo, ssk. Alternating both the slant of the decrease and the position of the yo did the trick. Another lesson to be retained for future designs, and solving pesky biasing.Joyce mentioned a designer who integrates biasing yarns in her beautiful knitwear: Kathryn Alexander. Check out her site. I love her use of color, and how she utilizes the 3-dimensional yarns as design elements.I find that using steam helps in slapping a biasing fabric back into place, so to speak. You can\'t use steam on acrylic (it will kill it dead or turn it into plastic—not a good look for knitwear), but you can use it on natural fibers. I place a wet dish towel over the knitted piece, and apply a hot iron in a "lift and press" motion. You want to hear that baby hiss!Check out the little t-shirt below—another upcoming design for spring 2012. The yarn used is Pediwick (66% bamboo/34% nylon) which was introduced last year as a sock yarn (392 yards per 100-gr ball). With a little experimentation I discovered that this yarn can also be knitted on a size 7 needles at a gauge of 6.5 sts per inch.  Knit at that gauge, this yarn drapes beautifully. A bit of slinky-ness. Me like it!Back in the mid-80\'s I co-wrote "Sweaters by Hand" (from Interweave Press) featuring a collection of designs for handspun yarns. My friend Rachael Emmons, spinner extraordinaire, spun the yarns and I designed the projects. A fun and educational process. I had never spun yarn before and I got to learn at that time.One of the interesting things when you design with a yarn that never  existed before is discovering it\'s best gauge. And depending on the  project, there could be more than one answer. By experimenting, you may  find that some yarns in your stash can create a variety of fabric weights.So next time you find yourself in a hurricane, with extra knitting time on your hands, grab yarn and assorted needle sizes, and start experimenting :-)The tip of the week (instead of an actual mini lesson) is this: when using circular needles with  interchangeable tips, use the correct size tip on your right-hand needle (the working needle) and a smaller tip on the left-hand needle. Your stitches will slide smoothly into position ready to be knitted, and there will be no more fighting to get them over the point where the cord attaches to the needle.Hélène  | Yes, I know, can we be any  slower to record and blog? And no, I will not, again, make excuses. All I will say is that we love to podcast, and as with many things in life, you can\'t always get to do what you love.In this podcast episode:1) our mini lesson is about moth repelling/preventing tips2) sneak preview of a new yarn: DungarEase3) should we shorten the blog and podcast more often? You can weigh in...As the weather starts to change with the end of summer, Joyce and I discuss taking out our fall sweaters and what methods we used to protect them from moth damage. This spurs me to go on a hunt on the net to find more information about homemade moth repellents. This actually is the mini lesson we discuss on the podcast. Note that we recorded this section outside on a windy day, so you hear a bit of ambient noise (car alarm, for example) and air blowing on the microphone (lesson learn there).Here are some online sites with more info:How To Get Rid of Moths With Natural RepellentsNon-Toxic Moth Ball AlternativesHow to Make Your Own Sweet-Smelling Moth Repellent Using an OrangeYou can find cedar paper on Amazon.We share our frustration at not having local access to good button sources. Finding buttons in our neck of the woods is difficult, and online sources don\'t exactly fit the bill when you want instant gratification. Are you lucky enough to have a great button store in your area, or an online source that shows colors very accurately and provide speedy service to us, "I want it now" people? Feel like sharing that info? Post a comment, or email us at info@knitonecrochettoo.comHere\'s a preview of one of our upcoming new spring yarns, DungarEase (60% cotton/40% acrylic). This child\'s pattern, shown in size 1 sans buttons (don\'t get me started), will be offered in sizes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.I know that finding patterns for the tween sizes is difficult, so for this basic, I made sure to cover lots of sizes. The yarn comes in 12 "denimy" colors and will be available in December through local yarn shops. Can I say, again, how I LOVE this yarn? I can\'t wait to get it in the stores for you guys to feel and enjoy. Soft, soft, and oh, so soft. :-)And as promised, we\'ve uploaded a free pattern on our website, the Stained Glass Cardigan.As I was designing on the fly (no swatches for me, so sirree Bob) I made the stitches travel after the corrugated ribbing was done and found myself creating a stained glass window type stitch that really worked well to showcase the colors of Geologee. Sometimes you take short cuts, and you get lucky.One of the reasons (among others) that the podcast doesn\'t get done more often is because of this blog. As you can see, I am looooonnnng winded.  So, getting the entire dog and pony show together is a many-hour process. Which explains why it doesn\'t happen more often. So, at least 2 listeners have told us to shorten the blog, and broadcast more often. I know. 2 people (and we love them both). Does that mean it is the opinion of the "masses" of people listening to us? Do you want to weigh in on this? You can either post here to let us know, or on Ravelry.So this is as far as I am going as a wordsmith today. The podcast, of course, contains way more info so please take a listen to get the full effect of our conjoined knitting banter.Helene  | After a 6-week hiatus (from recording and blogging, not working!), we finally have a chance to post again.In this podcast episode:1) we get ready for the TNNA show2) I cram to get 2 projects done to wear at the show3) check out the cabling-with-no-cable-needle method videoThe National Needle Arts Association is a trade organization that most people involved in making/wholesaling/retailing yarn belong to. There are many designers, teachers, and publishers who are also members. The organization hosts 2 large shows, with a couple of smaller ones, every year. We exhibit at the 2 larger shows. The June show is where we showcase our fall/winter yarns, along with any new designs and accessories.We begin the packing process in early May, with me coming up with last minute display ideas, and with Joyce pulling her hair out and gritting her teeth to accommodate these requests --- she is in charge of making sure everything is included in our crates, and I am in charge of making sure I drive her crazy. We have the perfect relationship.So, that is our excuses for going 6 weeks without a podcast. I really enjoy the recording process (and Joyce does too) and wish we could do it once a week, but unfortunately, it will continue to be on an as-we-can basis. Hopefully you will see it as a nice surprise, sort of like getting flowers here and there, just because :-)Back to the trade show process. Our crates got picked up about 1 1/2 weeks before we arrived and were waiting for us in the booth space the morning of set-up. I heard of a small company that came from South America and because of an erupting volcano (how dare it) that disrupted flying, their display items only made their appearance on Saturday morning, mere hours before the show was to officially open. THAT is my recurring nightmare! I am just glad it wasn\'t us dealing with that. I would have surely required a few slaps from Joyce to make me snap out of it!Here are a few photos of us setting up the booth. I took them using my iPad2 and I have to say that the on-board camera stinks the big one. See how grainy they look? And while I was taking them, they looked really nice on the screen. Not so now. So, sorry for that snafu. I think you can see the process well enough, though, from the very beginning where we started hanging our black curtains (first photo), to the finished look (last 2 photos). We had help from Jennifer who lives near Columbus and knits samples for us (beautifully), and Liz, our sales rep for Minnesota. We started at 8:30 am and were done by noon (woohoo, a record for us, thank you very much ladies). The infamous crates (much discussed on the podcast) are featured in the 2nd photo. Oh, and it\'s Joyce in the 3rd photo making a cameo appearance.The show went well. Those markets have been slow the last few years, but this one showed a definite upswing. Attending shows is a pricey proposition, both for exhibitors, and for buyers. The shop owners that came were there to buy. Not too many tire kickers this time around. That gave the show a nice upbeat atmosphere, and folks went home feeling recharged with optimism and inspiration.We are introducing 2 new yarns for the fall: Meadow Silk and Ty-Dy Superkid. We already have the Meadow Silk  in stock (70% highland wool/30% silk), ready to ship to a store near you. The 6 accompanying patterns are being completed right now and will be available by the end of June (next week).The yarn has a nice twist especially designed to prevent PILLING! Don\'t you just hate to spend $$ on a nice yarn, and hours knitting a sweater only to have the fabric pill after one or two wearings? So do we! So instead of designing a single ply yarn that looks real nice in the ball but will pill the first time you wear your sweater, we came up with this yarn. It feels a bit crispy in the hank, but it softens up nicely with steam blocking (apply a wet dishtowel to your work, and place a hot iron on the towel --- you should hear some hissing sound). It works wonders with this yarn. And that is a perfect example why you should not always judge a yarn by the feel before it\'s knitted and blocked. Ask your yarn shop owner if they have a blocked swatch or finished garment for you to fondle.See what nice twist it has? And the sheen is from the 30% silk content. The close up makes it look quite hairy, but it really isn\'t. It\'s pretty smooth, actually.Ty-Dy Superkid is a laceweight blend of superkid mohair, wool and nylon. We selected the 7 favorite Ty-Dy Wool and Ty-Dy Socks colors and applied them to this new yarn. One ball makes the Kurly Kid Scarf.Cute, isn\'t it?Just look at those beautiful colors...yum! This yarn will begin shipping to shops at the end of July.The word for fall and winter is "Accessories." So I came up with lots of new shawl, capelet, and hat patterns. Here\'s a sampling of some of those:From left to right, the Crayon Shawlette, the Linus Capelet and Hat, and the Bowties Scarf. All of these patterns are available now (got those done at least...still have more to go!)Joyce fessed up to having an ongoing allover Alice Starmore cable sweater on the needles for 2 years! Every stitch is twisted both on the right and wrong sides, and it\'s been taking her one hour to work 1" of fabric. After I showed her my no-cable-needle-cable method, she says she\'s picked up considerable speed. And as promised in the last podcast, here\'s the how-to video where I demonstrate the technique:I think it works pretty well and I doubt I\'ll be using a cable or double pointed needle to work my cables ever again!Oh, and one more thing. The Knit One, Crochet Too Facebook page is up to 886 followers. If  we reach 1000 people by July 4th, I will randomly select someone out of those 1000 people to win a kit of the Bowties Scarf (see above, right image)! So be sure to join and get your friends to join, too, so we can reach that milestone in time!Hélène  | Spring has sprung. And in Maine, that is a big deal. I love seasons. I lived in Florida for 3 years once, and I missed the change of seasons. And in these northern parts, the end of winter is always most welcome.In this podcast episode:1) those darn pattern editing woes2) a ball, a skein or a hank: do you know?3) the mini lesson gives you tips on mixing and matching patterns for new design possibilitiesDid I mention spring has officially arrived? So on the morning of our recording, we sat outside at the picnic table basking in the sun like a couple of seals. Well...not really...but we did record outside and we captured both the sounds of  birds chirping (quaint), and sounds of a big 18-wheeler truck backing up to our door for a large yarn delivery—not so quaint but still exciting \'cause that\'s another thing that gets our heart racing: YARN. Ah well, it\'s a job, and someone\'s got to do it, even though this environment makes some of us salivate a bit too much (suction, please!).One thing Knit One, Crochet Too is renowned for is our vast collection of patterns. Each season we put out around 25 new designs, offered in individual leaflets with sizes ranging from XS to 3XL. And once in a while, some of these come back to bite us where the sun don\'t shine...I mean, we find a mistake that totally eluded us through the editing process. Here is a typical conversation in the office: "Just got an email from a knitter saying our math is wrong on pattern (insert number)." "Oh, yeah, and is it?" "Yes, it\'s wrong." "What? How the heck did that happen??" "I have no idea. We\'ve looked at it 3 ways from Sunday." "I know!! Darn it all to &^*%$$ (fill in the blank)." Very, very, very frustrating.... But we still want to know if you find something kaflooey so we can fix it.So what is a knitter to do if you can\'t get a hold of us in a timely manner (over the weekend) and are stuck on one of our patterns, or if you\'d really like someone to show you how to do something in the flesh? This is when you\'d want to connect with other knitters for that much needed help, or just to share. A good place is through The Knitting Guild of America (TKGA). Their site lists guilds in most states. A quick Google search yielded a few links to other places to check out, including Knitting Meetup Groups, and Stitch \'n Bitch (this site lists groups worldwide). I\'m not sure how up to date the listings are (I often find lots of obsolete info on the web) but it\'s worth checking out just to see what knitting friend (or fiend) is out there in your neck of the woods.We caught up with our current knitting projects (are we REALLY ever caught up?) and Joyce said how she enjoyed working with Babyboo in a summer top she just finished. It\'s our bamboo/nylon blend, in a dk weight, and it knits to a super soft fabric. Plus it comes in many colors (not just baby colors as the name may imply). We have quite a few patterns that use this yarn for both babies and grown ups. By far the most popular this season is the Athena Tank, pattern 1740.I am working with Meadow Silk (wool/silk blend in a worsted weight), one of our new intros for the fall, that finally landed in our office last week. We have 6 projects to make by June 9, and we are scrambling to get those done in time. I\'ve been cramming and I finally perfected a method to work cables without a cable needle -- really too lazy to bother getting my behind off the couch to get an extra needle... Isn\'t there a saying that goes "laziness is the mother of inventions"? No? Well, there should be... Video to come in next blog installment. Until then, just call me Smoking Needles...In answer to a question posed to us by farmgirlnow on Ravelry, we talked about balls, skeins and hanks. What is what, and why is what...? What?? We give our take on the difference between a ball and a skein (not 100% consensus there, so please post COMMENTS below and let us know what you think), but we did agree that a hank is a continuous large loop of yarn that needs to be wound into a ball before using. Then we explained why some yarn comes to you on hanks, and others on skeins/balls. Reasons ranging from how slippery the yarn is and how the chosen put up will try to prevent it from totally falling apart while being fondled in the shops, to selling in hanks to further convey the earthiness of a fiber or give it a more artisan feel. It\'s often a combination of both common sense and marketing. The samples below, from left to right, are: Paint Box, 2nd Time Cotton and Babyboo.The mini lesson is about mixing and matching elements from patterns you already own. Add sleeves from one design to a sleeveless one from a different pattern in the same gauge to get just the look you want. Another tool (a blast from the past) is one of the books I wrote back in the \'80s, The Knitter\'s Design Sourcebook. A collection of 127 charted motifs, plus a boatload of blank patterns in many gauges, sizes and neck/sleeve styles. All you have to do is insert whatever motifs in whatever configuration you want. Thousands of possibilities...and the book is out of print. BUT I am sure there are copies circulating on the web or through used book vendors, and even at your local library.An example of an all-purpose pattern that is a good addition to your knitting library is  pattern 1398, the On The Go Top. It gives directions for sizes 32" to 56", plus 3 sleeve choices (sleeveless, short and long), and is worked at 5 sts per inch. This sample is worked in Ty-Dy, 100% cotton. Use it as a blank canvas to add lace, cables, or colorwork. The sky is the limit.And somehow, the lesson drifted briefly in the realm of gauge (as it often does) and how it\'s super important to work a swatch every time you begin using a new yarn, or a new pattern stitch. But if you are so disciplined that you actually can make a swatch without starting your project right away, and you want to stay organized and keep track of that darn little swatch and all the yarn info, check out our Swatch Pockets:Lastly, in a total fit of masochism (it\'s late and I\'m tired, I am still fighting off a nasty cold, or perhaps I have finally cracked), here is the photo of me from the back cover of the aforementioned book, circa mid-80s,  in all my hair-raising glory (plus it looks like I was dressed  ready to work at an ice cream parlor...just in case this knitwear  designing thing didn\'t work out). There are only two good things I can  say about this photo: I was young and I was thin.Now, please pick yourself off the floor from laughing too hard. And don\'t feel bad about that. I asked for it.Hélène  | We\'re baaaaack! Ha, where would we be without famous movie lines, right? Anyhoo, we\'ve been busy  tending to business and getting our sales reps fall/winter packs together, and we got those off in the mail last week. Phewww! It\'s like giving birth...twice a year :-)In this podcast episode:1) what makes a yarn a winner in my book2) traveling with knitting in tow3) the mini lesson is about choosing the right sweater to fit your body shapeI was recently asked to describe my company, and the type of yarn I sell. It got me thinking more seriously about what drives my decisions. Unlike other companies that specialize in only natural fibers, or in high end yarns, Knit One, Crochet Too has a much broader selection. Turns out I am an equal opportunity knitter! Yes, I am a knitter first, and I like a LOT of different types of yarn. When a yarn is added to our collection it means I want to knit with it. It has passed the "hand" test (how it feels and how it drapes), the feel test, the knitting test, and the inspiration test (I can see lots of design ideas)---as well as a few other tests. Of course, Joyce has input, too. I drive her crazy asking for her opinion on yarn, weight of yarn, color of yarn, what does she think of possible design ideas...all while she is trying to get her work done. What a slave driver I am...(but secretly, I think she loves it :-)Nautika, a new yarn for summer, is a perfect example of the type of yarn that won me over by passing all the tests with flying colors, all while being a blend of 85% microfiber acrylic and 15% nylon. Yes, I said acrylic! In the world of yarn, we  know that it\'s a word that make some knitters turn off. Completely. But it won me over by it\'s softness, sheen, stitch definition, and easy care. Not to mention the price ain\'t bad either. And in today\'s world, that\'s a pretty good thing. Ute Grzanna, of The Knitting Basket, in Richmond, VA, also succumbed to the temptation. She first passed it over when she read about Nautika in a sales flyer we sent her. But then we did an evil thing. We sent her a small sample. Bad, bad us (insert maniacal laugh). She got hooked...and her customers did too. She said she can\'t keep it in stock.I invite you to test yourself: next time you visit a yarn shop, make your yarn selection by feel and by sight. Only then allow yourself to take a peek at the fiber content. You might be surprised by your selection.After we got the rep packets out the door, I took a bit of a break in Branson, MO. Perfect time to go there (early April). No crowds, pretty quiet, and the weather cooperated. But of course, I never leave home without tons of yarn and needles, and I came back with this cute jacket, named Waterlily \'cause it kinda looks like the famous painting. It\'s made of Wrapunzel in a new color called Foxgloves (not yet shown on the website) and Ty-Dy Wool. The pattern will be available shortly as it is a late addition to the aforementioned fall/winter collection.I also made one sock in Ty-Dy Socks Skinny Stripes (this link shows you the original Ty-Dy Socks, minus the skinny stripes - still too new to load on the site, but shown here just to tease... :-) Oh, and the color is called Twilight. I just love that yarn---so much so, I am actually planning on knitting a 2nd sock. Matching socks, what a concept!Yes, I traveled armed to the teeth with 2 pairs of straights and 2 circular needles, in my carry-on bag. No problem. But don\'t try that as an audience member of the Jay Leno show. You\'ll have to park your arsenal at the door. Yes, in January, I was a victim of the Leno Show goon squad and had to pull the needles right out of my work-in-progress. But never fear, I used my super-duper back-on-the-needle method once I got my needles back at the end of show (they were still outside in a basket when I exited). Here\'s a how-to video where I demonstrate:The lesson for this episode is about identifying your body shape and selecting garments that puts your best attributes forward. Shape #1: the Pear---wider hips, narrow waist and shoulder. Best to select styles with details at the neck and shoulders, and minimal patterning at the lower edge. We suggest the Braided Yoke Tank worked in Nautika:Shape #2: the Apple---round body, broad chested, minimal waist definition, flat derriere, shapely legs. Select garments that divide your body vertically. The Charlie Vest in Ty-Dy can be worn with a loosely fitted belt (as shown below) that creates movement at the waist, or unbuttoned. A multi-colored garment like this will be most successful layered over a monochromatic top and pants.Shape #3: the Hourglass---width of hips and shoulders match with well defined waist, the perfect shape (or so I hear). The lucky hourglass can wear many styles, and is best showcased with form-fitting sweaters. The Sabrina Tee in 2nd Time Cotton molds your body for a vavavoom! effect :-)Shape #4: the Rectangle: evenly sized from shoulder to hips, no waist definition, boyish figure. Look for waist shaping and avoid square shaped garments. The Dahlia Cardigan in Babyboo gives width to the shoulders and a fit-and-flair lower section. Lots of trompe l\'oeuil action there.Shape #5: the Inverted Triangle---the opposite of the pear, the emphasis needs to be on the hips to balance extra wide shoulders. According to Joyce (who claims this shape as her nemesis), shapes with peplums or a flaired edging are best. The Mermaid Tee in Ty-Dy adds width to the hips, while camouflaging any tummy bulge that may have taken up residence there...Go ahead and gawk all you want at knitters modeling their creations on Ravelry.com and see what looks good on folks with a similar body type as yours. Nothing wrong with gawking. I do it all the time.Hélène  | Yes, I am tired of the rain, and the dirty, melting snow, and am now looking forward to mud season (not really) - and yes, mud season IS an official season in Maine. Good thing I\'ve got plenty of knitting to get me over that dreadful hump...In this podcast episode:1) Joyce feels pressured by me (what?? me? nahhh...) to reconstruct her mitered vest2) I get inspired by Cookie A., the sock mistress4) the mini lesson is about full-fashioningFirst off, let me apologize for the tapping/bumping noises on the podcast. I think as we speak, our hands move around (I am French, you know, and speak LOUDLY with my hands!), and perhaps tap the counter where the microphone sits. I haven\'t pinpointed the problem (we can\'t even think of what we were doing), and it may be annoying to hear. I\'ll bring my ruler next time and swat any noisy fingers! (just kidding...we\'ll just sit on our hands :-)In Episode 1, Joyce and I discussed some ideas to change a vest from a too-small garment to one that fits just right. Although she claims that I "nagged" her into finally making those changes (something about being her work wife...), the finished version fits her way better, and looks great, too.She chose to add a solid color band, continuing in Garter stitch with a mitered stitch in the front corner. A couple of rows of the contrasting color just before the bind off brings it all together nicely. I know taking out a project you thought was done to rework it is no fun, but that is the difference between a project that sits in the closet never to see the light of day, and one you can wear proudly, and often!Joyce described a method of weaving a loose strand of yarn in and out of your fabric, from row to row, to use instead of a stitch marker. I searched the internet to find such a method demonstrated and didn\'t find anything. So I experimented and came up with this, my own version. I guess you could just as well make a small loop (like a yarn ring) and use that instead of a ring marker, but this video shows you what Joyce was talking about. Can you think of a reason to do it this way?During my latest trip out of town (yes, again having to decide what projects to take), I took inspiration from a sock designer I very much admire, Cookie A. I find the way she makes the stitches move around in her sock designs intriguing and clever. So, as I looked at a new color of Ty-Dy Socks Dots (called Periwinkle, brand spanking new and not even in stock, yet), I decided to take a small stab at making my sock stitches travel, too. Still don\'t know what I\'ll call this design. Any suggestions?I recorded a short video to demonstrate the Stretchy Cast On method I used for the top of the socks. It is a new method for me so my technique is a little rough, but I think it\'s clear enough for you to give it a shot. It really makes a nice stretchy cast on—not too loose and sloppy looking like some other methods I\'ve tried.This episode\'s mini lesson is about full-fashioning. As I explained in the podcast, that term refers to working your decreases a few stitches in from the edge to create a decorative ridge. The two garments shown below make good use of that technique for working a raglan sleeve. On the left, the Urbana Cardie, has the yoke worked in one piece. The cardigan on the right, the Stadium Cardie, has all pieces (fronts, back and sleeves) worked individually and sewn together. Both garments feature the feathered version of full-fashioning, and both are worked with Nautika, a high-twist and smooth yarn that shows stitch detail beautifully. It is new this season, comes in 12 coordinated colors, and is machine wash and dry (you gotta love that for a summer yarn!).The 2 examples below are as follows: a close-up of the Stadium Cardie with feathered full-fashioning (left), and a small swatch done in Wrapunzel with basic full-fashioning. As I mentioned in the podcast, even though this yarn has lots of personality (textures and colors), the refined detail still works well.As I finish writing this blog entry, the sun is shining today (the process of recording, video taping, editing and writing spans several days) and I see the remnants of snow on the roof morphing into water drops. Yes, ladies and gents, spring is coming to Maine, any day now, and that makes me happy. Have a great knitting week :-)Hélène  | Episode 3 comes to you from my kitchen, on a rainy Monday morning in Maine. After experimenting with a few recording spots at the office and warehouse, stepping away from the hustle and bustle may just be the best solution for decent audio.After a short trip to Las Vegas, I share one of my all time travel fears: running out of knitting projects to work on during a trip! From experience, I ALWAYS over pack. This time was no exception—3 projects for a 3-day trip. Really...REALLY?? Yes...I can\'t help it. You never know. I actually Mapquested the nearest yarn shop in advance, Gail Knits  (a customer of ours), just in case...And if you think a Vegas casino is no place for knitting, think again. While waiting for the slowest penny slot machine to pay out $111.27, I took out a sock project (note to self: never leave the hotel room without an emergency knitting project) worked in an experimental version of Ty-Dy Socks  (Skinny Stripes—a new version of this popular yarn). A win/win situation ($$ + knitting in public) And by the way in case you are wondering, no tattoos!While I was in Las Vegas for the American Rental Association trade show (Jay, my SO, owns an equipment rental store), I did not take the time to walk the show floor with him—tractors and chain saws do nothing for my creative soul. Fortunately, there is a trade organization in our industry, The National Needle Arts Association, that totally fits the bill. We exhibit our products at the bi-annual trade show, along with many other companies. The show, including classes open to members only (sorry folks, not to the general public), spans 5 to 6 days, and one of the highlight is the Friday evening fashion show. We always participate and for this latest show, we had 3 featured designs: the Mermaid Tee in Ty-Dy cotton, the Stadium Cardigan in Nautika, and the Yoga Shrug and Sock Set in Pediwick.We have many new designs for spring, including the Athena Tank. This design is a perfect example of a blend of 2 ideas: an off-the-rack tank top with a printed motif on the racer back and a design for the Triangle Shawl from a previous season. Combine components of these 2 very different garments, and the end design is the Athena Tank (shown below in blue), pattern 1740, worked in Babyboo, a bamboo/nylon blend  (very soft to the touch and machine washable).This pattern is also featured in the June issue of Knit\'n Style magazine (should be on the newsstand any day now).The mini lesson for this episode is about the basics of lace: for every yarn over in lace (which creates the eyelet openings) there must be a matching decrease to offset it. If you work a yarn over without this matching decrease, the yarn over becomes an increase (and you will have more and more stitches on your needle). The following chart shows you each group of matching stitches (each color = matching stitches).For the groups of symbols in blue, red, purple and green, each yarn over is matched with either a k2 together or ssk decrease. The 2 orange eyelets are offset by the double decrease in between. The Hey Teach Cardigan from Knitty.com I designed in 2008 (and still going strong) is a perfect example of a pattern where you must be careful in keeping track of your matching yarn overs and decreases. In the chart below, the blue line illustrates a sample armhole shaping. The 2 circled yarn overs must NOT be worked because their matching decrease (the inverted V to the right) is no longer being worked after being eliminated by shaping.As promised, I\'ve created a pdf file with a blank grid to be used whenever you want to chart out the complete armhole shaping of a garment, or if you want to experiment in designing your own lace—go ahead, give it a go!Hélène  | Listen NowAnother week has passed and we\'ve managed to stay on schedule with our second episode of the podcast. Next week will most likely be off track as I will be out of the office through  Wednesday.Episode 2 of the Knit One, Crochet Too podcast includes the following:1) Weekend Wrap-Up where Joyce tells us about her major stash re-organization, and Helene discusses her week-in-knitting projects. Joyce also gets tips on salvaging a project that came out too small.2) Do a little homework to learn how to transcribe information from garments you already own and love, onto a basic knitted t-shirt pattern.While Joyce discussed her systematic way of purging her stash, she mentioned the McClellan\'s Frankenmuth Woolen Mill where she had great luck in having fleeces  washed and carded. She got back beautiful balls of roving, ready to be spun.We would both be interested to hear some of your de-stashing tips or anecdotes. Please feel free to share via comments below!Ok, so back to the now called "Linus Capelet and Hat" set. I, not so originally, called it Linus because of the yarn it\'s made of (sometimes you put all your inspiration in the design and there ain\'t much left for the naming process, know what I mean?). Yes, I took it apart, down to the large cable band, and it really wanted to stay a capelet (minus the buttonband idea), or mini poncho, whatever you want to call it. Capelet sounds a bit like some medieval garment, and not exactly something fashionable...but it\'s probably just me.It fits about elbow length and is very warm. The hat is cute, too. This will be part of our next fall/winter season and the pattern will be available in late April. Linus is already in our line and is available now. Below is the video for the stretchy bind off shown in ribbing. You can use the same method if binding off knitwise or purlwise.The next project I managed to complete over the weekend is the Snow Flower Set worked in Petite Boucle. The yarn has too much texture to show any fancy pattern stitch and has lots of personality so it doesn\'t need much else. As I was unsure of its fiber content (shame on me!), I looked it up and here it is: 58% nylon/21% kid mohair/21% merino wool. The project is one size fits all adults. This will also be ready in April, and will only be available as a kit in all 12 colors of Petite Boucle . I knew I already had just the right buttons for this, and turns out I even had exactly 2 - sometimes the stars align just right.You can wear the cowl buttoned or not, depending on how much warmth you need. The button on the beret is decorative only.Joyce asked for suggestions on altering a vest she made a few years ago. She\'s worn it a few times, even though it is a bit too small. I suggested adding a double breasted band in the center, and going around the bottom if she also wanted more length. She thought working it in corrugated ribbing (alternating k2 in blue and p2 in multi) could be another option.The Daisy Vest, worked in Ambrosia was designed that way because the fronts were original too small (bad me didn\'t bother with a gauge swatch), and I added the wider bands at the center to add to the size. The double row of buttons turned out to be a nice unplanned design element.The "Made-to-Fit Tee Worksheet" is part of a "Basic Lesson Series" I decided to start. This first lesson has you try your hand at designing a basic t-shirt shaped top. I\'ve uploaded a pdf worksheet you can download.Work a gauge swatch first using your stitch of choice (no, no, don\'t do as I do, do as I say!), then follow the directions carefully and fill in all your dimensions and stitch count first, before transfering that information on the pattern. Keep in mind that if you use a real t-shirt (made of thin knit fabric) as the garment to measure, and plan on using the pattern you create to knit yourself a tee shirt, you need to allow a bit more ease as your handknit fabric will be thicker than that of the t-shirt. Click on image below to begin downloading the worksheet file.The Fiber Gypsy site has a great chart for Garment Ease Allowances that is worth bookmarking. I also highly recommend the book Designing Knitwear, by Deborah Newton. Although written in 1998, the information included on designing and fit, is still relevant—a must-have reference book.By the way, we are now listed on iTunes. Doing a search for Knit One Crochet Too should bring us up. If not, drop down the "Advanced" menu in the iTunes software, and select the "Subscribe to Podcast" option. In the input box, copy and paste: "http://feeds.feedburner.com/KnitOneCrochetToo". That worked for me. Please leave comments on iTunes as this will help in moving the podcast out of obscurity :-)This wraps up the notes portion of Episode 2. If you get stuck figuring out the t-shirt worksheet, post your questions here. Next podcast may be a continuation of this workshop. Have a great week in knitting!Hélène  | Listen NowWe\'ve finally taken the plunge and started a podcast and this accompanying blog. This has been percolating for a while, but as always, time flies by, and there are too many things to do, and not enough time.Episode 1 of the Knit One, Crochet Too podcast includes the following:1) our Monday morning weekend wrap up where we discuss our weekend endeavors, and I report on my ongoing designs and knitting projects2) a mini  lesson on color selections, with suggestions where to look for ideas for inspiring colors3) a short reading of a knitting related essayHere is what the failed (so far) capelet design worked in Linus yarn looks like - before frogging.This is a close-up view (above) of the end where the 1" band turned into a 4" band...and still not big enough to go around the shoulders and arms, unless I place a buttonhole at the very top, and the capelet is worn open in the center. Not the look I was looking for.This shows you the entire thing...mostly finished...with all the small braided cables...ready to be ripped back...all the way down to the large cable band (which I actually ended up doing). Next photos will be of the finished garment, done like my original idea (the one that actually fits), but in the round, with no opening or buttons. Plus, there will be a matching hat. Yes, I do like to torture myself. :-)The book of designs for the roller derby crowd is called  "Knockdown Knits: 30 Projects from the Roller Derby Track" by Joan of Dark a.k.a. Toni Carr. As I mentioned, you can go to Amazon.com and look inside the book to see some of the featured projects. Some cute things, some interesting things, some things a little bit weird...but what do I know, right? I am the one who went dancing in the snow bank with the referee.Oh, and did I mention that each sample in the book is modeled by a member of the Naptown Roller Girls? And if you are interested in our local roller derby team, Maine Roller Derby, you can read about them here.In the 2nd section of the podcast, I give you tips on color selection. I know some knitters feel less than confident when trying to select colors for a multi-color project. I give easy tips for developing a reference list  of matching color groups.Here is the image (above) of the Pantone color guide I use to communicate my color choices to the dye houses. From left to right, above the color chips, you can see Ty-Dy Wool, 2 upcoming colors of Wrapunzel, and the Lucia Tee, a free t-shirt pattern that uses Ty-Dy cotton.Here\'s a photo of the whole Lucia Tee. Isn\'t it cute? The pattern is written from finished size 34" to 50".I did a lot of fiddling with the podcast sound file, trying to make it sound as professional as I can. But of course, as this is our very first program, I know things can only get better. So, please forgive any popping, smacking, talking over each other, mismatch sound level, and anything else that may need working on. I do invite you to post comments of specific peeves that we will try to address. Of course, we know we won\'t be everyone\'s cup of tea...and that\'s ok.We just hope to bring you some insider information from the business end of yarn, and a bit more.Enjoy!Hélène ', 'chan_desc': "A podcast from folks who work at Knit One, Crochet Too, the yarn company...really, yarn and knitting fanatics...who can't ever get enough knitting...or yarn...", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts6/v4/02/d2/5b/02d25b66-3960-0406-ee79-c8bff86d2f55/mza_328611544769756200.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2011-02-16'}}

Have appreciation for each item; display, store, use and discard things with gratitude. -Discard things by either giving away, donating, selling, or tossing into the trash. -The KonMari categories as I relate them to sewing stuff:  Clothing: finished items, garments, current and completed projects. These I recommend doing last in the Sentimental category. Books: all sewing-related books and publications Documents: patterns, pattern papers, magazines, notes, binders, etc. Komono/Misc: This should be broken down into subcategories:  Fabric: all fabrics, buckram & crinoline, muslin Trims, Lace: braids, tapes, ribbons, flowers/greenery, etc. Notions: Thread, buttons, zippers, hooks/eyes, boning, hoop wire, tapes, needles, pins, interfacings, elastic, yarns, etc. Sewing Tools: scissors, rulers, seam gauges, grommet setter, irons, sewing machines, sewing boxes, glue guns, knitting needles and crochet hooks, etc.   Sentimental: finished projects and costumes, undergarments, corsets, stockings and shoes, hats & bonnets, specific costume accessories, awards, convention memorabilia, photos, etc.  –Tim Ferriss\' interview with Marie Kondo\xa0 –Spark Joy Podcast hosted by KonMari Consultants: Kristyn Ivey and Karin Socci.

Through his numerous published articles he was able to share what many consider to be one of the greatest model railroads of all time.In this podcast Bruce the Moderately Agitated Mailboy takes us on a tour of his railroad and the man behind it all. Enjoy!! | What sort of questions would you ask someone that is a lighting engineer on “The Great White Way” and owns one of the finest model railroad shops in the midwest?? The Kelly Questions of course, a series of hard hitting questions and insights designed to discover the man under the no nonsense exterior of a tough businessman. Unfortunately Kelly didn’t write down any of those questions but we do manage to waste another hour of modeling time. So grab yourself a large bowl of shredded blue box kits, a tall glass of Solvaset and enjoy!! | What happens when you mix a Norfolk Southern engineer together with a freelance modeler and an active YouTube creator?? It’s a very interesting ninety minutes of podcasting. Tim has a great layout which he uses to relax from the day to day stress of being 1:1 railroader. There’s lots see and do on his Seaboard Central Railroad, so sit back and enjoy some great railroading stories and unique insights from another interesting guest of the AML Nation. | It’s time for another fabulous round of the Kelly Questions!! Each envelope has been hermetically sealed in the front pocket of Mike “the Spoon” Ostertag’s coveralls… No one… I repeat, no one has been given access to these questions until now. Find out what happens when a drummer, waiter, guy that prepares taxes, teacher and lonesome devil is put to the test. So grab yourself a bowl of shredded tax returns, a tall glass of recycled table water and enjoy!! | Ever wonder what it’s like to be an outstanding architectural modeler and the vice-president of a well respected company like ExactRail??Is it possible to have a one foot by seven foot layout featured on the cover of one our hobby’s top magazines. Can a small layout provide enough entertainment to host operating sessions for as many as six people?? The Hudson Terminal Railway and is a fictional subsidiary of the New York Central that’s heavily influenced by the multiple terminals that were once served by car floats. This a great interview which we’re sure you’ll enjoy. | It’s time for another exciting round of the Kelly questions and once again our victim… errr… Our guest has been strapped to the couch with his tinfoil helmet securely attached. We first met Cale in September of 2018 when he introduced us to the world of Lego trains. When not building models he can be found researching railroad history, and riding trains. You can find out more about Lego trains at: https://brickmodelrailroader.com/ So grab yourself a bowl of shredded bricks, a tall glass of axle grease and enjoy!! | Another model railroad manufacturer steps up. This time Rapido Trains and Jason Shron have produced a limited run of TTX\'s "On Track for a Cure" Husky-Stack well car. With every car purchased, Rapido will donate $10 to Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, in support of the Psychosocial Oncology Department. This car includes two limited edition Rapido Trains refrigerated domestic smooth-side containers and sold out in less than 48 hours. Thanks to Jason and Janet Shron and the hard working team Rapido Trains!! | We’ve returned once again to CP Rail’s Galt Subdivision, an exquisitely detailed layout modeling a relatively short section of busy mainline that incorporates the towns of Woodstock and Zorra, Ontario with it’s landmark cement plant. Bob is always full of passion about the hobby as we cover everything from the cross pollination of military modeling, the ease of taking photos with his iPhone, the Fallowfield effect, painting brass hoppers with a rattle can and all the comings and goings at ESU. Enjoy!! | So you’re disappointed that you didn’t get to the National Train Show in Salt Lake City?? Well neither did we but that hasn’t stopped us from being excited about all the new products being offered by dozens and dozens of manufacturers. So our crack staff headed by Model Railroad News editor Tony Cook have compiled pages and pages of copious notes in order to keep all those in the AML Nation informed about all the latest comings and goings in the hobby. Grab yourself a big bowl of shredded floor maps and enjoy!!! | What happens when a professional audio engineer and a model railroader combines his love of sound and trains into one product?? Spectacular model sound and realism is the never ending pursuit of J.T. Burke who has managed to create, what some are saying is the best sound in the hobby. This is a great interview suggested to us by Scott Thornton of ProtoThrottle fame after he was fortunate enough to experience first hand some the best sound effects he’d ever heard.

Good day!\xa0 | In this episode I talk with the McQuades, a birding couple who are on their 5th consecutive big year in the lower 48 states, and this is their 4th consecutive year of >600 species in the lower 48.\xa0 We talk about their birding stories, birding as a couple, birding while working full time, birding on what they call the last ABA birding frontier, the Gulf of Mexico, where they bird at speeds of >50 mph using radar to find the widespread birds, and how social media has enhanced their efforts and experiences.\xa0Check out my post on birdbanter.com where I will leave more detailed information, but here are a few links about topics discussed.https://www.facebook.com/david.mcquade.96https://www.facebook.com/david.mcquade.96Dorian Anderson\'s blog from his bicycle big year.\xa0\xa0http://bikingforbirds.blogspot.com/Christian Hagenlocher\'s The Birding Project page:\xa0\xa0http://www.thebirdingproject.Laura Keene\'s blog site\xa0\xa0https://birdtherock.com/tag/laura-keene/Blair Bernson\'s blog with details of many of his 50 state saga:\xa0\xa0https://blairbirding.comOlaf Danielson\'s Big Year Blog:\xa0\xa0http://olafsbigyear.blogspot.com/John Weigel\'s 2019 Big Year blog\xa0\xa0https://birdingyear.com/back-in-the-game/Good Birding and Good Day! | In Episode #26 my guest Tim Larson makes a strong case for the use of poison to eradicate mice from the Farallone Islands off the coast of California.\xa0 Rodent infestation of bird breeding islands is a huge issue. Seabirds are facing incredible pressure on their populations from overfishing, global warming, and other issues without solutions that have been proven to work.\xa0 Rodent eradication can work, but is controversial because of the use of poisons with short-term effects on other animals than the intended rodents.\xa0 Still Tim makes a case that their use is effective, proven and more humane than allowing them to continue to prey on birds who evolved to breed on islands where there were no mammalian predators.\xa0 I hope you find the episode informative.

I love books, the feel, the smell, even the taste. I do read books on an ereader as well and listen but there is nothing compared to a paper paged book. So I am asking this question. If you could only recommend five books to someone, what would they be? (I am willing to give one of those slots to a series of books but I want you to push yourselves and really think about this.) Also, what are books you like to revisit? I revisit the Harry Potter Series often and am considering the Narnia Series again… I love, LOVE, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.We mention: Lament for a Son by Nicholas Wolterstorff The Accidental Anglican by Todd D.

That is very obvious. What is your preferred method for making either drink at home? I like a good pour over method or a french press. The only reason I don’t make more french press is because of the clean up…. I hate cleaning the french press out. But I know there are other methods out there. (having worked in a coffee roasters retail shop I do know a lot of them.) Do you prefer a cold brew or a hot brew? How do you take you coffee and tea? Black or with “additives” such as cream, sugar, honey, lemon? Of the current drinks out at cafes, what is your current favorite? Also what is your all time favorite at cafes? This doesn’t have to be at a big chain store either, one of my favorite drinks is at a local twenty four hour coffeehouse, the drink is called an Irish Carbomb and the café is called Bitter End.

If you have ever considered grabbing your gear and heading to the great outdoors, then check out the World Wide Flora and Fauna program. In 2016 the ARRL held a year long event called ‘National Parks On The Air’. Amateur radio operators operated from parks all across America for certificates and awards. The event was a huge success. However many HAM operators weren’t aware of another ‘parks’ program they could participate in. The World Wide Flora and Fauna program is the oldest and original parks program. It was started in 2010 and currently has 53 countries participating in the program. According to their website; “The\xa0WWFF\xa0program wants to draw attention to the importance of protecting nature, flora and fauna. In this spirit amateur radio operators set up and operate their radio stations from designated nature parks and protected nature areas – generating attention for these areas whilst giving the ham radio community an interesting activity to contact.\xa0WWFF\xa0is an international and non-commercial program run by the National coordinators of a large number of national Flora and Fauna programs.” In this episode, we talk with KA2LHO, Kraig Pritts, W0PHX George Burger, and KD0IRW, Tanner Colvin about the WWFF program, activating parks, chasing activators, why this program is so great for new CW ops, logging DX, “Make Nature Your Shack”, and having tons of fun! | Many HAM operators never had the benefit of an Elmer. Most of us figured it out, but there were other times, like the time we were wondering why nobody ever answered our CQs because we didn’t know our code sending was so atrocious. It would have been nice to have someone sit next to us and show us how to send better code… Howard Bernstein, WB2UZE and Rich Collins, K2UPS - the New Elmers - are changing that with the Long Island CW Club. Their method of teaching Morse code and CW is casual and fun. It is a unique experience that has already appealed to more than a hundred students wanting a less structured and more relaxed approach to learning the code.\xa0 In this episode, Howard and Rich explain how the club got started, their unique way of teaching, and the classes available to anyone wanting to learn the code and have fun. | ‘Key Fright’ - The feeling of anxiety, nervousness, and excessive worry about making mistakes sending and receiving Morse code. Most often afflicting new CW operators immediately before attempting their first QSO. Every CW operator remembers their first on air QSO. Sitting in front of your radio, hoping you’d be able to copy code… and praying the other operator sends it slow enough for you to handle. It was really stressful and really exciting all at the same time! And those feelings of relief, joy, and pride you felt swelling in your chest afterward have rarely been matched since. The anxiety and uncertainty we feel doing something new for the first time is a very common experience. It’s part of what makes us human. It isn’t unique to any particular group of people, nation, or continent… we all get anxious and nervous from time to time. In this episode, I talk with five CW operators spanning three continents about the jitters, anxiety, being nervous and their first CW QSO experience. | The North American QRP CW Club (NAQCC) is the world’s largest organization of it’s kind with thousands of members in over 140 countries around the globe. All of the organization’s events are operated QRP and CW mode. Paul Huff, N8XMS, the NAQCC president talks about the club, it’s many activities, events, free membership, and the wide variety of of challenging and fun awards it has to offer. Spend a little time with Paul and discover all the great things this club has to offer! | Amateur radio has a long tradition of giving back and Elmering new radio operators. Anyone who has ever received the generous and patient attention from an Elmer is ever so thankful and appreciative for that help.\xa0 John Merkel, AJ1DM, is a shining example of the spirit of giving back and paying it forward. His volunteer activities include teaching tech classes, being a Volunteer Examiner, actively participating in fox hunts and special events, and donating time to introduce kids on Indian reservations to the fun and excitement of Morse code and CW. Amateur radio has much to offer and can be a source of great personal enrichment and fulfillment that can come from giving a little of ourselves to the next generation of amateur radio operators.\xa0 John Merkel is an inspiration to all amateur radio operators! | There are several organizations that promote Morse code and the CW operating mode. One of the very best is the Straight Key Century Club (SKCC). The organization officially began on January 2, 2006 and currently has over 18,800+ members worldwide. The SKCC offers one of the broadest assortments of awards, contests and activities available from any organization for every level of CW operator to participate in. Ted Rachwal, K8AQM, is a member of the SKCC board and editor of the "Rag Chew", the official newsletter of the Straight Key Century Club. We spent a little time talking with Ted about the SKCC, the resources and benefits the club has to offer, and why it\'s no surprise that many of the nicest people you\'ll ever meet in the CW bands are SKCC members! | Tom Parish, KB5RF, had the rare opportunity to take all three CW Academy courses in a twelve-month period. He began his Level 1 course hardly knowing anything about Morse code and completed the advanced Level 3 course twelve months later as a skilled CW operator capable of sending and receiving Morse code at 20+ word-per-minute. Listen as Tom shares helpful insights and experiences as a CW Academy student and follow him along on his unusual and intense journey to learn Morse code! | No matter if your operating QRP or QRO, having the right antenna for the job depends on what your target is.\xa0 In this episode, Steve Deines, N0TES, owner of Alpha Antenna talks about targeted antenna\xa0deployment, getting the best out of your antenna, and learning code in the dark! | There are many ways to learn Morse code.\xa0People often take the leap and try learning on their own. That what Roland Simmons, K7FOP, did... until he found a better way! Roland is an avid SOTA activator who had been packing not-so-light gear to peaks in the great northwest. His SOTA partner showed him an LNR Mountain Topper he would be using on the activation they were doing that day. Roland realized he could hold an HF radio, wire antenna, key and battery in one hand, and it was infinity lighter than a pack full of heavy gear! That\'s when he decided it was time to learn Morse code. Roland began learning the code by himself using computer programs and help from CW operators on Facebook. When he felt he wasn\'t progressing as fast as he wanted he found other apps that worked better and helped him learn faster. Eventually, he enrolled in a CW Academy course and got on the air. Learning the code on your own can be tough. Roland discovered he didn\'t have to go it alone. There are many resources you can use that will help you learn the code as quickly as possible. Listen as Roland shares some great advice about learning the code. | Cabin fever making you crazy... had enough of winter!? Spring is almost here, it\'s time to check your gear and head out into the fresh air. Find a comfy spot, throw a wire up in a tree and get on the air. Chris Bravo, W4ALF, talks about the joy of going portable. He\'ll discuss basic considerations, recommended antennas, when you should sign with a /P or /QRP and a few other things that will be handy to know when you\'re out in the field operating QRP CW.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'DitDit.fm is a podcast celebrating morse code, the CW operating mode and amateur radio.

First up, I mention the recent discussion around racism, inclusion and diversity in the knitting community. This podcast has not been as inclusive as it should be in the content produced up to now and I apologise for that. News-wise, I share a new podcast interview I did that is released now on The InDependant Spouse podcast with Jess Sands, which is a podcast that shares stories from military spouses and veterans in business. After this, there's a round up of knitting and creative projects that I've been taking part in. Spoiler: I've almost finished writing a book! Shownotes at www.shinybees.com/133 Music for this episode is Adam and the Walter Boys, I Need a Drink. | Carol Feller joins me on the show this week, sharing her journey into knitwear design. Carol Feller (StolenStiches.com) is a designer, teacher, and author living in Cork, Ireland. She has published almost 270 patterns and 7 books, including Short Row Knits (Pottercraft) and Contemporary Irish Knits (Wiley), and is a popular instructor on Craftsy.com with almost 400,000 students. She regularly teaches at yarn shops, fibre festivals, knitting retreats and tours, covering a wide variety of basic and advanced skills including chart reading, garment shaping, short rows, cables, and colourwork. Carol first learned to knit in primary school, and there is a strong history of crafting in her family. In university, she trained as a textile artist, and then as a structural engineer. Both of these backgrounds influence her work, which uses innovative construction methods to create well-shaped and flattering objects that are intuitive and enjoyable to knit, and that make the most out of carefully chosen yarns. She strives to help knitters create beautiful and unique products that they will love to use.

Are you a show veteran? or have you never been to a show? Somewhere in between? In this episode I share some top tips for getting the most out of attending yarn shows, including where to find which ones are happening. Looking at why you want to attend (social, shopping, work or a mixture) can help you to narrow down the wide range of options available these days and ensure you get the best experience. On the shopping side, it's worth saving up if possible, so you have a kitty of money to spend at the show. This can help with planning and budgeting. Some people collect £2 coins all year for instance. Make a list of what you want to make, and consult the stash to see where the gaps are. Once you know what the requirements are, make a list of what you need to get in terms of yardages and weights. This will mean you don't need to find wifi to look it up at a busy show stand and can have the information easily to hand. Having a priority route planned out can help with avoiding distractions. Check out the guide online in advance of the event so you know where you need to go and in what order. On the social side, definitely make sure you have made firm plans with anyone you definitely want to see. If you say you will 'see them there' there is every chance you won't because it is busy and full of yarn fumes. Fit in coffee breaks with catch ups and save money by getting a group airbnb if staying over. If your budget is a little bigger, you might decide to travel to a show in Europe and stay only for the day or just one night as an alternative to staying at a longer UK show, so you get a different experience.

Daria is the creative genius behind Cloud 9 Fiberworks, and is based in Winnipeg in Canada. Originally indulging in her love of yarn as a child, she would often be found under the table in her Aunt's yarn shop in Winnipeg, untangling balls of yarn. Still an aficionado of vintage yarns from the period, she also produces hand dyed yarns, both on custom blended yarns just for her as well as on more commercially available yarns for hand dyeing. Daria takes her inspiration from many places. A lot of her yarns have a nod to fantasy and sci fi (with Star Trek and Harry Potter being two of the bigger influences) and she also draws on random ideas, such as suggestions from customers or other inspiration. In this episode we also discussed the Canadian market at depth, with regard to what is available to dye onto both commercially and as custom spins. The mills in Canada are few and even fewer are capable of handling long staple fibres. Although there is a great climate for growing wool and fibre in the country, it doesn't necessarily translate to the ability to process these fibres. Also, the market is split into little 'islands' - there is so much geographical distance between groups, that it can be hard to both find breed yarns to try and be brave enough to do it. Daria had her own yarn commissioned which was a blend of merino, Shetland and Gotland from local farmers, into a singles, fingering weight yarn. Full show notes for this episode and all links are at www.shinybees.com/130 | What will be the five big trends for knitting in 2019? In this episode I share what I think will be the five top trends for the hand knitting world in 2019.  Based on what has gone prior and general observation of content and social media, I have picked out the following as things to watch.  1) Intarsia - we've seen brioche come and get overcooked and 2018 was definitely the year of the colour work yoked sweater. Intarsia is the next logical step in this progression for me. Bonus: Beads will be big in 2020/1 I reckon.  2) More Commercial Yarns - people will be combining hand dyed with more off-the-shelf, mass produced yarns in classic palettes and colours to tone down the speckled crazy. 3) More Emphasis on Knitting What You Have - not stashing down or cold shipping necessarily (they get done and abandoned every year) but a growing awareness of impact and sustainability generally. This will expand to knitting and encourage people to use what they have over wanton procurement. 4) Purchasing One-Offs - buying will focus more on the luxury, one-off and single farm type yarns that are special, over mass buying of run-of-the-mill yarns. 5) The Death of the One Skein Shawl - both designers and knitters will abandon this mid 2000-teen trend in favour of multi-skein mega shawls along the lines of the fades. What are your predictions for 2019? Full show notes at www.shinybees.com/129 | It's always a popular time to plan your projects for the coming new year, but do you really need to? I won't be doing Make9in2019 next year (spoiler) bout I will be using other people's ideas for that project as inspiration for what I could consider. The podcast will be going on tour soon and that has prompted some consideration in terms of what to take with me. As it's going to be a little longer than the average holiday, it's taken more consideration in terms of planning what to take. This episode is a discussion around the process I'm in currently in terms of trying to work out what is essential and desirable when changing continents. Full show notes at www.shinybees.com/128 | Christmas Jumper Day is 14th December and in today's episode, I'm running through your different options when it comes to embracing this staple of the festive season. Prompted by a social media post from @fash_rev about the Brits' obsession with the Christmas Jumper. Did you know that we will spend in excess of £220 MILLION on Christmas Jumpers this year? A quarter of which will end up in the bin? Charity shops are saying they are overflowing with Christmas jumpers. So, for our first option for acquiring a festive sweater is to go to your local charity shop and get your jumper from them. That way, charity wins twice! The next option is to consider an onshore supplier for your Christmas jumper. Kate Hills of the Make It British podcast interviewed Bhavik Master, who runs a family knitwear factory in Leicester. They manufacture Christmas jumpers here in the UK. They are acrylic, but at least they are local and they have a good range of designs, including some that are on the nordic end of the festive spectrum. My favourites of these are the Classic Fair Isle and the Penguin Fair Isle design. You can find these at www.britishchristmasjumpers.com and you can hear the full story at makeitbritish.co.uk/008 Your gold plated solution, is, of course, to knit your own jumper that you can wear for the next 30 years, just like Uncle Robert.

This could be over buying models that just sit there and\xa0are then sold, buying models to play games they will never play, or spending a lot of time berating themselves for not painting or playing when they want to.\xa0 \xa0 I first talked about this in episode 95 & 96 of the show, so that might be a good listen before this one as you will have more of an idea of what I mean before we begin.\xa0 \xa0 In these episodes we also pull in how the hobby may positively or negatively effect our\xa0personal health, the aspects of this being physical/social/mental. I personally believe that any part of our lives can affect our health and this hobby is no different. I personally try to make sure that the hobby is only affecting me in a positive way and these episodes are me and Mr Ignatius Fisher talking about what sustainable gaming is for us, in our experience.\xa0 \xa0 A final couple of notes are that this is not trying to tell you what to do, if you love this hobby and it fulfills you then let no one dissuade you from it. We also dont claim\xa0 to be experts or qualified to discuss this, so please dont take any thing we talk about as gospel or an idiots guide to happiness. It quickly becomes apparent that this subject area is incredibly deep.\xa0 \xa0 We hope that by\xa0 listening\xa0 it gives you pause for thought, a\xa0 few nuggets to reflect on. And possibly a few laughs.\xa0 \xa0 On a personal note it was the first time I had verbalized a lot of thoughts and feelings\xa0 and it really helped me to figure out what sustainable gaming means for me.\xa0 \xa0 Please make sure you reach out to share thoughts, feelings, or things you do in the hobby.\xa0 \xa0 I hope you enjoy the chat.\xa0 | This episode I speak to Brent Amberger of the Goobertown Hobbies Youtube Channel. Goobertown Hobbies is a youtube channel I personally really enjoy as there is a lot of thought, depth, and insight included in the videos I have watched. In an age of clickbait and also lots of videos/content that appears to have been put together to over promise and underdeliver I find Brent’s videos to be insightful and interesting. The way that he does his videos I appreciate, he never seems to be ‘selling’ anything, he just seems to be sharing his thoughts and his ethos, which is something Ii really enjoy. It was great talking to Brent and it is yet another positive byproduct of this podcast for me personally that not only do I get to find channels like Brent’s but I also get to spend an hour chatting to him, it was a fun chat and I hope that you enjoy it too. | Sustainable Gaming!!! Playing, Painting, Not overspending. Physical, Mental, Social Health. Coming Sept 20 for an entire month our podcast will be given over to talking about this concept of making the hobby work for us. ‘Enjoying the hobby and participating in it for the longest time possible, understanding what it is we like about it & what we dont, controlling it, not allowing it to control us.’ It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Ignatius Fischer on over 8 hours of audio spread across 4 episode for you guys as we talk about and make sense on our terms of how the hobby affects us and the things we can do to make it work more for us. It is essential to note that we are not experts, only people chatting about it from our experience and on our terms, also that it is not a set of rules. We hope that it could potentially be a catalyst for reflection to make sure that whatever you are doing is for you and possibly prompt some sort of thought. It has personally really helped me to make sense of my hobby and allowed me to find ways to improve certain health aspects whilst participating in this hobby we all love. | This episode I talk to Mr Mark Latham a now freelance games designer and writer who has worked on or created a number of games we would have heard of such as The Walking Dead All Out War, The Harry Potter Miniatures Game, and The Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms. Mark also has a very interesting background working with Games Workshop and was clearly involved in shaping key elements that a great many people hold fondness for, I wont spoil the chat by mentioning them here but I am sure that it will be a waltz down memory lane for a lot of you. It was great talking to Mark and I really enjoyed out chat, I hope you do to. | This episode I speak to Henry Hyde, a gent who has had a long and very interesting pathway in the hobby industry and has participated in a wide variety of roles and responsibilities. Working mostly in written media he has moved with the times and felt the changes in personal preference and technological advances. It was really fun speaking to Henry and I hope you enjoy the chat we had. If you haven’t heard of him before you can listen into the show where he talks about his Patreon activities and also his twitter account. I hope you enjoy our chat, I wont spoil it by talking about any more of it here. | This episode I speak to Jonas Ekman in a Why I love podcast where he talks about all the reasons he loves Open Combat. I will let Jonas talk to you about the details and why he loves it so much but some headlines are that Open Combat straddles skirmish/RPG games and allows you to use any models you have whilst also allowing you to stat them in any way you’d like . I really enjoy the Why I love podcasts and this one was no exception. I hope you enjoy the chat. We arent salesmen and we arent looking to influence you but if you like the sound of Open Combat you can find out more here: https://www.secondthunder.com/store/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1 | This episode I speak to Mike Hutchinson the writer of Gaslands, the post apocalyptic game of vehicular combat and racing, and also the upcoming game A Billion Suns which comes in 2020. I loved talking to Mike as his demeanour, candour, and insight makes for a great chat. Its obvious from our chat that he is a positive & hard working guy and there were so many threads I would have liked to chase down but alas time marched ever on and I could not ask all I wanted to. One key area that came up in our pre show and mid show chat was the idea of having a growth mindset, if you aren’t aware of what a growth mindset is then go and do some reading on it as it is something that I truly believe that can help in personal and professional situations. Carol Dweck is the person you need to look into. Its something I dont claim to be perfect at, and Mike quite rightly pulls me up on some slack thoughts I put out there in regard to games but there is a common thread that pops up regularly on the show with people who have ‘done something’ in the hobby industry and that is their ability and craft are developed and honed with time and experience. Sounds simple and straight forward when you read of it but the execution is what separates people like Mike from other people who maybe have a great idea but just dont ever do anything with it. I really do hope that I manage to get Mike back onto the show in the future as the hour literally flew by and it was a true pleasure. | This week I talk to Olly Gibson an average Joe just like you and me who enjoys the hobby but also has his YouTube channel Liberum Esse where he posts his thoughts. I will let Olly tell you what this means in due course. The show was a run rambly chat as it should be and covers a wide variety of things. It was great speaking to him and it is people like Olly that have made, will make, and currently make my experience in this hobby a positive one. I really subscribe to OIly’s ideas and the way he goes about things, very laid back, down to earth, and positive. I hope you enjoy the show!', 'chan_desc': 'Hey there!I sit and chat with a wide ranging set of individuals from both inside and on the outside of the Tabletop/RPG/Boardgame industry about their experience, insight, & motivations. Put on a show whilst you are painting and hear the stories behind your fellow geekers and the people that created the games you know and love.I hope you enjoy.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts128/v4/89/4a/43/894a43c6-eff5-525b-749e-866a5b1fcea8/mza_7142798565346077018.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-02-27'}}

When and how did you first learn to knit? I think it was in 2014, and I learned by watching YouTube videos. Every time I encountered a new stitch or technique I would just watch videos and practice until I figured it out. My own grandmothers had long since stopped knitting by the time I had an interest, but I’m hoping to teach my daughter in a few more years. What was your first project? A cotton dishcloth. I knit 3 of them on some terrible plastic needles from Michael’s, but despite some dropped stitches and random yarn overs, they are still workhorses stashed away with my cleaning supplies! What is your biggest knitting disaster? Hmm. Nothing comes to mind really. I tend to stop long before something ends disastrously (in knitting..not necessarily in life!). I knit a Gaptastic Cowl as one of my earliest projects, before I knew what gauge was, and it was monstrously huge. I’m talking, could-have-clothed-a-linebacker big. Needless to say, it got frogged! What are you most proud of as a knitter? I’m proud to create beautiful, useful, long lasting items that can be tangible examples for my loved ones of how much I care about them (because it’s a big time & energy investment!). And, when I knit for myself, I’m proud to engage in an activity that is a powerful act of self care both in the actual making of the thing, and then in the wearing of it. It really feels like I’m nurturing myself when I cast on something lovely with only myself in mind. We should really call it self-love knitting, rather than selfish knitting! What are you favorite items to knit? Stuffed toys for the important tiny humans in my life, and shawls for myself Are you a process knitter or a product knitter? I’m both! I used to be more of a product knitter but the more time goes on the more I’ve found that the act of knitting has become incredibly important to my well being. I’m a stay-at-home parent now, and it is hands down the most difficult job I’ve ever had (and I used to literally save babies for a living as an NICU nurse). Knitting allows me to satisfy so many of own needs: for mental stimulation, quiet alone time, and creative expression, all of which are hard to come by at this stage of my life. So, process has become extremely important to me as well. That said, I can’t fully engage in a project unless the finished object is something I’m excited to gift or wear. What it will be definitely still matters. Do you have any knitting goals? Projects? Techniques? I’d love to learn brioche, dive into sweater making, and eventually learn enough of the math involved to begin tech editing. Math doesn’t come easily to me, but I love editing. I can learn, right? Do you do any other fiber arts other than knitting? Not yet, but I have grand plans to learn embroidery, weaving, sewing, and rug punching. I want to learn it all! Especially sewing, I am most excited about eventually being able to make my own clothes and stop relying on fast fashion, which isn’t in line with my values and not the example for resource stewardship that I want to set for my daughter. But because she is so little, and free time is so scarse, new hobbies have to wait a while. Do you have any other super powers other than knitting? Momming. Thats a super power right?? I never really felt that i had a “true calling” until my child was born. Mothering, while certainly not all unicorns and rainbows, is really a natural aptitude for me. I’m good at it, and I love it (most days). I used to be a pretty good writer too, back in the day, and I can pick up new languages easily. I’m also a PADI Divemaster, which means I can teach some scuba diving courses and guide other divers around sites. I’m an excellent shark spotter! If there is one to be found or spotted in the distance, I promise i’ll see it. Anything else you’d like to tell the world? (shameless self promotion!) I’m incredibly passionate about feminism (intersectional or bust), and birth and the myriad of ways the two intersect. And I’ll happily chat about either with anyone, anytime!
