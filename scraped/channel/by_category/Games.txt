We also get into how the plot of\xa0Romeo & Juliet compares to a cooperative game, and how game design could possibly connect to contra dancing. | In this GameTek from August 2017, Geoff goes through three interesting bits of of game design-related research. Is there such a thing as momentum in sports? How does the brain react to the prospect of punishing others for violating social norms? And how does the Prisoner\'s Dilemma change if we alter its framing?', 'chan_desc': 'Welcome to Ludology, an analytical discussion of the how’s and why’s of the world of board games.

Hundreds of thousands volunteered for the militia during the Iran-Iraq war, boys as young as 12 were allowed to join and then deployed in human wave attacks at the front to clear minefields or draw enemy fire.Tens of thousands of children would die marching in straight lines against Iraqi positions, believing that they were heroes of the revolution and would be welcomed in heaven as martyrs.\xa0Campaign: Taroticum, KULT: Divinity LostMusic by: Atrium Carceri, Apocryphos, Eldar, Kammarheit, God Body Disconnect, Herbst9, Cities Last BroadcastWeb: https://www.redmoonroleplaying.comiTunes: http://apple.co/2wTNqHxAndroid: http://bit.ly/2vSvwZiYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/RedMoonRoleplayingRSS: http://www.redmoonroleplaying.com/podcast?format=rssPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/RedMoonRoleplaying | How easy is it to tame a frenzying super model, blessed by the undead gifts of the Ministry?

They\'re like Choose Your Own Adventure, but with D&D and, well, boring. Sort of! Maybe we\'re being too hard on them. We dig in to the first few, the history of the series, the unusual places it goes and there is, perhaps, a surprising turn-around of opinion. We learn a lot about ourselves on this podcast, folks. We\'re already getting excited for Halloween (what, its after Labor Day) so we\'ve got a couple games we\'re excited about. Stu finally got a hold of the rulebook for Mummy: The Resurrection, which tickles his funny bone.

It is the first major metaplot in tabletop RPGs and catapulted Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weiss onto the bestseller list, but never quite coalesced into the major D&D campaign setting it should have. We talk about the reasons why. After that, Hambone sits down with Craig Bergman, assistant manager of the Fantasy Flight Games Center about, well, the awesome  Fantasy Flight Games Center event space.

Check out the Kickstarter for Nerdy City\'s new Kickstarter for their Transformers-inspired RPG  Commandroids! | We start off with a videogame! We both logged a lot of hours in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. Lots of videogame food was made. The main course is the LJN Dungeons & Dragons toy line. We run through an overview of the entire line, talk about some of the toys that were never produced and even discuss the amazing concept art by comic artists Timothy Truman, Steve Bisette and John Totleben. And more. We go deep on this one, folks. [Hambone is a wrestling fan of the sort who uses wrestling lingo in real life. When he says "job" as a verb, as in "jobbed out by a unicorn," he means losing, usually in a fashion that puts the winner in an unusually favorable light] Finally, we chat about the new Young Adventurer\'s Guides: Monsters & Creatures and Warriors & Weapons. They\'re geared towards kids, entirely lack rules and focus on how the world works and teaching players how to roleplaying. They\'re pretty great. | Welcome back to the Vintage RPG podcast! We kick things off with the super-appropriate-for-July, Target-exclusive board game adaptation of Jaws. Its fun! The main course is Forgotten Realms, Ed Greenwood\'s classic campaign setting. We walk through the creation of the world, its absorption into Dungeons & Dragons and just barely scratch the surface of all the stuff that has happened with the Realms over the years. The Realms are huge, so we\'ll be visiting them again, no doubt. We wrap things up with a look at Things From the Flood, the follow-up to Tales From the Loop, the RPG about the 80s that never existed. Flood moves things up to the 90s and now your kid characters can die, because the 90s are gritty!

Use code SummerMoon from July 21 to August 5 for $5 off orders of $25 or more! | We made it one year! To celebrate our anniversary, we talk about some of our favorite things, and ramble through a number of seemingly random topics, like our love for sniveling cowards, whether Lord Soth listens to Sisters of Mercy, the glorious badness of the D&D cartoon, murder hobo average intelligence and jeeze, that\'s just the first 15 minutes. We also have a chat with Levi Combs of Planet X games. We talk about his first 5E D&D module Jungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride and learn some of the secrets in his new one,  An Occurrence at Howling Crater, now on Kickstarter! (The video Stu mentions is the video at the top of the campaign page). | We have a very special guest this episode. Tony DiTerlizzi graced us with a full length interview. We chat about his influences, Dragon Mountain, the Monstrous Manual, Planescape, Magic the Gathering, the Spiderwick Chronicles, Hong Kong dinosaurs (you can read Tony\'s post on these and their influence on Dungeons & Dragons  here) and so much more - and barely scratch the surface, honestly. Tony\'s retrospective art show, Never Abandon Imagination, opens June 22 at the Mint Museum Randolph, in Charlotte, North Carolina, and runs through November 3. If you\'re in the area, be sure to check it out. You can also follow Tony on Twitter and Instagram. | We start off with Hambone\'s experience playing the classic fantasy themed board game Talisman\xa0for the first time. He played the recent fourth edition from Fantasy Flight. Did you know there was an unofficial 1.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons? There was! Beginning with Unearthed Arcana and following through Oriental Adventures, Dungeoneer\'s Survival Guide and the Wilderness Survival Guide, it was partly a natural evolution of the system, partly a desperate attempt to save the company from financial ruin. Stu walks us through the history. Finally, we started playing Pendragon and we chat about character creation and the first introductory session. (Stu never explicitly states it, but the tedious bit was not the character creation itself, but rather working through the family histories). | A double meat episode! First off, Stu gives an overview of Keith Herber\'s series of Lovecraft Country sourcebooks for Call of Cthulhu: Arkham Unveiled, Return to Dunwich, Kingport: City in the Mists and Escape from Innsmouth. They are an important piece in the puzzle of how to present large regions in a way that is helpful and engaging for roleplaying games. Second, Hambone is a-glow for the new Dungeons & Dragons adventure compilation, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, which reprints a number of classic D&D scenarios, including the U-series: Sinister Secret of Salt Marsh, Danger at Dunwater and The Final Enemy. Surprising no one, Stu is less enthusiastic. Don\'t let that grump stop you, though. Ghosts of Saltmarsh is for sale now at our sponsor, Noble Knight Games.

Good thing Gen Con gave us a bigger room than ever before. Let's pack even more in next year! Between now and then, join us next week on our Patreon for a live recording of this month's Editor's Note! | We're at it again - posting something when we said we wouldn't. What rapscallions. You can't take us anywhere. Show Notes: Run Time: 8:13 This is the second week of our two week Gen Con hiatus, and yet, we just couldn't NOT post SOMETHING, right? Last week was Gen Con, as we lie about on the air.\xa0 For this Microsode, we answer the NEWEST, the FRESHEST, the RIGHT OFF THE PRESSES letter - one sent in mere hours before we recorded! Amazing.

However, delayed flights, jetlag, expired Drivers licenses... all kinds of things conspired against him to toss those plans right out the window.

This won't be the last time we do something like this, so we hope you become just as excited about it as we are! We tackle quite a few topics and struggle our way through some new technology, but overall I think we are very pleased with how the entire thing came together. We hope you agree.

These can be found in the narrative section of Chapter Approved 2018 as well as a slightly expanded version in the rule book for the Urban Conquest campaign set. This episode clocks in at a more reasonable two and a half hours. Which is a nice change for us from the marathon recordings we’ve been doing lately. Justin and Adan are back and we discuss what has been going on lately with about forty minutes of ‘Hobby Progress’. Carl also spends a little time describing The Somnium Stars Campaign which is launching for Legendary Level Patreon members in June! Then we launch into the main topic - Exploring the Cities of Death. We will tell you why this is the best way to play Warhammer 40,000 ever! (Well maybe). We really hope you enjoy the program!

Specifically, player numbers. We're talking about optimal player counts for games, whether games ever mean what they recommend on the box, and how well they scale. Before we count to ten, we talk about Vindication, Royal Palace, Throw Throw Burrito, and Pipeline.  05:40 – Vindication 12:05 – Royal Palace 17:28 – Throw Throw Burrito 21:37 – Pipeline\xa0 29:48 – Optimal Player Counts 31:51 – Eternal: Chronicles of the Throne 32:50 – Caverna: The Cave Farmers 33:13 – Alien Frontiers 34:19 – Dead of Winter 37:13 – Throw Throw Burrito 38:20 – The Resistance 39:17 – Inis 39:45 – Rising Sun 40:09 – Maria 43:48 – Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant | We're running components through our fingers this week, because we're ranking our favourite games that require dexterity. Whether it's flicking, stacking, or balancing, dexterity games tend to offer a respite from brain burning crunchiness, and a chance to exercise actual\xa0muscles.

From carrying all these games. But, more than the games, it's the people you meet that make the memories, so we're recovering from a very long weekend at Gen Con by telling some of our favourite little stories from the floor. Before we revisit our weekend, we talk about Tuki, God of War: The Card Game, and Wits & Wagers Vegas.  01:03 - Tuki 05:41 - God of War: The Card Game 16:34 - Wits & Wagers Vegas 24:08 - Letter Jam 25:09 - Catch the Moon 27:17 - Wooly Whammoth 31:02 - Click Clack Lumberjack 32:14 - Foodies 42:26 - Seasons of Inis 42:48 - City of the Big Shoulders 43:20 - Eternal: Chronicles of the Throne | Our trilogy of Gen Con podcasts concludes with one final foray between the sheets!

You guys know that Jason likes to keep episodes to under an hour in length. However, Tristan Hall from Hall or Nothing Productions is too much fun to talk to, so we decided to keep it all! Tristan stops by for three reasons. First, he is here to preview a project called 1565: St. Elmo\'s Pay. This is the follow up to 1066: Tears to Many Mothers, a historical war-themed card game for 1-2 players. This project launches today, October 4th. Second, at around 15:56 we have a big, fat Top Ten list for you - Top Ten Games for a Low Player Count (1-2 players). This list was originally meant to be Top Ten Card Games for 1-2 players, but Tristan breaks all the rules! So, our individual lists might be a bit lopsided, but that\'s ok - it\'s geeks chatting about a top ten. What\'s not to like? Finally, at a whooping 1:09:38 or so, Tristan and Jason put on the old amateur historian hats and break down the historical background of 1565: St. Elmo\'s Pay. The game is soaked in historical flavor which we are very, very excited to share. If you play this game and wonder where the Barrage of Heads card came from, this is the segment for you! This last past is very different than what you might be used to from ENGN. If you like (or don\'t like) what you hear, please reach out to us and let us know if you want us to do more historical deep dives behind games. One Stop Coop Shop Slack -\xa0bit.ly/onestopslack BGA Patreon -\xa0https://www.patreon.com/bga | The Kickstarter Squad is back! Liz from Beyond Solitaire and Jeremy from Jambalaya Plays Games have returned to being you the latest and greatest of delivered Kickstarter projects. As serendipity would have it, these games were all featured at GenCon 2019 as well (yeah, I know the big show was over a month ago, but... branding!) First up, Jason shares about Everdell: Pearlbrook (8:30), the first expansion to one of the real surprise hits from last year. Two more expansions for Everdell happen to be live on Kickstarter as we speak, so check out of Jason and Liz think they are worth your time. Jeremy then jumps in to chat about another worker placement game, Reavers of Midgard (12:54). This one is the follow up (spiritual successor, maybe?) to the very popular Champions of Midgard from Grey Fox Games. Liz gets the middle spot with the biggest game we review this episode, Pax Pamir (22:31). Jason and Jeremy then follow up with two lighter games that are nevertheless really fun, the real-time cooperative zombie survival game Until Daylight (31:05), and the card dueling game Unmatched (41:11). After all that fun, we get into a brief but spirited discussion about the rising price of games. Not just KS projects, but seemingly all games. We probably didn\'t come to any conclusions, but we had fun venting our spleens a bit.

There\'s set collection, dice rolling, and maybe most importantly for ENGN fans, solo and coop mode. Check it out as Michael talks about the development of Dance Card, not only it\'s mechanisms and thematic integration, but also larger issues of representation as well. Michael is a super, super excited guy, and it was a joy to talk to him. (The aftershow is completely random basketball talk that I felt like keeping in there for... reasons. For those in the Venn diagram of board gaming and basketball fans, enjoy! If not, the aftershow is very skippable!). | Our (belated yet still hopefully valuable) GenCon coverage rolls on, this time with some short games that use dice to make them go. First up, Jason shares about Unbroken (4:46), a resource management game of survival that is optimized for the one player experience. Jason wanted to review the game independently of some of the controversy surrounding it\'s Kickstarter fulfillment, so we get into that right at the beginning. If you want to hear further thoughts about the situation, please stay tuned until the end of the episode. Then, Anthony chats about the newest Matt Leacock dice game, Era: Medieval Age (13:47). This one is a follow up to Roll Through the Ages, one of the grandaddies of the roll n write genre, only this new version has player boards, toy buildings, and a lot more! Jason then jumps back in with (spoiler alert) one of his favorite dice games that he has played in a very long time, Mageling (24:31). Finally, we wrap up with Anthony in all of his roll n write glory, providing quick reviews of a pile of them that he got at GenCon, including Brikks, Second Chance, Deadly Doodles, Dizzle, Patchwork Doodle, On Tour and Cartographers.

And we have even more family weight games for your enjoyment, either with your family or as a solo gamer.  We start with two games that take familiar pieces of culture and make fun games out of them - The Fifty Nine Parks Print Series in the game Parks (6:38), and the Periodic Table of Elements in Periodic: A Game of Elements (12:30). We then turn to two more games that happened to do really well on Kickstarter - a nifty card drafting game called Villagers (19:36), and the next in the very popular Tiny Epic product line, Tiny Epic Mechs (29:31). We end with a dexterity game that has a lot of charm and excitement, Megacity Oceanea (39:19). Well, we really don\'t end there - there\'s more after the outro music, but we well let everyone discover that for themselves!

We are here for you to provide reviews of a TON of games from GenCon 2019. Get buckled in for a series of episodes to cover it all. Helping Jason for Part One of our Wrapup coverage are Colin and Steve from the One Stop Coop Shop podcast and YouTube channel. Before we get into the games, we announced the creation of a new fan group for Every Night is Game Night over at the One Stop Coop Shop Slack channel. We go over how it works in the show. If you are interested in joining a small, engaged part of the ENGN fandom and have direct access to me and my content, please join us! Just click this link: bit.ly/onestopslack We cram 6 games into an hour of fun for this episode. We got:  Roll for Adventure (7:01) Legendary: A James Bond Deckbuilding Game (15:15) Horrified (21:20) Pandemic: Rapid Response (32:53) Arkham Horror: Final Hour (43:22) Quirky Circuits (51:27)  | Jason welcomes Jordan Shoenberger, host of the Second Chance Shelf segment from Board Game Breakfast, to the show for the first time. Before we get swept up in the madness of all the new releases of 2019 (believe me, people, there are MANY episodes of new hotness coming), we slow things down and talk about what we love about finding rare gems and pulling old, beloved games off of the shelf. We then get into some reviews of some older games for lots of different tastes. Jason begins with Citadel of Blood (14:18), a relic of an earlier generation of dice-based dungeon crawling games that nevertheless holds some charm and also some design ideas for a newer generation. Jordan then shares about a hidden favorite among solo gamers, Walnut Grove (20:47). Thanks so much to Jordan for being someone who actually has that game and wanted to talk about it! Next up, Jason talks about Bethel Woods, a simple game with a Mancala-esque mechanism that\'s fairly unique in the cooperative space (29:45). Finally, Jordan takes us home with one of his favorite games to play in all situations, especially with his spouse, Taluva (35:42). | Jason welcomes good friend Gary Pope from the Dice Tower to talk about... uh, talking! Games first, though. Jason shares about World Shapers, a rare drafting game with a solo variant from Board&Dice that attempts to put its own spin and advance upon games like 7 Wonders and Tides of Time. Then, Gary sings the praises of one of his favorite games over the past few years, Heroes of Land, Air, and Sea. For our discussion, Jason and Gary pull from their experiences as a marriage counselor and forum moderator, respectively, to chat about how we help people who disagree talk to one another. Is it possible to strike a balance between keeping forum spaces safe, but also allowing critical conversation? What can we do when people start to take conversations personally? We get into these and many other questions. In Liz We Trust - Burgle Bros 2 - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fowers/burgle-bros-2-the-casino-capers | We have two separate segments for you this week. First, Brandt from the Portal Gaming Podcast joins Jason to chat about SpaceCorp 2025-2300 AD, a card driven space exploration game that plays more like a Euro than what we\'re used to from GMT. Second, Jason and Liz are joined by a listener, Tommy Ray, to chat about how they have recently gotten into wargaming. There\'s a lot of barriers to overcome - where to start, how to get used to the massive time investment, becoming a part of that community, etc. We break it all down, including some game talk about favorites like GMT\'s Falling Sky and DVG\'s Thunderbolt Apache Leader. We hope this helps you open up another avenue of gaming in your life. In Liz we Trust - Cosmic Run: Express - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/337407318/cosmic-run-express-promo-packs?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=cosmic%20run | We made it to Episode 150! To mark the occasion, Jason is going to try a whole new style of reviewing games, which will hopefully stick moving forward. Jason is very interested in the psychological experience of a board game, whether its the thematic, imaginative immersion it generates or the strategic, logical challenge it presents. That distinction folds nicely in with the concept in pop psychology of the "right brain" (creative, "big picture\') and "left brain" (analytical, detail-oriented). So, when Jason reviews games moving forward, the critical questions will be about game experience from these two perspectives. Unless, of course, you all think this is a terrible idea. If so, please let me know! The first game for review is Waters of Nereus (19:17), a simple economic, convert-stuff-into-more-stuff-into-points game with a touch of exploration and spatial movement to complement. Next up is Crisis at Steamfall (26:51), a tactical game with a significant Euro feel, especially in the way you build the actions and resources of your heroes over the course of three rounds. Finally, we get into the action cop movie, heavily thematic experience that is Brook City (36:26), fresh from the Sadler Brothers and Blacklist Games.

Host Antony Johnston     with Jason Snell, Quinn Rose, Liz Myles and Jean MacDonald. | Spooky Manor - You stop your bicycle by a forbidding wrought-iron gate. A cobblestone path winds its way to the north. To the east and west stretches a dark and lonely road. It is raining.

Host Erika Ensign      with Brian Hamilton, Annette Wierstra, Monty Ashley, Steven Schapansky and Kayti Burt. | Federation Feud II - Our audience: the final frontier.

Also a bunch of regular Trivial Pursuit sets, including Doctor Who and Star Wars, but it really did seem like Chex showed up a lot. Host Erika Ensign      with Monty Ashley, Moisés Chiullan, Shannon Sudderth, Jean MacDonald and Kathy Campbell. | UK Trivia VI - What’s a motorway? What’s an FA Cup? When is a mall not a mall? And why do British Trivial Pursuit question-setters have their mind set on topless women? Antony Johnston once again flings nonsense at a panel of confused North Americans for your education and amusement.

This time around, our teams test their knowledge of fictional characters’ epitaphs, compound word games, and award-winning books and movies that share a common word. It’s Jean MacDonald, Scott McNulty, and Liz Myles versus James Thomson, Kathy Campbell, and Tony Sindelar.  Host Dan Moren and Lex Friedman       with Jean MacDonald, Scott McNulty, Liz Myles, James Thomson, Kathy Campbell and Tony Sindelar. | We’ve gathered two teams from the corners of the Alpha and Beta quadrants to compete in this game, where we try to guess the stupid answers Star Trek fans gave to our stupid Star Trek questions.

Loehr, Jean MacDonald, Moisés Chiullan and Joe Rosensteel. | TL;DR Episode 1 - It’s time once again to play TL;DR, the game of hasty summaries and reckless connections where two teams battle against the clock, each other, and a sometimes surprising paucity of pop culture knowledge.

Games discussed: Proving Grounds, Onirim, Hostage Negotiator, and Ambush! We don't play games alone that much, but we tried a few out for this episode and were not disappointed. | Some great games coming down the pipe to report about this month. Clank! In! Space! Cyber Station 11 - We love this game and want more always. Fox in the Forest Duet Hako Onna - It's out and we have it in our grasp. Marvel: Crisis Protocol Wingspan in Digital Alien: Covenant expansion for\xa0Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game. -\xa0We love this one too, so this is a great excuse for this one to hit the table again. Fired Up - A game where you are the spectators. Hmm. Maybe they pull it off. Moonrakers Solar Storm Rare Roses and more. | We finally review Star Wars Outer Rim. Is this the Firefly killer? Can the rebels and empire dethrone the browncoats in the Verse? Even though the games are similar and we like both, Outer Rim doesn't blow the ship out of the trenches. Still, it's fantastic.

Nathan loves him some hidden roles, and these four games highlight a great use of the mechanic. Games discussed: Don't Mess with Cthulhu Bang! and Bang! The Dice Game Salem and Sheriff of Nottingham We're not sure if that last one is hidden roles or not, but Dave is special, so we didn't tell him to take his sweet voice and go home. | We talk all things hidden roles. What does Nathan find so appealing about seeking out the traitor or becoming one to turn the tables on the heroes? We discuss:\xa0  Dead of Winter Don’t Mess with Cthulhu Battlestar Galactica Shadows over Camelot One night anything Werewolf Betrayal at House on the Hill Resistance Secret Hitler Spyfall Dark Moon Betrayal Legacy The Thing: infection at Outpost 31 Werewords TimeBomb Evolution Deception: murder in Hong Kong  | So much news coming out of GenCon. Join your GenCan'ter hosts as we discuss all of the hot new game announcements. | The Lord of the Rings - Journeys in Middle-earth is an app-driven exploration game in the world of Middle-earth by Fantasy Flight. This is a spiritual successor to the app-driving plugged into their Imperial Assault and Decent properties, but this game was designed that was from the ground up. If you love Middle-earth, you will enjoy this game. If you don't mind a phone giving you all of the game's details, this will work. Ryan is unconvinced. | Dinosaur Island by\xa0Pandasaurus Games utilizes\xa0Action Points,\xa0Dice Rolling,\xa0Set Collection,\xa0Tile Placement, and\xa0Worker Placement\xa0all to replicate the great documentary Jurrassic Park.

My buddy Greg joins me in my studio to discuss the decks we piloted in a recent Star Wars Destiny marathon gaming session. Greg discusses his latest Aphra build, now featuring Commando Droid and elite General Grievous from the Convergence block. I tried my best to shut down his droids with Maul and Savage Opress, but the deck wasn\'t quite up to the challenge. Would if fare better against the Terror to Behold and a Jawa sidekick?Prior to any of that, however, I ask Greg some hard-hitting Star Wars questions, such as "Ewoks -- Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down?"\xa0\xa0Jank It Up, Fuzzball is on social media!Twitter: @jankitupInstagram: jankitupfuzzballFacebook: Jank It Up, Fuzzball---Podcast theme music: "District Four" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 Licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/', 'chan_desc': "Jank It Up, Fuzzball is a podcast looking at the casual side of Star Wars: Destiny, as told by one player's experiences with the game.

(https://youtu.be/Banh-V3T6b0)They discuss how when going over hands, and especially when playing, it’s important to ask yourself the right questions. Doing so will make all the difference, and Gareth's new coaching program is designed to help you do just that! Tricia also mentioned her upcoming downswing course and they talk about a few ways a downswing can manifest itself – especially through self-sabotage and poor mindset. Then they get into an interesting question sent in by Lou who wanted more information on doing a post-session review like Tricia discussed in her book Peak Poker Performance. (https://amzn.to/2AGzVik)Tricia expounded on this topic by giving a multi-step process that you can follow to maximally review your play, your mindset and construct a list of adjustments and changes you’d like to make going forward. As a bonus, Tricia created a packet of worksheets (https://www.peakpokermindset.com/post-session-review-reflection-worksheets) which you can use to go through the post session review and reflection process.

Then we got into an interesting hand sent in by Zac from a $109 WCOOP freeze-out event. The hand features a blind versus blind spot with 26bbs effective. We break down all the action and talk about decision points on all streets. Then Tricia led a discussion on some common illusions of competence that can impede our ability to learn poker effectively. Learning takes effort and reading one book or watching one video is not going to make you an expert. There is a difference between feeling informed on a topic and really knowing it.

MTT Coach Gareth James and Peak Performance Strategist Dr. Tricia Cardner are back with more answers to listener questions. But first, they start the episode with a spirited discussion of the controversy surrounding social media maven and aspiring poker player Catherine “catrific” Valdes who was removed from a WSOP-C Circuit event. She registered for one event, was seated in another, realized it and stayed in long enough to bust a player and amass a large chip stack. She was unhappy with the way the floor people talked to her according to a now removed YouTube video. Gareth and Tricia dissect her motivations and go over what to do if you should find yourself in a similar spot. Then the discussion turned to the question: What do you do when you no longer enjoy poker? Tricia led the discussion on the psychological construct known as burnout including the signs and symptoms and possible remedies. Gareth shared some of his personal experiences with poker burnout, too. Want us to answer your poker question?

MTT Coach Gareth James and Peak Performance Strategist Dr. Tricia Cardner covered a lot of ground in this episode. From discussing the discomfort that can come from getting outside of your comfort zone through to a discussion on magical thinking, they cover many mindset topics. They also discussed some of the issues at Stars and talked about the responsibility that sponsored pros have (or don’t have as the case may be) to promote the game in ways that are beneficial to the poker community as a whole. Gareth then took over the mic to answer Stuart’s question about a hand he played from the button with 118 left and 98 getting paid. Stuart had 16bbs and was dealt K2s. The small blind was sitting on 11bbs and the BB had 64bbs. We discussed the information that was missing from the question in order to reinforce all of the relevant variables that you need to collect data on if you want to maximize your analyses. Gareth talked us through our options and spent some time breaking down limping as a good option in this spot. He also explained the limits with the poker software and factors we need to consider when evaluating the results.

MTT Coach Gareth James and Peak Performance Strategist Dr. Tricia Cardner open the show by celebrating the fact that Gareth just shipped the $55 Clasico on Party for almost $5k! In addition, he also made the final table of a Monster Series event on Party. He also was a guest on an episode of The Chip Race Podcast where he talked about an interesting hand he played recently. After a bit more catching up, where the two hosts discuss Navy Seal training when it comes to developing an unbeatable mindset, Tricia answered a mindset question surrounding the concept of how our thoughts dictate our feelings. If you want to change how you feel, change how you think. She gave several strategies for doing so. Gareth then took over the mic to answer Adam’s question about a hand he played blind versus blind. We break down each street of the hand and Gareth explains both the GTO solution as well as the more exploitative line. He really stressed that we need to account for population tendencies and not blindly follow the GTO solution that PIO spits out for us.

Jamie wanted to know if his shove was correct or if he should min-raise and fold to a shove so as to ensure he makes it to day 2. Tricia then turned the conversation to dealing with new year’s goals and resolutions and explained the myriad of reasons why most people are not able to achieve them. She gave tips and strategies to deal with this issue and Gareth shared some of the techniques he is using to more effectively meet his goals.

There is a certain psychology behind either having heaps of chips or not very many. In both spots, we may take unwise risks and not play each hand to the best of our ability. Then, they answered a question about how to overcome variance when you play live. Specific tips were given regarding considering field size, rake, the # of events you play in a year, and whether or not the event skips levels. A discussion ensued about the role that study and preparation plays in ROI considerations.

Specifically, we looked at how to understand what is “normal” in poker and how it is hard to tell how well you are playing when you have small sample sizes. The key is to invest in a process and to be process oriented instead of outcome driven. Then we turned our attention to a question regarding playing and traveling on a small bankroll. Gareth gave an excellent description of how to sell action and Tricia discussed setting priorities and making sacrifices on some things so as to afford others. Want us to answer your poker question?
