And while grace doesn’t come naturally to all of us—especially when we lose—it can be cultivated… if you go out of your way to be grateful. Let me tell you a story. It all starts in the ladies room, in a snowy city, five minutes before my curtain call… daniellelaporte.com/withlove | When you feel like you have nothing to offer—TRUST your rhythms. Rest. Regenerate. Do what it takes to be well. Our culture confuses productivity-output-achievement with self-worth. To unhook from that fiction: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | When things are brutally difficult with somebody, sometimes the healthiest thing is to have a non-verbal, encouragement convo. When you can’t safely/bravely express yourself in this realm, then use an esoteric channel—speak to the other person’s Higher Self.  It might be the best conversation you’ve ever had. daniellelaporte.com/withlove | I’ve gotten in the habit of creating a “What I Trust” list before a big gig or opportunity, or when any situation feels wobbly. Often we’re fixated on firing up endorphins (and there are times for that), that we forget that feeling assured and comforted is where the real power is. Calm and centered is magnetic. The “What I Trust” list is for focus and soothing your nervous system. Instead of mustering bravado about things that we hope are true, we root into what we viscerally know we can rely on. So… what do you trust? daniellelaporte.com/withlove | It’s too late in the day, and too hot, crowded, and a little too painful on the planet, to be focused solely on personal attainment. Manifestation is a technology, and like all technologies, I pray that we use it to generate more loving realities for ourselves and for each other. You can still reach for the dream job, the healthy bod’, and the love of your life. You get to want what you want. Always. I’m saying: want all of those things, AND incorporate other people’s wellness in your vision. Pray that when you receive those things, it will make you more generous, more joyous, more healthy… more able to contribute to the collective happiness of everybody around you. This episode is a roundup of the potential mis-steps of popular manifestation techniques, and an invitation for something deeper and unifying. daniellelaporte.com/withlove | The first thing to do with that inner critic voice is to have compassion for it. (This is counterintuitive because we live in a performance-based culture that thrives on judgement.) Approach with love—then instead of creating further separation from your heart, you’re building a bridge. Anytime you bring compassion to a situation you will see it more clearly. Compassion is the light of Love. It’s the true power source. Speak of it often. Here’s some direction: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Our Shadow Self is not an evil-twin personality that we have to master. It’s our neglected inner child—our deep sensitivity. Our greatest opportunity for building strength comes from the work of healing our woundedness. I know this because I lived it: learning to love my most wounded self was my ultimate restoration. Encouragement for your journey: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Making new friends in your 30s, 40s, and onwards — it’s never, EVER too late. Your longing for sisterhood is both primal and divine. Friendship is the medicine. It's the elixir that we need right now, more than ever. Your desire is so HEALTHY. Friendships are my primary religion\xa0so here’s what I suggest… daniellelaporte.com/withlove | We can all understand the importance of starting our day in an intentional way. But before we jump into new habits, we need to look into our psyche and examine what’s really up when we wake up. Each of us has a pre-existing relationship with “mornings”. And it matters. Menus of morning habits are easy to come by (harder to practice). But habits are only bandaids unless we get beneath the surface of our behavior and relating. That’s what most productivity methods fail to ask. What were mornings like for you growing up? What does your ideal morning *feel* like? Welcome to Morning Therapy (but, like, not therapy) with Danielle! I struggled with mornings for a long time. There was a kind of resistance to starting the day, even when there was the presence of joy. I decided to take a deeper, psychological look—and it shifted everything for me. With a little help from my psychotherapist, essentially I created my own therapeutic approach to mornings.\xa0 Morning mindfulness is how you activate your superpowers. Your steadiness and strength. And your connection to the sacred—everything we need on the graceful and the challenging days. So, how do we power up our pre-day? First, we go deeper. \xa0 daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Are you attracting jerks because you’re a jerk? Maybe. Maybe not. Sometimes the jerk is there to show you how you do NOT want to feel or be treated—because contrast is one of our most powerful teachers. The flipside: what they may be here to illuminate is how you DO want to feel and who you truly are. I am a 100% yes to the theory that we attract certain people into our lives to teach us certain things. And—everyone is not your complete reflection. Here’s what I mean… daniellelaporte.com/withlove", 'chan_desc': 'A one woman show about self-realization from Danielle LaPorte, a member of Oprah’s Super Soul 100 and creator of The Desire Map. How do you create a spirituality that’s more rock n’ roll than oppressive, turn your anxiety into power, and live more deeply but lighten up? Danielle keeps it practical while riffing on the divine—from compassion and self-help fatigue, to sex, joy, and serving the world. She is, as Eve Ensler describes, “a force field of energy, wonder, humor, and love”, and her authenticity will have you feeling a little less crazy, full of possibility, and clearly part of the solution.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/bf/8a/e9/bf8ae9a6-bf8a-8ef9-4e8c-49060f65a51c/mza_7309140458972876657.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-14'}}

On this week\'s episode, we are talking about the psychology of accountability, the difference between internal and external accountability, the types of accountability structures that they have put in place in our own lives, and some high-level tips for holding yourself more accountable.\xa0 | One of Mika\'s favorite topics to talk about on this show is organizing. Mika worked as a professional home organizer for several years, and many of our listeners write into us asking for tips and hacks to help them organize their own lives. On today\'s podcast, Mika is going in-depth about one of her favorite techniques that she uses to keep her time, tasks, and thoughts organized. The best part is that this strategy only requires one simple item that most of us already have in our home: Post-It Notes. | Russ and Mika love taking personality tests.

This episode is all about how to become mindful about the role that email plays in our lives and how you can simplify the process of using email in your own life. | On this week\'s podcast, Russ and Mika talked all about how to make some wise financial decisions in your life. That doesn\'t mean that every financial decision they have made was wise, though.\xa0 In particular, Russ loves to purchase some outlandish things. This week, we are sharing a short bonus episode where they detail ten of his most ridiculous purchases.\xa0 \xa0 | Russ and Mika have received many requests over the past several months from listeners who want to hear a conversation about finances. This is a topic that people don\'t always like to talk about. Financial conversations can be incredibly uncomfortable. On this week\'s podcast, they are diving headfirst into some of those uncomfortable conversations. You\'ll hear about ways that you can save, budget, and approach your finances with a whole new perspective. | In this bonus episode, Russ breaks down sobriety. For him, alcohol was his addiction, but sobriety could mean breaking patterns around drugs, problem habits or more. He says in order for sobriety to work, you have to change for yourself; not your kids, your wife, your job, etc. Russ will talk about some practical tips on how to start and sustain sobriety and how important building a supportive community is. -- There are a variety of support and community groups dealing with addiction, beyond just Alcoholics Anonymous. For Russ, Celebrate Recovery was the best option.

Maddix was born when Russ was in college, and it was one of the most unexpected moments of his life. It has also been undoubtedly one of the biggest blessings. And yet so many times, when these unexpected moments happen to us, feelings of anxiety or negativity typically follow.

To help make this easier, I’ve created a free resource for you that will give you a REAL FRAMEWORK to uncover your calling, your purpose - and it\'s something you can actually work through fairly quickly. Here’s what you’ll discover in this new series:  How you can instantly feel relieved about what you put on earth to do (WHEN I LEARNED THIS, IT CHANGED EVERYTHING!) Purpose is not something we find or do but something we are… which free us up to CHOOSE how we want to use our time and gifts and resources. (THIS ONE HELPS ME so much when there are decisions that all could work!) Why worrying and being confused about purpose is a THE THING that often keeps us from moving forward and taking action. (AFTER UNDERSTANDING THIS SHIFT, I WAS ABLE TO start taking massive action towards my dreams) The obstacles that come up as I move into my calling SHOW ME THE WAY. They aren\'t a reason to give up, they are THE PATH that leads us to more meaning and peace (THIS ONE is a game changer!)  Click here\xa0 to get the field guide!

I’m honored to be collaborating with them on our podcasts—and beyond. In this episode, Susan and I dig into mediation and divorce. While we’ve said it before, it’s worth mentioning again: divorce is a time when you are making emotional, financial, family, parenting and other important decisions for your future. You should not be making them in a turmoil of negative emotion, which litigation often brings. With their online mediation platform, Susan and Rebecca bring mindfulness components to the mediation process so that you can think responsibly when making these tough life-impacting decisions. We also discuss the difference between litigation and mediation, what to do if your partner isn’t on board with mediation, and more. While mediation isn’t the only way to do divorce, it can definitely be a better way.\xa0 Show Highlights  Susan’s experience being a litigator, litigation as the institutional conflict cycle and and why she made the switch to mediation practice (4:11) How mediation differs from litigation and understanding that both parties need to agree to the mediation process (10:49) Why most people avoid mediation and the benefits of virtual mediation (13:00) The importance of going through a cooling off period before deciding between mediation or litigation, plus combining a mindfulness practice with the practice of mediation\xa0 (19:00) What to do if you really want to mediate, but your partner won’t agree to it, and how understanding the benefits of mediation may help motivate them (28:30) Walking through the “I want a divorce,” conversation and allowing the other party time to process everything before moving forward (36:00) The mindfulness component of Susan and Rebecca’s Breaking Free Mediation platform (40:29) Susan’s legal coaching practice, what it is and how she helps clients (43:24)   Learn More Susan: Susan Guthrie, honored as one of the top family law and mediation attorneys in the country, has been helping families to navigate the process of divorce for 30 years.\xa0 She is the current Chair of the American Bar Association\'s Mediation Committee and founded, along with her business partner and fellow top attorney, Rebecca Zung, Breaking Free Mediation which provides mediation services across the country through an online platform.\xa0 They are the first mediation service to offer a mindfulness track for their clients to help them to manage the difficult emotions of divorce.

I first met Rebecca, in-person, when recording an  interview for Laura Wasser’s podcast, Divorce Sucks. It’s always such a welcomed opportunity whenever I get to meet guests I have on this podcast, in real life.\xa0 Ah, divorce negotiations. They can truly suck. How can you get through negotiations with your emotions in check? And also let go of overwhelming thoughts like, “They always get what they want,” or “I’ll never be able to ‘fight’ them for the house (or car or fill in the blank).”\xa0 Today, Rebecca walks us through some of the strategies she uses with her own clients to help them successfully negotiate divorce, like negotiating with a narcissist, creating leverage, and using empowering body language. When you can successfully negotiate divorce, you set yourself up for what you want in your divorce, for your children and for your life thereafter. It’s time to stop thinking you have no power at the negotiation table. You, and you alone, define your value. It all starts with you.\xa0 Show Highlights  What to do when you feel your spouse and his lawyers are more powerful (7:01) Negotiating divorce starts with you, from the inside out (8:13) The divorce paradox: during the most traumatic part of your life, you have to make the toughest decisions (13:00) Dealing with the vulnerability of negotiations whereby you put a ‘value’ on how much you mattered to your spouse based on what you ‘get’ or don’t (15:00) Narcissistic personalities and how to navigate negotiations with them (17:00) Noone ever wins from being spiteful or pushing the buttons of your ex during the divorce process (19:00) Creating leverage in order to aid in you getting what you want (21:00) Passive and disempowering words and phrases, what they are and why you should not use them (24:00) Body language: powerful body language you can use and how to read body language to see if someone might be lying (25:00) Embedded commands, what they are and how you can use them in negotiations (27:48) Preparing for the negotiation process using Rebecca’s acronym M.A.T.T.E.R. (32:00) The different ways men and women keep their emotions in check (34:00)  Learn More Rebecca Zung: Rebecca Zung is one of the Top 1% of divorce attorneys in the nation, having been recognized by U.S. News & World Report as a “Best Lawyer in America”, as “Legal Elite” by Trend Magazine, and recognized by her peers and the judiciary as AV©, preeminent rated in family law, the highest possible rating for an attorney by Martindale Hubbell.\xa0 She is the author of the bestselling book Breaking Free: A Step-by-Step Divorce Guide for Achieving Emotional, Physical, and Spiritual Freedom, and is a sought after major media contributor.

You are making decisions about property, money, and time. It’s not a referendum on the emotional state—who did what, who’s right or who’s wrong. “If that\'s what you\'re litigating, you’re setting yourself for financial and legal disaster,” this week’s guest, Kimberly Nelson, says.

It’s a super important conversation to have and I am happy to have Kimberly Nelson, an expert in this area, join me to talk about all things money related. Kimberly has sat next to countless divorcing spouses facing significant financial challenges during an overwhelmingly emotional time. Emotional turmoil tends to cloud decision-making. Our hope is that this episode will provide a roadmap for detangling conjoined financial affairs and allow you to move forward with divorce with peace and empowerment rather than fear.\xa0 Show Highlights  What the financial goal for divorce should be (8:29) Keeping track of your expenses, what and how (including daily living expenses, health insurance and more) (10:40) Stash cash: what is it and how to make sure you have access to cash that’s available to you, when needed (13:16) The importance of letting the dust settle before making these financial decisions (21:08) Focus on divisions as transactions that you\'re trying to negotiate instead of marital rights and wrongs that you\'re trying to litigate (22:04) Why it’s really hard to be a grownup about money (25:46) Inventorying and splitting up assets and debt, why it’s important (28:11) What you need to know about personal credit, especially if it’s wrapped up with your spouse and marriage (38:55) House negotiations, If you need to let go of the house, realize wherever you go, you are home to your children (42:09)  Learn More Kimberly Nelson: Kimberly has been working with high net worth divorcees in the LA area for more than 15 years.

But for the committee, that’s who I was for more than a decade so that’s who it knows me to be. So we get stuck in this thought process that that’s who we really are in our core- that person that lied and manipulated people, who was hiding things from the people you love, who was destructive and maybe a bit mean and damaged relationships because you just weren’t in your right mind.And with all of those negative and hurtful behaviors, comes some guilt and shame for our actions. You feel embarrassed and want to hide, you have things that you never want anyone to find out because you don’t want them to know how “bad” you really are. You’re a liar and a cheater and a bad person. And that’s the information the committee has to work with.And with all of that horrible information, and your guilt and shame, and trying to kill yourself slowly with alcohol, there is no way to have a healthy self-esteem or to feel good about yourself or to be confident or proud of yourself. And again, that’s the information the committee has to work with.But here’s the catch- you, and the committee, have totally forgotten you were a whole human being functioning in life long before you ever had a drink or used a drug. I didn’t start drinking really until I was about 20- 19 or 20. So I had 20 years of being a whole person before I was hijacked by alcohol.You were hijacked. And so was the committee. I want you to remember the person you were before you ever had a drink- what was that person like? I was a super kind, funny, loving, nurturing person. I was honest and had a ton of integrity, I was a loyal friend and daughter and sister- I was a lot of great things! And so were you!And here is the absolute truth- when I was drunk, I did not make good choices. I was broken. If I wasn’t broken, I wouldn’t have been drunk all the damn time! But I would NEVER make those choices in my right mind. NEVER. No matter how broken I was, I would have never lied the way I did, I would have never manipulated and used people the way I did, and I wouldn’t have hated myself the way I did if I wasn’t drunk. It’s alcohol that is all of those shitty things- not me.Recovery ToolboxFacebook GroupCoaching with AngelaRecovery Recipe | So today I am going to talk about some of the biggest mistakes I see people make in early sobriety or recovery. I say in early recovery, but the truth is, these stumbling blocks can pop up at any time in our lives and at any stage of sobriety so it’s good to be aware and know how to work around them. And we will get to that in a few minutes.But first, my big announcement!! I’ve been telling you that I was working on a new website, full of tools and resources to support recovery- at any stage. And I am so excited to tell you the website is READY!!This is officially my first announcement and I can’t wait for you to go check it out and to take advantage of all the good information there-\xa0 there are courses, a couple of different products over there, many are free and, of course, all of the options to work with me as your coach are all available there.I want to give you a quick rundown of what you will find there- and I set all of this up to support you and give you ongoing guidance and tools to build your own toolbox full of tools to help you. The website is www.myrecoverytoolbox.com.Now- on to our topic today! We’re going to talk about some of the major mistakes I see people make in their early sobriety. This is my observation over the course of the last decade+ working with addiction, being an addict, AND being a Life Coach and studying behavior and change and habit.And many of the things you will hear me talk about today aren’t necessarily specific to recovery or getting sober, but more about making big changes in your life or yourself as a person. Most of the tools I talk about are centered around the art of change and breaking habits and understanding how all of that works. It just so happens that getting sober or quitting drinking is a HUGE change- and it requires action and intention, and being purposeful about the moves you make so you can get the results you want.It’s like GPS for your life. You wouldn’t get in your car for a cross-country road trip and not use a map or GPS, right? Because who knows what would happen or where you would end up. So it doesn’t make sense to try to navigate a ginourmous shift in your life without guidance and an understanding of your destination.New site:\xa0 www.myrecoverytoolbox.comGet Coaching with Angela HERE!Get your Recovery Recipe HERE!Join the Facebook group HERE! | "Feelings of unworthiness, fear of being seen & heard, needing to be perfect, trauma, deep wounds, unresolved emotional pain & grief block our connection with ourselves and others.

First of all, if your goal is to win an argument, you are already on the wrong path.To make amends or offer an apology for behavior, words, or poor choices is actually a way to validate someone else\'s feelings and show respect. It also requires some emotional maturity and an ability to put yourself and what you want to the side for a minute, to offer respect and love to someone else first.It takes enormous strength and integrity to recognize your part in a situation then take the time to offer an amends for it. In this episode I\'ll give you some good one liners to make those conversations a bit easier and give you courage to take responsibility for yourself and your actions.Oh yeah, there\'s a little rant in here about Southwest Airlines and the crazy situation I just experienced- I\'m shocked by the poor customer service of an airline I have been so faithful to.As usual, here are the links to find more about working with me as your coach, getting your free copy of my recovery recipe, and joining our phenomenal Facebook group!Work with me HERE!Get your FREE copy of my Recovery Recipe HERE!Join the FB group HERE!Instagram:\xa0 @addictionunlimited | Understand your personality type.

You get some sober time under your belt and start feeling pretty good, then all of a sudden you find yourself drunk again, hating life, wondering how the heck this happened. Self-sabotage is a phrase we hear often, especially as addicts.In this episode, we\'ll talk about the 3 stages of belief with clear examples of what they look like, how to recognize them, and show you how to transition from not believing you can ever live successfully sober and happy, to believing anything is possible for you.This may not sound like it\'s part of the getting sober process, but your beliefs shape your reality. If you don\'t truly believe you are capable of living a life without alcohol, then how far will you really make it? If you quit drinking, but are overwhelmed with doubt about staying sober, how long will you stay sober?These 3 stages of belief are important to recognize in everything we do. Getting honest about where you are is the only thing that will allow you to move forward and accomplish more. Whether that\'s longer sobriety, less anxiety in sobriety, better relationships, or making more money at your job.

You fueled me to keep making more—and so I did! NEW podcast. “With Love, Danielle.” For you.

Tune in for Sunday sermons and Thursday’s Q&A—send your Qs to me (anything goes!) and please subscribe at daniellelaporte.com/withlove. | Friends,  First: gratitude. Thank you for hanging out and listening to LIGHT WORK. The response continues to be... surprisingly amazing. I’m going to make so much more for you — and that’s the first announcement: New podcast!! For you. All the love. This summer.  In the meantime, there’s this for you... announcement #2: I’ve got a new conversation out that I had with one of my dearest friends, Jeff Krasno (co-founder of Wanderlust and Commune).  This is the first time I\'ve publicly spoken about the "living death" I experienced in the Fall of 2018. I went to the darkest place of my being — panic attacks, identity crisis, loss, disillusionment and… incredible awe. GRACE. I\'m still mining it, and will be sharing the gold for years to come.  It’s one of the most psychologically intimate conversations I\'ve recorded. My hope is to shed light on the pain that we all experience to varying degrees, so that we can heal together. Togetherness is powerful medicine.  Please have a listen: https://apple.co/2WPrwCG | Friends, this is the last episode of the podcast. And, of course, it’s devoted to one of my favourites: Devotion. We’re shining light on our prayers, our beliefs, our teachers… and whether they’re actually getting us closer to what we really want—liberation. We’re talking about the real work of light work. \xa0 There are some doozer questions to chew on in this ep: \xa0  Do your beliefs liberate you? Because if we don’t feel free… what’s the point? What are the “devotion flags” that you fly without shame? What can we do to un-believe the things that tie us down? How important is it to know about our past lives? How do we tell posers from true spiritual teachers? And how can you feel gratitude (instead of beating yourself up) if you’ve ever fallen for a charlatan? #beenthere  | Revolutionaries, \xa0 This episode is about our personal activism. I’m talking about how we can get justice, without incurring too much karma. About how to fight corruption without the anger burning us out. About the importance of being inclusive—to even the bad guys. I’m talking about how to be a revolutionary for just love. \xa0 Here’s the trip: \xa0  Where do we even start? (When the world is so messed up, and we’re feeling messed up because of it.) Why we have to resist going numb. Numbness leads to disconnection. Hopelessness is as common as violence. Think about that for a minute. The difference between anger and rage, and why we shouldn’t dismiss or repress the latter. My perspective on evil, and the value of having compassion for EVERYONE, like, on a Soul level––but still working for justice.  \xa0 Tune in here: DANIELLELAPORTE.COM/PODCAST | If God is in the details, then the Soul is in a good Q&A. And that’s the substance of Podcast #4: Beliefs, Movies & Man Crushes. \xa0 Your questions make it so easy for me to rant and offer some (hopefully) useful how-to’s and tricks of the trade. The “trade” being discernment and devotion. It’s deep, it’s lite, I hope it’s all right: \xa0  Have I ever Feng Shui’ed my house? The short answer: yes. The cliffhanger: no, not anymore. What brings back my energy when I’m in my darkest hour? (I take my own medicine.) Who are my celebrity crushes? Favourite movies? Favourite tea? In between swooning, I manage to break down some romance wisdom. Why don’t I talk about my parents? I do now. What\'s my take on the narcissistic vs. empath dynamic? Oh darling… When did I know I “arrived”? (Still getting there.)  | I\'ve talked to rabbis, priests, monks, and people who I consider to be high esoteric practitioners. I’ve figured out a few things about joy… and woven them into this week’s episode. Listen in for:  Should you leave your soul-dulling job and follow your joy to France? (Maybe.) I’ve got some ideas on HOW to buck fear and obligation. The difference between happiness and joy, and a story from my divorce about the first time that I really understood the truth about joy. Are you addicted to longing? Waking up to the corruption and addiction in our own psyches, community, and society. Starting to make more holistic choices. Moving towards joy: Two questions to help you remove the debris, and create more space for light to move in. The 3 kinds of “happy lives”, Sensitive New Age Guys, Flow Boys… And finally: Living in joy without feeling like you’re betraying your (or anyone else’s) pain. Shedding the achievement, possessing, having, striving ways to be “happy” and focusing on one way to be joyful—to serve.  | No tip-toeing in this episode: I deep dive into the unfathomable, beautiful lessons we may learn from pain… without falling for the New Age speak that would have us gloss over real suffering. \xa0 Also in this EP:  The 3 types of suffering (knowing what you’re experiencing is key to liberation)  Everyday suffering—the slog, the general malaise, the greyness. Interconnected suffering—the feeling a lot of us have because of the agony in the world. Brutal tragedy-type suffering—seemingly insurmountable circumstances, violations, and losses.   How some New Age perspectives on suffering utterly fail us, invalidate us and keep us from liberation. My damn the man retelling of the Princess and the Pea story that illustrates how to keep moving forward, when the day-to-day takes it out of you.

Here’s some of the top 3s from the past 99 episodes followed by a look at the next episode in the Changeability Podcast story.\xa0 Audience top 3 episodes The 3 favourite episodes of our audience to date. These are the shows with the highest number of downloads so far. The longer the episode’s been on iTunes or our BrilliantLivingHQ.com website or Stitcher or TuneIn the longer people have had to listen to it, so we would expect the older shows to have more downloads than newer ones and that’s reflected in these results. Third most popular episode - ‘What is Mind Management’ Episode 6 In episode 6 of the Changeability Podcast we were thinking about our strap line phrase – ‘Mind Management’. What is mind management and what’s in it for you? In episode 6 you found out about:  Kathryn and Julian’s acting skills (you’ve been warned) How many thoughts you have in a day Why sports people love mind management How thoughts have energy How you are not thoughts How mind management needs training Mind management can improve your personal and professional life  Second most popular episode - ‘The Brilliant You’ Episode 2 Do you know how truly amazing you are?\xa0 Well that’s what episode 2 is all about. You might not always feel like a magnificent being, but by the end of this second episode you be agreeing with us that you’re pretty smart. Because in this show we talk about just how brilliant you and your marvellous mind and what it means.\xa0 \xa0  What you’re doing as you listen to the episode (really?) How you’re like an iceberg and why that’s a good thing. How many things we can focus on at a time What Julian learnt from a Memory World Champion (or rather - didn’t learn!) The role of the conscious and unconscious brain and how they manage our minds.\xa0  Understanding a few basics about how your mind works, will help you understand what’s getting in the way of doing what you want and what to do about it. Most popular episode - ‘Changeability – The Start’ Episode 1 The first episode saw us introducing ourselves and the Changeability show.\xa0 The Changeability podcast is for you if you’re interested in changing or improving something in your life or business, big or small. It’s for people like us who’re interested in finding ways to make our lives the best they can be – so we can be more successful (whatever that means to you), happy and fulfilled. Through discussion and interviews we look at practical mind management and change techniques, tactics & tools - taken from the worlds of personal development, psychology, neuroscience, business, sport, entertainment and spirituality – to empower and inspire a happier, successful life or business. In the first episode you find out:  What is Changeability? And why should you care about it? Why is change hard? How we can self-sabotage our best intentions Why it’s not your fault - and why it’s good. Our story and what we’ve learnt  Top 3 countries We love you being here wherever you’re from – so this isn’t our favourite countries – but rather the top 3 countries with the highest number of listeners out of the 167 countries we currently have listeners in.  Third – UAE 6% Second – USA 19% First – UK 48%  (And just in cast you’re interested the fourth is Australia with India in fifth place.) Kathryn and Julian’s favourites This was so hard to choose, especially as we decided not to include any interviews in our top 3s (maybe they’re deserving of a separate post) – but here’s three each with a couple of extras thrown in for good measure. Kathryn’s favourites  Episode 3 – The Library in your brain Episode 19 - Why use affirmations to manage your mind? Episode 31 – 5 mind management techniques for changing your life.  Julian’s favourites\xa0  Episode 43 – What is mindfulness and why you need it? Episode 46 - 21 simple tips for mindfulness meditation. Episode 56 What is happiness and the neuroscience behind it  Couple of extras  Episode 85 How to recognise toxic people and relationships Episode 89 What does success mean to you  3 of our favourite reviews on iTunes Very hard to pick 3 out of the 78 we have \xa0so far across the different iTunes countries as we obviously love them all.\xa0 So we can’t really call these our favourites but they are reviews we’ve especially like. Excellent -\xa0iimmmii\xa0from United Kingdom One of the best ‘change your life’ resources I’ve come across. If you like to understand the theory and evidence (be it scientific or anecdotal) behind advice on how to change your life, this material is presented in an engaging way in this podcast. Of course they also make recommendations for how best to go about taking action. A few episodes in and you will feel like you’ve made two new friends who are supporting you on your journey of change. Well done Kathryn and Julian, listening to you makes me proud to be from the same Sceptred Isle! A Homely Serving Up of Sound Advice/Wisdom -\xa0Ola-B.\xa0from United Kingdom Where has this amazing couple been all my life?! :) Love Kathryn, love Julian, and let's not forget Dude!!! Love this podcast - the topics, the delivery of it all...it's simply unique, uplifting and inspiring! Thank you guys! Kathryn and Julian's chemistry rocks! -\xa0\xa0 LornaLi from United States  I love the concept of this show! It's so unique and refreshing! I absolutely LOVE the hosts' chemistry - their exchanges are such a joy to listen to. Thank you for all the useful tips you provide to your listeners on how to plan and achieve their goals, I'm sure many are reaping so many benefits from this show! \xa0 Thank you to you for taking the effort and making our day. By the way – we’d love more reviews. We don’t always ask for them in every episode as it gets tedious for you to listen to – and we want to provide you with a good listening experience. However, reviews are important to us not only because it’s great to find out what you think but it means iTunes makes our show more visible to people looking for podcasts.\xa0 You know yourself the power of reviews on sites like Tripadvisor and Amazon – so if you feel like helping us out that’s one way to do it.\xa0 Dude’s top 3 Who’s been with us all through every single episode and every phase of the podcasting process – in fact he’s always with us – Dude the Dog, our faithful hound and black labradoodle. We’ve joked we have a contractual obligation to mention him in every show – not that we’ve quite done that but he’s had more than his fair share of mentions and even made it onto the show on a few occasions. So here’s Dude’s top 3 favourite Changeability Podcast moments as chosen by him (woof).  Episode 83 ‘Self-love Rituals’ – The 10th of our self-love rituals is to have Pet Time. Walk, cuddle, play with or groom your dog or cat or talk to your budgerigar. You might not get this if you don’t have a pet – but if you do have one you’ll know what we mean! Episode 63 ‘How to start and finish anything with Tom Boother’ – Dude features in a cameo role when Tom starts talking about Dude and how they met! Episode 98 ‘What are habits and why we need them’ – Dude gets his own moment in the spotlight. You’ll have to listen to this episode to know what we mean, or just listen to episode 100 to hear the extract.  Our top 3 bloomers You wont know what we’re talking about here if you’ve never listened right to the end of our shows – but listen to episode 100 to hear 3 of them for your entertainment – and why they’re called Kathryn’s bloomers! 3 lessons we’ve learned\xa0 from creating 100 episodes of the Changeability Podcast Here’s just 3 of the many things we’ve learned from creating 100 episodes of this podcast over the past two years, and they’re all relevant to you.  You can’t always measure your impact  Sometimes it’s hard to measure your impact – this goes for measuring the success of a podcast or many things.\xa0 How do you measure your success or the impact you have? On the whole people don’t tell you and it’s not always possible to make a connection e.g. between who’s listened to the podcast and who’s visited the website or bought an Affirmation or audio mind management tool or a course like our ‘Beginner’s guide to mindfulness meditation’.\xa0 That’s not to say there aren’t any clues. Ways of gauging if we’re having a positive impact include comments in our FB group or page and reviews on Stitcher or iTunes. Plus nomination for national / international podcast awards – being a finalist for the New Media Europe Audience Appreciation Award and winner of the UK Podcaster’s Best Self Help Podcast Award.\xa0 But the truth of it is that for the thousands of our podcast listeners each month, for the most part it’s hard know the difference, if any, it makes to them.\xa0 Does that matter? Yes and no.\xa0 Yes because from a resource and business perspective it’s helpful to have a handle on the impact but also no because sometimes it’s not just possible to know but that doesn’t make it any less valuable. This is an important lesson for us all because you don’t always know the impact of what you do in your work, relationships and everyday life – but that in itself doesn’t mean you should stop what you do.  Stickability and focus  Creating 100 episodes of a podcast, especially one like this, is an achievement. This is an important lesson for us and maybe also you as well.\xa0 When we do something consistently and with focus it creates results.\xa0 We may not know the full impact of those results but there are some clear results for us.  100 episodes of a podcast are out there in the world being listened to in 167 countries. 100 blog posts which are the show notes on this website. Winners of a national podcast award and finalists for another.  All of which is the result of focus and stickability – week by week.\xa0 And now we have this body of work that is out there in the world whatever happens in the future – no-one can take that away from us. This goes for you as well – what is it you want to achieve? A new skill, producing something, writing a book, starting your own podcast, setting up a business.\xa0 Whatever it is clarity, consistency, stickability and focus is the key.  Review evaluate and change  The third lesson for us has been learning the importance of reviewing and evaluating what you’re doing.\xa0 We’ve been doing just that with our podcast as 100 seems a good point to do so. We’ve been looking back on the experience of the past two years, learning from it and making changes.\xa0 This is something we advocate for you too. It’s about being deliberate about what you do rather than just carrying on doing the same thing because that’s what you do or what people expect of you.\xa0 It might be a matter of fine-tuning and pivot or of big changes. For us it’s meant reviewing our experience, going right back to why we started Brilliant Living HQ in the first place. In fact going back further than that to why we wanted to make the big change in leaving our previous careers.\xa0 Sometimes it’s good to remind yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing.\xa0 One of the things we always said was that we wanted more control over our time and to spend time doing what we want to do, and more time for ourselves. We know that time is a resource, even our most precious resource. So to put these two things together we’ve been looking at how we spend our time and efforts, in effect the resources we put into the podcast – that’s the review bit. Next came the evaluation. Is the balance right? This is a challenging one for us because we love doing the podcast, which means it’s always high on our list of priorities, together with the schedule we set ourselves and the way we create our show. Review, evaluate and make changes in the light of your experience to make sure you’re always taking control of your own path. That’s what we’ve done – and to see what changing we come to the future. The future The result of our thinking about what we’ve done and what we want to do is that we love the podcast and you the listeners, so we’re going to continue with it but take a break over the summer for a few weeks. We’re taking this short break for an exciting reason, because when we return at the beginning of September we’ll have the Changeability Success Club. We’re taking the next few weeks to get this exciting club ready for you.\xa0 We’re ordering the carpets and curtains, mowing the lawn, changing the beds, only joking, it’s an online club to take the things we talk about on the Changeability podcast and make them a reality in your life.\xa0 With everything you could want and need to help you make changes in your life alongside a great community of people like you to support each other.\xa0\xa0 More on that very soon, but for now we wanted to let you know it’s coming.\xa0 We’re putting a lot of love and time into creating what we believe will be the best online club for you to become a member of.\xa0 We’ve been working on it behind the scenes for a while now and now we want to put a special effort into the final push to get it ready for opening the doors. \xa0We’ve been making videos and templates and downloadable tools including special audio tools to help you not only get clear about what you want but also give you the tools and support to make it happen – all within our special membership club for those of you who join us. So we’re taking the next few weeks to get it ready for you and when we come back it will be here.\xa0 We’ll have one hundred places ready – it’s going to be really special and we can’t wait to share it with you.

They are strengthened by an increase in the number of repeated acts. Habits are also weakened or broken, and contrary habits are formed by the repetition of contrary acts.”\xa0―\xa0Mortimer J. Adler  Habits are an intrinsic part of who we are and how we function.\xa0 Habits are fundamental to how we think and behave, which makes them key to how we live our lives and make our decisions. The achievement of our goals and success are more the product of our daily habits than any one off transformative situation or action on our part. Habits are a key part of mind management because;  your mind use habits like a shortcut or brain power saving device or mechanism if you manage your mind in a helpful way you can utilise the power of habits. Rather than viewing habits in a negative light as something we need to control and overcome, they become an empowering tool to enhance our lives, help us make changes and be happier.  To do this we need to know which habits are good for us and to continue and critically which habits are not supporting our goals. The first step therefore is to identify a habit you want to change for a helpful, empowering, positive, healthy or wealthy habit, or a new habit you want to cultivate.\xa0 This an important step as the funny thing about habits (like limiting thoughts) is we’re not always aware of them. We have to take a deliberate step back to identify the habit or to acknowledge that thing we keep doing but would really love to change is indeed a habit – an habitual way of behaving in response to a situation or action. Willpower Now you know the habit you want to change, is it a matter of using your willpower to change it and your motivation to keep going? Yes and no. \xa0Yes because when it comes to habits willpower and motivation both have an important role to play but they’re not enough on there own as there are limitations to be aware of. Willpower is the power to exercise your will.\xa0 To have control over what you do and self-discipline. But the thing about will power is you only have so much of it and when it runs out – because we’re tired or hungry or sad – it’s hard to rely on.\xa0 This is why you can wake up with good intentions and lots of willpower but by the evening it’s decidedly harder to exercise your will. Although you can get better at exercising willpower the more we do it, your brain likes your habits so wants you to keep them. So although willpower has a role to play in changing your habits, it can’t be relied on to do it alone.\xa0 The same goes for your motivation. Motivation Your motivation is the purpose or the ‘why’ behind what you do – in this case behind the new habit you want. I think of motivation as having different levels or layers and each level or layer has a different strength. Think of it as concentric circles –circles within circles like an onion. The outer layer is your big ‘why’ or the purpose that motivates you. Say you want to develop some health and fitness habits– the big outer layer motivation is to be healthier and fitter because it makes you feel better, gives you more energy, to get the most out of life, you look better which makes you feel better, and that makes you a better happier person in yourself and relationships. In short the outer layer is you want to develop healthy habits because being fit and healthy feels good and makes me a happier person.\xa0 That’s all very well and good but it’s hard to keep that at the forefront of our mind in everything we do – and we know that willpower will only take us so far.\xa0 Especially as we move in onto the next layer. The next layer or circle in is your situation. For example, you have a busy life, you’re looking after your house, maybe you have a family or a hectic social life or many commitments, and you’re always rushing around from one thing to the next. Then we get to the next layer in which is your career or job that maybe demands a lot from you in terms of energy and time. Next comes the final layer because right in the middle (like the bullseye on a dart board) is a circle which represent you.\xa0 It has the word ‘you’ of ‘me’ written in it. This is you at this very moment or in the present moment when you’re thinking about it. That’s the model but it’s not static, because the thickness of these layers changes over the day and over the week, they may be different at the weekend to a Monday morning, The point is your motivation which starts off with the best of intentions can get hijacked or watered down as you move through the layers. So first thing in the morning you start off with good intentions about changing your habits but then you get busy getting the breakfast done, getting to work, your energy dips and then the you in the middle circle – i.e. the you at that precise moment –\xa0 isn’t so worried about the bigger picture because the needs of the moment are nearer to you than the big circle on the outside. And the needs of the moment are that you’re hungry, you’re busy and need something quick to boost your energy but more importantly in that moment to overcome the hunger and to do it quickly and easily in a satisfying way.\xa0 That’s when you don’t want to just be relying on willpower and motivation and can do with something else to help you. Let’s think about what that could be and to do this we need to go back to the idea of what a habit is. The habit loop Habits have a cycle they go through.\xa0 These are the elements or phases a habits exhibits or has h to be classed a habit. A habit is made up of  the cue or trigger, the routine, action or behaviour and the reward or what we get out of it – the benefit.  This whole habit process or framework is sometimes referred to as the habit loop and it’s a crucial concept to changing your habits.\xa0 Disrupt the loop Now comes the clever part. You take this habit loop and use it to your advantage to reduce your reliance on willpower or motivation to help you form new empowering habits to support your goals.\xa0 In practical terms you do this through disrupting this existing habit loop and tying the new habit you want to cultivate to an existing one.\xa0 In that way the existing habit or activity becomes the cue or trigger for the new one you want to do. So you take a habit you do every day like cleaning your teeth or having a shower and disrupt or interrupt it – because you’re not necessarily completely changing the habit, you might be adding in a new habit. You’re effectively hijacking or piggybacking an existing habit. I’ve been doing this by interrupting my morning bathroom routine to insert a push-ups and stretching directly in-between cleaning my teeth and having my shower. And it works as I’ve done it every day this year. It’s now intrinsically tied into my morning routine so it doesn’t feel right to get in the shower if I haven’t done my little exercise habit. Try it for yourself.\xa0 Tie or link your new habit to an existing one and see how long it takes to create a new pattern of normality, in other words a new habit. Let us know how you get on.\xa0  “Habits aren’t destiny. Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced. But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit—unless you find new routines—the pattern will unfold automatically.”\xa0―\xa0Charles Duhigg,\xa0The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do  The Changeability Podcast Hear us talk about all of this and more on episode 99 of the Changeability Podcast.

Habits underpin what we do at Brilliant Living HQ.com and on the Changeability Podcast – mind management for your best life and business and how to make changes. Lasting change, i.e. achieving your goals – is not the result of a one off transformation but a product of daily habits. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to change?\xa0 Whatever it is, getting it is the result of your habits.\xa0 Habits play a role in what you look and feel like, in your success and relationships. All of which makes it slightly surprising we’ve got to episode 98 of the Changeability Podcast before dedicating and episode to habits – but here we are and this is it. So what are habits? Habits are the things we do, but also and maybe as importantly, the way we think and what we believe.\xa0 They include the self-beliefs that influence what we do, our behaviour and the actions we take. A habit is the repeated thinking and behaviours that become automatic, so we don’t mostly think about it. We need to know how we form habits in order to change them. Habits have certain characteristics or constituent parts that keep us doing them. Cues, routines and rewards There’s a cue that initiates the behaviour. A cue is a trigger, or reminder, something that triggers our thought or behaviour.\xa0 Like the cue line in a play, (the line before you come in) which on hearing it reminds you to say your line, or triggers you to deliver your line. Then comes the routine.\xa0 This is the behaviour or action that the cue has triggered – and the bit we think of as the habit. This is followed by the third part of a habit – the reward.\xa0 This is the bit that is of benefit to you in some way, even though it might not actually feel like that, your brain is seeing it’s benefit.\xa0\xa0 Because it’s a reward or benefit your brain wants you to repeat it and so you do until you’ve done it often enough it becomes a habit. This forms what Charles Duhigg in ‘The Power of Habit’ and Stanford professor B.J. Hogg in ‘Tiny Habits’ call the ‘habit loop’. Many of our everyday activities involve habits with a cue, action and reward.\xa0 Here’s a few you probably repeatedly do and don’t really think about them :  Cleaning your teeth Tying your laces Riding a bike Driving - remember learning to drive and how painfully slow it was having to think of each step every time. Whereas now it’s such an ingrained habit not only do you not think of each step, sometimes you can’t even remember driving somewhere.  Then there’s certain ways of behaving we get into which quickly become habits for example,  Getting in the habit of going to bed or getting up early or late. Eating certain types of food or at certain times of the day. Why do we tend to eat different things for breakfast to dinner? There’s not really any reason, it’s a habit born out of convention.  Then there are the habits you think of as bad or unhelpful.  Julian bites his nails and worse! Kathryn procrastinates, gets distracted by social media and emails and eats snacks late at night. That’s just for starters...  If you want proof of the power of habit – if proof were needed – just look at your pet.\xa0 Our dog Dude not only knows the time of day but exactly what should be happening in his world at what time and what order.\xa0 Especially when it comes to food and walks. Why we need habits Habits help us manage our minds.\xa0 Habits save us brain power – or rather free up our brains to do exciting creative thinking. Making habits out of the things we do repeatedly, our behaviours and actions – provides our brain with a power saving or effort saving mechanism.\xa0 An automatic response requires less creativity and complexity of thinking from us. Gretchen Rubin in her book “Better than before” sums it up nicely:  “When possible, the brain makes a behavior into a habit, which saves effort and therefore gives us more capacity to deal with complex, novel, or urgent matters.”\xa0 ―\xa0Gretchen Rubin  Why habits matter Habits matter because they hold great influence and sway over how we think, act and feel – which just about covers everything we do. We get into habits of thinking, doing and feeling. And because it’s the brain’ shortcut to behaving and feeling certain ways, it becomes automatic behaviour.\xa0  “We become what we repeatedly do.” -\xa0Sean Covey,\xa0The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective Teens  This is great if it’s good automatic behaviour – but what if it’s not good behaviour?\xa0 We’ve mentioned a few of our bad habits, those unhelpful habits that don’t support us in the changes we want to make and the way we want to live.\xa0 And the truth is we all have unhelpful habits. That’s why habits matter.\xa0 They matter to us because they are such a big part of who we are and what they do.\xa0 The results of their influence is felt and seen in every aspect of our life and work.\xa0 They help to determine how we feel and what we do. Habits underpin our mind management and how we can manage our minds to change what we do and how we do it. And habits matter because lasting change is a product of daily habits.\xa0 The little small daily things we do that day in day out, week in week out and then month in month out, go into making the person we are - how we think, feel and act. In other words, we and our lives are the sum and result of our habits.\xa0 Mind Work What can we do about it? Before we think about how to change our habits – we need to identify them and decide which are helpful and which are not serving us in what we want to do or the person we want to be. The mind work is to take a day really notice what you think are your habits.\xa0 Notice what you do and how you feel and note down a word or two or you’ll forget (you think you wont but you really will) and then determine if it’s linked to a habit and if that habit is helping or hindering you. To take it one step further you can relate it to the there being the three aspects of a habit.\xa0 This will not only help you determine if it actually is a habit but also help you understand what triggers it, (the cue) how it shows itself (the routine or behaviour or action) and what that habit is doing for you (this is the reward and benefits bit).\xa0 This will not only give you an increased level of self awareness and understanding but will put you in a good place to take forward some of next week’s suggestions when we look at how to change your habits.\xa0 Changeability Podcast Episode 98 Hear us talk about all of this and a lot more – including some more of Julian’s unsavoury habits, on episode 98 of the Changeability Podcast.

Amen  \xa0 | Change your brain, revitalise your body – really? Sound too good to be true? We’ve been talking over the last few weeks about how to use the power of your brain to reach your ideal body weight, look younger and boost your energy. And let’s face it, who couldn’t do with a bit of that! As part of our wellness and wellbeing series we’ve explored Dr Daniel Amen’s book, Change your Brain, Change your Body, including 10 brain principles for the body you want and four ways to use your brain to change your weight. Today we conclude our exploration in change your brain, revitalise your body. How your brain can help beautify your body and improve your overall health and well-being. Dr Amen puts forward 6 solutions:\xa0 1 - The Skin solution Your skin is directly tied to the health of your brain. People spend a lot of money on skin care products and more. It’s a huge multi-million pound business. From skin-care products to laser treatment, to the plastic surgeon, but Dr Amen argues these are only temporary fixes and the real solution lies in your brain. It’s your brain that tells your skin to produce more or less oil, supervises the production of supportive collagen and is responsible for skin regeneration; so it’s there we need to begin.  “The health of your skin is an outside reflection of the health of your brain.” – Dr Daniel G. Amen  So what’s bad for our brain (and therefore our skin)? Well it’s the usual suspects: Caffeine, alcohol, smoking, poor diet, too much sugar, yo-yo dieting, inadequate water intake, lack of sleep, lack of exercise, stress, unresolved emotional conflicts or PTSD, hormonal changes, untreated psychiatric conditions, dementia, medications, sun exposure, pollution and environmental toxins, climate. And the solution: Get more sleep, distress, exercise, balance your hormones, have more sex (really), limit caffeine and alcohol, quit smoking, eat a brain healthy diet (more of that next week), maintain a healthy weight, drink more water, balance your sun exposure (some sun is good for your Vitamin D) but not too much which can cause premature aging and sun spots. 20 minutes during the day after which protect yourself with sunscreen. And finally treat mental disorders and memory problems. Plus you can take some supplements, e.g. Vitamin D, fish oil, evening primrose oil and grape seed extract (good antioxidant)\xa0 2 - The Hormone solution Did you know your hormones have a huge impact on brain function? When your hormones are balanced you tend to feel happy and energetic. And in contrast Dr Amen cites evidence pointing to low hormonal levels being responsible for amongst other things: low libido, depression, memory problems, midlife crises and divorce. While high hormone levels lead to: hyper competitiveness, acne or aggression. Once again it’s the brain that controls all the hormones in your body. Types of hormonal imbalance include thyroid, adrenal, testosterone, oestrogen, progesterone to name but a few. Different hormones require different treatments but often begin with blood tests depending on the symptoms. 3 - The Focus and Energy solution If you want more energy and focus (and frankly, who doesn’t) then you are probably prey to one or more focus and energy robbers. These fall into different categories including; infectious causes, hormonal issues, low or erratic blood sugar states, anaemia, brain trauma, environmental toxins, inherited brain disorders, medications, chronic stress, untreated past emotional traumas and bad brain habits. So if you find yourself wondering if your lack of focus could be something more that just being disorganised or lacking focus, it might well be. The good news is there’s lots you can do to counteract this. The first step is to get any of those focus and energy robbers treated and at the same time develop and maintain a brain-healthy lifestyle – adequate sleep, a brain-healthy diet, exercise (4-5 times/week), a stress reduction program if chronically stressed, and meditation is a particularly good energy booster too. Plus, certain foods are energy boosters including fruit, veg, beans, and whole grains and protein. 4 - The Sleep solution And then we get to solution 4 – the sleep solution. Always a favourite topic of conversation between us. One of us a night owl who can survive on considerably less than the other. Dr Amen suggests resting your brain for a slimmer shape and smoother skin, pointing to a small study by the University of Chicago which suggests people who are sleep deprived (the test was on 12 healthy men in their twenties who slept only 4 hours a night) were more likely to choose sweets, cookies, and cake over fruit, veg and dairy products. Practical action steps in the sleep solution include: maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoid exercise close to bed time, and what causes sleep deprivations which includes amongst others medications, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine and a number of others along with these usual suspects. 5 - The Stress solution A little stress can be a good thing but excessive stress both in good and bad forms can spell trouble for your brain and body. Chronic stress affects the flow of blood to the brain, lowering overall brain function and prematurely ageing the brain and can also affect the body making you look older. A 2009 study of 647 women found the physical effects of chronic stress were similar to the effects of smoking, being obese or being 10 years older than their actual age. Techniques to help calm stress and thereby have a better body include: meditation, yoga, learning to delegate, practicing gratitude, getting enough sleep, exercise, soothing music, lavender, rehearsing or practicing situations that cause stress, living in the present (mindfulness), laughing more, seeking help, self-hypnosis and avoiding substances that harm your brain (the aforementioned usual suspects). 6 - The Negative Thoughts solution The last solution is around thinking your way to being thinner, younger and happier through avoiding negative thoughts. Dr Amen cites 9 types of ANTs or Automatic Negative Thoughts that get in the way of your being thinner, feeling and looking younger and being happier. We’ve looked at these and more in a previous post and episode of the Changeability Podcast which you check out at – Episode 39 – 11 Negative thoughts to avoid. And how to swat them. Change your Brain, Change your Body ‘Change your Brain, Change your Body’ is an interesting book that really got me thinking about whether some of the things he talks about, which I’m sometimes frustrated about in my own behaviours – tiredness, fogginess of thinking, could well be around imbalances, or poor dietary considerations and I was left wanting to explore that more. It’s a dense book with many useful actionable steps in it, plenty to ponder and take action on and return to for further reading. It will really make you think about the mind-body connection.\xa0 Where to start? Start by changing a few vital habits that will have the maximum impact. That may mean replacing ‘anti-nutrition’ with brain healthy foods, or taking supplements geared to your brain type, or by gradually starting an exercise program, or getting a bit more kip (sleep). Then fine tune your life changes to ramp up your brain and body health.

It’s sweetly ironic and rather timely. As part of our mini series on health and wellbeing, this week we think about weight and if we can use our brains to help us lose weight. Today’s featured author certainly thinks so as Dr Daniel G. Amen devotes the second section of his book, Change your Brain, Change your Body, to the subject. Last week we looked at 10 brain principles for the body you’ve always wanted. Continuing with our exploration of the link between your brain and body and how having a healthy body and making healthy decisions all starts with your brain, we turn to the subject of weight. Weight is an aspect of our bodies that many of us want to do something about.\xa0 We might want to change our weight upwards or more commonly downwards, for our health and because we think it will make us feel better about ourselves. So what does Dr Daniel G. Amen say about this?\xa0 How can you use your brain to achieve lasting weight loss? Dr Amen, puts forward four major solutions to how to use your brain to change your weight. 1 - The Craving Solution This is about using your brain to increase your willpower and calm the urges that prevent you achieving your goals. How often do we have a day where everything’s going well and then someone offers us a cream cake? In Dr Amen’s case\xa0 it was a caramel apple which he resisted it by walking away – but why was everything in him craving it? Essentially, there are centres of the brain responsible for focus, judgment and impulse control – the pre-frontal cortex in the front of your brain – and there is also a pleasure and motivation centre deep within your brain plus we also have emotional memory centres that trigger behaviour. \xa0All this comes together to influence our behaviour. By understanding these brain circuits of willpower and control you can work towards gaining mastery of your brain and body. It starts with our first experiences of pleasure or intense emotional experiences. These first experiences can get locked in the brain and lay down the tracks for later behaviour and addictions, because we want to replicate and repeat what led to our first pleasurable experiences. For Dr Amen it was linked to the pleasure he associated with some of his earliest memories of making fudge with his sweet-maker grandfather. What about you? What are your earliest memories of pleasure or intense emotional experiences? I remember eating ‘milky way’ chocolate bars at my Grandma’s house when I got home from school and my Mother’s sherry trifles were legendry at family parties and celebrations of every kind. \xa0 For Julian the stodgy puddings of school dinners and getting enough of it after it had been passed down the table of older children first, loom large in his memory (yes he is that person that loved school dinners)! So going back to the idea there are different centres of the brain responsible for focus, judgment and impulse control plus a pleasure and motivation centre, it’s the relative strength and weakness of each of these brain areas that goes a long way in determining how much control we have over ourselves and how well we are able to stick to our plans. Regaining control of these different centres of the brain depends in part on the area in question but it generally involves balancing your brain systems. If, for example your Prefrontal Cortex is out of balance, you might need to treat any PFC problems that exist but in more general terms you can strengthen this area by:  Good sleep Maintaining a healthy blood sugar level Exercise Meditation And creating focused, written goals. All of which are designed to boost activity and blood flow to this area of the brain. (Couldn’t agree more with this and if you want to know more sign up for our Changeability Starter Kit)  Solution 2 – The Weight Solution Here, you’re using your brain to achieve your optimal weight. While according to Dr Amen we might exhibit different clinical presentations and brain patterns and require different approaches, he outlines 13 things all of us should do to maintain a healthy weight.  Know your brain type – not everyone has the same brain type. There are six main types (detailed in the book) Get a complete physical and focus on having healthy vitamin D, DHEA (a hormone in the body which can become depleted), and thyroid levels Know your BMI and caloric need numbers – the approximate number of calories you need to maintain your current weight. He gives you a formula which you can use to calculate the number of calories you need to maintain your current weight. Know the approximate number of calories you eat a day by keeping a food journal and calorie log and work on getting ‘high-quality calories in versus high-quality energy out’. This is useful because people lie about their food intake, or to put it more kindly, we often underestimate our daily intake and keeping a food journal overcomes this tendency. You start using your brain to become educated about the nutrition you put in your body and can then take control over it. You can not change what you can not measure. Exercise 4-5 times a week, starting with walking fast and light strength training. Optimise your hormone levels Get great sleep Use simple stress-management techniques Stop believing every negative thought that goes through your brain Use hypnosis to keep you slim Take supplements to keep your brain healthy Use the advice in his book, to keep your brain young and active in order to lose 10 pounds (5 kilograms) Take control of your weight and do not let other people make you fat  Solution 3 – The Nutrition Solution This involves feeding your brain nutritious foods to look and feel younger, on the basis that we are what we eat, and that the foods we eat affect our moods and our energy levels. We’re constantly getting the wrong or unhelpful messages about food. As a society we’re bombarded with messages encouraging us to adopt bad eating habits. ‘Do you want to supersize that?’, ‘Do you want bread first?’ ‘Do you want a larger drink? It’s a better deal’, the All you can eat buffet! Many of us send out the wrong messages to our children ‘If you’re good, you can have a treat when you get home.’ We use poor nutrition as a reward for good behaviour which later in life translates to us rewarding ourselves with food that is not good for us. To follow the Nutrition Solution of how to use your brain to change your weight:  Drink plenty of water, some green tea, and not too many calories Watch your calories Increase good fats (unsaturated fats) and decrease bad ones (saturated and trans fats) Unsaturated good fats include: avocadoes (thought you’d like that one), olive oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil and nuts such as almonds, cashews and pistachios. Increase good carbs and decrease bad ones. Carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet, the amount you need depends on your brain type Good carbs are complex carbs which take longer to digest: fruit, veg, beans, pulses and whole grains. Bad carbs or simple carbs are digested quickly and provide little or no nutritional value: e.g. sugar, pastries, sweets, fizzy drinks, fruit juices, doughnuts, white bread, pasta and white rice Dump artificial sweeteners and replace with small amounts of natural sweeteners. Limit caffeine intake to one or two normal cups of coffee or three cups of tea a day. Eat great brain foods, which include Acai berries, blueberries, blackberries, cranberries, strawberries, spinach, raspberries, brussell sprouts, plums, broccoli, beetroot, avocadoes, oranges, red grapes, red peppers, cherries and kiwis Reduce salt intake and increase potassium intake Plan snacks. Interestingly, he says don’t listen to the idea of avoid snacking. Going too long without eating can wreak havoc on your brain function and make your blood sugar levels drop too low. But make them healthy snacks. Take a multivitamin supplement and fish oil Recognise when you or someone you care about has hidden food allergies.  Solution 4 – The Exercise Solution Exercise your body to strengthen your brain.  “Those who think they have not time for bodily exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness.” – Edward Stanley  We’re becoming more sedentary – driving to work, sitting all day at a desk, lounging on the sofa. This is bad news for our brains, our bellies, our backsides and our backs. Exercise is part of the solution because it:  Encourages the growth of new brain cells Enhances cognitive ability at all ages Enhances your mood Helps alleviate depression Calms worries and anxiety And helps us sleep better, amongst other things  Episode 95 of the Changeability Podcast Join us to hear us talk about all of this and more in episode 95 of the Changeability Podcast What about you?

Changeability Starter Kit Change your Brain Change your Body by Dr Daniel G. Amen Episode 94 - 10 Brain Principles for the body you’ve always wanted  | 10 brain principles for the body you want Is it possible to utilise the power of your brain, to reach your ideal body weight, to look younger and boost your energy? That’s the question we’re asking today. And it’s the bold claim Dr Daniel G Amen makes in his New York Times bestseller, Change your Brain, Change your Body - the subject of this week’s blog and Changeability Podcast.\xa0 What’s the idea behind Change your Brain, Change your Body? In his introduction, Dr Amen tells us  “Fifty percent of the brain is dedicated to vision. How you look plays a large role in how you feel. To look and feel your best, you must first think about and\xa0optimize your brain.”  Let’s unpick this a bit. We’re visually orientated, with our brain devoting half of its processing power to sight. Being visual creatures – how we look, or how we perceive we look, plays a large part in how we feel about ourselves and that can often determine our ultimate success. For our own underlying health – and not just for vanity sake – we should therefore concern ourselves with how we look and feel. And that ultimately, to look and feel your best you need to first think about and then optimize your brain. So as the title suggests, this book is about understanding and optimizing your brain to help you reach your ideal weight, look younger, boost your energy, change how you feel about yourself and that process of changing your body (via your mind) will in turn ultimately determine your success. In essence then, this book is about body/mind integration, mind/body connection and how you can use your brain to improve your body and health. And I’m sure you’ll agree, that’s an interesting premise. But what do we know about the author and how he comes to make these claims?\xa0 Background and credentials of the author Dr Daniel G Amen is a doctor with three decades of clinical practice at the Amen Clinics. His interest in the brain-body connection started over 30 years ago – where intriguingly he was influenced by an oncologist who taught people to use visualization to boost their immune system in order to fight cancer. At medical school he became trained in hypnosis and saw the effect it can have on healing the body in a variety of treatments. But it was in 1991 that he truly started to understand the mind-body connection when he started doing the brain imaging work which he now does at his clinics.  “Our brain imaging work opened a new window into why people do what they do. It provided the missing link and allowed people to see what was going on in their brains, so they could do things to improve their brain and bodies.”  Addressing the effect rather than the cause of body dissatisfaction How often do we look in the mirror and see things we don’t always like? We look at our reflection and we see lines on our face we don’t always want there, or we catch a glance of ourselves sidelong and see a tum which frankly we’d prefer not to have. We notice a few split ends in our hair or excessively dry skin on our face. What do we do? Well, we could make an appointment with a hairdresser for a haircut. The wrinkles – we might slap all sorts of lotions and potions onto the skin to moisturise, cleanse and fill the cracks, so to speak – and some might nip along to their doctors to make an appointment for Botox. Basically we try and fix it ourselves (diet to lose the tum) or get some professional help. We address the effect. But Dr Amen would say that we need to address this issue by thinking about the health of our brain, the cause. And that many of us are walking around with brains that could do with some serious help, but we don’t know it, so we don’t do anything about it to address the issue. The things we see in the mirror are symptomatic of our brain health and instead of addressing the causal symptom we address the effect.\xa0 10 brain principles for the body you want Amen’s book is based on 10 key principles about the brain and its relationship with your body, and ultimately the health and wellbeing of our bodies.  Your brain is involved in everything you do. It is at the core of your very health and wellbeing and the good or bad decisions we make with our brain ultimately determine whether your stomach bulges over your belt or your waistline is trim and toned. Essentially, the moment-by-moment functioning of the brain is responsible for the way you think, feel, eat and exercise. When your brain works right, your body looks and feels better. Here the idea is that when you have a healthy brain, it’s easier for you to have the best body possible. When your brain is working at optimal levels, you are more likely to stick to a diet, follow an exercise routine and adopt wellness lifestyle behaviours. The brain is a complex organ and we should respect it. The brain is an incredible organ, more powerful than the most sophisticated supercomputer. It is also responsible for our personalities, our character, our intelligence, indeed who we are. Yet often we don’t respect it, with the things we put into our bodies or the lifestyle we live. Your brain is soft and housed in a really hard skull and needs protecting. The consistency of the brain is not firm and rubbery as we might believe but very soft – like butter or custard. Although protected by a hard skull it can still be damaged easily. Many studies indicate that a lot of contact sports can damage our brains and demonstrate that even people who have suffered minor brain injuries can often experience emotional, behavioural or cognitive problems. The brain has only so much reserve. The more reserve you have, the healthier you are. The less, the more vulnerable. In times of stress some people deal with the situation better than others and the conclusion from Dr Amen’s brain scan work is that this is something to do with brain reserve – the cushion of healthy brain function we have to deal with stressful events or injuries. Specific parts of the brain are involved in certain behaviours. Trouble in specific parts tends to cause certain behavioural problems. The brain is divided into various parts or systems. If these parts of the brain show low or high activity (which can be seen with brain scanning) we exhibit certain behavioural problems. By addressing that under or over activity through the use of supplements and lifestyle changes we can help our ability to have the best body possible. Many things hurt the brain and make it harder for you to get and keep the body you’ve always wanted. Many things help the brain and make it easier to get and keep a body you love. Things that harm include: physical trauma, drugs, alcohol, obesity, hormonal imbalances, malnutrition, inflammation of the body, stress, sleep deprivation, smoking, too much caffeine, too much TV, violent video games, dehydration, lack of exercise, negative thinking, and also making the list - excessive texting and social networking on the internet. Brain imaging gives insight into healing the brain so you can have a better body. Brain imaging can often give clues as to the type of issue – from the list above, but also the area of the brain affected, which can then be treated. One prescription does not work for everyone. We are all unique and you need to understand how your own personal brain functions. We need individualised approaches based on our own brain type and needs. You can change your brain and body! Here Dr Amen imagines a really exciting breakthrough in medicine where by targeting specific interventions and lifestyle changes, you can improve both your brain and body.  So that’s it, the 10 principles that explain why it is essential to love and nurture your brain to have your best body possible and optimal wellness. Next time, we explore how to use your brain to achieve something many of us struggle with – lasting weight loss; plus the many ways your brain can help you beautify your body and achieve lasting wellness and good health.\xa0 Episode 94 of The Changeability Podcast Hear us discuss the 10 principles and more in episode 94 of The Changeability Podcast, or subscribe to all our previous episodes on iTunes.\xa0 Links mentioned in today’s show  Dr Daniel G Amen – Change your Brain, Change your Body  | Nicole Keating is on a mission to live a life of Epic Wellness, and to inspire and help others in their quest for The Art of Epic Wellness – a life of physical, spiritual and emotional vitality. Nicole maintains:  “If you treat your body as a temple, then your body is going to treat you with beautiful energy and epic vitality”  And who doesn’t want more energy and vitality? We know we certainly do. Behind the concept of epic wellness is the belief you have the right to know what’s going into the temple that is your body, and the responsibility to share what you know with the people you love.  “It’s all about becoming involved with your food”, Nicole tells us.  And this carries on from ideas we explored on last week’s Changeability Podcast where we were talking about wellness and wellbeing. Nicole’s website, theartofepicwellness.com and her podcast of the same name seeks to do just that, to explore, uncover, question, unburden and uplevel your wellness journey. After all…  “When you invest in clean food going into your body you won’t to have to invest later in your healthcare.”  With a life voyage of such life changing proportions, we thought the only decent and British thing to do was to invite her onto the Changeability Podcast to discuss not the science but the Art of Epic Wellness. And when the California State (where Nicole lives) and good old blighty meet – that’s home to Kathryn and I – there’s bound to be room for lively discussion on living a life of such epic proportions.\xa0 On today’s Changeability Podcast Hear Nicole, Kathryn and I discuss:\xa0  What is Epic Wellness? What is Nicole’s new Art of Epic Wellness Manifesto? Food integrity – the importance of source, and eating seasonally Nurturing our four quadrants:  the heart the mind and creativity the spirit and the body.   Nicole’s tragedy that brought urgency to the idea of epic wellness. The changes you might need to make in your life to achieve your own epic wellness. Why you might need to try an elimination diet to determine potential allergens in your body How we can live more in a state of physical, spiritual and emotional vitality. The concepts of unburdening and uplevelling ourselves Mindfulness and eating – creating one mindful meal a day How you can start that wellness journey And more   “I like to think of my meal as a palette, I’m building a beautiful canvas of food in front of me and I want to see all the different colours, I want to have different textures, I like to have some things cooked and some things raw and whenever I am cooking, I’m thinking about it that way.”  Links mentioned on this week’s show  We’d love your vote for The Changeability Podcast – it’s up for the Best UK Podcast of 2016 Award – and while you’re there Kathryn would appreciate a vote for Podcast Divas as well!

L. Sarlin  | What the heck is wellbeing? Here at Brilliant Living HQ and our Changeability Podcast we’re all about helping you and us manage our minds to make changes and have more success and our best life and business.\xa0 As well as looking at mind management techniques and processes to do this, we thought it would be fun and hopefully helpful to look at some of the key areas of life that many of us want to do something about.\xa0 Earlier this year we did a series of podcasts and posts about relationships and today we start thinking about wellness and wellbeing.  “Everything that brings us well being is achieved through allowing ourselves to flow with life and be in harmony. Pain happens, it is our attachment to the pain and our resistance to change that causes suffering.”\xa0Alaric Hutchinson  Today is a beautiful day. It’s the first week of May and spring has sprung here in our little corner of England. The evenings are light and the days getting longer every day. The sunshine is making us feel better and it’s amazing the difference it makes. In fact we could say it’s increasing our sense of wellbeing - it certainly feels like that to us.\xa0 But what the heck is wellbeing? What does wellbeing and wellness mean to us? This notion of wellbeing seems to be everywhere, in the work-place, in magazines, all over the internet, in fact there is a whole wellness and wellbeing industry out there.\xa0 Wellbeing is big business.\xa0 It’s a world populated by spas, therapists, therapies, fitness, gyms, dancing, exercise classes, weight loss, relaxation, supplements, closely associated to the health industry and being in a healthy state. Wellness is the manifestation of wellbeing. Wellbeing is a particular way or specific state of being encompassing many different aspects such as:  Body and physical health Mental and psychological wellbeing Emotional wellbeing Economic wellbeing Social wellbeing  Psychologists, economists and policy makers are all interested in wellbeing and try to measure it, so they can use it to understand more about populations and the policies needed in the future. While our focus at Brilliant Living HQ and in the Changeability mind-work is on mind management, it doesn’t mean we ignore the physical or body side of things. The two are totally entwined.\xa0 We know this is area where lots of us want to change things – and that’s great because we believe mind management is key to making those changes, as much as it is to making any changes in life or business. Is it an area you want to change? Ask yourself if your level of wellbeing is having an impact on your life, work, business, interests, family or relationships? Mind body and spirit When we talk about wellness in terms of Brilliant Living, we see wellbeing encompassing body, mind and spirit. For us it has to be a holistic definition and approach to wellbeing that takes all three elements into account. How do you define wellbeing? What the heck does wellbeing mean to you? We asked our Changeability Facebook Group and is what two of our members told us:  ‘Giving your body what it needs (fuel, movement, rest and recovery) self care, connection, emotional support/nurturance... Just some ideas off the top of my head\xa0😉\xa0‘\xa0 Vicky ‘Wellness for me has to do with both mind and body, but I sometimes have to go along with wellness also including pain/discomfort as well. So it isn't the absence of problems, more like being happy where I am, appreciating all the good things, having a\xa0sharp mind to play with and a very useful body! Other people, communication, meaningful activities, and all the basic needs met are of course in the mix. (There’s no of course about that list for so many people, so gratitude is in there too!)’\xa0 Janet  Thanks to Vicky and Janet for these insightful definitions.\xa0 Positivity Just as health is not the absence of disease, there’s something much more positive to it rather than being just an opposite to a negative thing, wellbeing is something positive in its own right.\xa0 As Jan points out, it isn’t about the absence of problems, but about being happy where we are – which is a relief for all of us as we’re never going to have a completely problem-free life, but we can still have wellness and experience wellbeing. How we think and feel about wellbeing is context dependent, as wellness and wellbeing are a relative concept. It might change at different times and stages of life, and different levels of health and fitness, but the key to wellbeing remains the same.\xa0 The key to wellbeing is feeling good That’s it really isn’t it?\xa0 The answer to what the heck is wellbeing is – ‘feeling good’. As our feelings and emotions are connected to our mind this brings us back around to mind management as the way to help us experience wellbeing. So how can we summarise what wellbeing means to us? Wellbeing is a combination of factors, some of which are more important at different times than others, but all impact on our levels of wellbeing including:  health and fitness - both physical and mental self-esteem and self-worth confidence energy enthusiasm and a zest for life happiness feeling good  That’s our quick introduction to wellbeing, what it is (and isn’t) and we're looking forward to delving into this subject a bit more and talking to some guests about it over the next few weeks. The Changeability Podcast Episode 92 Hear us talk about all of this and much more – including how and 11 year old Kathryn got this definition of wellbeing and times she hasn’t been feeling it – on episode 92 of the Changeability Podcast. Getting to Know You survey Thanks to those fantastic people who’ve completed our ‘Getting to know you’ questionnaire.\xa0 If you haven’t done we’d love to hear from you.\xa0 It’s very quick and easy with only handful of questions. It’s anonymous unless you want to leave your details and will help us get to know and serve you better. Thank you. | A new measure of successHow do you quantify success? What is it you actuallymeasure?Should it be statistics, figures, numbers? Or how about theeffort put in to achieving it?Maybe it could be a combination of these, rather like thoseschool reports where you get a grade for achievement and a scorefor effort.Or should we more concerned with experiences rather thannumbers?Statistics are certainly the easiest and most obvious way tomeasure success. With money wealth, income being one of mostpopular ways for people to measure their own or others’success.But it’s all relative. What constitutes a measure of success inmonetary terms fluctuates according to age, the circles you movein, geographical location and your time in history.Money can be measure in it’s own right or as an indication ormeasure of success. It’s not necessarily the money per sethat’s important to measure, but it’s rather the way some peoplechoose to quantify their success. The success is what drives them,not the money, but income is a useful indicator and measure ofthat.That’s all very well and yes numbers and effort are a good wayto measure anything, but let’s not ignore the role of feelings andthe experience itself. Otherwise we run the danger of seeingsuccess as one-dimensional and we’re not one-dimensional beings, soif we do this we fail to capture the true meanings of success.So how are we measuring success?During my reflection time recently (a part of my Changeabilitymind-work where I write whatever comes to mind during meditation orvisualisation) I came to a realisation as I was musing on this verysubject.I realised that for much of my life I’ve equated success withvalidation. Validation for what I’m not sure, but it’s something todo with feeling valued and wanting to be seen to be good enough orfor people to think I’m good at doing what I’m doing.This was quite a revelation! I was interested in what it meant.Did I see my self-worth wrapped up in other people’s idea of myworthiness? I don’t think of myself as someone who worries too muchabout what others think of me, or let it stop me doing things. Butmaybe it’s not so much about what others think, but more that Iwant to be seen as good enough so I think I’m good enoughmyself.\xa0There’s a lot more to be said about this and how it shows up inwhat I do and don’t do. You can hear all of this in much moredetail in episode 91 of The ChangeabilityPodcast.\xa0A new measure of successIf you haven’t got time to listen to the episode now (and it’squite a short episode for us) here’s a flavour of what I wrote inmy Changeability Daily Journal:I am going to have a new measure of success from nowon.\xa0My new measure of success is around enjoying every day.\xa0 Soessentially I will measure my daily success in terms of whether Ienjoyed the day and found it fulfilling in some way.Now of course what constitutes an enjoyable day or a fulfillingday will change from day to day depending on what I’m doing – butin many ways that is the point.\xa0There is no real single measure of success, but many differentmeasures depending on what we’re trying to achieve at anytime.\xa0 Therefore, I’m using this as an overarching catchallthat can encompass any other measure within it.After all, what I (and I think most people) want to achieve inlife and business is to be happy and fulfilled and enjoy thisamazing experience of being alive.\xa0What makes each of us happy and fulfilled will be different andthat doesn’t matter, because my new measure of success allows me tocapture this for me.Listen to the podcast to hear me read the full extract from myChangeability Planner and Journal.“A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bedat night, and in between he does what he wants to do.”\xa0BobDylanGetting to know youIf you listen to our podcast or come to this website regularlythen you know a bit about us – and we’d love to reciprocate and getto know more about you. So we’ve come up with a quick questionnaireto help do this. We recorded a shortvideo to explains why – or you can skip straight to ourGetting toKnow You Questionnaire.There’s just a few questions which only take a couple of minutesto complete. It would be fantastic to hear from you as the more weknow about you the more we can talk about things and create thingsyou’re interested in and will help you.

No matter what grade level or subject area you teach, there are always a few ways that Google tools can help you and your students save time and get creative. Below are a variety of ideas to help get to know your students, build relationships, do some goal setting, create, and play some games. Be sure to share your favorite ways to use G Suite for back to school in the comments below this post! Here are six ideas for going Back to School with G Suite. Student Interest Survey with Google Forms One of the most important things teachers can do during the first few weeks of school is to build relationships with their students. We want to know what they like, what they don't like, where they struggle, and their learning style. There are lots of ways to get to know your students, but Google Forms is a great way to gather some basic information and keep it organized in a spreadsheet. The answers to some of these types of questions may not be something students are comfortable sharing with the entire class, so a Google Form is a great way to give students a safe space to share. Depending on what age you teach, these questions will vary. Below are some ideas to get you started.  What do you want me to call you in class? (preferred first name) What is your favorite color? What is your favorite food? What are you passionate about? If you could learn anything at school, what would you choose to learn? Do you like to be recognized for your accomplishments in front of the class? What characteristics do you like in a teacher? Is there anything that you struggle with in class? What do you do if you don't know how to answer a question or problem? How do you learn best? What do you want me to know or understand about you? Do you prefer to work in groups or on your own? Do you like to read aloud? What are your favorite books? Do you enjoy reading?   Vision Boards with Google Slides The beginning of the school year or semester is the perfect time to build a growth mindset and set some goals with students. Visualization is one of the most powerful exercises for the mind and for reaching your goals. A vision board is a collection of images and words that represent the things you want in life–the things you want to do, the things you want to learn, the things you want to be. Vision boards also support Dynamic Learning and the ISTE Standards for Students! This is just one small way we can empower l | Welcome back to the show ya’ll! Today I’m talking with another amazing student guest about coding, art, and student-led innovation. Ainsley McClard is going into the 7th grade next year and she chats about some amazing projects she’s been involved in, what she thinks about the grading system, and why she started her own business! Ainsley loves to learn and create. Her favorite classes involve art and creation and she has used this passion to create inventions with coding! She also creates bracelets (that you can buy to help her fund her Washington D.C. field trip) and she’s learning to sew. She wishes that teachers were able to spend more time moving forward rather than repeating lessons they’ve already learned. Sometimes she gets bored when they aren’t moving quickly enough through the material. She also shares her thoughts on grading and why there should be a way for students to obtain feedback and correct their mistakes prior to receiving a final grade. That’s not all she shares on the grading issue, listen in to learn more.\xa0 Ainsley was unbelievably transparent about her thoughts on her classrooms, her projects, and her feelings toward school. This is definitely an episode that would inspire many to either continue working on technology-driven projects in their classrooms or start implementing them!

You are never going to write and publish as much as you want if you feel yucky about your writing. But feeling good about your writing doesn’t just happen randomly or by accident. You have to create that positive relationship with your writing. \xa0 In this episode I’m talking all about creating a positive relationship with your writing in order to get more writing done and feel better doing it. I call this creating “positive feedback loops.” It means that when you write, you feel positive feelings, which make you want to write again, in a super-happy loop of unicorns and rainbows.I exaggerate, but you get what I mean. These positive feelings are created by you by implementing certain writing behaviors.\xa0 Actions to Take to Cultivate a Positive Relationship with Writing It doesn’t happen on it’s own, and it doesn’t happen by wishing for it, but you can take actionable steps to make yourself feel better about writing, with reinforces your desire to do it.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Start with small wins. Getting in one hour of focused writing per week consistently is the first small step.Then you can expand to two or three hours. Do this during your “tiger time” (not sure what that is? Take a listen to episode 2!) The idea is to set yourself up to win at writing. Small goals, consistency, writing with focus so that the writing feels good. Be purposeful and gentle on yourself.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Reward yourself. Set up an easy-to-maintain reward system so that you are giving yourself positive feedback for small and large writing successes. For small successes (completing your one hour sessions to start with) try something like a gold star on the calendar, or what a member of the I Should be Writing Facebook group does: putting a pebble in a glass vase for each day that you meet a small writing goal.  \xa0 When you meet a large goal (submitting for publication or some other large project) be sure to give yourself a bigger reward: go out to dinner, open a nice bottle of wine, or maybe just an at-home dance party in your living room. Get into the habit of acknowledging your work by creating a positive experience for yourself. \xa0 \xa0  Adjust your mindset. So much of writing is about mindset. We all struggle with impostor syndrome, guilt, and overwhelm at one time or another. There is so much pressure around writing and publishing in academia because the stakes are very high: getting the job, keeping the job, getting the promotion, getting the grant. Much of it is dependent on your publication record. Sometimes all the pressure can lead us to believe things about our writing that aren’t true, and certainly aren’t helpful. Adjusting our mindsets may need to include reprogramming how we think.  \xa0 “We have to actively learn to reprogram our negative writing stories so that we can get our big message out into the world.” How to Unlearn and Relearn Writing in Academia Most of us aren’t trained in writing as a practice, so we are making up systems and behaviors as we go along. When these systems and behaviors come from a place of pressure and fear, they can end up creating negative cycles of feedback between us and our writing. Instead, you must realize that writing is about caring for yourself and your career. It is about getting your message out into the world, where it can change your field and help people. Your teaching and research are better when you feel good about your writing, and you are happier. Here’s how to accomplish this mindset switch. \xa0 \xa0  Identify the stories you have been telling yourself about your writing. These are all the messages that come up when you sit down to think about your writing. For example:  \xa0 “I’m a bad writer.” “I have nothing new to say.” “This is going to get a desk reject.” “I don’t have time to write.” \xa0  Flip the script. Now take each story and literally flip it on its head. Write exactly the opposite.  \xa0 I don’t know how to write→ I know how to write. I have nothing new to say→ I have new and important things to say. \xa0  Reprogram. Changing our default thoughts takes diligence. Try writing your new writing stories on a paper and hanging it up on the wall, or set an alarm on your phone and read your new stories aloud to yourself several times per day.  \xa0 When your old stories come back, shoo them away with a phrase like “not helpful.” If you have to say it out loud, do it! Do whatever it takes to relearn that relationship to writing. If you were a writer as a kid, remember the reasons you wrote then: you had a story to tell, a message to communicate, something to say! You can connect with that kiddo again–and believe her that you have something important to say. “Writing is worth your time, reflection, and energy, perhaps more than any other academic undertaking.”\xa0 Conclusion We all know writing is vital to our academic careers. In order to maintain our productivity and our sanity, we need to intentionally cultivate a positive relationship with that part of our academic lives. No amount of pushing ourselves to write will be as effective if we don’t get this right first.\xa0 \xa0 If you need more ideas on how to find time to write, head here to grab my FREE PDF download: 10 ways to make time to write.\xa0 Start taking action today to write and publish more and FEEL BETTER about it! Connect with me: Website Facebook Group Facebook Page  Originally published at https://www.cathymazak.com/episode5 | Do you have too much going on? In all seriousness, can you fit everything that needs to be done on your calendar? If you feel like there are simply not enough hours in the day, this episode is for you.\xa0 \xa0More and more of what we are expected to do in academia is “shallow work”: paper pushing, email, useless meetings. This means that we are finding less and less time for “deep work” (terms explained by Cal Newport in his book Deep Work): the thinking and creating that we were trained to do, the reasons many of us got into this profession in the first place. The market is flooded and if you don’t have time to write and publish or to bring in the big grant money,someone else is: someone who is willing to work nights and weekends, or who has home-care built in, or is turning themselves inside out to try and do it all.\xa0 I want you to see that the fact that you feel overworked and overwhelmed is not a reflection on your personal character. It’s not your fault. You are part of a system that is set up this way. But what do we do about it? On this episode we’re talking about how to “find” time with a strategy called “my ideal week.”\xa0 (If you’re interested in more ways to make time to write, I’ve got a PDF list for you called 10 Ways to Make Time To Write. Grab it here.) \xa0 Guidelines for Creating Your Ideal Week Calendar An ideal week calendar is a visualization of how you can make your work fit into your working hours. Here is how you do it.  Come up with basic categories for everything you do. Some examples are: teaching (class meeting times, course prep, grading); research (data collection, lab work, reading, writing); service (meeting times, work on service-related things); etc.  \xa0 \xa0  Map them onto your calendar. Assign each category a color, then map each one out onto your work week. Using a color-coded system will help with visualizing, and making adjustments later in the process.  \xa0 \xa0  Reminders and suggestions.\xa0   Don’t forget what I call “personal maintenance” time. Use this category for things like taking a walk, break times, and always taking time for lunch away from work. Be sure to block similar items together, and don’t forget to include “tiger time” (see episode 2 for more information). Schedule activities that tend to run over against immovable tasks, like scheduled meetings or class time, to prevent using more time than needed. Consider waiting to check email until after lunch.  \xa0 “One of the things that really derails us in terms of time management is checking email first thing in the morning.” -Cathy Mazak \xa0 Reflect on Your Ideal Calendar Once you have your ideal calendar laid out, with activities slotted into blocks, and everything you need to accomplish in place, it’s time to reflect on what you’ve come up with. \xa0  Does what you have laid out accurately reflect your “load”, whatever that may be according to your university contract? In other words, if you are supposed to be spending 50% of your time on teaching and 50% on research, does this calendar reflect that?\xa0  \xa0  Does everything you need to do in a week fit into this calendar? If you are having to cram 50, 60, 70 hours into your work week to fit everything, something HAS to go. What will you cut? This is important to maintain a fulfilling career and avoid burnout.  \xa0  How would it feel to actually live out this schedule?  \xa0 Try Your Ideal Week Calendar This exercise is designed to help you make time for writing and for yourself. It is meant to help you spot things that are bloating your schedule and wasting time. But you won’t know for sure what works, and how to adjust it unless you actually give it a try.\xa0 \xa0 “The reason that we try new things is because what we’re currently doing is not working.”\xa0 \xa0 If you feel like what you are currently doing is not working in terms of your schedule and your time, then please, try it! Do the ideal week exercise, and value yourself enough to work through it and find a better experience for yourself.\xa0 \xa0 “Let’s make this academic life more centered, less stressed, and less overwhelming.” \xa0 If you are in our Facebook Group and you decide to lay out your ideal calendar and give it a try, snap a pic, share it with us, and let us know what you’ve learned!

The day-to-day project management tasks of the academic life are not part of our training. In some cases, these tasks are modeled by excellent mentors,but most of the time we’re making it up as we go along. \xa0 If you’ve been following along, you know that I’m on a one-woman mission to reveal all the “secrets” of how to do academia successfully so that we can all be happier, healthier, and more fulfilled in our careers. In this episode, we’re looking at how project management can help accomplish these goals. \xa0 “Without a system for project management, you’re going to feel overwhelmed and exhausted all the time, no matter how much progress you’re actually making.” -Cathy Mazak \xa0 Understanding the Basics of Academic Project Management Before we jump in to how to build and execute our project management systems, it’s important to understand a few basic skills.\xa0 \xa0  Not all writing tasks involve actual writing. When I say “writing,” I don’t mean only putting words on a page. I mean all the things you must do to complete a writing project. These could include: reading, collecting data, analyzing, creating charts and graphs, proofreading, etc. By thinking about all of these things as writing, you will see progress towards your publication goals, even when you are not physically writing.  \xa0 \xa0  A project is not the same thing as a task. The first step to managing your academic writing projects is to know the difference between a project and a task. Projects are big: writing an article, a book proposal, a grant. Tasks are small: Write the introduction, investigate competing titles, create the grant budget. Tasks are what we put on our calendars. Projects are what we put on our publication pipelines. If you’ve been writing “finish article” on your to-do list, it’s time to break it into manageable tasks.  \xa0 \xa0  Estimating time for completing each task is critical. \xa0Most people underestimate how long it will take to do something. The danger of this is that you start to feel bad about your writing, which leads to guilt and overwhelm, writing’s two biggest enemies.\xa0 Instead I want you to overestimate the time it will take you to do tasks. To maintain and perpetuate positive feelings about your writing tasks, you need to feel like you are “winning”,\xa0 checking things off the list, moving projects forward. If you overestimate the time it takes to do a writing task, and then you get finished earlier: that’s what you want!  \xa0 Many of the academic women I coach having been writing for years but still can’t put accurate time estimates on how long it takes for them to complete writing tasks. In this episode I talk about an exercise you can do to dial in your ability to estimate the size of your tasks. It’s important that each task is able to be completed in one hour or less. \xa0 \xa0  Scheduling tasks in your calendar. I recommend one of two methods: (1) actually give each task a due date or (2) have a prioritized bank of tasks and scheduled writing time; during the writing time you pull from the bank of tasks. Whichever method you choose, be sure your individual tasks have a place on your calendar.  \xa0 \xa0 Systems are the Foundation of Writing Project Management \xa0 It is best to work on one project at a time, but this is nearly impossible in academia. So strive to work on one writing project at a time and move it all the way to completion. Moving a project through your pipeline and to completion is dependent on implementing workable systems. Here’s how: \xa0 \xa0  Use templates to make common project tasks repeatable. So much of our writing energy goes to figuring out what to do next. A writing project management system eliminates this time spent thinking and planning at the beginning of every writing session. A “template” for academic writing projects is a generic task list and outline for that type of project.  \xa0 \xa0 “The benefit of templates is that they stop you wheel-spinning by making sure you never start with a blank page.” -Cathy Mazak \xa0 \xa0  Schedule time for project management. For people short on time, it might seem counterintuitive to add time to the calendar for project management. But this is a short, focused planning session that will save you so much time and energy later. You can use Trello or another project management tool, sticky notes in a calendar, or a bullet journal. The idea is to begin your week with the big picture of what needs to get done.\xa0  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  Trust the System. Once you’ve set up templates for repeatable tasks and taken the time for project management, you need to trust the system and try it out for at least two weeks. Sometimes if I get stressed it is tempting to push my carefully laid plans aside. To combat this, I’ve adopted the mantra “trust the system.” When I want to ditch the plan I made the day before in response to something new that’s come up, I just tell myself to work on the things I planned to work on and deal with fitting in the new task when I get to my project management planning time at the end of the day.  \xa0 \xa0 Need Help with Implementing Academic Project Management? I use Trello for my project management needs, and I am offering a course to show you how to use Trello to organize all of your academic projects. The course is called Organize Your Academic Life and includes a complete set of academic project management templates, made by me, for you. In the course I walk you through how to personalize and set up these templates and workflows for common academic projects on everything from co-authoring to communication with students and colleagues to research and writing.

In fact, writing every day could be counterproductive to your writing goals.\xa0 \xa0 Everyone wants to write and publish more. Academia demands it; it’s how we get jobs, keep jobs, and get promoted. More importantly, it’s how we influence our field, get our message out to the world, and spread knowledge that can help change lives. But how do we do it?\xa0 \xa0 Many sources push a system of writing every day, no matter what. In this episode, I’m going to share why trying to write every day can be a bad idea, and what you can do instead.\xa0 \xa0 Writing Every Day isn’t for Everyone When you research how to be more productive in your writing, you might find answers like: “Do it every day. Don’t miss a day. Hit a word count. Get accountability systems so that you continue to write every day.”\xa0 \xa0 If the “write every day” method appeals to you, then please, do it! \xa0 But as an academic mom of three, this has never worked for me. And this method can have negative consequences for your writing.\xa0 \xa0 “It can actually be counterproductive to write daily.” \xa0 Why Trying to Write Every Day Could Be Counterproductive If you are trying to force yourself to write every day, you could be setting yourself up for failure.\xa0 \xa0 Here’s why a goal of writing every day can backfire: \xa0 1. You slip and feel guilty. If your goal is to write every day, what happens when you don’t? What happens when your kid gets a fever, your department chair need a fire put out, or you yourself wake up sick? You miss a day, and then you feel guilty.\xa0 \xa0 “Guilt is the biggest obstacle to writing and publishing more.” \xa0 Guilt stamps down writing spark and creativity. It pretty much guarantees that you will feel worse when you sit down to try again. You need a system that sets you up for success, so you feel good about sitting down to write, every time.\xa0 \xa0 2.\xa0Not All Writing Sessions are Created Equal. Have you ever sat down to write and the words just flowed out of you?\xa0 \xa0 At other times, have you sat down to write just one paragraph and ended up writing five words and deleting three over and over, so that by the end of your session you only had a sentence or two? \xa0 That’s because not all writing sessions are created equal.\xa0 \xa0 “You need to be setting yourself up to write during your ‘flow’ times, and to deliberately avoid writing at other times.” \xa0 If your writing system is simply to write every day, you might be hitting your flow time and you might not.\xa0 \xa0 When you don’t hit those “flow” times, but sit down and try to bang out a certain number of words anyway, you could be creating a negative feedback loop between you and your writing. You write, you feel bad, you write, you feel bad. Then you might stop. Or you might end up dreading to write. That’s not what we want!\xa0 \xa0 So what is a system that takes advantage of times you are in flow, and cuts out the guilt? I call it Tiger Time, a name I borrowed from entrepreneur Amy Porterfield. Tiger Time: What Is It and How Can It Help You? Using tiger time creates positive feedback loops around your writing. The tiger time system works well for those who struggle with guilt, because it gives you permission to not be writing all the time. It breaks writing up into smaller time slots and makes it a regular habit. And it can help you find your writing “spark” because you are writing during your most naturally energized and productive times. \xa0 “Write during your best, most focused, most high energy times, and do not write at other times.” \xa0 So how do you implement the tiger time system?\xa0 \xa0 1.\xa0Identify your “tiger time”. To find your tiger time, keep a journal for 5 days. About every hour, pull out your journal and reflect on how you’re feeling, then mark that hour with a color based on this key: \xa0  Green: the most energy, inspiration, and drive Blue: still energized but need to take more breaks to sustain momentum Orange: distracted, bored, tired, procrastinating Red: complete exhaustion, there’s no way you’re getting anything done  \xa0 If you don’t want to make up your own, you can download my free, ready-made journal here:\xa0 https://www.cathymazak.com/tigertime After the 5 days, look back over your color-coded journal. Blue times are your tiger times, and green times are your second best choice. \xa0 2.\xa0Block off 1-2 hour chunks of tiger time on your calendar. Don’t try to block off more than 1-2 hours at a time. If you can’t do 1-2 hours in a row, that’s fine. Try to do one hour during your tiger time and another hour during your second best time. If you can only do one hour, or 30 minutes, that’s fine too. The important thing is being realistic and consistent. \xa0 3. Align your writing blocks with your real life. Do you have obligations during those times? Do your best to reschedule. Maybe you teach during that time this semester, but you can change your schedule for next semester.\xa0 \xa0 Of course, there are things we can’t change, like having to drop our kids at school at a certain time. But I encourage you to be creative. Is there a parent who you could partner with to alternate school pick up and drop off? \xa0 Be diligent, and guard this time. Your tiger time is precious, so don’t let requests from other people or other aspects of your job crowd it out.\xa0 \xa0 If you can write every day and feel happy about it, then fantastic. But if trying to write every day doesn’t work for you, I encourage you to find your tiger time (cathymazak.com/tigertime for the free journal) and give my system a try.\xa0 \xa0 “Done is better than perfect, and consistent is better than perfect.” Connect with me: Website Facebook Group Facebook Page This episode was first published at cathymazak.com/episode2 | Are you an academic woman ready to amplify your voice in your field, say goodbye to burnout and overwhelm, and harness focused energy to reach your writing goals? You’re in the right place.\xa0 \xa0 In this introductory episode of the Academic Woman Amplified podcast, I’m sharing my story with you from my first love of writing to becoming a fully tenured professor while raising a growing family. I share lessons I’ve learned as an academic and a woman and how those experiences have shaped my life and career.\xa0 \xa0 On this podcast, we’ll talk about writing as the currency of your academic career, and I’ll share advice on how to manage all the moving parts each semester.\xa0 \xa0 My Beginnings as a Writer I have always loved writing and reading. From the time I was a little girl I’ve wanted to make my living writing, but didn’t know how I would do that. In college I followed my love of writing and teaching from being an ESL teacher to earning my PhD in English language learning. After that, I went on to become a tenured professor at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez. \xa0 Tenure Track, Pregnancy, and Learning How to Make it Work \xa0 As I was starting on my tenure track, I became pregnant. Having a baby during this process forced me to figure out who I wanted to be as an academic. I also had to figure out how to do things efficiently to accomplish the necessary writing and publishing.\xa0 \xa0 Because I had to navigate the pressures of new motherhood and academia, I was able to develop a writing system that wasn’t normally taught, but that worked for me. I developed a way to harness my best focused energy and use that for writing. \xa0 “Motherhood really forced me to figure out how to get the job done in a more efficient way.” \xa0 What I Want for You as an Academic Woman Due to uncertain circumstances at my University, I started to reflect on what I wanted to do with my life and career. I realized that colleagues often asked me how I was able to write and publish prolifically despite a heavy course load as a professor and the demands of family.\xa0 \xa0 Through these questions, I recognized that sharing my knowledge with other academic women was what I really wanted to do.\xa0 \xa0 “My favorite part of this work is talking to academic women about writing.” \xa0 For the past four years I have been coaching academic women. Because of my own experiences as a woman in the current academic culture, I am on a mission to help women like me to harness focused energy, create writing systems and pipelines that work without the burnout, write to secure resources, and amplify voices in their academic arenas.\xa0 \xa0 Connect with me: Website Facebook Group Facebook Page \xa0 This episode was first published at cathymazak.com/episode1 | Are you an academic woman who knows she needs to write more, but writing keeps falling to the bottom of the list? Do you feel overworked and overwhelmed and not sure if you can sustain this pace anymore? Academia was not built for women, but I believe it can change. As academic women, we have the power to create the life and career we want. This podcast is about helping you write and publish more, but it's also about much more than that.

Have you wondered why it can be so hard to stop bad habits and replace them with healthier ones? Have you wondered why you tend to repeat the same choices, attract the same kind of relationships, or sabotage your success? Well today you’re going to find out the answers to all of these questions and more with thanks to our guest and one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, Adam Lyons. Adam has become one of the world’s biggest authorities on brain chemistry, and how affects the decisions that we all make on a daily basis. And I have to say that this interview is absolutely fascinating because Adam is about to pull back the curtain and give you a behind the scenes look at the neuro-chemistry that’s driving our decisions and behaviors at a subconscious level. All of the decisions that you make, and actions that you take are a result of your brain’s desire for five different chemicals. We all know that smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are bad for your body over the long-term, and that they could even kill you, and yet people consume both on a regular basis? Why? Because that moment of consumption is triggering the release of a pleasure-based hormone like dopamine, which your brain is programed to pursue. So before you know it, you’ve cracked open that beer, and lit up that cigarette, even though you’ve told yourself that you’re going to stop. Maybe you constantly spend all of the money you make, and saving has always been a challenge for you. Well that’s because you’re brain is getting pleasure every time you buy something. It’s basically a little crack addict that constantly needs another hit of that chemical, and before you know it, you’re on Amazon once again, and hitting the buy button. Once you’re aware of why your brain does this, you can start to short-circuit and reprogram this pattern, which is the key to making better decisions in every area of your life. This is one of those episodes that can have a dramatic impact on your life moving forward to get ready to take some notes, and please help me welcome Adam Lyons.

Now if you aren’t familiar with Binance, they are the largest and fastest-growing crypto exchange in the world. They launched in July of 2017, and in 2018 alone, they produced over $440 million in profits despite the bear market. Well, today we’re joined by their former Head of Growth, Alan Kong. Now what really caught my attention was an email I received that lead to this interview. It turns out that Alan was a student of mine and had gone through List-Grow and 7-Figure Sales Presentations during the past few years, providing him with skills that helped him land his position at Binance. I was obviously thrilled to know I was connected in any way to their amazing success story, so I asked Alan to jump on the podcast to talk about what he’s up to today, and the industry at large. Well, it turns out that Binance recently purchased a crypto wallet company called Trust Wallet which has been developed by our second guest today, Viktor Radchenko, and Alan has been tasked with increasing the adoption and use of Trust Wallet to help people like you and I, keep our crypto safe. So today we’re going to take a deep dive into how crypto wallets work, how to keep your crypto safe from hackers, and what Alan and Viktor think is ahead for the industry at large. It’s a fascinating interview and make sure you head to www.TrustWallet.com to check out the app. Resources: TrustWallet.com Binance.com Music: Track: Arlow - How Do You Know [NCS Release] Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.

When I was young and naive’ one of my goals in life was to literally never have to deal with their of those situations. Well, guess what? Within the next few years, I found myself having to sue two different people for the first time in my life. Unfortunately, both of them had mental health problems. Their actions were unreasonable, their motives were to intentionally cause myself and my business harm, and they had no desire to find an actual remedy to the situation. They were not healthy people. They wanted conflict and that was their goal. So I called up some of my older and wiser mentors at the time, and they all said the same thing… Don’t pursue a lawsuit unless you absolutely must, but if you must, then go all in. So that’s what I did… It took almost a year in one case, and several years in the next, but I eventually won both cases. So why am I bringing all of this up? Because my goal of going through life without ever getting involved in a lawsuit, while putting myself in front of millions of people was naive. As someone who conducts business with other people and companies, you are going to run into conflict, and you are going to run into mentally unstable people no matter how well you run your business. It is an unfortunate part of life, so my goal today is to simply prepare you for that day which can be one of the most difficult experiences you’ll ever have. To help me do that, we’re joined by the attorney who helped me handle those cases, Mr. Peter Hoppenfeld. Today Peter’s going to make sure you have your legal basics in place and covered, and to give you some sound advice when it comes to doing business in a litigious world.

There is one thing that Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Sales Force, Mail Chimp, and countless other Billion dollar companies all have in common, and it’s what gives them so much leverage in the world. And the good news is that you can build your business using the same strategy when you ask yourself one single question that Brad and I will be discussing with you here today. Now if you aren’t familiar with Brad, he’s the Found of LightSpeedVT. LightSpeedVT is an innovative e-learning platform that’s used by leaders like Daymond John, Grant Cardone, Top Chef, The World Series of Poker, and the UFC. And what makes LightSpeedVt different, is that their focus is on the use of gamification to incentive the consumption and retention of your content, by your customers. At the end of the day, if you’re selling education, and if you really want to make an impact on your customers, they have to consume and retain your content. LightSpeed has the technology that enables you to do exactly that. Now Brad’s core skillset also happens to be in sales. He provides some of the best sales training on the internet today, which is what we had originally planned to discuss during this interview, but as you’ll hear, the conversation quickly turned to the trials and tribulations that he went through, in order to build Lightspeed into the successful business that it is today. Resources: LightspeedVT Music: Music by: RudeLies Song: Down Licensed under a Creative Commons License | Alright, so last week I posted what was easily the most detailed and vulnerable interview of my life where I walked you guys through my past year recovering from a mysterious traumatic brain injury, by taking advantage of all kinds of alternative therapies like EMDR, psychedelics, Katmine, neuro-bio feedback, and many more. Well during that interview, I also mentioned that a friend of mine taught me a mental exercise that literally helped save my life when nothing else was working. After a year of living with a body that was stuck in fight or flight… That was producing cortisol and adrenaline 24/7, I jumped on a call with today’s guest, Blair Dunkley. On that call, Blair walked me through a visualization technique that allows you to literally pull fear, anxiety, frustration, and depression right out of your body, providing you instant relief. I know it sounds a little crazy, but this simple mental exercise is what worked when everything else failed. Within 24 hours of using it, my cortisol stopped, the adrenaline stopped, and my body started to recover for the very first time in almost a year. Well, today Blair is going to share this technique with you so you can use it in your life. If you or a friend of yours is stuck in fear, if you are dealing with constant anxiety, stress, depression or trauma of any kind, this simple mental exercise could dramatically change your life as it did for me. Blair is a master when it comes to helping people rewire their mind to deal with a specific problem, or to help them break through to new levels of performance. This is one of the single most valuable interviews we’ve ever produced here, so get ready to take some notes, and please help me welcome, Blair Dunkley.

If you’ve been a part of my audience for any time at all, you are probably aware that I suffered a mysterious brain injury in June of 2018 that almost killed me. I haven’t really shared anything more than that over the past 12 months for two reasons… First, we had no idea what happened, and I didn’t want to talk about it until we did because that’s really just not very helpful to anyone. And second, I wanted to wait until there was some kind of happy ending to this situation so that I could bring it around full circle and share what I learned from it. Well, thankfully I’m happy to say that we did figure out what took place about 3 months ago, and I have been getting better ever since. While I’m still not sleeping normally just yet, my brain is back online. I can think, I can speak, and my energy levels have started to return. And I’ll just say this… The culprit was shocking. This whole mess was caused by a household toxin that’s in your home right now. It’s something that you’re breathing every day, and whether or not it affects you is simply a matter of your level of exposure. If you have any friends or family members with a chronic or undiagnosed illness, they could definitely be suffering from the same thing, so please share this with them so they can get tested asap. Now during the past year, I’ve always said that when I’m ready to tell this story, I wanted to do it around a table with the people who helped me through it, which is exactly what we did. So today I’m joined by my friend Aubrey Marcus who hosted this interview, along with Krisstina Wise, and my physician, Dr. Ann Shippy. We held this group discussion at Aubrey’s office, and you can watch the entire interview on video at MikeDillard.com/heal While this situation has been the single biggest challenge of my life, it has also been the most rewarding because of the personal work and transformation that it forced me to do, including all kinds of psychedelic medicine which we’ll be talking about today. This is one hell of a story, and this is definitely the most personal interview I’ve ever given, so thank you for your support during this past year, and I’m incredibly grateful that I’m back to work so I can help you guys and serve you in any way that I can. Without further ado, let’s dive in… Resources: AnnShippyMD.com ChooseMuse.com Curable: How an Unlikely Group of Radical Innovators is Trying to Transform our Health Care System Music: Music by: Ascence Song: About You Licensed under a Creative Commons License \xa0 | I have to say that I truly love interviews like the one we have today with Dr. Jason Wersland. Almost every great business success story has one thing in common… A single individual with a problem they couldn’t find a solution for, and the drive to go create one. It’s where garages are turned into workshops, and notepads into diaries of scratched out ideas and circled moments of eureka. And this is literally the story arch that Jason found himself in 2007 after a motorcycle accident. A chiropractor by profession, Jason’s pain from his injuries inspired him to invent a new kind of physical therapy for the body using nothing more than a few power tools from Home Depot, and his knowledge of biomechanics. A year later, he’d invented a completely new category of physical therapy product he called the Theragun. Today, Theragun’s are used by countless doctors and athletes around the world, and you are about to get the behind the scenes story of how it was invented, developed, and turned into a global success story. And speaking of health, make sure you keep an eye out for next week’s episode which will be one of the most important I’ve ever recorded. After suffering a mysterious brain injury 14 months ago that almost took me out, we finally found the cause, and I’m happy to say that I’m on the mend. What we discovered is going to be pretty shocking. In fact, you are very likely surrounded by the toxin that made me sick right now as you listen to this. My friend Aubrey Marcus will be hosting the interview, and we’ll be joined by my doctor as well, as I publically fill you in on the most challenging, and rewarding adventures of my life for the very first time. Now without further ado, please welcome Dr. Jason Wersland.

Everything, from cleaning and servicing the homes, to wowing his guests, is outsourced. \xa0 He can literally run his empire from his cell phone on a beach, and today he’s going to share the entire strategy with you. \xa0 If you’re currently looking for a way to replace your income, and potentially build a massive income stream, this is the single best opportunity to do so, that I’ve seen in years. | Today’s intro is going to be short and sweet… This week we’re joined my good friend and local Facebook advertising expert, Curt Maly. Facebook’s ad platform has seen some dramatic changes over the past two years, and what used to work in the past, isn’t working as well today. So Curt is here to bring you up to speed on what’s different, and what’s working the best today if you want to start advertising there, as well as Instagram. Mastering paid ads is the fastest way to scaling your business to 7 or 8 figures, so make sure this is at the top of your priority list.

In other words, our biggest challenges in life can be turned into an opportunity to grow, and then to give, if we’re brave enough to face them head-on and conquer them. Well, the gentleman you’re about to meet today is one of the most incredible living examples of this philosophy that I’ve ever met. His name is Akshay Nanavati and his story is so amazing that I’m not even going to give you a preview of what’s to come in today’s episode because I don’t want to ruin it for you. But the fact that the Dali Lama wrote the forward to his book, should tell you all you need to know about this man’s challenges in life, and what he’s turned them into.

In addition to causing man-boobs and wilting your erections… …this dastardly villain is also responsible for:  Fat Gains Depression Hormonal Disruption Immune Dysfunction Blood Clotting Cancer Infertility  Holy Hell. WTF Are Estrogenics? Estrogenics are external estrogen sources that - once consumed, applied to our skins, or inhaled – can throw our hormones way out of whack. According to Dr. Anthony Jay, author of Estrogeneration: How Estrogenics are Making You Fat, Sick and Infertile, and today’s guest, we as a society are swimming in external estrogen sources. They can be found in our foods, cleaning products, plastics and sunscreens…just to name a few. The long-term effects of swimming in a sea of estrogenics: obesity, sickness and declining dick health. In this Episode  Dr. Jay’s top 10 list of Estrogenic Sources to Avoid The two foods every man should avoid (soy is one, but the other is 3 times as loaded with estrogenics) Why you should throw out all of your sunscreens and use 3 alternatives The troubling trend of testosterone decline at the same time as obesity incline Why you should get your testosterone checked annually Why you should not rely on America’s FDA standards and take command of your own purchasing decisions  Resources: Dr. Jay’s Book on Amazon: Estrogeneration Dr. Jay’s YouTube Channel: Chagrin & Tonic Dr. Jay’s DNA Consulting: DNA Consulting Products that Dr. Jay Uses: “What I Use” Estrogenic Avoidance Plans: Click Here The Top 10 List of Daily Estrogenics: Click Here | If you’re looking for wisdom or clarity on any of life’s mysteries, this is not your episode. But if you’re down for getting to know me and Bryan a little better, here’s your chance. We decided to open up our kimonos with a series of 20 cheeky and provocative questions. Here’s a flavor for some of them:  My first sexual experience included… A failure I still haven’t gotten over is… My secret male grooming habit is… The longest I’ve gone without showering is… The woman who’s had the biggest influence on me not named Mom/Sister…  If you’d like to download this list of 20 questions for yourself, go for it: https://www.doinnerwork.com/20questions | Nir Eyal is the author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller Hooked: How to Build Habit Forming Technology…which is found on the bookshelves of tech leaders at Facebook, Google, PayPal and Slack. The MIT Review called him the Prophet of Habit Forming Tech. Nir runs a popular productivity blog at www.NirAndFar.com, has successfully built and sold two businesses and was also a teacher at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. His life’s work sits at the intersection of psychology, technology and business. I interviewed Nir about his brand new book Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life which has a front cover endorsement from Mark Manson, he of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck fame. If Nir’s first book Hooked was a roadmap for Silicon Valley companies to build habit forming technologies… …Indistractable is a roadmap for us consumers to take back command of our attention and focus from said habit forming technologies. I had a chance to visit Nir’s apartment in Manhattan, which is a stunning duplex, by the way, and we conducted the interview in what he calls his “moon room.” On the walls are a dozen or so framed photos of the moon taken from the 1970s. He has them on the wall for inspiration – this is the room where dreams up “moonshots,” the big hairy audacious ideas. I loved the intentionality he designed into his environment. As you’ll hear in the podcast and find out if you pick up the book, Nir is incredibly well researched and relies heavily on science and systems. Systems, he’ll tell you, are what saves him from being downright lazy and obese. I was shocked to learn that the lean man sitting in front of me was once clinically obese…so clearly his systems are working for him. And yet, at times I found myself wondering if there wasn’t a certain rigidity to his weighting of left-brained, systematic, everything must rely on science way of thinking. For example, Nir will tell you that he time blocks every single minute of his days. \u2028He’s one of the few people I’ve interviewed who regularly practiced meditation who said it just didn’t work for him…which you’ll hear about in this episode. So it’ll be up for you to decide how far you choose to take the 4 step protocol he outlines for how to live a life Indistractable.

When a woman comes to you with what sounds like a problem, it can be difficult to know: a) Is she asking me to help solve it? b) Is she asking me to listen? Bryan and I have coached frustrated and exasperated men who have gone into “fix it mode” and been on the receiving end of these all-time classics: “You’re not hearing me.” “I just want you to listen.” “Why are you always telling me what to do??” Our special guest today, Blaire Lindsay, a mentor and intimacy coach to women gives one simple way of clearing it all up. THE ONE QUESTION THAT’LL HEAD OFF HOURS OF CONFUSION AND CONFLICT AT THE PASS For situations when Blaire is bringing something of importance or emotionally charged to husband Chris, they’ve instituted a single, simple question that she refers to as a “lift raft.” Chris will ask:  “Do you need empathy, or strategy right now?” \xa0 Boom. The elegant simplicity of this question does a few things:  Chris now knows whether Blaire needs him to listen, needs him to help fix, or both This question also causes Blaire to pause and get clear on what she truly wants and needs from Chris Chris demonstrates his ability to guide and provide a gentle structure for Blaire, which deepens her trust and feelings of safety.  Fellas, try this out and let us know how it’s working. ALSO IN THIS EPISODE Blaire Lindsay primarily coaches two types of women:  The “always doing” woman whose heading towards burnout (or already there) The woman who doesn’t have direction and is frozen, stuck  Fellas, if either of these sounds like an important woman in your life, this episode has some serious insights for you:  How to cultivate DEEP LISTENING that women crave from men Understanding a woman’s AROUSAL TRAJECTORY, how it’s different than ours, and how to learn to dance with your partner’s unique style Blaire answers “WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE AFTER GIVING BIRTH?” Many new fathers want to know what happened to his partner’s sex drive and why her focus on him dwindles…and what to do about it. How to express desire to a woman in a NON-NEEDY, non-entitled way…that’ll magnetize her towards you. Ideas to float to your partner to allow her to increase her relationship with PLEASURE (in case this isn’t obvious for you: the more your partner can find pleasure for herself, the more pleasure will roll off to you)  Blaire’s Website: https://blaire-lindsay.com Blaire’s Instagram: @BlaireLindsay Blaire’s e-Book: Essential Orgasm | This powerful emotion: ANGER.\xa0 Let’s start in the most responsible place: The man who is controlled by his anger… who is cynical, judgmental and cuts down others… who explodes on everything around him… who leaves destruction in his wake… …he is a threat to society. That is not the man we’re talking about. There’s another type of man who’s dysfunctional relationship with anger becomes a threat to himself: The man who thinks he has no anger at all. Anger is one of the most powerful and potent sources of energy creation in a man’s life. 3 REASONS WHY MEN AVOID ANGER Do any of these sound like beliefs of yours?  “I don’t have anger/I’m all good/why is this relevant?” “Anger is a weakness, and it should be avoided.” “I’m ashamed of what I’ve done/said when I’ve been angry in the past.”  This episode is for you.  7 WAYS OF THE SOFT MAN Too many men don’t tap anger, deny they have anger, think that having anger is wrong…and over time they end up soft.  Heavily conflict avoidant; uses “I don’t let it get to me” as a wall for having to fully feel the uncomfortable emotion Unwillingness to establish, preserve and fight for personal boundaries Absence of killer instinct that others can depend on during tough times Growing sense of tiredness and lethargy from swallowing a lifetime of shit sandwiches Bypassing feelings of anger to race towards the “virtue of compassion” Playing small, conservative games in work, relationships and life Smiles on the outside, growing resentment, cynicism and helplessness on the inside   IF YOU GET ANGER RIGHT: THE BENEFITS Learning how to allow, experience and harness anger leads to these benefits:  Power and control (vital life force) Trust from those you lead, as well as the women in your life Sexual polarity and magnetism with your feminine partner Unleashed creativity and genuine self-expression Confidence to step towards bigger, bolder situations \u2028 TOO MANY MEN IN THE ANGER EXTREMES  When it comes to anger, I see too many men operating at the extremes: 1. SOFT EXTREME:  Denies and suppresses anger because “anger is bad” Tells himself and others that he doesn’t have anger He avoids confrontation and allows his boundaries to be infringed upon Tells himself he’s “above it,” which is really a defense mechanism for avoiding the discomfort of confrontation His softness erodes trust from the people he leads and the women in his life  2. SCARY EXTREME:  Allows anger to control him… Knee jerk explosiveness OR Eats shit sandwiches until he hits his tipping point and erupts Says and does things he regrets His anger infects everyone around him, leaving a heavy, dark cloud in the environments in which he operates   SEXY ANGER VS. UNSEXY ANGER: WHAT WOMEN ARE SAYING Here are real quotes from the women in our community who weighed in on the question: “When is anger unsexy…and when is it sexy?” UNSEXY ANGER: “Anger that is meant to hurt or be destructive is not sexy. Being angry and letting that feeling bleed on everyone around you, being out of control, not sexy.” - Lindsey J  SEXY ANGER: “Anger can be very sexy! It gets a bum rap and labeled as a “negative emotion” but I posit that it is an amazingly generative and creative and passionate emotion when felt, allowed, safely experienced and consciously expressed.\xa0 For my man, and for men in general, the ferocity and passion of anger can be so very sexy and direct and decisive and powerful. It simply means a boundary has been crossed and that is unacceptable to me. How you choose to express is depends on your level of inner work, resilience, awareness, and willingness to feel!!!”\xa0 - Talitha S  THREE WAYS ANGER COMES OUT What I learned from The ManKind Project retreat was that anger, no matter how good we think we are at controlling, always comes out in one of these three directions:  At the source: Via harnessed emotion (constructive and resourceful) or unhinged emotion (fits of blind rage) Sideways: Via sarcasm, passive aggressiveness, chronic cynicism Turned Inward: Via negative self talk (ie “how the hell could you do that/let that happen?”)   IN THIS EPISODE  Dominick’s journey from 35 years of anger denial to harnessing anger, unleashing the most powerful 5 years of his life The 3 ways anger comes out The 3 ways men deny anger The consequences of a life lived denying anger SEXY ANGER vs UNSEXY ANGER: Women weigh in 7 thought provoking quotes about anger from the world’s greatest writers and leaders (Aristotle, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou, Mark Twain) Practices to allow anger, harness it and express it in a powerful, healthy way  | Without a doubt, gentlemen, these are confusing times when it comes to the “new rules” of dating and courting women. One of readers, Linda M., concurs: “I’ve been on dates where men have said they are scared to open the door for women or pick up the bill because they’ve been told off for doing so previously. I like both of these things done for me so I’m disappointed when a man doesn’t demonstrate what I classify as chivalry.” \xa0 Bryan and I too often find ourselves tongue tied, stuck in unclear situations, and needing to clear up misunderstandings when something we’ve said didn’t land the way we intended. But this recurring complaint from men is where we lay the smack down: “I can’t compliment a woman anymore.” It’s high time to euthanize this weak expression of helplessness and exasperation. \xa0 Men, You Are Better Than That When a man says “I can’t even compliment a woman anymore,” he’s revealing that his attempts to compliment are less a genuine expression of praise or admiration with no expectation of return… …and more a self-serving act to extract something of desire from his target. And when that doesn’t happen, it’s followed by a temper tantrum turned “I’m taking my ball and going home,” self-ejection from the game. I’ve never wanted that guy on my team. Why would any woman? \xa0 The 4 Problems of Your “Compliment Hammer” Men often bring a Compliment Hammer to every situation, treating each unique woman – and each unique context – like a standard issue nail. Here are the 4 key problems you’re not considering with respect to paying a compliment: \xa0  Your compliment is oblivious to CONTEXT You’re only complimenting the PHYSICAL APPEARENCE You think your INTENTION is more important than the IMPACT on the other person You expect a black-and-white UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTABLE set of guidelines that applies to 4 billion unique women  \xa0 In today’s podcast, we give a story-gone-wrong from each of these situations, as well as the antidote. \xa0 Women Will Happily Give You Their Trust and Affection (if you deserve it…) Here are 4 things the women in our community made abundantly clear:  Yes, women very much still want compliments (as do men). Women want you to demonstrate you’ve considered their interests, their safety and the context – not just your own agenda – before thrusting an expectant compliment upon them. Women will place a disproportionate amount of trust, affection and connection to the man (men) who has attuned his senses to her unique needs, desires and fears. Women want a man who is willing to learn and handle potentially difficult feedback without collapsing (anger, shutting down, running away, giving up).  \xa0 In other words, if you’re coming from a place of admiration, respect, and wanting to understand THIS unique woman in front of you… …the greater the likelihood your compliment (and you as a man) will be received. \xa0 Quotes from the Women in Our Community \xa0 Linda M: “I have often felt uncomfortable when receiving a compliment because the CONTEXT felt inappropriate.\xa0 On one hand I do feel men should take some time to consider what they say and how they say it.\xa0 On another I feel sorry for men because it is a sensitive time and women are more expressed about what they are uncomfortable with.\xa0  This challenge extends far beyond just giving compliments. I’ve been on dates where men have said they are scared to open the door for women or pick up the bill because they’ve been told off for doing so previously. I like both of these things done for me so I’m disappointed when a man doesn’t demonstrate what I class as chivalry.\xa0  I think if men approach every situation with curiosity they will develop the ability to understand the boundaries of the individuals they interact with and can adapt their approach accordingly.” \xa0 Kara A. “I had a CEO comment on a Private Message on Linked In that my photos looked hot. I had known him for years, had placed him in his previous role (Kara is an executive recruiter) – I have never been able to work with him since\xa0that word from him permanently changed everything.” \xa0 Tara T. “At work, men don\'t need to talk about women\'s appearances. Unless you two are very close friends and she brings it up, just don\'t do it.\xa0 I totally see how men might feel worried about everything they say, but it\'s just a new paradigm.\xa0 Women have been mincing their words forever in other ways for men (trying to seem less direct, less assertive, less demanding, etc.) so I think generally we\'re more used to obsessing about what we say.\xa0 The bottom line though is that if something doesn\'t land well, which is okay because everyone makes mistakes, a quick "oh shoot, I\'m so sorry, I didn\'t mean to make you uncomfortable; I should\'ve been more mindful of how I said that." will quickly fix it. We\'re all in this together. \xa0 \xa0 Melissa R.\xa0 “If he is your boss, authority, your pay check is dependent upon this man, etc. a compliment said with a positive intent may or may not be received well because of the power factor.\xa0 I think it’s important we don’t develop any “rules” around when a man should or shouldn’t share a genuine compliment.  Maybe it’s more about as a man is your compliment to a woman genuine, non-sexual, non-wanting anything in return... is the intention truly admiration and genuine authentic sharing? Or is there an agenda? Is there anything behind the compliment conscious or unconscious? Do you want something from this woman behind your compliment? I think we need to start talking about this with men and us women need to start understanding more of what invokes our fears. Some ate very instinctual and the more I understand them the safer I would feel.  A world with less compliments from men to women will not make more women feel safe.” \xa0 \xa0 Michelle N. “Compliments that work for me have more to do with my talents, personality or skills. If what I am wearing is well done, complementing on how the color or style suits me, without reference to whatever body part it may accentuate, without looking me up and down, first, and DO NOT comment on my weight.” \xa0 | You guys are still really digging the 11 ideas for your morning routine podcast. We love hearing your success stories from implementing the techniques we shared as well as your follow up questions. Here’s one of the most persistent questions: “What do I do about my evening routine (it’s a disaster!)” If your evening routine is a disaster – and as you’ll hear in this podcast, Bryan’s is an unmitigated disaster – then your morning will suffer, as will the rest of your day. Your morning and evening routines are the bookends of your day. They determine the quality of the 16, 17, 18 waking hours in between. Let’s tighten that shit up. In This Episode:  An unforgiving inventory of Bryan’s disaster of an evening routine Dominick’s 3 stages of his evening routine 1. Shut down today 2. Set up tomorrow 3. Wind it down for sleep Best Sleep Practices/Tools 1. Room Temperature at 68 degrees 2. Chilipad Bed Cooling Technology 3. Swannies Blue Blocking Night Glasses 4. Gravity Weighted Blanket 5. Melatonin 3mg \xa0   I also ask you the following questions: 1. Do you consciously choose when to go to sleep, or do you pass out? 2. Do you have a regular window (75% of the time) when you go to sleep (ie between 9:00-10:30pm)? 3. Do you look at your calendar for the next day sometime in the last 2-3 hours before bed? 4. What’s the very last thing you do before you turn the lights out? 5. Do you reflect on the day you just had (wins, losses, gratitudes, insights)? 6. Do you set an intention/goals for the next day? 7. Do you use your cell phone as your alarm clock? 8. Most nights, when is your last meal/snack. 9. How much time do you spend in bed…before you fall asleep? (ie get into bed at 10:00pm but look at phone until 11:15-midnight). 10. Do you take sleeping medication?', 'chan_desc': 'Dominick & Bryan are your guides for a High-Achieving Man’s Journey to Personal Development. They confront the topics most men never speak about openly but secretly struggle with: - Your Purpose: Achieving external success, yet feeling internally unfulfilled - Your Edge: Always doing many things yet never feeling fully alive    - Your Sex Life: Stuck in a cycle of lackluster, destructive and/or secretive sexual behaviors The Man Amongst Men designs his life with intentionality, plays bigger games and leads those around him to higher ground.

Since the early 1980s she has researched the mind-brain connection, the nature of mental health, and the formation of memory. She was one of the first in her field to study how the brain can change (neuroplasticity) with directed mind input. During her years in clinical practice and her work with thousands of underprivileged teachers and students in her home country of South Africa and in the USA, she developed her theory (called the Geodesic Information Processing theory) of how we think, build memory, and learn, into tools and processes that have transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), learning disabilities (ADD, ADHD), autism, dementias and mental ill-health issues like anxiety and depression. She has helped hundreds of thousands of students and adults learn how to use their mind to detox and grow their brain to succeed in every area of their lives, including school, university, and the workplace.Dr. Leaf is also the bestselling author of Switch on Your Brain, Think Learn Succeed, Think and Eat Yourself Smart, and many more. She teaches at academic, medical and neuroscience conferences, churches, and to various audiences around the world. Dr. Leaf is also involved in the global ECHO movement, which trains physicians worldwide on the mind-brain-body connection, mental health and how to avoid physician burnout. She runs the “Integrated Mind Network”, which is a panel of top neurosurgeons, neurologists, MD\'s, OBGYN\'s, endocrinologists, MD’s, and neuroscientists with whom she consults with, and does research and clinical trials. She is also part of a mental health initiative in Washington, DC. Dr. Leaf is currently conducting clinical trials using the 5-step program she developed while in private practice to further demonstrate the effectiveness of mind-directed techniques to help relieve mental ill-health problems such as anxiety, depression and intrusive thoughts. The primary aim of these trials is to make mental health care more affordable, applicable, and accessible worldwide, and to reduce the stigma around mental health.- https://drleaf.com/Please do NOT hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn, Instagram, or via email mark@vudream.comLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-metry/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/markmetry/Twitter - https://twitter.com/markymetryMedium - https://medium.com/@markymetryFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/Humans.2.0.PodcastMark Metry  - https://www.markmetry.com/Humans 2.0 Twitter - https://twitter.com/Humans2Podcast | Julian Guthrie is one of the nation\'s most respected journalists, an international best-selling author, and an inspirational speaker represented by Innovative Entertainment.

She looks at stories as her "little pieces of immortality."n Alpha Girls, award-winning journalist Julian Guthrie takes readers behind the closed doors of venture capital, an industry that transforms economies and shapes how we live. We follow the lives and careers of four women who were largely written out of history - until now.Magdalena Yesil, who arrived in America from Turkey with $43 to her name, would go on to receive her electrical engineering degree from Stanford, found some of the first companies to commercialize internet access, and help Marc Benioff build Salesforce. Mary Jane Elmore went from the corn fields of Indiana to Stanford and on to the storied venture capital firm IVP - where she was one of the first women in the U.S. to make partner - only to be pulled back from the glass ceiling by expectations at home. Theresia Gouw, an overachieving first-generation Asian American from a working-class town, dominated the foosball tables at Brown (she would later reluctantly let Sergey Brin win to help Accel Partners court Google), before she helped land and build companies including Facebook, Trulia, Imperva, and ForeScout. Sonja Hoel, a Southerner who became the first woman investing partner at white-glove Menlo Ventures, invested in McAfee, Hotmail, Acme Packet, and F5 Networks. As her star was still rising at Menlo, a personal crisis would turn her into an activist overnight, inspiring her to found an all-women\'s investment group and a national nonprofit for girls.These women, juggling work and family, shaped the tech landscape we know today while overcoming unequal pay, actual punches, betrayals, and the sexist attitudes prevalent in Silicon Valley and in male-dominated industries everywhere. Despite the setbacks, they would rise again to rewrite the rules for an industry they love.

Perhaps you are constantly putting out fires, running on autopilot, all the while watching shit pile up that you swore you were going to handle two weeks ago. Ever find yourself volunteering for an extra project or an extra whateverthefuck that ends up leaving you feeling both obligated\xa0and\xa0stress to the max? Or perhaps your method of staying on top of things is a system of piles and stacks, sticky notes and memos, without a solid understanding of what really needs attention. So, you just constantly put out fires. And more fires. Until you, yourself, burn the fuck out. Sound familiar? If you are used to constant overwhelm and doing everything your god-dammed self, it’s likely that you could use a bit of knowledge on good ol’ time management. It’s time to break out of the rat race that leaves you feeling constantly behind, exhausted, and frazzled.

Even though it’s not quite as popular as it was a handful of years ago, I find that people are still really interested in the Law of Attraction and what it\xa0really\xa0takes to actually manifest shit in your life. I mean… do you just state what you want and magically the Universe just drops it at your doorstep? Um, obviously not. If that was how it worked we would all be sporting some fabulous Jimmy Choos, chillin’ at a Beyonce concert(s), having killer spouses (and sex), and only amazing-ass friendships. So, just\xa0deciding\xa0what you want to manifest is only a small piece of the manifestation puzzle. In this episode, I share my 5-step system to manifesting damn-near anything you desire. No really. But, guess what? It’s going to take action. And planning and willingness and commitment. And maybe even some tough choices. But honey, you DO have the pow-ah to create some serious magic. #trust This pod explores:  What the universe needs to hear from you when you declare your desired goal How to identify the clutter you need to eliminate to make space for what you\xa0really\xa0want What it means to get into “inspired action” and why this is CRUCIAL to making shit happen Why dismissing compliments and/or support from others may be seriously stifling your manifestation  FREE WORKSHEETS + SCREENSAVERS!  GRAB YOURS BELOW!  Did you grab your free cheat-sheet that accompanies this episode? Get on it, Babycakes! Here’s the deal: our brain takes things\xa0waaaaay\xa0more seriously when we get out of our heads and get our thoughts/commitments out on paper. It’s like, science. So, OF COURSE I want you to make some serious changes and start #manifesting, so be sure you have your Pod #311 worksheets with you while you (re) listen to this pod so you can get into some serious action. Trust… if you just listen and don’t\xa0DO, you’re not going to manifest shit. Plus, I’ve custom-made you some dope-ass screensavers in multiple sizes to help you cement what you are learning. Hello!

And then your inner voice tells you that you are horribly unqualified and everyone is going to find you out. You enter a super healthy relationship with an awesome partner. And then your inner voice tells you how damaged you are, why you aren’t good enough, and why it’s all going to come crashing down in a blazing inferno. You finally finish that graduate degree. And then your inner voice tells you how you were the slowest in the class, probably won’t get hired, and should probably just try to get your old job back. Sound familiar? If so, you are likely battling a lovely little issue we (in the personal growth world)\xa0 like to call The Imposter Syndrome. The idea that, in spite of your success or accomplishment, you are somehow not good enough, a total fraud, and have fooled everyone who will surely soon find you out. In this week’s episode, I answer a listener’s buring Q about what to do when you find yourself beating yourself up about being an imposter in your career, relationship, as a parent, or whatever. You’ll learn what to do with those pesky thoughts, how to acknowledge yourself (without being a cocky asshole), and how to own your god-damned brilliance (even if that terrifies you).

Totally”? Or how ‘bout this one: You know you need to address something with your bestie by you keep thinking, “Am I overreacting? Am I being dramatic? I feel like I should say something, but I’m so nervous!” Or maybe your boss walks into your office and asks for another report to be completed and instead of saying “I don’t think I can add one more thing to my plate”, you just verbally list out a litany of things that you have to accomplish, hoping that she’ll magically get your drift. Real talk. No one teaches us how to articulate our thoughts, feelings, needs, and opinions in an effective manner. We stumble around thinking we can’t ever let anyone down and god forbid we actually say “No”! So we learn to “sweep things under the rug” and tell ourselves that it’s not that serious until we erupt like a god-damned volcano.

Madelyn enjoyed this episode so much that we wanted to share it with all of you. Madelyn and Sam discuss what it means to feel safe to be in your feminine essence as a modern-day woman. They discuss why receiving help can be so hard and how mainstream society plays a huge part in this struggle. They also talk about how to let go of perfection and soften your edges physically (and energetically) to begin to create change and a deeper connection to yourself. It\'s a juicy episode that they both enjoyed so much that they kinda forgot they were recording.Show notes: Candor is a company fiercely devoted to being radically honest. Madelyn\'s go-to morning beverage is their nootropic Matcha Coconut drink: it warms up her spirit and provides sustainable energy throughout her entire workday. Go to www.choosecandor.com/maddy\xa0and use code\xa0"MADDY10" for 10% off your next order. Masculine and feminine polarity work and intimacy offers you the depth of relationships and friendships that is possible. “To really feel safe in your feminine, you have to be really close to your masculine.” How to set goals that are nourishing and feminine. Madelyn was raised to be aggressive and driven and why she’s grateful for that.\xa0 "It is such a gift to be seen as weak." The damage that comes from “doing it all.” Madelyn’s disconnection from her feminine and how she reclaimed it. Her need for perfection, wanting to be "one of the guys," and her toxic masculinity.

Born in rural Humboldt County, California, some of her earliest childhood memories were of making friends with the flowers and trees growing in the vacant lots behind her house, and sitting in her dad’s vegetable garden.Most of Corinna’s adult life was spent working in social services and community-based non-profits, with gardening and cannabis jobs on the side. In her mid-twenties, she picked up her first tarot deck and started learning by reading for others and herself. Corinna also spent more than 3 years in Latin America, including more than 2 years living in Oaxaca city working as an ESL teacher, and lived a short while in Barcelona studying Global Health at the University. In 2015 she ended up back in Humboldt County, working in the health care system and attained her master’s degree in Applied Anthropology, all the while cultivating more than 30 medicinal plants in her backyard- prompting her to start making herbal medicine to give to friends and community membersIn early 2018, Corinna Rosella made rise up! good witch her full-time job.

Our responsibility for acknowledging our history, especially in the spiritual community. “We are all in a deep learning process of how to be better.” The reality of having “the racial conversation” in order to grow. The meme background that Corinna created: “Maybe you manifested it, or maybe it’s white privilege.” “It is important that we all understand that pretty much none of us are self-made.”\xa0 Corinna Rosella’s stance on manifestation. Being able to let go of the ownership of something and knowing that all ideas pass through us. Why it\'s okay to feel uncomfortable talking about white privilege. How to educate ourselves on the current news, but not get wrapped into the negativity. “In general, if something doesn\'t affect us, that\'s our privilege. We have the privilege to ignore it. And if we want to see systemic change, if we want to see collective healing, what we have to do is open our eyes.” When to speak up and when to listen. Making sure that the full moon circles in practices are not contributing harm to communities of color or indigenous cultures. The importance of using plants from our own lineage. White sage and palo santo are being over-harvested.\xa0 The word “tribe, gypsy, spirit animal” should not be used by white people—it’s not respectful.

In this powerful episode, Embodiment teachers Madelyn Moon and Jamie Wollrab discuss real examples of how embodying archetypes (shadows) will change your life— as well as your family, your business, your trauma and how you feel about yourself.\xa0Madelyn and Jamie offer their profound insight into the work they\'ve done to heal their shadows/trauma by embracing the part of themselves that they didn\'t want others to see. "Whatever is touched and experienced fully, dissolves." Once we fully feel into our shadows—the bitch, the slut, the drama queen, etc, they break apart and dissolve. Madelyn and Jamie explain the process they\'ll be leading at the retreat in November to embody your shadows to unlock greater freedom, self-expression, love and empowerment. Through chakra clearing, vocal work, embodiment and polarity work, you\'ll leave the event forever beautifully changed.Show notes: “Until we bring the unconscious mind into the conscious mind, it will rule our lives and we will call it fate.”\xa0 The embodying archetype process of giving our inner critic a voice so it doesn’t run/ruin our lives.

When we embrace our flaws, it actually augments the light side of us. What is the shadow? The metaphor of the shadow and a castle to help you understand this work. The bitch and slut archetypes and why they aren\'t bad.\xa0 Reclaiming your inner bitch and slut. “We are all wounded healers.” The embodiment process of embracing parts of you that you don’t want others to see.

Maddy’s experience with her twin flame. “We heal through connection; we don’t heal through isolation.” Problems arise when we start to put hierarchy above the other types of relationships. Not everyone has a twin flame and not everyone meets their twin flames in this lifetime. For some people, it’s not necessary for them to meet their twin flame. We shouldn’t expect a certain behavior based on the relationship label we put on them. “It’s so dangerous to think that there\'s one person to complete you.” Twin flames are not here to make you feel terrible—twin flames should still make you feel emotionally safe.Connect with Cheryl: Website Facebook Twitter Instagram[Tweet ""Twin flames are here for lessons and soul mates are here for blessings." #mindbodymusings"]COACHING: receive personalized, 1:1 coaching from Maddy Moon to create your own feminine and masculine embodiment.

You\'re reading, listening to podcasts, joining programs and yet everything is staying relatively the same? This episode I go over a personal experience of lack of boundaries and how I got back into alignment. And some of the reasons women give away their power and energy without even knowing it. We\'re only allotted a certain amount of energy per day. Where are you spending your energy doing things that aren\'t serving your highest good? Because we always have control in where we spend our energy. We have to take 100% responsibility of where we are in our lives vs where we want to be. Run your day and not allow the day to run YOU. Don\'t go with the flow, BE the flow.

If you want to upgrade your life you have to let go of the energy that isn\'t serving you.

This is a podcast I was recently interviewed on and we went DEEP into the mind and body connection and why this is so important to raising your vibration.

Do you have set values and boundaries specific to YOU and what you believe in and the direction you want your life to take? A standard is something that doesn\'t fluctuate based off of how you feel or your situation. They are values you hold for yourself and others. Nothing screams confidence like a woman who knows who she is, knows what her values are and won\'t settle.

It\'s also detrimental to your growth process as you can\'t heal what you don\'t feel, and you can\'t change what you aren\'t willing to see.

By exposing his own struggle with a panic disorder in A LIBERATED MIND: How to Pivot Toward What Matters (Avery/Penguin Random House), Dr. Hayes reveals: Normal, successful people are often suffering. Instead of being shamed, we need to let go of finding a way out and instead pivot toward finding a way in. As the originator and pioneering researcher into Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), he lays out the psychological flexibility skills that make it one of the most powerful, research-based forms of therapy. Psychological flexibility refers to your ability to connect with the present moment and direct attention and action toward what you value. Whether you are contending with depression, substance abuse, chronic pain, relationship issues, or limitations in business, ACT teaches you that you hurt where you care. Instead of shunning your vulnerability, embrace it to live a meaningful life.Steven C. Hayes is Nevada Foundation Professor in the Behavior Analysis program at the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. An author of 44 books and nearly 600 scientific articles, his career has focused on an analysis of the nature of human language and cognition and the application of this to the understanding and alleviation of human suffering. He is the developer of Relational Frame Theory, an account of human higher cognition, and has guided its extension to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a popular evidence-based form of psychotherapy that uses mindfulness, acceptance, and values-based methods.

He was the first Secretary-Treasurer of the Association for Psychological Science, which he helped form and has served a 5 year term on the National Advisory Council for Drug Abuse in the National Institutes of Health.In 1992 he was listed by the Institute for Scientific Information as the 30th “highest impact” psychologist in the world and Google Scholar data ranks him among the top ~1,500 most cited scholars in all areas of study, living and dead (http://www.webometrics.info/en/node/58).

Just because your likes & dislikes, your life agenda, or your personal preferences are different from someone else’s doesn’t mean you should feel bad for wanting to live YOUR life the way that’s comfortable for you. It almost blows my mind that I didn’t understand that making decisions based on what somebody else likes doesn’t make any sense - you are living YOUR life, not theirs!!

Although I shared A LOT as I learned and changed, I want to share more. I never know exactly how to answer all the questions I get recently: “How have you lost so much weight?” “How did you learn to trust again?” “How did you get past the resentment?” “How did you keep fear & obsessive thoughts about what else might happen from consuming your mind?” “How did you learn to trust yourself, love yourself, and believe in yourself?” There is no straight-line answer to any of those questions! And there’s no “quick fix” to overcoming any of this. I haven’t even mastered them all, but the truth is...it takes WORK. Actual work. Mental work. Emotional work. Learning constantly. Physically practicing new skills. Accepting that the clichés “two steps forward and one step back,” “progress, not perfection,” and “it gets worse before it gets better” are TRUE and NORMAL.I certainly don’t have all the answers, but I want to share what I’ve learned. I want to go back and dive deeper into what I was doing behind the scenes of the past year and how I MADE the changes I was preaching about. I don’t want anybody else stuck where I was.

Never losing optimism, spirit, or humor despite extraordinary rigors and setbacks, Ethan used his journey and considerable platform to connect with others – young adults in particular – and offer much-needed inspiration, advice, and comfort. As demonstrated by his charitable work with various global and domestic health and wellness organizations, and community involvement, Ethan believes that a better and healthier world can be achieved by living with strong values.

Running from the negative thoughts and feelings blocks your ability to experience the event and thus not learn what you need to in order to mature and evolve. Realize that problems are forever. You will never eliminate all the problems in your life. It is impossible.\xa0Get a good grade and your friend gets a bad grade - how will you handle your contrary emotions?Get a raise and now you pay higher taxes. Get a new car and now you have greater expenses. Win the game and now you have pressure to win the next game. Get good grades and now you pressure yourself to get better.No matter the situation you experience it will bring with it a whole new set of "problem" that are really just life situations you now get to experience\xa0so you can continue to grow.Ask yourself these questions when a problem arises or you feel overwhelmed by college and life.1. What is a problem you want to eliminate forever? Why?2. If you were able to eliminate this problem, what new problem would take its place that you don\'t have now?3. What do you think about the concept that problems and negative emotions are forever?4. As a human being that has both positive and negative emotions, what doyou think about the idea that the good balance is half and half without anybuffering or false pleasures?5. I believe that most of our dreams are on the other side of discomfort. What is your relationship with discomfort?6. When we see problems as an unwanted or wrong part of life, we end up not growing. Why do you think this is?7. If you looked forward to negative emotion and planned on problems, howwould your life be different?8. Can you think of a problem you have had that ultimately created an equalamount of positive contrast? Write it here.9. Here\'s an idea...The bigger your dreams, the more problems you will have. The more problems you have, the more opportunity you have for the balance of positive emotion.

Certainty2. Uncertainty/Variety3. Significance4. Love/Connection5. Growth6. Contribution | Ep #19 - You are building new habits by the 1000s over your first few months of a new semester. Your brain can adapt, learn, and grow in infinite ways and by knowing this you can turn its incredible power in your favor. This isn\'t the first time you have adapted to a massive amount of new experiences at once. Every new school year brought about these kinds of actions in you. You have a ton of background adapting - so don\'t let the anxiety monster get to you.This is how life will be forever.\xa0People used to believe that the brain became fixed, could no longer learn new things, after a certain age. Newer research has revealed that the brain never stops changing in response to learning.\xa0Neuroplasticity is your brain\'s ability to adapt and change to anything and everything you experience in life.It\'s a wonderful thing, so harness it now and turn your life into a gigantic experiment. It\'ll make new habit creation a joy and you\'ll be self-aware enough to know if the habit you are creating will lead you toward success or away from failure.As always, I am honored you spent your precious time with me!Please subscribe, rate and review the show to help us spread the word about this awesome free content.

You have to show up every day and be present in your life.Some keys to remember and thrive through:Be where you say you\'re going to be when you say you\'re going to be there.Don\'t change the way you act to impress others.

LOLFlexibility is critical because through that pliability you will better overcome challenges, reduce your stress level (when things do go awry,) and ultimately be more successful than others (who are more rigid and set in their ways.)\xa0Flexibility is the ability to demonstrate a fluid approach to your work, relationships, and life.

Being action-oriented is crucial in life because its the only way you’ll know if the decision you made was the right one for you or not.\xa0In college, being\xa0action-oriented is insanely important because you have everything at your disposal, a world of opportunities.\xa0It is a rare time in your life when you will generally be surrounded by people seeking to evolve and propel their lives in a new direction. Getting into a rhythm, discovering your true self, and moving toward your destiny should be priorities in your university life.How to take action?\xa01. Get up and do something!2.

Do not stop a month in because it feels uncomfortable and scary.\xa0Discomfort is a signal you are growing, learning something new, and most likely the result of you truly becoming the person college will influence you to become.You\'re in college, try new things out. You want to be a vegan, be a vegan. Then be a pescatarian, then a vegetarian - hell, eat only raw meat, under a pale moonlight, in the woods, if you want.\xa0You can make those decisions, just make them and move forward with the confidence you can always make another decision later.Also, please subscribe, rate, and review the show to help us spread the word about this awesome free content.

It’s how one faces that fear, manages that fear, deals with that fear, and begins to overcome that fear - that speaks volumes about their courageousness and their character.If you call yourself a perfectionist or if you procrastinate as a default behavior you are living in a state of fear, and most certainly lacking courage.As we progress through the next five principles look for ideas and inspiration to push through perfectionism and procrastination and actually get to the job at hand.Step through the fear of social awkwardness.Be grounded in the idea that not everyone will like you but a lot will.Be who you want to be and be around the people you want to be around not just the people that want you around because you act like they want you to act.If you feel fear coming through you ask yourself why you feel that fear, where is the source of the fear, and how can you overcome the fear?\xa0In my experience, just going through the act that is bringing you fear will relieve most of the fear.\xa0You know you have done this in other areas of your life. Go back to a time when you overcame a fear. What were you doing? How did you do to overcome the fear?\xa0Thank you for joining me for another episode of College Success Habits.\xa0Also, please subscribe, rate and review the show to help us spread the word about this awesome free content.

There is no guarantee for tomorrow, so let\'s make the most out of today. All we have is now. |      Alex Huddleston joins the podcast to talk about the power of the human mind. When Huddleston\'s MMA career came to an abrupt end, he struggled to find meaning in his life. Concussed, anxious, and suicidal, Huddleston spent months locked up in his home thinking about what he perceived as his failed existence. Alex finally found the strength to build himself back up upon the realization that he was cared for. In this episode, he discusses his Buddhist practices, the benefits of meditation, the flaws of human perception, and the power of self-belief.\xa0  \xa0 \xa0   \xa0   | We seem to live for our limits rather than our goals, but what if we lived a LIMITLESS existence? What if we BELIEVED in ourselves rather than sell ourselves short? As a professional MMA fighter, I often psyched myself out of believing in myself. I convinced myself that I could not hang with the best in the game. I sometimes even had arguments with coaches and teammates where I "justified" my complete lack of belief in myself. It\'s impossible to know whether or not I would have ever reached the top of my division in the UFC, but my mindset most certainly did not help me reach my goal. I did not believe I could beat the best, so I was never the best. I cannot guarantee that you will reach the goal you\'re chasing, but I can assure you this: regardless of the end result, you will have a much more meaningful, empowering journey if you CHOOSE to believe in yourself. | UFC host Karyn Bryant joins the podcast to discuss her career, her identity, racial and gender inequality, and her unique experience in the journalism industry. Karyn began interviewing and commentating combat sports in 2006 when she joined the Showtime Championship Boxing team. She later began her career in the MMA industry with CBS. Karyn currently hosts and co-hosts most of the UFC\'s Pre- and Post-Fight shows on ESPN. | Here\'s where NEVER giving up took me. I\'d been chasing my goal of qualifying for the ADCC World Champion since I was 20 years, and it always seems to elude me. I tried and failed to get into the most prestigious grappling tournament in the world for 18 years. I took 2nd and 3rd multiple times at the qualifers, and, as time passed, my dream seemed to distance itself from reality. Yet I kept training, I kept teaching, and I kept trying to become the best version of myself that I could ever become. Now at 38 years old, well past my physical prime, with two kids and a wife, I was unexpectedly invited to compete at the 2019 ADCC World Championship. Let this serves as a lesson for you and me: never let failure, others\' opinions or your own disappointment prevent you from chasing your goals. DON\'T EVER GIVE UP. | In this episode, Eliot sits down with Damon Martin. Damon is a veteran mixed martial arts journalist who has been covering the industry since 2003 with bylines on FOX Sports, CNN, Bleacher Report and numerous other outlets. | Rule #4 for me and my kids: if you\'re scared of something, you have to do it. When fear runs your life, you live in a constant state of regret. Well, there\'s only one person that can change that pattern, and it\'s YOU. YOU can take charge of your own life, look at fear in the eyes and say "Not today." Take risks, make mistakes, fail, succeed, but most importantly live the life YOU want to live, and not the one fear dictates for you. Happy Friday, everyone, go find your power. | This episode of the podcast features martial artist Tony Blauer. Tony is perhaps best known as the founder of "The SPEAR System." A close-quarter protection system that uses a person\'s reflex action in threatening situations as a basis for defense.

On today\'s episode of TOL we are joined by my friend, and SBO partner, Stefanie Wyres. Stefanie is a home organizer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and is the founder of Bring Peace Home.\xa0 Stefanie and her team are driven to helping people find balance and peace in their lives.\xa0 She tackles everything from garages to craft rooms to doctor’s offices and has fun doing it! \xa0 Stefanie is also a mom to 2 daughters, ages 18 and 20. Given that she\xa0 has already gone through the whole "college thing" with her 20 year old,\xa0 I asked her to share with us some valuable tips and strategies for those who are about to embark on this exciting (yet overwhelming) chapter. I realize that many of you can’t even begin to think about college, because you\'re surrounded by diapers, sippy cups, and tripping over toys, (and for a hot minute I would like to trade places with you!). For folks like me, who are in the thick of it, trust me when I tell you that the whole college prepared-ness can be a real struggle, and source of stress, both for parents and students. Thankfully Stefanie created a cheat-sheet of sorts to help parents and students navigate these muddy waters.\xa0 So whether you are just about to embark on this journey, or maybe you are knee deep in it, there is some valuable information for everyone! She covers things like:  What to do before they enter their senior in high school Some go to apps and information on financial aid Emotional preparation (for you and you student)  I loved our conversation and I hope you do to!\xa0 If you know someone who can benefit from the episode, would you please share it with a friend?

I figured, who better to kick off our parenting series, than my very own daughter, Logan-- who at the time of this recording was embarking on her 16th birthday (Jesus take the wheel!) If you\'ve listened to my show at all, you know that I have 2 incredible daughters, each with their own gifts and talents. They also each have areas in which they struggle.\xa0 It is with their permission that I am able to share parts of their lives with all of you. Logan has had her fair share of struggles, and has come a long way over the past 16 years. She really opened up on this episode about some vulnerable topics, including her struggles with ADHD, OCD, and Magical Thinking. We also talk about how Josh and I parent differently, what she likes (and dislikes) about being the kid of an organizer, and what tips and strategies she plans to take with her into adulthood. What I loved most about our conversation is that it was honest, unscripted (I literally gave her the talking points 5 minutes before we started recording), and most of all, gives hope to our listeners.\xa0 If you are a parent of child who may be struggling with similar issues to Logs, I encourage you to listen to this episode with them. Feel free to use our conversation as a springboard to open a discussion about how they are feeling about school, responsibilities, and everything in between(anxious? overwhelmed? maybe even scared). I\'ve made my fair share of parenting mistakes over the years. I hardly have all the answers, or even close to it,\xa0 but I can tell you with 100% certainty a few things that I know to be true. Dialogue with your kids matters. Involving them in the process matters. Leading by example matters. And most of all, remember to tell them that whatever they are going though, they are not alone. \xa0 XOXO- Laurie *If this is your first time here, please tap the  SUBSCRIBE button to have new episodes downloaded each week!

Her birthing journey remarkable for many reasons - like after suffering PCOS as well as holistically healing from thyroid cancer, she’s been able to birth 4 healthy children. Her third birth really influenced the choice for home birth, as it was the “most traumatizing” of her births and she felt like she had no sense of control of the experience.Sarah’s fourth birth was a paradigm shift - a reprogramming.

So for her growing up, it was just “normal.” So there didn’t have to be this explanation and deep dive into what it was or why people might choose it.It’s this normalcy that carries through how Celia shares her story, from research she did while pregnant, the conversations with her partner Ali and assembling a birth team that would support her in what she wanted to create (while also receiving prenatal care at a hospital). With about a month of “practice labor” prior to birth, Celia was ready to meet her baby, her son Nadir.We hear the birth story as well as some of Celia’s favorite resources, as a birth and postpartum doula and childbirth educator herself.

Today we dive into that with Amelia Page, mama of 6. We chat about her first two births and the influence that moved her towards home birth for her remaining 4 children. We touch on the topic of circumcision (respecting all choices), as well as the inner work that supports in the pregnancy, birth and motherhood experience. Pregnancy was a challenging experience for Amelia, so for any mamas who can relate - this is a great one to feel understood. You are not alone!Plus we get highlights from all 4 home births and hear about both similarities and differences amongst them.

Anatomy scans revealed that Evan had cleft lip and possibly cleft palate, potentially shifting not only birth plans, but Becca’s plans to breastfeed (there can be issues with forming suction in cleft-affected babies). This was a devastating experience for Becca, challenging her to stay connected through the remainder of her pregnancy. However, supportive doctors gave them to green light to proceed with a home birth. The birth itself was peaceful and “normal.” This was also after a traumatic experience with her first birth of her son Tucker, which led her wanting a “do over.” We really appreciate Becca and Mark bringing this conversation to the podcast, because we haven’t shared a cleft-affected story before. Some of the things that Becca emphasized and wanted to make sure we share with listeners who are also going through this - to make sure your midwife (care provider) is very confident with resuscitation (this can be one of the things to be mindful of at the birth of a cleft-affected baby). From Becca:I think it's important for other cleft-mamas to know that my midwife had a laryngo mask and was experienced with it; she also does monthly refreshers on neonatal resuscitation. I also had 3 different cleft bottles on hand, syringes, and donor milk so that I could figure out feeding him no matter what, if his palate had been cleft. I also had a pump ready to go. I think these are important things to have if you're giving birth to a cleft kiddo at home. We also had a plan to meet with our cleft team within a week after birth or earlier, if there were feeding issues (within 24 hours). Also, mostly importantly, my home birth was the healing experience my mind, soul, body, and family needed! After he was delivered earthside, I physically bounced right back! He was 9lbs, and I didn't tear! I physically felt soooooo much better than I did after Tucker. I didn't even really need the peribottle...I felt great! Everything about Evan's birth was exactly what I needed in the end.

Naomi felt a loss of control with her first birth of her daughter Jasmine, followed by some traumatic stitches to repair her tearing. She was left feeling disappointed, not at peace. For her second birth, she wanted to do something different.So she prepared more this time - she read, listened to podcasts (like DIAH!) and joined local groups to connect with other mothers. It gave her the opportunity to get clear on what she wanted and what she didn’t want.

Introverts are often misunderstood and mis-labeled by people who don\'t understand the personality type. Often people think introverted women are boring or stuck-up because of the way they show up in the world. Those people couldn\'t be more wrong! Powerful introverts are fabulous and this episode outlines how we can shine in the workplace and increase our confidence.Chelsey is so passionate about introverts because she is one! So her interest in increasing confidence as an introvert came out of her own difficulties. Introverts often feel awkward and out of place in social situations and have anxiety about small talk or being in large groups. And the advice to "get out of your shell, speak up and stop thinking so much" isn\'\'t helpful and doesn’t work.In this episode we discussed:The strengths of being exactly who you are. Some people can go their whole lives without figuring that out.What\'s wrong with the dictionary definition of an introvert?The hurtful labels that people use to describe introverts.Was there an event that helped Chelsey figure out she was different and unique?The ingredients in a confidence milk shake.How to use introversion as an advantage not a weakness.How to be a powerful introvertShow notes can be found at https://allegrasinclair.com/070 | When most of you started your professional journeys you likely thought your most important responsibility was managing yourself and your work tasks. Over time, the most successful among you learned managing your manager had a much bigger impact on career success.Trying to talk to your boss can be intimidating, uncomfortable and awkward. But if you know the right way to approach your manager, you can not only survive the conversation, you can thrive in your workplace.Effective communication with your manager is critical for a number of reasons. If you want to ask for a raise or get support for a new project or initiative, communicating effectively increases your chances of success.How to have an effective conversation with your managerBe Respectful of Your Manager\'s TimeIf you don\'t know your boss\' schedule, you risk approaching her when she\'s not receptive. There are times when she\'s more stressed and times when she\'s more relaxed, so focus on talking with her at her convenience. Pay attention to her signals and respect her time boundaries.Haven\'t you had this happen? You\'re racing out of your office, late for a meeting and somebody stops by to \'ask a quick question\'. You explain tactfully that you don\'t have a minute, but they don\'t listen to you and keep pushing forward. How does that taste? You could care less what they\'re saying because you don\'t have time to listen. If they are asking a question, they are likely to get a no. Don\'t be that person.Be Prepared to Keep Emotions Under ControlDon\'t walk into an \'asking\' conversation cold. An asking conversation is when you want something specific--a new position, additional staff, time off, etc. If you are emotional about your request, rehearse the conversation. Think about how your manager might respond and think through how those responses could make you feel.The key here is not to just walk through getting exactly what you want. What if your judgment is questioned? What if the answer is no? I am not telling you to plan to fail, I am asking you to be professional and consider all the possibilities. Thinking about the results that might make you emotional gives you a chance to experience those emotions in private BEFORE you talk to your manager. You are not a robot, emotions are part of life, but you can choose where to have an emotional response to the subject.Stay Abreast of Industry TrendsOne way to get your boss\' attention is to know what\'s going on in your industry. Staying knowledgeable can help you get ahead and make your conversation with your boss more impressive. And, your boss is more likely to remember the conversation in a positive way.Ways to stay up-to-date with industry trends include:Reading industry trade magazinesTalking with others in the same professionAttending conferences and listening to speakersKeeping up with the newsDevelop Good Communication Before You \'Need\' ItEverything about how you communicate with others illustrates who you are and your feelings about them and yourself. When it comes to managing your manager, your voice, speech, and word choice demonstrate how well you get along with others. Learn to take advantage of strong communication skills to demonstrate your competence and confidence.When communicating with your manager:Use the tone of your voice to show self-assurance. Maintaining a pleasant tone of voice, even in stressful situations, shows that you can handle pressure. A calm tone will make you appear much more confident.Choose your volume wisely. Projecting too loudly is never a good look at work. Sometimes we raise our voices if we\'re afraid we won\'t be... | Let\'s talk about how you gave up on the dream career you want. Once you have given up, what are you supposed to do next? First, a little background.One of the most important things about hope is that it prevents you from giving up. You may be thinking, you haven’t given up on anything. Are you sure?I ended a recent podcast episode by saying one of the most important things about hope is that it prevents you from giving up. (If you need to learn the basics of the power of hope, be sure to go back and listen to Episode 062.) I also pointed out that some people may have given up even though they aren\'t aware of it.In this week\'s episode I\'ll help you figure out:The different forms of giving upIf you have given upWhat to do if you gave up but you\'re ready to try againGiving up can be disguised as:Making the best of the current situation instead of trying to make changes, i.e., telling yourself you really like staying where you are.Only showing up with 50% of yourself and 50%o f your potential, because that\'s good enough.Protecting yourself by expecting less out of life, acting as if you will feel less disappointment if you expect less from your life.Sabotaging yourself from doing bigger things i.e., missing the deadline to apply for a job or educationa; opportunity.Wallowing in self-doubt, playing the victim, so that giving up on your dream is not your fault.How to Move ForwardForget that you gave up on your dream career. Give yourself a little grace and forgive yourself for old decisions. When we know better, we do better.Invest 30-40 minutes in remembering what your dream was, adapting it to your current situation, and picking 2 action steps you can take to move toward the dream and giving yourself a deadline.You don\'t have to do this alone. If you have friends who are also living smaller than they are capable of, you could form a mastermind group or a sister circle and hold each other accountable for making changes. Today, not some day. Do I sound like this is urgent? Good, because it is.Show notes can be found at https://allegrasinclair.com/065 Support this podcast | When things suck it\'s hard to feel gratitude but I have 7 ways to feel gratitude that will help you get through it.Gratitude is one of the most powerful emotions that you can experience. It connects you to what is really important in your life. It reminds you that as long as you’re breathing, everything is going to be okay. And it helps frame your day, your expectations, and your actions.Embracing gratitude can be as simple as saying thank you.Life is unpredictable and occasionally things suck. Each day we\'re faced with situations that test our ability to behave with grace and deal with difficulties. It\'s easy to get angry, scared, or resentful and forget to be grateful for the good things in our lives.Question: If we don\'t cherish and feel grateful for the good things we already have, how can we justify wanting more?In this episode I look at 7 ways to feel gratitude:Do something kind for someone else every daySay thank you for little thingsEstablish a no-complaining zoneRe-frame your negative thoughtsKeep a gratitude journalDonate your time or money or thingsCreate a \'100 Things to Be Grateful For\' listEveryone struggles, gets stuck, and experiences difficulty. Next time you find yourself having a tough time, remember that crisis is also a wonderful growth opportunity. Embrace the challenge, enrich it with gratitude, and you’ll experience genuine growth.Show notes available at https://allegrasinclair.com/064 | How can you tell if you really like yourself? It\'s probably something you don\'t think about because you just assume that you do. But, according to an American sociologist, at any given moment, 80% of the world doesn\'t like themselves. I\'m a little scared of the answer, but I need somebody to do research on what the number would be for women. Do you think it\'s higher or lower?This morning I found myself thinking, \'I really like myself\'. That\'s not the first time I\'ve had that thought, or even my most enthusiastic episode of self approval. It struck me today because I realized that I\'ve spent a couple of days NOT liking myself.Spending time not liking myself sneaks up on me, just like I know it sneaks up on you.I read an article that outlined 15 ways that people show they don\'t like themselves but I disagreed with some of their ideas, so here is my list.HOW CAN YOU TELL IF YOU DON’T LIKE YOURSELF?Things that used to delight you, don’t make you as happy. And you start to talk smack to yourself for ever having enjoyed them.Your self care starts to slip, specifically what you eat and how much you sleep.You respond to things differently, often in a negative way. Being reactive and defensive are not a good look.You try to ignore your self talk but in truth you are only ignoring the POSITIVE self talk because it doesn’t match the negative conversation that’s going on in your head.Get the full show notes at https://allegrasinclair.com/063Need some help liking yourself? There is no need to suffer alone. Schedule a Discovery Call and learn how to reject negative thoughts about yourself and start liking yourself again.Have a friend who needs to hear this? Tell them how to listen to this podcast. | In this week\'s episode of the podcast I am going to take a look at what hope is and why you should care.I got a question on Twitter the other day that I decided to answer here on the podcast in addition to responding directly. The question was, "With all the stuff that’s going on how do you stay hopeful about everything? It feels trivial to be concerned with my stuff when there’s so much happening in the world."Short answer:\xa0I see you and I hear you. The weight of all the mayhem in the world gives me pause, too. However, I actively choose to focus on the things that I can control. That’s not always easy, but it is always necessary.The weight of all the mayhem in the world gives me pause, too. However, I actively choose to focus on the things that I can control. That’s not always easy, but it is always necessary. If there is something I can do, I need to be brave enough to do it. If not, I need to flourish in my spot so that my influence grows. If I want to be able to tackle bigger problems, I have to build a bigger platform.

With all the rapid changes in the workplace it\'s natural to experience some fear. Will the company stay profitable? Will you be able to continue to progress and move up the organization? Are you going to be replaced by a robot? We delve into these questions and more in today\'s episode of the podcast.Many of my coaching clients are accomplished, mid-career women who:Are worried that the changing workplace seems to be leaving them behindWant to turn their career upside down and do something different but they aren\'t sure what they want to doToday\'s guest, Nicolle Merrill has a delicious blend of skills that helps both groups.IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSSED:How to take control of your careerHow the world of work is changing and whyThe changing world of work does not mean you have no valueWhether robots are taking all our jobsWhy we shame people for not moving up the corporate ladderHow we\'re missing opportunities to up-skillThe skills we should focus on to remain relevant in the workplaceHow you build influence in your workplaceGet the show notes and resources at allegrasinclair.com/061 | If you change the content you see, your life will improve. You may not realize it, but you are ‘bathed’ in content every day. And the content you see affects you in many ways. If you expose yourself to a lot of negative content, you will experience anxiety and self-doubt frequently.In fact, absorb enough negative content and you will start having epic levels of self doubt. But, if you bathe yourself in positive content, your life will improve.For the purpose of this discussion, anything that is not positive, is negative.When you expose yourself to negative messages often, you train your brain to think negatively about everything. You will begin to fret about things that will probably never happen. This leads to worries about your health, your relationships, your finances, etc.Excessive worrying can even lead to feelings of high anxiety and make you feel physically ill, according to WebMD. Once this has been going on awhile, you are rewarded with a testy attitude and constant negative thoughts.This is important to tackle because chronic negativity can really harm you. (OK, the article says it can kill you, but I wanted to be a little more positive.)If you\'ve been around here for a while you know I don’t point out problems and then leave you hanging without a solution. You can combat the effects of all this negative content by exposing yourself to positive content throughout your day.Show notes available at https://allegrasinclair.com/060 | I thought LinkedIn was a place to post your resume if you were actively looking for a job. And that\'s all I did, check in every 4 years or so and make a half-hearted attempt at keeping my resume updated. Usually I would hop on there when I started getting a bunch of email notifications that people were congratulating me on a work anniversary for a company I\'d left several years before. I’m comfortable not knowing everything and I love finding people who I can tap into for specific expertise. And today\'s guest is a LinkedIn rockstar. Donna Serdula started on LinkedIn back in 2005, so she is the perfect person to bring all the LinkedIn knowledge.In this episode we discussed:The one thing you SHOULD NOT do on LinkedIn.

What if it\'s within your power to do and believe new things? This is your introduction to the startling power of \'what if\'.I know how strongly we hold our beliefs. I’m not necessarily talking about limiting beliefs, I’m speaking in more broad terms. We are a nation that questions a lot of things but what we believe, we REALLY believe. And to our credit, it\'s hard for us to shake off things that we believe in strongly.There are certain things that I believe that you can’t shake me from. Period. Ever. For example, I believe that all people are created equal, and I believe that education is magical.However, what if your strong beliefs aren’t positive? I’ve been hearing from a lot of my coaching clients about their beliefs and many of these beliefs are unshakeable. The challenge comes when the belief is something that makes them feel bad. Or something that holds them back when they are ready to move forward.A few of the more negative beliefs sound like this:* I could never do that* I just can\'t get over this* I should just be content with my life is and stop dreaming of bigger and better thingsDo any if these beliefs sound familiar? Just for today, let\'s dream. What if you were able to believe something different? How different would you be as a result of the new belief? Would you like yourself better? Would you be able to help more people and increase your impact and influence on the world around you?I don’t know what belief is currently weighing you down, but in this \'what if \' game, let\'s look at 2 new beliefs you can try on for size.Show notes available at: https://allegrasinclair.com/058', 'chan_desc': 'Allegra Sinclair is a career and confidence coach.

Well, I give a crap! Let\'s stop being embarrassed and figure this out.People love to post pictures of what they are about to eat for lunch. But you know what they don’t want to share? Keto poop problems! For some reason, dirty keto dieters clam up when it comes to talking about keto diarrhea or keto constipation.When you make a sudden diet change, like starting the DIRTY,LAZY, KETO way of eating, your bowels also make big changes. What you eat comesout the other end, so it makes sense there would be some impressive changes“down there,” right?The Bristol Stool Chart explains (in gorgeous, Claymation detail!) what healthy poop is “supposed” to look like. Ideally, your stool should look like Type 3 or 4 in the chart. Healthy stool dives smoothly into the toilet bowl without a big splash (TMI?). The shape of your poop should have an S or C curve, mimicking the shape of your curvy intestine.By Cabot Health, Bristol Stool Chart - http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/46082.pdf, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=41761316At one time or another, due to medication, illness, or diet, we have all experienced Types 1-7 poop. Don’t try and lie! Let’s try and figure out what might be happening today with your poop as it relates to the DIRTY, LAZY, KETO diet*.Keto Constipation Did you know that 75% of your poop is made up of water? About 9% of poop is from fiber (where it gets its form), and the remainder is inorganic material or bacteria (the stinky part). So, what that tells me is drinking water is important! When you started DIRTY, LAZY, KETO, I talked about avoiding the keto flu by increasing electrolytes – remember? The same lesson applies here. Electrolyte supplemented fluids and increased water intake will keep you regular. If your poop looks like pebbles or clumped pebbles (Type 1 and 2 on the stool chart), you are likely dehydrated.Constipation can also be a result of not eating enough soluble fiber. Found in healthy fruits and vegetables, soluble fiber turns to mush inside your intestines, making your poop nice and soft. For a detailed list of DIRTY, LAZY, KETO recommended fruits and veggies – check the Fiber section of the Net Carb Calculator blog post.Keto Diarrhea When you suddenly increase the amount of fat in your diet,your colon might go into shock. Diarrhea is the body’s reaction to unabsorbedfat – the small intestine and colon secrete large amounts of water which leadsto watery stool and diarrhea. Another likely culprit behind keto diarrhea isthe consumption of MCT oil, sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners. Everyonetolerates these differently; sometimes sugar-free candy or other keto treatshave unintended side effects -- sorry!A deeper dive into keto diarrhea (oh, that was a badvisual!) might point toward a vitamin D deficiency. Have you had your levelschecked? Additionally, over-the-counter supplements like magnesium are known toloosen the bowels. Be sure you know what you are actually taking! Ask yourdoctor for help.In podcast episode 9 of DIRTY, LAZY, Girl, Tamara and Stephanie discuss what healthy poop looks like and will provide specific tips to help you address this sometimes very crappy situation!

If you haven\'t explored yourself, haven\'t listened to your instincts, your intuition, learned your unique language, then you\'ve got no chance of being able to sustain any real boundaries with yourself, or with anyone else.Listen to your inner voice. Learn the language of your soul and wake up. Do what your body is telling you to do. Stop avoiding the inner work.

We’re talking birth, sex, and death. We’re talking about all the ways these three things are held hostage, feelings squashed, surrounded in shame, pushed into the background, not discussed publicly, or not discussed at all, period. I’m breaking down why we’re having no honest, meaningful conversations about birth, sex or death, and how significant our suffering is as a result.When I first started in Doula work, there was quite literally no conversation around sex and death, intersectionality, any discussion around the milestones, the events, the thresholds, the catalysts in terms of the mainstream Doula Training that was available to me at the time. It was very much a safe Doula Training, and therefore very safe Doula conversation.Today I share with you what full spectrum doula work looks like for me. I discuss why the hard conversations are so important, why you must know and love yourself before you can even think about holding space for another, and why you need to cut the bullshi$, and work on yourself.
