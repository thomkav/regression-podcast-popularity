Thank you to Jean Chambers at\xa0  String Theory Yarn and Fiber for helping us put on the Washington Coast Meetup! We had a great time meeting new fiber friends who felt like old friends right away. The unexpected theme of the meetup was dogs! All the attendees were dog owners, the shop has a new puppy, Marsha brought Enzo, and two of the attendees also had their dogs with them. So a beach run with the dogs was a highlight of Saturday afternoon. On our way to Seabrook we stopped by Olympic Yarn and Fiber Mill for a tour by the owner Lynn Lipski. She is also the creator of Lina Yarns. We toured her current mill and had a sneak peak at the new fiber spinning mill that she is opening in Cosmopolis, WA. Her operation is very impressive and her vision for providing a mill for local fiber and helping to build the fiber supply chain is definitely infectious.\xa0 Marsha’s Projects I finished  Lounging Top by Joji Locatelli. The yarn is  Debbie Bliss Juliet.\xa0 I also finished the first sock with\xa0  Schahenmayr Regia Design Line by Arne & Carlos. I’m using\xa0  Knitted Wit Smarties for the toes and heels. Note: 45-yard mini skein is enough for heel and toe of one sock. I’m making another 1898 Hat by Kristine Byrnes with worsted weight. This time using  Leading Men Fiber Arts Box Office Worsted in the colorway Wild Goose Chase. The pattern is available for free on the  Seamen’s Church Institute: Christmas at Sea website.\xa0 Marsha’s Plans I started Shared Rib by Anne Hanson back in February. The pattern is for a scarf, cowl, or infinity cowl. I’ve knit about 4” of the scarf but think I’m going to rip out and knit the cowl instead. The yarn is from  Old Maiden Aunt fingering that in the colorway Crimson Lips that I bought at the Edinburgh Yarn Festival. Halloween is coming! I\'m thinking about making the  Daphne’s Skull designed by Ellen Sibelius owner of Wooly Wonders. To hear more about her designs check out  Episode 109. Kelly’s Projects I’m participating in the  Oh Gnome You Didn’t MKAL by Sara Shira. I was keeping up with the clues until I went off to Washington for the meetup. The clue that week involved stuffing the gnome so I put the project on pause for the trip and I haven’t picked it back up. The mystery KAL is now over so I know how the gnomes look and they’re very cute. I’ll finish my two in time for Christmas and add a couple more traditional looking gnomes to the bunch, but\xa0 right now I’m not in the mood for small pieces, stuffing or sewing.\xa0 I did start a pair of socks at the meetup. They are out of Little Fish Stitches yarn in the Seabrook Sunset colorway that is exclusive to  String Theory Yarn and Fiber. It’s a very pretty orange and purple combination.\xa0 Other than that, my knitting has hit a stall. I\'m in a funk. Maybe that’s for the best since it’s almost time for the 19-20 Winter Weave Along!

Marsha’s Projects I finished the Lace Market T-shirt by Marie Green using Schoppel-Wolle El Linio several weeks ago. The neckline was too big and yesterday I finally reknit it. Fits perfectly! The Schoppel-Wolle Das Paar socks are finished and they match just as promised. I also finished Fine Sand by Heidi Kirrmeier. Using  Fibra Natura Unity. Fits great! I also cast on another pair of vanilla socks for my brother. Using  Schahenmayr Regia Design Line by Arne & Carlos. I’m going to use  Knitted Wit Smarties for the toes and heels.

This seemed to be the perfect pattern for an adventurer and yarn is from Seattle. Kelly’s updates I swatched for  Mariannes cardigan by Trine Bertelsen. The pattern has a crochet yoke, button band, and sleeve edging. I will modify it to be a pullover. I’ll be using  Blue Heron Egyptian Mercerized Cotton spirit yarn from Tracy (littletownknitter). Also joined the  Oh Gnome You Didn’t mystery gnome knit along. Pattern updates start in early September.  Billions of baby socks!\xa0 Well, maybe not billions.\xa0 Six pairs are finished and I have another pair on the needles. Method 1:\xa0 I often use the same sock formula that I use for my own socks and do them top down with a heel flap of half the stitches. I usually use size US 2 needles and 32 stitches. To turn the heel I go two stitches past the center do a decrease, do one more stitch and turn. Then slip one, go five stitches, do a decrease, do one more stitch and turn. Now every row I slip one, knit to the gap created by the decrease, do a decrease across the gap, knit one more stitch, and turn. Repeat until all stitches are used. Then I pick up for the gussets and keep knitting.\xa0 A pattern, if you want one is  Better-Than-Booties Baby Socks\xa0 Method 2: For the most recent socks I’ve been using a short row heel and it seems faster. I’ve been using  Basically Perfect Baby Socks by Diana Burch as a guide for the short rows.\xa0 Listener Questions Yarngirl52 (Debbie) asked about adding a zipper, adding a shoulder button band for a toddler sweater, and finishing a button band. Should you use grosgrain ribbon or not; backer buttons or not. There are two ways to add a zipper to a sweater that doesn’t have one. One way is steeking to add a zipper to a sweater designed as a pullover, another is adding a zipper to a sweater instead of a button band. Kelly responds:\xa0 I haven’t ever done a steeked sweater, but I steeked for the  Clover, Bee, and Revery pillow. The pillow was knit in the round with an extra 5 or 7 stitches that were where it was cut and folded over to create the left and right edges of the pillow top.\xa0 I did a crocheted steek where I crocheted up each edge before cutting. If I ever made another Cowichan-style sweater I think I would do it in the round and then steek it to put in the zipper. That way you avoid colorwork while purling.\xa0 I added a zipper instead of a button band to  the Mielie vest that I made (pattern by Hilary Smith Callis). I made the button bands a little wider because I liked that look. I also changed the order of putting on the collar and button band so I could fold the collar down over the top edge of the zipper. I sewed the zipper in by hand and I actually just used yarn to do it. The zipper on the Orcas Run was sewn by hand with sewing thread. I pinned it on, zipped the zipper up to adjust the pinning if needed, then unzipped it again and made small stitches all around the edge of the zipper. What about adding a shoulder button band to a toddler sweater that doesn’t have one?\xa0  Bluebell Pullover doesn’t have a shoulder button band but has the envelope neckline that onesies have. To put a button band on a bottom up sweater would be straightforward. Instead of joining at the shoulders, just bind off (to provide structure) and then pick up for the button bands. One will need to have button holes put into it. I think I’d make it the front one, but it doesn’t really matter I don’t think. Putting a button band on a top down toddler sweater would be more tricky and would really depend on the construction of the sweater.\xa0 Another trick I like when I want to alter a pattern is to find a pattern with the thing I want to add and either make it first to figure out the construction, or read through it and see if I can visualize how to make the changes I want in the original sweater. For example Diggory from Berroco is an example. It has the neckline with button bands and could serve as a great model of what to do. Besides, the baby in the pattern photo couldn\'t be cuter. Go take a look--we promise it will make you smile! Marsha found some resources about adding grosgrain ribbon to the button bands of a sweater. Neither of us have ever done this, but we spend a lot of time speculating and decide to experiment with the technique on two of our sweaters.\xa0  Tips for adding ribbon to a sweater button band by Olive Knits.\xa0  Adding a ribbon backing to your knit button band by Ms. Cleaver \xa0 | Lots of travel knitting, a natural dye workshop with fiber friends and some listener questions about spinning and stash are the topics for this week.

Here is a link to the Ravelry thread about the meet-up. We just spent a week together in Seattle! Kelly came up to join Marsha and some fiber friends for a natural dye workshop.\xa0 The dyes used were coreopsis, lichen, avocado, and cochineal. They were dyed on a variety of natural colored yarns using different strengths of dye. We also used an ammonia modifier to change the color of the dye. Very inspiring.\xa0 Marsha\'s Projects: I finished the\xa0Lace Market T-shirt by Marie Green using Schoppel-Wolle El Linio several weeks ago. The neck is too big and I had planned to re-knit picking up fewer stitches, small needles, and slightly less loose bind off. Where did the time go? I turned heel and worked gusset of\xa0 Schoppel-Wolle Das Paar socks. About an inch of the foot is completed.\xa0 I also finished body and neck band of Fine Sand by Heidi Kirrmeier, using  Fibra Natura Unity.\xa0 Knot a long: Nothing!!!! But that doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t enter. So far we have 38 FOs, our biggest along ever! Enter by August 31st. Remember, it\'s any fiber related item that is not knit,\xa0 crochet, spinning or weaving. We\'ll draw for prizes in our first September episode. Kelly’s Projects The most significant FO for this week is my 5th metatarsal! Bone is 90% healed and the boot is off. Now on to the physical therapy! I also finished\xa0Two cowls from Alchemy yarn 100% silk. The pattern is  Simple Yet Effective from Tin Can Knits. I finished the first one on the road trip to Seattle and the second one I almost finished on the trip back home.\xa0\xa0 The  Silk Cardigan from  Dragonfly Fibers Dance Rustic Silk is also finished. The pattern is  Koru by Aroha Knits. I got some good wear out of it during the trip to Seattle. The fit is good and the armscye works ok with some of my short-sleeved tees.\xa0 I also finished the  Tarantula that I was making for my grand nephew. Did you know that Tarantulas have 8 eyes? Two larger eyes and 6 tiny ones. I tried to make this tarantula as realistic as possible. The grands are keeping the class tarantula for the summer, so they are a little tarantula-obsessed! Finally, I finished the  miniature punch needle rug. The kit by J. Conner Designs was a gift from Tori (wideanglemind). It was so fun and fast to do and turned out so cute.\xa0 I will definitely try more of this mini-punch work. The fabric is thin and flexible compared to the regular punch needle. It is more like embroidery and is often called punch needle embroidery.\xa0 Questions from Listeners PegofmyHeart (Peggy) asked about keeping her handspun yarn consistent.\xa0 "When I returned to spinning I must have changed my gauge. Now I have a sleeve that needs to be ripped out. New fiber spun, hopefully at a better gauge, and knitted again. HELP!" Suggestions: Take a piece of freshly spun singles off the bobbin and let it ply back on itself to be stablized. I hang this on my wheel so I can keep checking my spinning against this yarn. Unply it so you can see the single if you need to. You can also make a “Spinners Control Card” where you wrap both freshly spun singles and the plied-back-on-itself yarn around a stiff card and keep that with your spinning. This will help with consistency in spinning. Don’t wrap it too tightly or it will seem thinner than it really is.\xa0 Other tricks are: Spin all the singles before plying and put them all on storage bobbins and ply them first bobbin to last bobbin, second bobbin to penultimate bobbin, etc.\xa0 This presumes that the most widely differing bobbins are first and last and plying them together will average out the inconsistencies.\xa0 Spin all the yarn before starting the project and calculate the yards per pound or yards per gram. This will help you see inconsistencies in the skeins and allow you to use the most similar skeins where gauge is important. Any that are significantly different can be used where it matters less or maybe they won\'t be needed at all. Cindy (CindyQ)\xa0 and Valerie29 (Valerie) asked about stash busting, and stash organizing. Marsha suggests: I organize my wool stash by weight and store them in labelled plastic bins I pick up at the Goodwill. I have a separate bins for cotton and handspun. Braids for spinning are stored in those plastic covers that bedding comes in. Yarn/fiber I buy at stores is listed in Ravelry. I tried posting yarn I pick up at thrift stores/destash rooms in Ravelry, but it honestly got to be too much. As for using up the yarn, I made a scarf called  Mini Mania using leftover sock yarn. I also made a Steven West afghan called  Garter Squish that used up about 5,700 yards of worsted weight yarn. I made a shaw called  Sunny Delight using yarn from the NoCKRs retreat destash room. Socks and hats are another great way to use up stash. Here are some other patterns I have been looking at to use up leftovers.  Lily’s Scrap Blanket  Vintage Crocheted Throw & Afghan  Briochevron Blanket\xa0 (not sure I can do that much brioche)  Stashbuster Blarf  Stashbuster Sweater \xa0 Kelly says: Right now I have yarn all over the place.\xa0 Larger weaving cones are on a shelf in the garage and the smaller cotton, linen, etc. cones are in boxes in the garage since my only available looms are out there.\xa0\xa0Usually most of my knitting yarn is in baskets and bowls and sorted however I think looks nice. It varies.\xa0 Sometimes by color, sometimes by type, sometimes by weight. Because of the electrical work mess, some of my yarn is also in boxes/bags in the living room (where big piles of stuff are being stored).\xa0 After using an already created warp from a destash, I’ve been thinking that winding warps and storing them as warps would be a great way to have weaving projects ready to go. When the inside studio is available again I’ve thought of a system for threading cones onto chains that drape across one of the walls. I like to see my yarn in different combinations to get inspiration. The downside of this system is that there could be sun damage to the yarn if I don’t use it regularly. I’m also not quite sure of the system for getting yarn down easily without having the whole string of cones come down on my head! My stashbuster projects for using leftovers are bears for the Mother Bear Project , charity hats, and baby socks. I also find that having yarn out on display gives me other ideas for combining yarns that weren’t originally planned to go together. Another possible project for using up waste (thrums from weaving) and other leftovers are to make hot pads. One technique is to use multiple strands that are twisted and plied to create a square that is then sewn together and felted. Another technique is to wrap rope with yarn using a coil basketry technique to make a spiral the becomes a round hot pad. Both would be perfect projects for the (K)Not Along that is going until August 31). | Crochet critters, punch needle projects, finished sweaters, and listener questions are the topics for this episode.

The neck is too big. I intentionally didn’t weave in ends because I thought this might be an issue. I\'ll reknit the neckline with smaller needles, picking up fewer stitches, and doing a slightly less loose bind off. I finished first sock using Schoppel-Wolle Das Paar. Cast on for second and knit about 3 inches. I cast on for a summer weight sweater, Fine Sand by (of course) Heidi Kirrmeier. The yarn is  Fibra Natura Unity. The yoke and about 7” of body are finished. Nice yarn with some thick and thin sections that give it character.\xa0 Kelly’s Projects My Assam Cardigan is finished and I didn’t run out of yarn! The seaming I used was mattress stitch and a variation of duplicate stitch since it was knit sideways. Pull the mattress stitch tight, but make sure the duplicate stitch has your seaming stitches the same size as your knit stitches so it shouldn\'t be pulled tight. The Knot Along practice punch needle project is finished. I learned a lot. I used handspun rug yarn leftovers and it’s a good example of different colors with the same value not really having enough contrast for color work. If you look at the piece in a black and white photo you can see that the colors don\'t have enough contrast in value. I have several crochet projects finished!  Beeyanka Honey pattern was put on my radar by a listener and I snapped it right up and made it during a camping trip. I also finished 8  Mother Bears (2 were knit, 6 orcheted).\xa0\xa0 Actively in progress I have a crocheted tarantula for my nephew, the Koru Cardigan, and I’m getting ready to start a miniature punch needle project with a different kind of punch needle than the Oxford Punch Needle brand. I’ll be using crewel weight yarn. It’s a kit.\xa0 Listener Questions Fiddlewitch (Joanna) asked about “how to get more out of ravelry and tricks on using the site." She also wanted "leads on who else is doing wonderful work out there. Who are your (who are our) favorite unsung designers? " Kelly: One of my favorite Ravelry features is the advanced search. You can do an advanced search on almost anything--forum posts, projects, your own stash, patterns.\xa0 Just look for a link saying advanced search.\xa0 For example, recently I’ve been using the advanced search to find patterns from lesser known designers, particularly designers of color. First I favorited some bundles that were created by others:  Solidarity Swap Designers,  POC Designers to Lift Up. Then I go to patterns and select “ pattern browser and advanced search.” Once there, the category My Notebook on the side has “favorite bundles” as one of the filters. I also like to use gauge as a filter in order to find a pattern that matches my swatch, rather than trying to make my swatch match a particular pattern. Finding bundles to favorite in the first place is a little trickier. You can find bundles on a group’s main page or in an individual’s favorites. Ravelry VP of Operations MaryHeatherB has a great set of bundles on her favorites page. Once you favorite/heart a bundle, you can use it as a search filter.\xa0 To support makers who are people of color, you can also follow @bipocinfiber and @bipocmakers on Instagram. Also  @ladydyeyarns on Instagram has been posting independent dyers and other makers of color and who are not always as well known..\xa0 Seine1 (Kathleen) asked "I’d like to hear about some of the Rav groups you belong to." Kelly: I belong to a lot of Ravelry Groups and you can see them all by looking at the side of my profile page.

In the 80/90’s when Kaffe Fassett’s colorwork was the rage, he wrote that he didn’t bother weaving in any ends because they were on the inside. 2. Bought a shetland hat on Orkney and the woman who knit it just knotted the ends and left them. No weaving. She said after a good wash the ends stayed put. I’ll report back after wearing the hat. I always wash my finished project and lay it out on a towel on the spare bed in the shape of the pattern schematic. I then pin it in that share with T pins. If it is lace I block “aggressively” often beyond the size of the schematic. Linen goes in dryer. Here are some good videos by Suzanne Bryan. I met her at Stitches West two years ago. She is a master knitter and very informative. Here is her YouTube Channel Here are some of her videos on this topic: How to Block Knitting Blocking a Sweater (knit in the round) Blocking a Sweater (in pieces) Weaving in Ends in Garter Stitch Weaving in Ends in Stockinette\xa0 On stockinette and garter stitch I weave in the end following the stitch on the wrong side. If it’s very fine yarn I may un-ply the yarn and weave in the singles separately. Kelly: Russian Join Staci Perry, Very Pink Knits video Clasped Weft Join Louise Tilbrooke video On cotton and linen\xa0 garments I have the best luck if I weave a little and then leave a tail hanging on the inside. Duplicate stitch is the way I weave in ends if I don\'t want them to show on front or back. If you don\'t want to do duplicate stitch after the fact this technique is like doing duplicate stitch weaving in as you knit:\xa0 Knit with two strands together for 4-5 stitches or more for very slippery yarns. This is good for lace and other patterns where duplicate stitch is difficult. Cut the tails on each strand. Another way to secure ends is to use a sharp needle while weaving in ends and and split the yarn so the end is traveling inside of another yarn strand. Another tip: Don’t cut yarn cleanly--pull a little and rip the scissors blade across making a rough edge. Even with nonfelting yarn the fibers will be able to grip each other a little when this end is woven in.

More generally, a reflexive verb has the same semantic\xa0agent and patient\xa0(typically represented syntactically by the subject and the direct object). For example, the English verb\xa0to perjure\xa0is reflexive, since one can only perjure\xa0oneself. In a wider sense, the term refers to any verb form whose\xa0grammatical object\xa0is a\xa0reflexive pronoun, regardless of semantics; such verbs are also referred to as\xa0pronominal verbs, especially in grammars of the\xa0Romance languages. In the Romance languages, the\xa0pronominal verbs is a parent category\xa0with reflexive verbs as only one of its sub-categories. Other kinds of pronominal verbs are\xa0reciprocal\xa0(they killed each other),\xa0passive\xa0(it is told),\xa0subjective,\xa0idiomatic\xa0(the presence of the reflexive pronoun \xa0 In her book Splendid Apparel, \xa0Anna writes that her mother worried she thought too much about her knitting and directed her towards more academic pursuits. \xa0 Anna was educated at Harvard and taught at MIT but eventually left the academic world of the mind. \xa0 She is skeptical of brain oriented knitting and credits the hands for their own intelligence, especially in crafts. \xa0 She encourages people to understand their knitting and not just follow the rules. \xa0 She’s a bit like Elizabeth Zimmerman in that way. \xa0 But Anna also offers detailed instruction on techniques. \xa0The traveling twisted stitch is one of them.\xa0 And she’s unvented and adapted a number of other techniques \xa0 \xa0 I’ve edited out a lot of this free wheeling interview although I believe some of you would have enjoyed discussions of feminism and academic politics. \xa0 But I wanted to focus on Anna’s journey from the straight lines and head thinking of the academic world to the wandering and explorative world of her hands and her heart. \xa0 She is now an Anglican solitary who lives in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and she teaches knitting \xa0at workshops and conferences on the side. \xa0\xa0 Throughout the recording, I’ll stop and explain what I’ve edited out and where we’ll head next. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0I begin by asking her about something she said in class and writes about in her books: \xa0Knitting instructions never used to be written and learned from —They weren’t even spoken and listened to. \xa0They were demonstrated and copied. \xa0 \xa0 Just to expand a bit on hand learning versus mind learning. \xa0 Anna writes in her book Magnificent Mittens and Socks: \xa0“About learning, there is one thing to say: \xa0 it isn’t easy. \xa0It is always difficult for fingers to learn to do something new. \xa0On the other hand, when they do, they learn it. \xa0 They never forget it , unlike the mind which learns easily and forgets quickly.” \xa0 BAck to the interview. \xa0 \xa0 Even though I got the gist of what Anna was saying, I wasn’t familiar with the terms accusative and reflexive so I looked them up. \xa0In Russian, teach and learn are the same verb but a different form. \xa0 The reflexive is when something is done to oneself. \xa0Like, I perjure myself. \xa0 A person can only perjure one’s self. \xa0 No one else can do it to them. \xa0 In this instance I believe , the students teach themselves. \xa0 \xa0The Accusative is when something is done to someone. \xa0 In English we say the teacher teaches the student. \xa0 Something is being done to the students. \xa0 Like Anna says, like a mother bird stuffing the mouths of a baby bird. \xa0This wasn’t very appealing to her. \xa0 From this insight of another way of teaching, Anna was more open to teaching as a career. \xa0But as you can imagine, she didn’t approach it in an orthodox way. \xa0 A portion of the interview is edited out although I left in our discussion of climate crisis. \xa0Then we broach the subject of brain or mind learning versus the hands learning. \xa0 \xa0 I’ve edited out a large section of discussion on academic politics. \xa0 We discussed Anna\'s frustration and disappointment with teaching at MIT and her leaving it without any firm idea of how she’d make a living. \xa0She used part of this time to explore her spirituality and her interest in what has traditionally been known as\xa0“women’s work”. \xa0 She turned to quilting and sold her quilts to help \xa0 support herself flirted with getting a post doc in divinity but was not willing to return to academia. \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 As I mentioned earlier, I took Anna’s classes at Camp Stitches. Camp Stitches is a three day immersive knitting workshop with one teacher hosted by Knitting Universe usually at a luxury hotel in some beautiful place. \xa0 Yes, it’s a little spendy but what an incredible opportunity to get to know and learn from a teacher. \xa0Anna was teaching the enormously flexible technique of making a vest or sweater by knitting and embellishing strips or panels and then usually joining them as you go. \xa0 This approach allows you to design or change your mind as you go. \xa0 In addition to the overall construction, we learned Twisted travel stitches, a number of embroidery stitches,\xa0 her perfect button hole, \xa0and a variety of general knitting tips and tricks. \xa0 She teaches using the traditional way of one-on-one instruction enhanced by other approaches: \xa0she demonstrates to the class from the front of the classroom, sometimes using the board; \xa0then she goes around to each person and watches them execute the technique or coaches them. \xa0She encourages the class for the tricky parts. \xa0 She had us learn to knit and purl backwards and kept saying\xa0“You can do it. \xa0 You can do it.” \xa0And we did. \xa0In the end, our hands learned these techniques. \xa0 Anna teaches at Stitches events. \xa0 I encourage you to take one of her classes or indulge and spend a whole camp with her. \xa0 You won’t regret it. \xa0 In our next podcast, Catherine will be back and we have our classic format: \xa0What we learned from our knitting; \xa0A brainy thing; \xa0and Behind the Redwood Curtain where we live. \xa0 \xa0 Looking forward to connecting with you then. \xa0 | Brainy thing: \xa024:18 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Behind the Redwood Curtain: \xa029:40 \xa0 What we’ve learned from our knitting (and crochet): \xa0 Margaret completed her Quest Shawl by Linda Dean featured in the Jimmy Beans Advent Crochet event. \xa0 It was great fun but she was glad to finally finish it. \xa0\xa0Quest Shawl:https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/quest-shawl. \xa0 Then she completed several small projects: \xa0A\xa0souvenir\xa0from Stitches West, Rebecca Danger’s\xa0Wickedly Peaceful Polar Bear: \xa0\xa0https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wickedly-peaceful-polar-bear-christmas-ornament. \xa0 Some eggs including one by\xa0Nicky Fijalkowska in her book\xa0\xa0Knitted Birds \xa0\xa0 https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/knitted-birds-by-nicky-fijalkowska\xa0and one that Margaret freelanced on her own. \xa0 Finally, to mix up needle sizes, she finished the Jolly Wee Elf by Churchmouse Yarns and Teas \xa0\xa0https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jolly-wee-elf\xa0in worsted weight yarn and size 5 needles. \xa0\xa0 In this process she became curious about casting on small circular objects and found the following links helpful: \xa0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRHzIYEK7a8\xa0 \xa0and circular \xa0Cast on: \xa0\xa0https://knitmuch.com/4-cast-ons-for-knitting-circular-lace/ She also found a great tutorial for stuffing these items by Sarah Schira from Imagined Landscapes, famously a gnome designer: \xa0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkSFzJDULFA \xa0 Catherine sadly lost the bag with her textured blanket squares but started with a new project for the Welcome Blanket project:\xa0\xa0 https://www.welcomeblanket.org/patterns/\xa0.She’s \xa0using Caron\'s Yarnspirations in the summer berry colorway. \xa0 Brainy Thing: How do birds migrate and bees find their way?

Born and trained in couturier designing, pattern making and sewing in Russia, Tatyana migrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1989. A third-generation couturier, she started sewing at the age of 5, "helping" her grandmother with an evening dress for one of her many clients. She then applied her talents to suits, corsets, children\'s wear, evening garments and wedding gowns, but it is luxurious and sophisticated bedroom wear that has captured her passion and imagination. Her magnificent work has been described as structured, demure and as understated opulence. Tatyana is passionate about her new home country and her hand selected talented team of artisans. She is dedicated to designing and producing her luxurious garments at her boutique studio here in Melbourne under\xa0Ethical Clothing Australia\xa0standards. She also works tirelessly with global artisans to take her garments to the new level of luxury. Elegant embroidery, luxurious laces, Swarovski crystals and handmade jewellery adorn her every garment with loving care. \xa0 \xa0 | There was a time when the thought of online fabric shopping was an idea sewing and craft people would not consider or want.

There is a library based video website called Kanopy.\xa0 I found a very interesting video on spinning throughout the world.\xa0 I wanted other spinners to see it too, but they may not have access unless their library card (and their library system) grants access to Kanopy.\xa0 The reason I do not include a link here, is because it is best to access it from your library's website.\xa0\xa0 So first, if you have a current library card,go to their website and look for Kanopy, click through to it and\xa0 set up a free account. Then search and watch the video World Spinning Techniques.\xa0 If you do watch the video, you really do not need to listen to the podcast.\xa0 If you can not access the video, then there is a detailed, albeit,verbal description from when I watched the video. Or do both, I would love to have you listen in to my reactions to all the amazing things I saw in the video. The picture connected with this podcast has just slight relevance, it is three sample skeins of the alpaca fiber I have been spinning lately.\xa0 Alpaca is the first fiber talked about in the video. | I was able to do so much during this Tour de Fleece, it took two podcasts to tell you all about it.\xa0 See the previous podcast for part one of this two part series. The first fiber I talk about spinning is called Fake Cashmere, due to it softness.\xa0 It is however, 100% nylon.\xa0 I bought my fiber from a dyer whose business is Jazz Turtle.\xa0\xa0 It seems most people like to spin this fiber blended with other fibers, but I enjoyed spinning it on it's own.\xa0 Another source for the fiber is  Paradise Fibers The next fiber I worked with was a dyed merino silk batt in the colors purple and green.\xa0 Listen as I explain how I made color sequencing work for the 2 ply yarn. On the TdF challenge day, I got out the book charka, not something I have much skill with. I was able to set it up and spin some single on it for my challenge. I spent many days during the Tdf dyeing fiber, both in locks and in big pots full of fiber.\xa0 I had the amazing once in a life time experience of dyeing a color I will never be able to repeat, calico locks.\xa0 This podcast tells you how that happened. Finally for the state fair entries, I needed an art yarn and chose to spin locks into a yarn.\xa0 It was a learning experience and I share all I learned to make this yarn. At the beginning of the podcast I talk about how there will be no Spinzilla this year, but TNNA has provided these two links for spinning fund raisers:\xa0 Britspin\xa0also Spin Her Free\xa0and The owner of Purple Lamb Fibers is doing a Spin Together Oct 6 through Oct 12, 2019 Lots and lots of information in this podcast, grab a big chunk of fiber, your spinning tool of choice, and join me. | This is the first of a two part podcast, because I had so many projects to tell you about for the Tour de Fleece. In this podcast I talk about spinning cotton sliver on the Majacraft Aura, not a very traditional way to spin cotton.\xa0 My challenge day project was finally achieving those beautiful tight rolags on my blending board. I also completed two skeins.\xa0 The first was a dyed polworth from Yarn Hollow The second skein was a gray Horned Dorset fiber, which I got from Dyed in the Wool.\xa0 I talk a little about the breed too. I suggest checking out Hilltop Cloud, to get an idea of the type of rolags I was making on the blending board, but when I checked the website they are not currently in stock.\xa0 A quick search of Etsy brought up  these, and  these. \xa0 \xa0 | Here is the first of the book review only podcasts I mentioned in a previous podcast.\xa0 After years of podcasting, I realized that the book reviews will be easier to find if in their own individual podcast. This podcast reviews the book Spindle Spinning from Novice to Expert by Connie Delaney.\xa0\xa0 Links to possible sources for this book can be found on  Abe Books Also seen listed on Ebay  here In both cases, the exact listings may no longer be available, but it serves for you to see the book and description, and know how to search for it in those websites. One last link is to the fiber I talk about in the review, kenaf.\xa0 The Wiki page for it is here. | It's that time of year, and the tents are up and the vendors hopeful as the cycle of yearly fiber fairs continue.\xa0 I mention in the podcast my 'blue sky' dream of hitting them nationwide some year.\xa0 A van full of fiber to sell, and be replaced by purchases, sounds just right! The photo for this podcast shows the Pegosa alpaca fiber I am currently spinning by the lock on my Roberta. There are lots of links for the podcast, for everyone that I mentioned, be sure to check out the webpages. The Woolery, which you can find at fiber fairs and their storefront. Dyed in the Wool.\xa0 I owe Sandy Ferguson an apology for not mentioning in the podcast, her as an owner of this business too! The Alien Encounter sock pattern can be found on Ravelry, here. The Stoltman Family farm only has a FaceBook page, here. Ohio Valley Natural Fibers is the fiber processing mill I talk about. Yarn Geek Fibers has this page of dyed yarn and fibers for sale. Punkin Patch is Equinox Farm home of the crazy sheep lady.\xa0 There's a good blog on that website, where you can get you fill of photos and good writing. This is the farm from whom I purchased Bullwinkle's fleece. This blog had one post that showed Bullwinkle, he's the white sheep. This farm is also part of the breed conservancy program, Shave 'em to Save 'em, for rare breed sheep.\xa0 \xa0 | I realize that is an unusual subtitle for a postcast.\xa0 I recently had a total knee replacement surgery, and for the first 15 minutes or so of this podcast, I do talk about how the healing process delayed my spinning and fiber work for several weeks. But once the spinning wheels got going again, I had two WIP to talk about, the Pegosa alpaca project was continued and I finished spinning two fibers I had used for a project back in Sept. a babydoll Southdown and a Polworth. As promised I did one book review at the end of this podcast.\xa0 It is  Creative Spinning, a creative combination of two authors, Alison Daykin and Jane Deane. The Polworth fiber I spun is from MohairandMore.\xa0\xa0 The episode of this podcast where I review the breed Babydoll Southdown is here, episode 37. Please see a separate non podcast page on the blog for a listing of episodes of this podcast that contain book reviews.\xa0 That way I can list the episode number, and the book title, and keep it updated. Photo shown with this episode is of the southdown/polworth skeins I finished and talked about in the podcast. \xa0 \xa0 | It's official!\xa0 I have joined the ranks of retirees.\xa0 Now it is time to 'spend' my stash, or as I have decided to call it, my retirement 'fund'. We start this with a very large blanket of alpaca fiber from an alpaca named Pegosa.\xa0 The first pound is washed, but not completely processed as I am using it to test various processing methods.\xa0 This podcast talks about combing with handheld combs, and the yarn that I spun from that top. Needless to say there will be plenty more to podcast about Pegosa's fiber in the next few months.\xa0 However I have talked about alpaca in past podcasts too.\xa0 If you are interested, here is a list of episodes with links: Episode 35\xa0 Washing alpaca Episode 101\xa0  Machine washing alpaca Episode 102\xa0 Spinning alpaca Episode 108\xa0 Dyeing alpaca Episode 123 Alpaca in the dyepots One other spinning project completed since the last podcast was fiber from Homestead Hobbyist, a lovely polworth/silk blend. \xa0 | Happy New Year!\xa0 It is always full of thoughts and plans for the spinning projects ahead.\xa0 In today's podcast I talk about maintaining watch on the drafting zone to make your yarn more intentional. Watching the drafting zone will help you break out of making the same WPI yarn all the time to making art yarns that feature thick and thin singles.\xa0 All of this is the topic of this podcast. I have done previous podcasts on drafting if you care to find those and listen to them.\xa0 Just click on the links to go to them.\xa0 Episode 26 (woolen and worsted spinning)  episode 40 (spinning intentional yarn) and episode 67 (woolen spinning). Links to things I also mention in the podcast are: Book of Days, something I came across while looking up distaff day. Fellviewfibres The source of the punis I spun, made from wool and silk. The videos I viewed while researching spinning thick and thin can be found on Youtube by searching the topic. \xa0 | Links to vendors mentioned in the podcast: Stitches events\xa0in general Atlanta Ga event May 30-June 2 2019 Stitches United is on that page too.

The farm business is called Alpaca Pines and their website can be found here. There was a what I called a wood ball winder that I was unable to find online to show you. I have found out since that this item has another use, which is to hold the ball of yarn wound on to it as you knit. So the concept for it I think is to wind the yarn on it from a skein and then let it sit near you as you knit, it will rotate release the yarn. No balls of yarn rolling away from you. I was not able to find any 1500 yard one dye lot skeins of yarn online, like I saw in the market. I think this concept is a custom dye project, so if interested contact your favorite dyer, see if they can purchase the yarn in the large skein and dye it for you. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | In this discussion of what I did during the 2018 Tour de Fleece, I talk about the wool breed Zwartbles, spinning buffalo fiber on a drop spindle and finally a very rare breed of wool, Dor Galen. The buffalo fiber was included in the Clouds of Luxury from the Etsy store Sericin The Dor Galen fiber was purchased at a fiber festival several years ago from Sandy Ferguson's Dyed in the Wool \xa0\xa0 Dor Galen is no longer available, the horned dorset at the bottom of the above linked page is probably a good close substitute. \xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Join me as each time I either prep fiber for spinning, or sit at my spinning wheel.

Originally from the Houston, Texas, area, Sha came to Searcy, Arkansas and has left her mark.She began her dream of pursuing a career in the legal field in high school at her magnet school, hosting mock court sessions involving her fellow classmates. Pursuing an undergraduate degree in criminal justice just seemed to make sense. Eventually she became a Sergeant at the White County Sheriff’s Office, the highest position non-commissioned law enforcement personnel could attain. But after three years, something was missing. After being encouraged by a co-worker to applying for a position with the local newspaper The Daily Citizen, Sha decided, “Why not?”Writing has always been a part of Sha’s life-from the time she was little she remembers writing stories. She has published one book since her arrival in Searcy, and now works full-time as a journalist for The Daily Citizen, the local newspaper where The Build Guild Podcast takes place. Sha talks about the struggles with seeking out stories, changes to her writing style, and how she can never look at her work once it’s over because she feels like she got it right the first time.In this unconventional episode of The Build Guild Podcast, Sha talks us through the justice system in White County, her struggles with finding self-confidence and assurance, and keeping her voice through it all.The 60w Laser Ben and Brian bought: \xa0https://amzn.to/2LRHPgeThank you for listening to Episode 7!\xa0If you enjoyed the podcast, please leave a rating and review!Make sure to follow us on Instagram- https://www.instagram.com/thebuildguildpodcast/Social MediaBen- (https://www.instagram.com/myerswoodshop/)( https://www.facebook.com/MyersWoodshop/)(https://www.etsy.com/people/benmyerswoodshop)Coty-(https://www.instagram.com/arganic_woodwork/)(https://www.facebook.com/arganicwoodwork/)Brian-(https://www.instagram.com/fierysquirrelart/)( https://www.facebook.com/fierysquirrelart/)Sha Johnson - (https://www.instagram.com/ahseeitmedia) Email: authorsha@yahoo.com--- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  https://anchor.fm/app--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thebuildguildpodcast/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/thebuildguildpodcast/support | Episode 6 : John Godwin of Duck DynastyIn this episode of The Build Guild Podcast, the guys have the privilege of interviewing John Godwin of the wildly popular A&E tv show Duck Dynasty. \xa0Godwin is part of the Duck Commander Family.Godwin grew up in the heart of Louisiana and had childhood ties to the Robertson family after participating in a duck calling contest where Phil Robertson was a judge. As he grew up, Godwin recalls going down the wrong path and feeling like he needed to straighten up his act, but struggled to do so until Phil convinced him to follow Jesus. Godwin quickly recognized a need in his life, and chose to follow the Savior Phil talked about so easily and with such conviction.\xa0Godwin’s life has always centered on the outdoors, cultivating a love for hunting and fishing from an early age. He began working for Duck Commander in 2002 until the present. He is one of two members of the Duck Commander crew who is not a member of the Robertson family, and has recently launched Fin Commander, the fishing branch of Duck Commander. Ascribing to the ideology of “Don’t sell it till you’d hunt with it,” the Duck Commander brand emerged as a necessity for any outdoorsman. As Duck Commander’s popularity grew, the market for television appearances grew, with the team gearing up for hunting shows or outdoor channels. When the Duck Commander crew was initially approached by A&E, however, the show was a bit different from what they had in mind. A&E wanted Duck Dynasty to focus on a successful business that centered on three things: God, family, and ducks.With over 130 episodes spanning 11 seasons, the show was wildly successful. Originally the crew would film after business hours, but as the show became more popular, filming during business hours became necessary. One week’s worth of work is the shop was roughly an episode, and Godwin was a part of it all, starring in over a hundred episodes.\xa0Godwin’s story is an example of finding a vocation, honing a craft, and, better yet, finding a family along the way. Godwin’s life has been changed tremendously by the influence of Phil and the Robertsons.\xa0In this episode, The Build Guild talks with John about faith, family, and fame. From foot tattoos, wild Saturday nights, and NASCAR, this episode is an example of family and diversity within the making community that can lead to lasting friendships and change lives for the better.Thank you for listening, and if you wanted to check out the duck call John mentions in the show, check below:https://store.duckcommander.com/duck-calls/classic-commander-duck-call/Find John Godwin Here:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Gev_nIYf_a1U2Ocz_V0Dghttps://www.facebook.com/GodwintheWalrus/https://twitter.com/GodwintheWalrushttps://www.instagram.com/godwinjohn316Follow The Build Guild on all of our social media platforms:https://www.facebook.com/groups/402217757048040/https://www.facebook.com/thebuildguildpodcast/https://www.facebook.com/arganicwoodwork/https://www.facebook.com/MyersWoodshop/https://www.facebook.com/fierysquirrelart/https://www.instagram.com/arganic_woodwork/https://www.instagram.com/myerswoodshop/https://www.instagram.com/fierysquirrelart/\xa0If you want to fuel The Build Guild’s snack craving after the podcast:https://amzn.to/2XtyAnP--- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  https://anchor.fm/app--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thebuildguildpodcast/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/thebuildguildpodcast/support | Our guest host for Episode Five is Jo Ellis, the Founder and Director of Make.Do. Graduating from Harding with a degree in interior design and her MBA, Jo wasn’t exactly sure what she wanted to do after her time at Harding was over. While spending three years in Ireland as a missionary, Jo was a camp counselor during the summer. After being a counselor for a group of girls who challenged her, she offered to let the girls visit her in Dublin, not really believing they’d accept. They did. With three teenage girls in her house and unsure of what to do to keep them occupied, Jo set the girls on a task that has forever changed her own life: make pillowcases.Jo watched the girls create something that was uniquely theirs, their struggle with the creative process, and the impact the affirmation they received had on the girls. Believing that creativity is a fundamental aspect of who God is and how it is a restorative process where we find our identity, integrity, and value, Jo realized this mission could become something truly incredible. At times, Jo faced immense challenges and self-doubt, and started actually running a variation of Make.Do. out of the back of her car, loading and unloading ten sewing machines at whatever venue she was in that night. Eventually, Jo returned to Searcy and began to truly realize the mission she had dreamed of. Make.Do.’s purpose and goal are to create something while connecting to others within the community. The creating is the “Make” aspect of Make.Do., and the connections formed are the “Do.”. Jo wants those in the community who attend classes to enjoy the experience of creating something they can be proud of while working through the creative process and connecting with others through this experience of creating together. Although Make.Do. isn’t necessarily an activity for only women, Jo views it as an incredible outlet for women in the church to lead and display their talents in a validating and encouraging environment.This is Jo’s first year working full-time for Make.Do., and although she has her own artistic talents and abilities, she often will bring others in to teach a variety of classes. Make.Do.’s business model is inclusive and welcomes everyone, with suggested prices for those who can afford it and allowing those who can’t pay to participate anyway. The first female guest host on the show, Jo is an incredible example of using talents to honor God while also bettering her community along the way. Make.Do.’s logo, the lemon, is a constant reminder that if life gives us lemons to make lemonade, and maybe to “Be Createfull” along the way.http://makedocreate.org/To help sponsor Make.Do.’s Collaboration with the White County Child Safety Center at Camp Createfull coming up on June 28th, or to donate to Make.Do.’s mission, donations can be sent here:http://makedocreate.org/get-involved/fundraising/https://www.instagram.com/makedocreate/https://www.facebook.com/Make.Do.Searcy/Also, check out our new Facebook group for The Build Guild Podcast: https://www.facebook.com/groups/402217757048040/And find us on social here:https://www.facebook.com/thebuildguildpodcast/https://www.facebook.com/arganicwoodwork/https://www.facebook.com/MyersWoodshop/https://www.facebook.com/fierysquirrelart/https://www.instagram.com/arganic_woodwork/https://www.instagram.com/myerswoodshop/https://www.instagram.com/fierysquirrelart/And once again, if you want to fuel The Build Guild’s snack craving after the podcast:https://amzn.to/2IFrFnwNext episode we have an exciting guest host, so come back and join us!Thank you for listening and all of your support!Want to support our podcast?

Mark’s clientele comes from a mix of referrals from Lowe’s™ and word-of-mouth around the community. Mark began working in the contracting industry working as an installer for Lowe’s™, and then became an installer himself. New to social media, Mark is learning how to advertise his business by showcasing his projects for both his business and his own home.Similar to Coty’s family, Mark’s family is involved in the foster care system. Recognizing the juggernaut of emotions surrounding a foster child’s first day in his or her new home, Mark constructed a castle at the front of his house to make that difficult first day a little easier. The second floor of his home contains a hidden passage, spiral staircase and hidden room to add a whimsical touch to his children’s childhood.Mark’s perspective is completely unique from the other makers of the Build Guild podcast. Most notably, Mark’s tools differ from the fine woodworking tools the other Build Guild makers utilize in their daily business. As a general contractor, Mark’s tool investments occur often and are focused on transportation and durability, whereas Ben, Brian, and Coty all see their tools as lasting investments that can (hopefully) last for years before being passed on to novice makers. Mark is an incredible example of how making isn’t limited to fine woodworking but is an all-encompassing field with room for anyone with an idea or just a little bit of whimsy. His 9-5 work is impeccable, but after hours he’s created an environment where his children have a place to make their daydreams a reality.Episode 4 brings us up to speed with Coty’s journey in the Small Business Revolution™, Brian’s current (secret) projects he’s spending the summer on, and Ben’s hair-brained YouTube ideas for Mark’s house. Mark and Coty are both in need of employees for their businesses, and a resume with any relevant experience can be emailed to Markbatescontracting@gmail.com and Arganicwoodwork@gmail.com, respectively.

Growing up in Delaware, Peter’s father and mother operated a successful masonry business. Peter’s father ran the business ends and contracts, and his mother kept the books. At its peak, Romano’s Masonry had around sixty employees. Today, the business has shifted its business model to include subcontracting but manages to maintain its identity. Peter left Delaware to attend Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas. After meeting his wife at Harding, Peter and his wife moved to Colorado for a few years before Peter returned to the family business. Working at Romano’s Masonry for a few years expanded the knowledge Peter had gained through his childhood. However, after returning to Delaware, Peter felt God calling him to raise a family elsewhere. Peter and his family left Delaware to move back to Searcy with little planning and a whole lotta faith. He had no job secured, no leads on any open positions, and eventually he and his family were able to move into an old family home. The home had been in his wife’s family since the 1940s and was in desperate need of renovations. Determined to make the best of life in Searcy, Peter began teaching high school history, became a volunteer fireman, attending graduate school for his master’s degree in counseling, and renovating the family home. When Peter was unsure about how to properly renovate his home, he often turned to YouTube to help guide him along. This week’s guest host talks shop with The Build Guild about being raised by parents who owned a successful business, how YouTube has evolved the world of making, and even how each of the guys asked their girlfriend’s dad for permission to marry his daughter. 5 HP Sawstophttps://amzn.to/2WtV5cy1.75 HP Sawstophttps://amzn.to/2Jkhk12StoneFly Netshttps://stoneflynets.com/www.thebuildguildpodcast.comSupport us on patreon : www.patreon.com/thebuildguildpodcast--- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  https://anchor.fm/app--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/thebuildguildpodcast/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/thebuildguildpodcast/support | Episode Two: Look Ma, I’m on TVWhat is winning $75,000 and being featured on a reality television series like? For Coty Skinner, that dream became a reality in March of 2019 when his company, ARganic Woodworking, LLC, was chosen as one of the six contestants for the Hulu series, “Small Business Revolution,” sponsored by the highly respected marketing firm, Deluxe.Coty hadn’t always dreamed of being a maker, though. Upon graduation from a high school in central Arkansas, Coty enlisted with the United States Army. After serving in the Army for ten years, Coty pursued a career in HVAC, and then felt God calling him into ministry. After having two daughters of their own, ages 5 and 13, Coty and his wife began a new challenging and impactful ministry of their own: fostering. Being a foster parent is full of challenges and hurdles, and very quickly Coty realized a glaring obstacle: the family dining table was too small. Remembering his own teenage years and the impact conversations made at the family table had on him, he realized he needed to build a table with enough room for his family and the children they fostered. Driven by a passion for ministering to others and making sure everyone has a seat at the table, ARganic Woodworking was born. Working out of his garage, for every three tables Coty made, he donated one to a foster family in need of a bigger table. As his business has grown, Coty wants to move from making tables to creating livelihoods for teens aging out of the foster system by teaching them a trade.“The more you do, the more you learn it.” ARganic Woodworking became Coty’s full-time business this year, and several of his projects garnered local attention, specifically tables he made for a local coffee shop and creperie, Savor + Sip. His wife encouraged him to apply for the Small Business Revolution, a Hulu series sponsored by Deluxe with hosts Amanda Brinkman and Ty Pennington. Applying on the last day, with very little optimism that his company would be chosen, ARganic Woodworking was selected as one of six winners on the show. Coty’s story and business are inspiring, humbling, and reminds us that no matter where you are in your making journey, in this community, you always have a seat at the table.Thank you for listening to Week 2!

Driven by their love for making, community, and connection, Ben, Brian, and Coty invite you to take an inside look into the making world: from stealing Wal-Mart Wi-Fi to for Instagram posts to selling pencil bowls to grandma.Each of these makers bring a variety of skills into their niche of the market into the making community. The Build Guild is just evidence that everyone brings something to the table, and if you’re Coty, you just might bring the table itself. Who are the Makers?Brian Hickey is a native Arkansan who teaches art at a local elementary school. Making is his side hustle, and he devotes most of his summer breaks to it. Brian’s specialties are wood signs, art prints, and paintings. Brian currently has his shop set up in his garage and is breaking even in his business as he amasses tools and other necessities. Brian’s social media presence and content is a direct reflection of the intentionality he exemplifies in his career and craft, with him walking to Wal-Mart each day to make a post to Instagram.Coty Skinner is a native Arkansan who, after serving in the United States military, decided to return home and put down roots. He was one of six contestants chosen for season four of Hulu and Deluxe’s Small Business Revolution and hopes to put the expert advice and consultations he received from the show into practice in his business. Coty is the only full-time maker on the podcast, and he is currently working out of his own garage. Being featured on the show will provide Coty with incredible opportunities for growth, enhancement, and business savvy tactics to turn profits. Ben Myers decided to leave Pennsylvania to come to college and never looked back. Ben is a hybrid of classic woodworking in the modern era. From woodturning to turning profits on digital CNC files, Ben has cornered his market, and brings insight on the delights and downfalls of social media, viral videos, and how that translates into business.The Build Guild was created to demonstrate how three normal, average, and everyday dads are cornering their market while balancing family, fatherhood, and making. The show addresses a variety of topics from where customers come from, when your side hustle finally starts to feel like a business, to the hardships of pricing, and everything in between.If you’ve listened already, feel free to leave a review and comment!Welcome to The Build Guild Podcast.
