(1:45:30) | 2008-05-09 | Love in ActionThis is a 78-minute dharma talk from Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh in Hanoi during the “Engaged Buddhism in the 21st Century” retreat. This is the fifth talk on May 9, 2008 and the talk is offered in English. Teaching and Social WorkIn 1964, Thay was teaching at Colombia University and my friends in Vietnam asked me to return home. In Saigon there was a school (School of Youth for Social Service) to teach engaged Buddhism and serve the communities in Vietnamese countryside. An expression of Love in Action.  They did not want sponsorship from the government and didn’t want to be involved in the war. Inspired by compassion. Nonviolence and rural development. It started with 300 workers and expanded to 10,000 workers — these were volunteers. Thay shares some of the work they did during this time and where they learned to do this work. Some of these social workers died in service and there is a memorial at the Dharma Cloud Temple (Chua Phâp Van) in Ho Chi Minh City. Thay talks of the spiritual dimension to this social work. This is where the Order of Interbeing arose and Thay talks of the first members and the first ordination. In 1966, That was invited by Cornell University to teach a series of lectures. The purpose was also to help Thay get out of Vietnam and to speak out about the war in Vietnam. This was sponsored by the Fellowship of Reconciliation. After this, Thay was not allowed to return to Vietnam. At this time was intensifying and a young OI member immolated of herself - her name was Nhat Chi Mai. Also several members of the school were murdered.  The School for Social Service setup pilot villages. One village was bombed multiple times after re-building. To help with farming, health, and economics. They also setup refugee camps to assist with resettlement of thousands of people. This too is Engaged Buddhism. And we must also maintain our spiritual development. Thay remained in France and raised money to help fund the work of the school and bring awareness of the real war in Vietnam. After we setup Plum Village (1982) in France, they offered retreats for veterans, health professionals, business people, members of war-torn nations, congresspeople, school teachers, and young people. Buddhism is for all walks of society. We also reach into serving those who are imprisoned. Releasing the tension. Holding the emotion. Heal yourself.  Heal your family. This too is Engaged Buddhism. Engaged Buddhism is our business in every minute and every hour. It can even be practiced in a normal fashion, without appearing religious. Manifestation-Only BuddhismThe first practice of Right Diligence is: the negative seeds, let them sleep. Don’t water them. They become weaker and weaker. This is an art. It is the practice of Right Diligence. It is continued practice. Today we introduce the concept of manas. Sometimes this consciousness is called ‘the lover.’ It is born from a number of unwholesome seeds. For example, feelings of superiority, inferiority, and equality. We learn of subject, object, and emptiness. Thanks to emptiness everything is possible. But manas ignores this. Manas believes you have a self. It doesn’t see Interbeing. Manas is always seeking pleasure. It is always trying to run away from suffering and ignores the goodness of suffering. No mud. No lotus. Interbeing. We need the Wisdom of Nondiscrimination (gained through meditation). Linked with Right Thinking and Mindful Consumption. Changing the PegThe second practice of Right Diligence is when a negative seed does arise, we help return the mental formation to our store consciousness. How? Thay provides an example. Change the peg. Mindful breathing and invite another mental formation to arise. Coming to a retreat is a good way to water a lot of positive seeds. Create a positive environment. We can do this at home too. Listen to a dharma talk, practice chanting, | This is a 97-minute dharma talk from Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh in Hanoi during the “Engaged Buddhism in the 21st Century” retreat. This is the fourth talk on May 8, 2008 and the talk is offered in English.\xa0We begin with Thay offering a short guided meditation that encourages us to bring our attention to our father and mother inside of us.\xa0There is a school of Buddhism called “Mind Only” and that school studies our mind in depth. Another name is “Manifestation Only” school. No birth and no death. We are not a creation, we are only a manifestation. What does Thay mean by “manifestation” and how is it present in our lives? Before things manifest themselves they can be conceived in the form of Seeds. Bija. When the seeds manifest themselves, they become dharma. Samskara. This teaching of manifestation only could be easily applied in our daily life. And this is part of the practice of engaged Buddhism. In work. In family. In the May 7 talk, we explored the 51 forms of mental formations. Seeds.\xa0This is illustrated with the story of a young couple where the woman is pregnant with a child. Thay recalls her niece who was pregnant and how she used the Lotus Sutra to nourish her unborn child by reciting the sutra regularly.\xa0In Buddhism, we learn that understanding is the foundation of love. How do we practice this within our families? We can adopt loving speech. Concrete examples of how to do this is offered. We learn of the “Peace Treaty” used in Plum Village. And of flower-watering, or selective watering. It can be practiced in on our own.\xa0What is buddhanature? Do we all have buddhanature? Illustrated by a couple who lives in Paris. They are well to do and have been married a long time. But they are not happy. They do not know the art of selective watering. How language and loving speech can impact their relationship. The language of love.\xa0We receive a lesson on writing a letter of love. Thay shares the story of giving the monastics a “homework” assignment to write a letter to their parents.\xa0Conditions of happiness. We have more than enough conditions of happiness. The practice of mindfulness is very crucial. The Five Mantras. Darling, I know you are there and it makes me happy. A young man who suffered greatly because of his father — they were very rich but his father was not available to his son. His father was completely absorbed with his business. The young man asked for his father to present for him. Darling, I am here for you. That is what he was asking of his father. To love means to be there. Your presence.\xa0True love. Overcoming pride. In Plum Village we have a formula, a practice, for overcoming anger. Asking for help. The fourth mantra.\xa0The Buddha in your wallet.\xa0Story of Mr. Trung from many centuries ago in Vietnam who had returned home after being gone in the army a long time. A tragedy of misunderstanding and miscommunication. Wrong perceptions. They did not know how to practice the fourth mantra.\xa0After 9/11 Thay tried to get America to practice the fourth mantra. Only a few days after 9/11, Thay gave a talk on holding our anger in Berkeley, California. To help people to calm down. Collective anger and collective fear. This is very dangerous. We calm down first and then practice the fourth mantra.\xa0Loving speech and deep listening is effective for anyone in relationship, including nations. This is engaged Buddhism. | This is a 82-minute dharma talk with Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh\xa0from Hanoi during the “Engaged Buddhism” retreat. This is the third talk on May 7, 2008 and the talk is offered in English.\xa0Walking MeditationHow can we enjoy walking? How can we use breathing?Every step is life.\xa0Every step is a miracle.\xa0Every step is healing.\xa0Every step is freedom.\xa0We learn how to use this gatha with our walking - whether alone or in a group.Photo by Paul DavisSeven Factors of AwakeningThe Buddha taught of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.\xa0Buddhism is about enlightenment and mindfulness is already enlightenment. Awareness of breathing is already enlightenment. \xa0We explore mindfulness, joy, and ease. How does this link with the Four Noble Truths?\xa0Ill-being and well-being. Relaxation, lightness, and peace. We have methods for\xa0reducing stress. This is the path - The Path of Well Being. We have very concrete practices to assist. \xa0For example, the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. In this talk, we touch on several of the methods for breathing. This is a Noble Path.You don’t have to be a scholar, you simply need to be a practitioner. We have all experienced ill-being. How can we do this as practitioners?\xa0Engaged Buddhism in VietnamAbout 39-minutes into the talk, we turn back toward the history of engaged Buddhism. In\xa0the 1950s, Thay began writing about religious belief and society. In the mid-60s, we established the Order of Interbeing arising out of war and ideologies. \xa0We can look at the precepts of the Order as a direct response. What is the teaching on views from the Buddha? To be free from views is a basic foundation of Buddhism. In 1965, I wrote the book Lotus in a Sea of Fire. The war in Vietnam was raging. Our enemies are not man, it is hate and violence. We needed more international support to hear us say we don’t want this war. The peace movement in Vietnam was the lotus. The book was released underground in Vietnam. Sister Chân Không was arrested for having the book. In 1964, we also establish the School for Youth and Social Service to focus on education, health, economics, and organization.\xa0Thay shares of the creation of a new group for today’s youth - now known as Wake Up! \xa0And there are also new courses coming from the Institute of Applied Buddhism. These are building upon these early days in Vietnam.\xa0If you appreciate this teaching, please consider\xa0making a donation\xa0to support the ongoing efforts of the online monastery.

This is the second talk on May 6, 2008 and the talk in offered in English. We begin with a teaching on mental formations and the roots of our ill-being before moving toward the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.\xa0Samskara.\xa0A Buddhist technical term. Means formation. Physical, biological, and mental. What is a formation? Recognizing that all formations are impermanent. When we observe a formation, we should be able to see this impermanent nature.\xa0Mental FormationsIn the Plum Village tradition, we talk of 51 mental formations. There are positive formations - compassion, loving kindness, joy, etc. These are wholesome mental formations. As practitioners, can we recognize and help them to manifest? We also have negative mental formations - craving, anger, hate, jealousy, etc. In our practice, we refrain from watering these negative formations. Further, there are also indefinite mental formations - they can be wholesome or unwholesome.\xa0Practicing meditation is a way to recognize the mental formation. Thay teaches examples of how to do this practice of awareness with mental formations. Mindfulness. In the present moment.\xa0BijaThese are seeds we all carry. For example, we have a seed of anger. It may not be present as a mental formation right now, but it is a seed in our consciousness. These seeds can become a mental formation. Learning to water the wholesome seeds so they may arise as a mental formation.\xa0The two layers of consciousness - Store and Mind. The seeds live in store. With the practice, we can water wholesome seeds in store and help them manifest into kind consciousness. Thay teaches this is greater detail along with concrete examples.\xa0Mindfulness of our mental formations. An example of depression. No fighting between mindfulness and depression. It is simply to recognize. And then to embrace with tenderness. This is the energy of depression. And this is the energy of mindfulness. This is our practice. Supporting through non-duality and non-violence. Both seeds are you. You are both depression and mindfulness.\xa0Mindfulness, Concentration, InsightIn the Sutra the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, the Buddha teaches to begin with the body. Today we move into the second realm of practice. Aware of the feelings and emotions. And then take good care of them. Mindfulness has the function to recognize, to hold, and bring relief. It also carries the energy of concentration.\xa0Mindfulness leads to concentration. With concentration, you can take a deep look at your feelings and the. discover the roots of what is. This brings insight - liberation. This only comes if you have strong concentration. This begins with mindfulness.\xa0Roots of Ill-Being and the Noble Eightfold PathComing home to the present moment. To recognize ill-being as it is. The first noble truth. Through looking at ill-being, we can discover the second noble truth. Craving. Hate. Ignorance. Wrong perception. Lack of communication. What is the cause of our ill-being? Do we know how to live like a Buddha? To bring a spiritual dimension to our daily life?\xa0What are the methods of removing wrong perceptions? Even in the case of war and terrorism.\xa0Consumption, developing countries, large populations, meat industry, and learning to reduce our consumption. From the roots of ill-being we can discover the path. By practicing deeply the first and the second noble truths we can discover the fourth noble truth. Using the Five Mindfulness Trainings to guide us. Protecting life and the practice of love. Thay offers a summary of the Five Mindfulness Trainings.\xa0In the noble eightfold path, the Buddha recommends Right View. This is the insight of interbeing. And once you have this insight, you discover Right Thinking.\xa0Right Speech. Right Action. Engaged Buddhism can be seen in the light of the Four No... | A gentle and kind teaching from Thich Nhat Hanh on the merits of the breathing and sitting meditation. Hanoi, 2008. | For the Fifth International Buddhist Conference in May 2008, the Venerable Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh was invited to offer the opening keynote address. The event took place at the\xa0National Convention Center, Hanoi, Vietnam with the theme Buddhist Contribution to Building a Just, Democratic and Civilized Society. Hosted by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and co-organized by International Organizing Vietnam Buddhist Sangha and National Coordinating Committee for the United Nations Day of Vesak. The date is May 13, 2008 and both audio and video are available below. The talk is 53-minutes.\xa0Promoting PeacePracticing Buddhism is the art of being peace, the art of promoting peace, in the society and in the world. We all should learn this art.\xa0We all have elements of war in our body. Practicing Buddhism is recognizing these elements so that we can then transform these elements. In the\xa0Sutra on Mindful Breathing, the Buddha provided us the practice to release the tension in our body. It only takes a few minutes. If we can release the tension in our body, then our body can learn to heal itself. When we make peace body, we can begin to make peace with our feelings and emotions. Do you know how to recognize your emotions? This is the art of making peace with ourselves. Our body, and our feelings and emotions. The Buddha also taught in this sutra how to recognize and transform our mental formations. The Buddhist practice means going home to oneself. To restore peace. How does this work in the family setting? Or in the school setting? Why is it important for parents and teachers to learn this art of being peace?\xa0Deep Listening and Loving SpeechDuring our time teaching in the west, we have also taught\xa0listening with compassion and using\xa0loving speech\xa0to restore communication. In Plum Village, we have practiced this intentionally with groups in conflict - Israelis and Palestinians. What is outlined above is used to illustrate practical application with these groups. In Mahayana Buddhism, we have the Bodhissatva Avalokiteshvara - the bodhissatva of compassion. They do this practice in order to suffer less.\xa0Right View is the view of dependent co-arising, no-self, interbeing. Practitioners should always remember to maintain this right view in their daily life. How does this look between a father and a son? We learn that suffering is not an individual matter. Everything this is linked to everything else. To protect other species on earth, and the earth itself, is to protect ourselves. This is the insight of interbeing.\xa0The Five Mindfulness TrainingsThay reminds of Unesco’s Manifesto 2000 which Thay helped to create with several Nobel Peace Prize laureates. There are six points and has been signed by 75-million people. This arose from the teachings of Buddhism and are very similar to the\xa0Five Mindfulness Trainings. If we practice these, we will have peace in ourselves and in the world. Just signing is not enough; we need to put it into practice. This is why we recommend forming ourselves into communities - in our families, schools, workplace, and within governments. These can all become a sangha and bring these six points (and Five Mindfulness Trainings) into practice.\xa0The practice of deep ecology, mindful consumption and the Five Mindfulness Trainings. The trainings also teach us not to exploit people or the earth. We have been talking a lot about peace, but we have not done\xa0enough for the cause of peace. Whatever we can do in terms of thinking, speech, and action could be considered as an offering to the Lord Budhha. As an example, we learn how Deer Park Monastery in California is using solar energy and having car free days. Reducing consumption, learning to live more simply, and to have more time to take care of oneself and our beloved ones is very crucial and is the way of peace.\xa0Living happily in the present moment. And taking care of the present moment is taking care of the future. | This 71-minute dharma talk in the Ocean of Peace Meditation Hall takes place on Sunday, February 8, 2004. The monastic and lay community are practicing together during the 2004 Rainy Season Retreat from January 4 to March 14 at Deer Park Monastery. Both audio and video versions are available with this post.Thay has received many letters from those participating in the retreat. Some contain joy and some contain their difficulties. We begin with a review of some of these letters and picks three questions.\xa0If nothing is created and nothing dies, where is the beginning? What are the elements that form the beginning?Continuing the teaching on the sixteen exercises of mindful breathing in the recent weeks. The last four are about perceptions, and this question is about our perceptions. A contemplation on the nature of reality. The objects of our perception, and look deeply, in order to touch the ultimate dimension.\xa0I often feel I have no reason to continue to live. If there is no birth, no death then I feel ready to live.\xa0This question too has to do with the ultimate dimension. This too is a good object of meditation. We can inquire about our body and our mind. We can water the seeds of love and understanding. This question is very important.\xa0For 15-years I have been working as a medical doctor with two other doctors in a health center. We provide care for immigrants, refugees and people who are destitute. The more patients who come, the more it costs the health center because the government only pays for a few per year. This leads to many long days, house calls, and financial challenges. Personally, I am tired and stressed out.\xa0We can have compassion and willingness to help, but this can lead to burnout. We cannot continue like this. Thay shares a story of the congressman who practices walking meditation in the capitol.\xa0How do we respond? The first thing is to look at how do we organize our day. We have to know how to preserve ourselves in order to continue. We do this with our practice - eating, walking, etc. Do we allow time for this? Can we incorporate into our daily life? The next step is to call upon others to help. We don’t need to do this alone. We could learn how to setup a Sangha to nourish our practice - an island and refuge for us.\xa0Last time we spoke about how to take care of our feelings. The four exercises in the realm of feelings are about knowing how to bring the feeling of joy and happiness.\xa0Five Kinds of Energy or the Five Powers\xa0Faith (or confidence/trust)\xa0DiligenceMindfulnessConcentrationInsight\xa0We begin to learn about store consciousness and the seeds contained therein. Followed by our mind consciousness and selective watering. Appropriate attention. Positive and negative seeds.\xa0Let us use the five power to create the source of happiness. And we can add “letting go” as the sixth power.\xa0Now we come to the 7th exercise - recognition of the mental formation. That feeling or emotion has its base in store consciousness as a seed (bija). The first function of mindfulness is to be aware, to recognize. It is a practice of love.\xa0RecognizeEmbraceReliefTransformation\xa0In the seventh exercise, we are only doing the first step above.\xa0https://youtu.be/o6KTb0QMyJ8If you appreciate this teaching, please consider making a donation\xa0to support the ongoing efforts of the online monastery. Please make a note with your donation that it was because of this talk. | This 74-minute dharma talk in the Ocean of Peace Meditation Hall takes place on Sunday, February 1, 2004. The monastic and lay community are practicing together during the 2004 Rainy Season Retreat from January 4 to March 14 at Deer Park Monastery. Both audio and video versions are available with this post.In the process of renewing Buddhism, many people disagreed with me. Today, Thay offers some words on renewing Christianity. The teaching of living deeply in the present moment is also very clear in the gospel. We should take care of today. Living happily in the present moment is possible. Our basic practice during this Rainy Season Retreat is this: living happily in the present moment. If the Buddha is there, the pure land is there too. If God is there, then the kingdom of God is there too. This practice is not difficult. Mindfulness will help us be in the present moment. Thay proposed that theologians and Christian teachers offer us the teaching and practice to help us live in the present moment. The same is said to Buddhist teachers. Walking and contemplating in the pure land or the Kingdom of God. Then we no longer have to run after fame, power, wealth, and sex.\xa0The teaching should be embodied by the teacher. The life of the teacher can then be authentic. If you are Dharma Teacher, you have to embody the teaching of living happily in the present moment. If you want others to be able to stop suffering and to live happily. Every moment of our daily life can be seen as a miracle. Thay offers a few examples of how we embody the practice.\xa0If you are beginner, a new practitioner, there are brothers and sisters who are more experienced. And these more experienced practitioners can show how we can live in the present moment. Mindfulness and concentration bring about happiness, solidity, understanding, and compassion. And this will nourish us and the other people around us. We can help those around us. Thay offers some examples of how this is practiced. Practicing is helping the sangha.\xa0There are those who have received the Five Trainings, and yet sometimes there are those who have not\xa0 received the trainings who may be more solid in their practice. We can learn from these students because their present in the sangha is a blessing too. It makes the sangha more beautiful and a better refuge. It’s not because of have received the Five Trainings that makes us more important. Anyone can be the teacher. Our teacher is a little bit everywhere. Signlessness. Not caught by the form. The same is true for the Order of Interbeing member - those without the brown jacket may be better practitioners than us. When we wear the brown jacket, we have to be more careful and embody the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings. Our real value, as members of the Order of Interbeing, is how we practice these trainings. In order to do this, we have to be solid in our daily practice and see our teacher in others. As members of the Order, we have a duty of setting up a sangha. We have to do the work of sangha building. The sangha is protecting and supporting us. So, whether you have received the Five Trainings or not, whether you have received the Fourteen Trainings or not, whether you have received the Ten Novice Precepts - we need a sangha.\xa0Daily Practice worksheet - there is a column for each day. And in the evening before you go to sleep, we can evaluate our practice. We start with waking up - when you woke up, did you practice? Were you aware and present with waking up. In the teaching, we continue through the other parts of the day where we can enjoy and practice in each moment - putting on your shoes, folding your blanket, opening and closing the door, etc. There are also verses (Gathas) of practices.\xa0During this retreat, we have been learning about how to take care of our body and our feelings through the Exercises on Mindful Breathing proposed by the Buddha. We are learning how to handle our feelings, | The monastic and lay community are practicing together during the 2004 Rainy Season Retreat from January 4 to March 14 at Deer Park Monastery. This 95-minute event took place outdoors at San Dieguito County Park, Solana Beach in the afternoon of\xa0Saturday, January 31, 2004. Because the event is outdoors, there is some wind noise on the microphone from time to time. Both audio and video versions are available with this post.00:00:00 Slideshow of Alms Round (music)00:01:51 Chanting00:10:15 Introductory Words from Thay on Asking QuestionsAre we supposed to spend all our time in the here and now?How to help someone get rid of the anger?How do we practice to do the right thing, even when it is difficult?How do we practice when someone we love dies?\xa0Can there ever be a positive benefit to anger?How do we keep a balance with the practice and personal fulfillment, especially in professional efforts?How do I forgive myself?\xa0Sometimes I have difficulty in believing in myself; how do I believe in myself?My son wants to marry a Catholic and I want him to be in front of our ancestors first; what can I do?What do you think of humans living in this place and time; the wrong frequency?00:19:25 Dharma Talk in Response to the QuestionsThe past is already gone, and the future is not yet here. There is only the present moment. Being in the present moment doesn’t mean you can’t learn from the past nor that you can’t make plans for the future. We can be grounded in the present moment and not get lost in the past or the future. The past can even be the object of your practice in the present moment.\xa0Suppose you have anger at your grandmother, in the past, and she is no longer alive today. But if you practice deeply you can see she is still alive inside of you - in every cell of your body. Nothing is lost. We can practice to heal our suffering and out anger.\xa0Understanding and compassion are the answer to our anger. Where does anger come from? It arises from the things we consume. We can practice mindful consumption to protect ourselves and our families from anger. This is the first thing to do when practicing when anger. The second second part is to work on transforming the anger that is already present inside of us. The fifth mindfulness training can help us practice with consumption.\xa0It is important to not suppress our anger; this can be very dangerous. We use the energy of mindfulness to recognize and embrace our anger. This is much safer. Then we can learn to use loving speech to better express our feelings. Thay shares how to go about skillfully responding to another person with whom we are angry. Some think the energy of anger is a powerful tool, but this can be dangerous.\xa000:58:19 You might think your practice of meditation might contradict your eagerness to succeed in your career. How to practice and succeed in your business? These can come together perfectly. Business leaders suffer like any other person. And if they suffer less, they can succeed more in their business. Career does not need to be an obstacle for your practice. There are ways to practice in order to have time for your families, your practice, and your business and career. Thay shares a story of offering a retreat for members of congress and some methods for practicing mindfulness in the work environment — mindful walking and mindful breathing. Taking care of yourself is taking care of your career. Mindfulness brings about understanding and compassion. Happiness is possible only when we have good communication, mutual understanding. Employees should be taken care of in the same way we take care of our families.\xa0Practicing with our grief. Our true nature is the nature of no-birth and no-death. Illustrated by a cloud in the sky.\xa0The last story of the dharma talk is one of a Vietnam veteran who attended a retreat in the 90s and shared about having killed some children during the war.

She has written about her work in a new book, The Inner Work of Racial Justice: Healing Ourselves and Transforming Our Communities Through Mindfulness. | Writer and longtime Zen student Lawrence Shainberg joins Tricycle Editor and Publisher James Shaheen to discuss his new book, "Four Men Shaking: Searching for Sanity with Samuel Beckett, Norman Mailer, and My Perfect Zen Teacher."

In it, he argued\xa0 that mindfulness practice has been commercialized, and reduced to a mere “self-help technique.” His new book, McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality, offers an argument against the mindfulness movement, claiming that corporations have embraced the practice in order to advance a neoliberal agenda.\xa0Here, Purser strikes a more balanced tone and discusses the good and bad of the mindfulness movement, explains what he means by the catch-all term McMindfulness, and presents his view that mindfulness has an untapped potential to bring about real social change. | At the age of 36, the Tibetan Buddhist meditation master Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche sneaked out of his monastery in Bodhgaya, India, in the middle of the night to live as a beggar and traveling yogi. The story of how he left behind his privileged lifestyle for a four-year wandering retreat is told in the new book, In Love With the World: A Monk\'s Journey Through the Bardos of Living and Dying, which he co-wrote with his student and Tricycle’s founding editor, Helen Tworkov.  Tworkov sits down with James Shaheen, Tricycle’s publisher and editor, to discuss how she helped Mingyur Rinpoche tell his story, the near-death experience that transformed his life and teachings, and how seeing the small deaths we experience each day can help us alleviate our fears of dying. They also discuss the origins of the magazine and how the Western Buddhist landscape has changed over time. | In recent years, school mindfulness programs have sprung up across the country, setting off a debate about whether the nominally secular programs derived from religious practices violate laws about the separation of church and state.In her new book, Debating Yoga and Mindfulness in Public Schools, Indiana University Bloomington religious studies professor Candy Gunther Brown takes a look at the history of the separation of church and state and the mindfulness movement and makes the case that mindfulness programs have overstepped their bounds. While she does not recommend that the programs should be banned, she argues that making them mandatory is unconstitutional and that students must be asked to opt-in to the classes. (Even opt-out options, she claims, place an illegal burden on the students.)Here, Brown talks with Tricycle Editor and Publisher James Shaheen about how her view, the legal precedents set from the school prayer debate, and the claims that mindfulness is a form of “stealth Buddhism.”This episode is sponsored by Maitripa College. www.maitripa.org | Acclaimed travel and spirituality writer Pico Iyer has written\xa0two new books about his life in Japan, Autumn Light (Penguin, April 2019), and the forthcoming A Beginner’s Guide to Japan: Observations and Provocations (Penguin, September 2019). Iyer views the books as complimentary: while Autumn Light describes his experience within the culture, A Beginner’s Guide offers his perspective as an outsider. Since marrying and moving in with his wife in her home city of Nara three decades ago, Iyer has become one of the foremost translators of Japanese culture to Western audiences. Iyer discusses his latest books as well as the way impermanence colors Japanese life and what it means to try to understand other cultures at a time when the term globalist has become, in many parts, a dirty word. | On February 19th, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an executive order designating military zones along the West Coast and laying the groundwork for US authorities to remove citizens of Japanese descent from their homes and imprison them in camps. While it is widely acknowledged that racism was central to this shameful chapter of American history, the role of religious discrimination cannot be overlooked, says scholar and Soto Zen priest Duncan Ryuken Williams. Here, Williams joins Tricycle Editor and Publisher James Shaheen to discuss his new book, American Sutra, how Japanese Americans stood up for religious freedom, and how this disturbing legacy of persecution has taken on new relevance. | Acclaimed scholar of religion Elaine Pagels discusses the role of faith today, the practical consequences of religious ideas, and what led her to ask, "Why Religion?" with Tricycle\'s editor and publisher, James Shaheen.Pagels is the Harrington Spear Paine Foundation Professor of Religion at Princeton University, a MacArthur Fellow, and a best-selling author who won the National Book Award for her groundbreaking 1989 work, "The Gnostic Gospels." Her latest book, "Why Religion? A Personal Story" explores why religion has persisted through a blend of meticulous research and an earnest exploration of her own struggles with faith and grief. | Feeling burnt out does not make you a failure. That’s the first thing Buddhist teacher and former tech executive Lawrence Levy would want you to know. Burnout, Levy says, is a healthy response when our human needs aren’t being met. As the former Chief Financial Officer of Pixar, Levy knows what it means to have a demanding job. But it was during his many years practicing in the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism that Levy began to find a way to apply Buddhist principles to the difficulties that we face in our everyday lives, leading him to co-found Juniper, an organization devoted to making meditation and the dharma accessible in a modern context. Here, Tricycle Editor and Publisher James Shaheen talks to Levy about the importance of continuous self-care in a mutually supportive environment and how meditation, learning, and connection can help us tend to the conditions that lead to burnout. | Women have a lot to be angry about. A history of inequality and violence in the Buddhist world and beyond persists to this day. The question remains: what can we do with that anger? Lama Tsultrim Allione says that we have the ability to transform it into a source of strength and clarity—and that goes for all of us, not just women. Known in good part for her work exploring feminine power in Tibetan Buddhism, she examines the figure of the dakinis, fierce feminine embodiments of wisdom, and how they challenge the dominant role models for femininity in Western culture. Lama Tsultrim, who was once Allen Ginsberg’s meditation teacher, has written a new book called Wisdom Rising: Journey into the Mandala of the Empowered Feminine.  Here, Lama Tsultrim talks to Executive Editor Emma Varvaloucas about mandala meditation as well as her personal struggle to rediscover Buddhism’s fierce female role models and advocate for equality in a male-dominated culture.', 'chan_desc': 'Conversations with contemporary Buddhist leaders and thinkers', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts118/v4/29/4c/65/294c6594-6366-de3c-5b73-192c54df6ebd/mza_7828580918729951289.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2014-12-17'}}

Life, like baseball, is a team sport. In baseball, it\'s not just about the pitcher. In life, it\'s not just about me or you. All the players and contributing causes and conditions come together to score runs in a dominating offensive win or through a defensive no-hitter. In life, we can\'t do anything on our own. Baseball can break your heart and fill you with hope. Life can turn from bad to worse in a day, minute, or hour, because of the impermanent and sometimes unsatisfactory nature of it. No matter the pitch, we keep swinging until we get a hit. And we keep playing through the season. | In this episode, we talk about Bodhicitta. Bodhicitta characterizes the path of a Mahayana practitioner. It is Bodhicitta that creates a Bodhisattva and it is Bodhicitta that ultimately creates a Buddha. In Tibetan, compassion is translated as the nobility or greatness of heart which implies wisdom, discernment, empathy, unselfishness, and abundant kindness. Bodhicitta is compassion working with a mind awakened by right view. It is the joining of compassion and emptiness. We\'ll examine how to use the Four Bodhisattva Vows to supercharge Right Intention with Right View and discover the same spacious freedom of a flower that blooms despite its circumstances. \xa0 | In this special guest episode, join me in a conversation with Dena Moes, the author of the book The Buddha Sat Right Here: A Family Odyssey Through India and Nepal. Listen as we share some laughs, talk deep Buddhist philosophy, explore the difference between Indian and U.S. cultures and the way children are raised, and how in India there is a complete incorporation of interdependence as a reality, not a spiritual concept. Sample a taste of Dena\'s award-winning book that is equal parts travelogue, spiritual discovery, and internal pilgrimage into new ways of thinking about family life, love, and spirituality. | In this special podcast, we\'ll revisit the topic of "Right Speech" through a reflection and practice tip from my upcoming book. We\'ll focus on how right speech depends more on listening than speaking. Speaking is dualistic. Listening is a non-dual activity of Oneness. Most of the time, the reason we speak is to speak TO or AT someone, expressing ourselves to the other. And, frequently, expressing how they ARE the other. And so much speaking is completely unnecessary. The trick is to maintain an open awareness when listening. Deep listening requires guarding your internal chatter, judgments, and reactive responses. When you are truly listening, you are totally engaged. And when you are engaged, your conversation partner will feel heard.\xa0 \xa0 | What is a perfect day? A perfect relationship? Join me for a discussion of perfection in a podcast featuring a wedding Dharma talk. Stay until the end to respond to the challenge of making your own vows, allowing for the perfection of \'the other\' in all your relationships. The perfection of life exists in impermanence and interdependence—the very things that end up messing with our plans. A perfect relationship happens at the intersection of person, place, and time. And can only happen when each person allows the other person, the place, and the time to unfold just as life nudges it to unfold. Allowing everything to be as it is, while remaining an open, non-judgmental participant, enables something beautiful—like a shared laugh or surprise—to arise out of the perfect now. | In this episode we\'ll talk about the 7th and 8th steps of The Noble Eightfold Path, Right Mindfulness and Right Meditation, also called Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. It takes one to know the other and it all starts with an openness of mind. Studies show that meditation seems to cease the activity of the lobes in the brain that determine where self ends and non-self begins. Meaning, meditation can dissolve our sense of separateness and heighten a sense of interconnection. This is the intention we should hold when we practice meditation. Again, it all starts with awareness. Being aware of what IS. The Buddha did not teach enlightenment as escape to another world and meditation as its vehicle. No, the Buddha taught that enlightenment is truly seeing and being in the life you are in. | The Three Jewels: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. I think many connect with the *jewel* or treasure aspect of the Buddha and Dharma, but Sangha? The Buddha taught the Dharma as an experiential path. His advice is to try it for ourselves, rather than taking his or anyone else\'s word for it.\xa0 It is Sangha that moves Buddhism beyond a study or philosophy to something lived and alive. But you have to practice or it doesn\'t work. Sangha is where you perfect your practice with others doing the same thing. We come just as we are. Working on practices, not being people who are already perfect. The Sangha accepts us and supports us so that we can become more honest with ourselves and others. We learn to accept ourselves AND others. We accept our humanity, together. \xa0 | In the 4th of the "talking with my teachers" series, I am talking with Rev. Satya Robyn, a priest in the Amida Order, about how the whole of messy humanity is met by the divine when we relax our sense of control and know that life accepts us just as we are. Satya talks of her journey from atheist to psychotherapist and Pureland Buddhist priest. And how she was "grabbed" by Amida, the celestial Buddha of Infinite Light and Life, the Buddha of acceptance and compassion. She describes the simplicity of Pureland Buddhism and the practice of the Nembutsu, where in saying the name we open a little portal of connection to the compassion and wisdom of Amida Buddha. I know you\'ll delight in Satya\'s beautiful ways of communicating the heart and soul of spiritual practice, Buddhism, Pureland Buddhism, refuge, and—yes—the "f" word or faith. \xa0 \xa0 | Meditating on death is a traditional Buddhist practice. In this podcast, we\'ll talk about how thinking about our own and others\' death can help us live more fully. All the things that keep us busy and entertained might help us forget about the certainty of death, but it won\'t help us escape it. Reflecting on death can help us remember that the "shiny" things we find attractive and desirable will soon lose their appeal. We can try to avoid the suffering the thought of death brings or we can look at it directly and make ourselves familiar. I offer an Everyday-Buddhism approach to death meditation that does not include spending a night in Tibetan charnel grounds or even your local cemetery. Instead, reflect on the lives that go before us and feel the realness of live and death through visits to legacy.com. w | The "Eastern Way" of psychology offers a profoundly different paradigm than Western psychology. Join me as a talk with Gregg Krech, one of the leading authorities on Japanese Psychology in North America, about this difference. Using the Buddhist concept of "skillful means", Japanese psychology offers methods to master the skills of acceptance, attention, co-existing with unpleasant feelings, and self-reflection. Rather than talking it out, we can develop skills to cope more effectively with anxiety, depression, anger, shyness, procrastination ... you name it! Ultimately based on the practical, we can learn how to focus on our purpose and an appropriate response to the needs of each situation, rather than a reaction to our feelings—removing our feelings from the position of "Director" in the play of life. \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Wendy Shinyo Haylett, a Buddhist teacher, lay minister, life and mindfulness coach shares the "tips and tricks" found in Buddhist teachings to make your professional and personal life better ... everyday!', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/f8/76/9a/f8769ac5-8c6c-a6aa-db2c-8b1e40dd2ac5/mza_2901515502162130591.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-06-18'}}

Already the impacts of climate change have turned into a genuine ecological crisis. A growing group of people are asking out loud, if the recent string of dire government-backed climate reports are too conservative to accurately describe the real dangers ahead of us. What if, in fact, we are on the fast track toward both an ecological & civilizational collapse, and it\'s already too late?

Thus, generosity is fundamentally a state of mind. Our goal would be to completely condition our mind to giving. It is conditioning our mind to wish to be the gift, the blessing, the miracle for other living beings. The practice of generosity entails generating, in various ways, the intention to give and steadily increasing this generosity, even though you may not be actually giving something away to others.\xa0 Buddha once said, “If beings knew, as I know, the results of giving, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of selfishness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared”. There are many ways to practice generosity—by giving material things, spiritual teachings or care for the sick, saving the bugs or animals in danger and giving love. In an era in which we are always advertised to, spurring our attachment and over-consumption, generosity is a much-needed practice. Giving our material possessions helps to diminish attachment and craving, which increases our peace and good fortune. In general, there are Four Ways to Give:\xa0\xa0 -Materially -Dharma -Fearlessness (saving living beings from harm or caring for the sick) -Love Fools don’t praise generosity;\xa0 Misers don’t go to the world of gods.\xa0 The wise rejoice in generosity\xa0 And so find happiness in the hereafter.

If we lack mindfulness of our words, we can cause another to believe something negative about themselves that they carry their whole lives. We might end a long friendship with only a few sentences motivated by anger. in the episode, we learn how to become mindful of our words and purify our speech of four downfalls. This can change our lives so completely. Where there was once drama and confusion, there can be peace and stable relationships. Some might even say that if we purify our speech, we will purify our world! The four downfalls of speech to try to let go of: Lying Lying is when someone else—the recipient of the lie—comprehends the meaning of the lie. The motivation is your desire to misrepresent your perception. The performance of the lie can be through speaking, through choosing not to speak, or through gesture. It is said that even causing others to engage in the three non-virtuous types of speech—lying, divisive speech, or offensive speech—is the same as doing it yourself.\xa0 Divisive Speech Speech that divides others.\xa0 Offensive Speech This when we speak in an offensive manner. The performance is saying something unpleasant, which may be either true or false. Senseless Speech This is speech about a topic that is not meaningful. For people who speak falsely,\xa0 Who transgress in this one way,\xa0 And who reject the world beyond,\xa0 There is no evil they won’t do.

All the teachings of Buddhism help us to develop and refine these two qualities. Also, we can use wisdom or compassion to help us to work on our problems, like anger, anxiety or an attachment causing us great pain. In this episode, we look at wisdom and compassion and ask ourselves, Who am I? Who do I want to be?\xa0 Wisdom realizing emptiness is realization that leads to enlightenment. Buddha taught that the ultimate nature of all things is emptiness. Our reality is empty of something that we normally perceive, but what is it empty of? When we say our glass is empty and ask for more, the glass is empty of something. Is it empty of\xa0 water or tea? This is the same with the emptiness of reality; it means our reality is empty of something. We ask then, “reality is empty of what?” Buddha taught that our reality is empty of inherent existence. Nothing exists inherently, independent of its name or without our minds perceiving it. A wine glass, for example, is not inherently a wine glass. Someone from a culture that has never seen a wine glass might see it as a vase flowers or a bowl for food. If no one ever gave it the name ‘wine glass’ it would not be a wine glass. The object is empty of existing inherently as a wine glass, but it does exist as a wine glass conventionally; it exists as mere name or imputation by conception. This also means the wine glass is full of possibilities for how it can exist.\xa0 This state of infinite possibility is true of our self also. If we even get a taste of our self being empty, it opens up infinite possibilities for our us. We can be anything. We can exist in any new, healthy way we can imagine. We can believe with certainty that we can become a Buddha and set out on the journey to become a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva is someone who has universal compassion and has determined to become a Buddha for the benefit of all living beings. Who are you? Who do you want to become? \xa0 Blind is this world;\xa0 Few see clearly here.\xa0 As birds who escape from nets are few,\xa0 Few go to heaven. (174)\xa0 \xa0 Swans travel the path of the sun;\xa0 Those with psychic powers travel through space; The wise travel forth from the world,\xa0 Having conquered Māra and his army. --Buddha, The Dhammapada \xa0 Reference  Buddha.The Dhammapada.

Wisdom Publications, Somerville, 2014.    | The world that appears to us depends upon our mind: our mental habits, our views and beliefs. In this episode, Buddhist Teacher, JoAnn Fox, talks about how to purify our mind and specifically how to purify our negative karma. We can create a new mind and a new world by purifying negative karma and taking positive actions toward creating the life we really want.\xa0 Karma means action. Actions that caused harm to others in the past create our present painful feelings and experiences. We can purify the negative karma we’ve created in the past through the following purification meditation, which also involves a special mindfulness practice in daily life.\xa0 Meditation to Purifying Negative Karma has four parts:  Power of regret (sometimes translated as the power of release). Generate the strong wish to purify a specific action in the past causing you suffering, that is perpetuating your current way of being that you wish to change. Power of reliance: Pray for help to any holy being you feel connected to or simply pray, thinking “please help me to purify this.”\xa0 Power of opponent force: means we do something to oppose the negative karmic. In this meditation, you can simply perform the following visualization as an opponent force. You can also recite the mantra of purification before the visualization. The short mantra of Vajrasattva is “Om Vajrasattva hum.” You might recite this many times, a few times, or 100 times using a mala (Buddhist rosary).\xa0 Then visualize a holy being of light comes to the crown of your head. This holy beings sends out liquid light, which enters your crown. The purifying light travels down your central channel, pushing the negative karma down and out of your body. Power of Promise: Make a promise to yourself to refrain from a certain negative or unhelpful behavior for a specific amount of time (a day or a week).\xa0  Whoever recovers from doing evil\xa0 By doing something wholesome\xa0 Illuminates the world\xa0 Like the moon set free from a cloud. (172)\xa0 \xa0 Whoever replaces an evil deed\xa0 With what is wholesome\xa0 Illuminates the world\xa0 Like the moon set free from a cloud.

In this episode, we try to get a taste of the experience of emptiness— the true nature of reality. The correct view of emptiness is one of three prerequisites for the practice of Buddhist tantra (in addition to renunciation and bodhicitta.) Over time, we try to develop this correct view of emptiness which allows us to experience this world as perfect and all living beings as perfect. Like a rainbow appearing in the sky, a real experience of emptiness ushers in a new world for us, one without stress, insecurities or isolation.\xa0 Do not follow an inferior way;\xa0 Don’t live with negligence.\xa0 Do not follow a wrong view;\xa0 Don’t be engrossed in the world.

This is because intentions cause actions. What is the highest intention a human can have? Only the most benevolent intention can create actions so powerful it can radically transform us. In this episode, we look at a human’s ultimate potential and the intentions that ripen it.\xa0 It’s easy to do what is not good\xa0 And things that harm oneself.\xa0 It’s very difficult to do\xa0 Things beneficial and good.

Wisdom Publications, Somerville, 2014. | The three principal aspects of the Buddhist Path are the prerequisites for the practice of Buddhist tantra. These three are renunciation, bodhicitta and the correct view of emptiness. In this episode, we look at the mind of renunciation. The Tibetan term for renunciation is translated as “definite emergence”. What are we emerging from through this practice? We emerge from dissatisfaction and suffering. If you\xa0 look up renunciation in the dictionary,\xa0 the definition is something like, “ to formally give something up or reject something.” Renunciation is not the same as giving up pleasure or denying ourselves happiness. It means giving up our unrealistic expectations about ordinary pleasures. What we want is happiness all the time. We expect the external world to provide us with endless sources of pleasure and contentment. Check if this is true. We never want to be in pain, be angry or bored or sick. We want to be happy all the time. So we seek out the things that make us happy. A romantic partner appears to make us happy, but sometimes they make us crazy or miserable. Perhaps we then find a new romance and for a while it is wonderful... the grass is greener, firmer. We are in love! After a while, we find this grass is thinning; in fact, it is receding! They are not as attractive as they once were to us. Do we then seek ANOTHER partner? We are like a shark that can not stop moving, can not sleep, always hungry and looking for another source of happiness. We want a new car. Then we want a boat. We want a delicious meal, but then we are hungry again. In this ordinary cycle of dissatisfaction, we are always looking for happiness. Definite emergence is learning to create happiness. Renunciation is not giving up pleasure, but developing a mental attitude that no longer relies on transitory pleasures to give us happiness. We have to seek happiness from within to find a lasting source of happiness. Renunciation is to stop expecting ordinary pleasures to give us lasting happiness. It is these unrealistic expectations that cause the things that give us pleasure to turn into pain.\xa0 There is nothing wrong with pleasure. The happiness that comes from sense objects--beautiful tastes, smells, people, experiences--is a result of our good karma. It is the misunderstanding that happiness and problems are external to our mind that pollutes our mind and causes us pain and dissatisfaction. True satisfaction is not dependent on things or people. Satisfaction comes from inner acceptance of the way things are, even appreciation of the way things are. The mind of definite emergence, renunciation helps you loosen your grip on external things and relax. You become simpler, more easy-going. We turn away from our ordinary preoccupations and start to focus on cultivating our mind’s potential for peace and happiness. Renunciation creates space in our mind for spiritual practice. When we create happiness with our mind by changing the way we are perceiving something, we create a bridge out of darkness, of definite emergence. Every time we practice mindfulness and apply a teaching to solve our problems it is an act of definite emergence. When we merely look for happiness this is not a bridge, not an act of definite emergence. This week we try to build as many bridges as possible, thinking each day “How can I create happiness?” How can I create happiness right now? We let what unfolds throughout our day pose this question and answer it, many times. \xa0 Oneself, indeed, is one’s own protector. What other protector could there be?\xa0 With self-control\xa0 One gains a protector hard to obtain. \xa0 By oneself alone is evil done.\xa0 Born of oneself, produced by oneself, It grinds down those devoid of wisdom,\xa0 As a diamond grinds down a gem. (161)\xa0 \xa0 They who cover themselves with their own corrupt conduct,\xa0 Like a creeper covers a tree,\xa0 Do to themselves\xa0 What an enemy wishes for them. (162)\xa0 \xa0 It’s easy to do what is not good\xa0 And things that harm oneself.\xa0 It’s very difficult to do\xa0 Things beneficial and good. —Buddha, The Dhammapada References References  Buddha.The Dhammapada.

Wisdom Publications, Somerville, 2014. | Buddhist Tantra is a set of methods to quickly attain realizations of the true nature of reality (emptiness), universal compassion and great bliss. In this introduction to tantric practice, Buddhist Teacher, JoAnn Fox shares some of the fundamentals of the two stages of tantra: generation stage and completion stage.\xa0In generation stage, we imagine dissolving our ordinary sense of self and all our ordinary appearances into emptiness. We try to have some taste--some wisdom experience--of emptiness. From emptiness we imagine we arise, like a rainbow appearing out of a clear sky, as a pure being with a body of light. We imagine we have universal compassion for all beings, feel \xa0 blissful, and perceive all beings and all things in this world as pure. When we have a pure mind, free from habits like desirous attachment, Just as the mind of anger appears an unpleasant person, a pure mind sees the fundamental purity of all things.\xa0 In completion stage practice of tantra, we learn to manipulate the subtle energies of our own body. Harnessing our subtle energy system, the chakras and so forth, we can cause blissful states of consciousness that can easily penetrate the veil of reality and realize emptiness. \xa0 If one knew oneself to be precious, One would guard oneself with care.\xa0 The sage will watch over herself\xa0 In any part\xa0 Of the night. (157)*\xa0 \xa0 In first establishing himself\xa0 In what is proper\xa0 And only then teaching others,\xa0 The sage will not be stained. (158)\xa0 \xa0 As one instructs others,\xa0 So should one do oneself:\xa0 Only the self-controlled should restrain others. Truly, it’s hard to restrain oneself.

Wisdom Publications, Somerville, 2014. | Buddhist tantric practice is a method for quickly gaining realizations like great compassion and wisdom. In this episode, we explore the stage of tantra in which imagine our self as an awakened being. Called generation stage tantra, this is a technique for becoming more and more familiar with the thoughts and actions of an enlightened being until awakening is actualized through much-repeated practice. Ultimately tantra is a quick method to realize emptiness and compassion for all living beings.\xa0 In the meditation, we imagine our body and mind becoming a wishfulling jewel filled with light and as vast as the universe. We also try to perceive the experiences of our life, our thoughts, pleasant/unpleasant feelings, and this body as clouds passing through our vast, sky-like mind. We then contemplate the suffering of someone or a group of living beings. We try to imagine what it is really like for them, what their days and nights are like, until we generate heart-felt compassion. Then we imagine this compassion causes our mind to expand and become a wishfulfilling jewel, radiating light and as big as the universe. We then send light rays out to each and every living being, imagining we bring them temporary happiness and then the lasting inner peace of awakening.\xa0 We can do this tantric meditation every day if we wish. The point of this type of practice is to experience and awaken to our true nature, great compassion and wisdom, which is intrinsically present in everyone. For our daily mindfulness practice, can send light rays from our heart to anyone we see suffering at any time. We do not need to close our eyes to do this practice, just send them light. We can also try to experience our mind as sky-like and our feelings and thoughts as clouds, just passing through. In this way, we can feel a little less affected by our passing feelings. The person of little learning\xa0 Grows old like an ox:\xa0 The flesh increases,\xa0 But insight does not. (152)\xa0 \xa0 Through many births\xa0 I have wandered on and on,\xa0 Searching for, but never finding,\xa0 The builder of [this] house.\xa0 To be born again and again is suffering. \xa0 House-builder, you are seen!\xa0 You will not build a house again!\xa0 All the rafters are broken,\xa0 The ridgepole destroyed;\xa0 The mind, gone to the\xa0 Unconstructed, Has reached the end of craving!

Translated by Gil Fronsdale. Shambala, 2011. pp. 21-22. | The root cause of all our suffering that we do not take enough time, through mindful observation, prayer, and meditation to come to know ourselves -- our true, awakened nature. Our true nature is wisdom and great love and compassion. We contemplate death and impermanence as a way to relate to our true nature, which is more than this body and this life. We are a traveler, bound beyond this life. If we can relate to our deeper, spiritual self, we naturally want to care for it. How do we care for our true nature? Only through spiritual practice. Whether you believe in an afterlife, reincarnation or nothing beyond death, it’s still very valuable to live our lives with an awareness of our mortality. It helps us to prioritize our lives. When we come to the time of our dying, won’t most of us want to feel we have led a meaningful life? Will we not wonder, is the world is a better place because I was here? Realizing that we will someday die helps us discover--AND ACT ON--what is most important to us.\xa0 Today may be our last. There is no guarantee we will see tomorrow. This way of thinking can motivate us to live this day like it is our last! We hug our loved ones tighter and we are truly present with them. Is it any wonder that a University of Kentucky study found that “thinking about death fosters an orientation toward emotionally pleasant stimuli.” The researchers who conducted the study, C. Nathan DeWall and Roy F. Baumeister, said, “We have shown that the common response to contemplating death is a nonconscious orientation toward happy thoughts.” Awesome! Buddha was right :) If we believe that our spiritual awakening for the benefit of all living beings is the most meaningful function of our human life, then becoming mindful of death can lead to the conviction that we must practice today. Further, the realization that our true nature is unconditional compassion breaks through the feeling we are not enough. Like the acorn and the great oak tree, and the acorn becomes angry at itself because it can not yet provide shade or shelter like the giant oak. We can discover that the acorn is the same nature as the oak tree, even if it is still in the process of development. Likewise, we are in the nature of enlightenment, of great compassion and wisdom, even if we are still in the process of awakening. Why the laughter, why the joy,\xa0 When flames are ever burning?\xa0 Surrounded by darkness,\xa0 Shouldn’t you search for light?

Even though things are rarely how we would like them to be - within, or in our personal lives, or in the greater world - we have the potential to let go of our resistance, grief, or anger, and feel more relaxed, at ease, grateful, and enthusiastic. In this sense, working towards real happiness is far from selfish; it makes us much more able to respond compassionately and skillfully, and therefore it benefits others. | In my enthusiastic endorsement of shikantaza or, "just sitting," I may have given the impression I think a real Zen student would only sit shikantaza, and there’s no place in Zen for paying attention to, learning from, and working with your thoughts and feelings in meditation. I think it\'s fine to use multiple types of meditation in your practice, and there’s no reason you shouldn’t devote some or all of your meditation time to mindfulness of your thoughts and feelings, if you find that fruitful. | So sorry... no time to produce a new episode for you this week, but there\'s still something for you to listen to! I’ll be giving the Dharma Talk at San Francisco Zen Center this Saturday, Sept 14th. Livestream the talk at 10:15am Pacific, or watch it later, or download it as a podcast. Visit http://sfzc.org/teachings/video/live-streaming-media, or simply search online for “San Francisco Zen Center Dharma Talks.” My working title for the talk is “A Passionate Sermon for Buddhists in a Time of Crisis.” | I continue study of 13th-century Zen master Dogen’s essay, Bodaisatta Shishobo, "Four Ways Bodhisattvas Embrace Living Beings." In Episode 105 I gave an overview of the essay and defined the bodhisattva’s four “embracing actions:” practicing nongreed, loving words, beneficial action, and “being in the same boat” as other beings. In Episode 106 I took us through the part of the essay on nongreed, or giving.\xa0Today I cover the section of the essay on loving words, or kind speech. | If we\'re lucky, our practices of meditation and mindfulness give us some sense of spaciousness, stillness, and silence. What about when we engage in activities more complicated and demanding than potentially calming manual tasks like weeding the garden, sweeping, or washing the dishes?\xa0Zen master Dogen teaches us a better way to practice in the midst of activity: maintaining joyful mind, nurturing mind, and magnanimous mind. These qualities have the potential to grow even stronger as we get busier. | We do not have retreat from appreciation of conditional or material things in order to live an enlightened life. However, we must diligently turn the lens of practice onto all of our relationships to things and to beings. Learning to see and accept the impermanence of all things and yet to “enjoy them incredibly” is a wonderful practice opportunity. | Of course, traditional Buddhism doesn’t say anything about mass shootings per se, but it does present teachings on human nature, behavior, and choices. In this episode I discuss the Buddhist of view of how and why people do horrible things, pointing out how Buddhism is realistic but also optimistic, and how a Buddhist view can help relieve some of our fear and despair. | The “Five Skandhas,” or aggregates, are the five aspects of a human being: Form, the body; Feelings, our positive, negative, or neutral reactions to stimuli; Perception, the basic process of labeling or identifying things; Consciousness, awareness of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, and thoughts; and Mental Fabrications, all of our active processes of mind. The Five Skandhas aren’t so much a teaching in an of themselves as they are a tool for exploring the teaching of Anatta, or not-self. | Buddhism includes values of Right Action and Right Livelihood, generosity, goodwill, and compassion, and Mahayana Buddhists vow to free all beings from suffering. It\'s not easy to enact these values and aspirations in the modern world, which is so complex we find ourselves complicit in causes of suffering simply by participating in society, or by neglecting to stand up for change. How do we find and enact our best response to the world\'s suffering without getting overwhelmed, depressed, or discouraged?', 'chan_desc': 'Learn about traditional Zen and Buddhist teachings, practices, and history through episodes recorded specifically for podcast listeners.

Luke 22:29 has Jesus tell the Twelve "I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred on me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."

Was it an escape from death and direct abduction to heaven like Hercules, Romulus, Empedocles, etc. not to mention some old testament figures who escaped death?

This seems extremely odd from any kind of Christian perspective. Is God calling character witnesses at judgment? How exactly is the Queen of Sheba relevant? What qualifies her to provide any input: she is presumably a pagan, even if she recognized Solomon\'s wisdom some thousand years earlier? And what is it she\'s supposed to do? She rises from the dead, scans the crowd comprising "this generation"--apparently judgment is being handled by generation for administrative efficiency--and confirms that, yep, anyone who didn\'t recognize Jesus as superior to Solomon should indeed go to hell?How do you translate Mark 14: 33-34?What would you require as substantial proof that an historical Jesus existed?

Doesn’t Genesis 6:19 imply a significant diminution in the power of God who, a few chapters before, had CREATED all living things? Why round up all the animals? Couldn’t God have just created them anew after the flood? We know that Zoroastrianism had a profound impact on second temple theology, but could the reverse have also occurred. Could the angel mythology and sacred fires of the first temple cult have influenced Zoroastrianism? Do you know people who actually have memorized the Bible, all of it, and could demonstrate it? | 1 Timothy 4:3,4 says, "the inspired word clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith...\xa0They forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods that God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving ... " (New World Translation) . Who is the author talking about? And, what "inspired word" does he have in mind (I can\'t find one that says this)?\xa0Could you speak about the earliest\xa0state adoption(s) of Christianity and the impact this had on the\xa0development and trajectory of the faith?What is your opinion on the historicity of Mary?What is “Abraham’s bosom” as found in Luke 16:22-23? What is the historical context and background reasoning for why Jesus is depicted as using Psalm 82 as a proof text in John 10?\xa0Do you have any book/article recommendations on calendars in the ancient world? Is the contradiction between Acts 9:7 and Acts 22:9 simply a problem of the KJV translation?We speak of Christian borrowing from pagan sources, but are there cases where pagans borrowed Christian elements?Is there a clear verse or agreed upon interpretation in Christianity that states that if an “hidden” sinner or unrepentant person exists in the congregation, the Holy Spirit will leave til he is gone? | Do you think the Bible teaches a literal burning hell, or is it more a metaphor like outer darkness? Matthew reads this way in this NIV, "From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it." Does this refer to the rapid expansion of the gospel faith or to the persecution of its preachers?Matt 10:23 says, “truly I say to you, you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.” Does this mean that the preaching work will not be completed before Jesus comes back to judge everyone? If so, it seems unfair to those who didn’t get the chance to hear it. You’ve explained that the bible is a patchwork of various authors writing in different times, different styles, and for various purposes using the same characters, or variations on similar themes. This is just like the reboots, retcons, and contradictions in superhero comics, rightProverbs 3:5, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding." (KJV) seems to me to be a rather ingenious bit of priestcraft, as on the surface, it admonishes believers not to think things through for themselves, so by inference, they ought to leave that to the ecclesiastical authorities. Think so?What is going on with the connections in the gospels between Jonah, John the Baptist, Oannes, and Peter—and the waters?Can you remind me, what is the historical context and meaning of the prohibitions listed in Acts 15:19-20?MythVision Podcast video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSJ64C7dk0k', 'chan_desc': 'Dr. Robert M.

Purser opens the book by questioning elements of the movement that have lead to its success: its scientific credibility, its secular façade, the prevailing discourse in society around stress, and other topics. Purser’s main concern, however, is that mindfulness is being used to reinforce the capitalist system by absolving companies of any responsibility for its negative consequences, for example work-related mental health problems, and shifting full responsibility onto the shoulders of the individual. Purser also points out how mindfulness is being used in questionable ways in schools, the US military and national governments. Purser ends the book by discussing his vision of a revolutionary, socially-minded, collective-based form of mindfulness. Full of humor and eye-opening anecdotes, McMindfulness is a thought-provoking book that forces readers to look at the mindfulness movement in a new light.Learn more about your ad choices.

Gorvine provides a multifaceted analysis of Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen (1859-1934), one of the most prominent modern representatives of the Tibetan Bön tradition. Engaging two written versions of Shardza’s life story as well as oral histories gathered during fieldwork in eastern Tibet and Bön exile communities in India, Gorvine explores the ways in which Shardza has been represented and what such representations can tell us about the religious communities in which Shardza operated as well as the genre of religious biography more generally. In the process, Gorvine also provides an accessible introduction to Bön, a religious minority that remains understudied by scholars of Tibet. This book will be of interest to those who are interested in religious biographies and how they related to the religious, literary, and historical contexts in which they were produced.Catherine Hartmann is a PhD candidate in Buddhist Studies at Harvard University.

Founded in the 1930s by a group of teachers focused on educational reform, Soka Gakkai has since evolved from its grassroot origins as a movement inspired by Nichiren Buddhism to a highly significant source of influence in contemporary Japanese education and politics. In Soka Gakkai’s Human Revolution: The Rise of A Mimetic Nation in Modern Japan (University of Hawaii Press, 2018), Levi McLaughlin argues that Soka Gakkai comprises a great deal more than Buddhism and is instead best conceived as the product of “twin legacies” – lay Nichiren Buddhism and modern Euro-American humanist imports. Drawing on nearly two decades of archival and non-member fieldwork in the Soka Gakkai communities in Japan, McLaughlin offers a comprehensive study of the new religious movement and suggests a new framework which understands Soka Gakkai as mimetic of the nation-state in which it took place. To demonstrate this argument, McLaughlin traces in his book Soka Gakkai’s Human Revolution the history of the movement from intellectual collective to religion and examines their creation of new religious canon, such as Ikeda Daisaku’s The Human Revolution, as well as pedagogy in the movement through standardized education and the Soka Gakkai idea of women as Good Wives, Wise Mothers.Daigengna Duoer is a PhD student at the Religious Studies Department, University of California, Santa Barbara.

Berthe Jansen's study of monastic guidelines is the first study of its kind to examine the genre in detail. The book contains an exploration of its parallels in other Buddhist cultures, its connection to the Vinaya, and its value as socio-historical source-material. The guidelines are witness to certain socio-economic changes, while also containing rules that aim to change the monastery in order to preserve it. Jansen argues that the monastic institutions’ influence on society was maintained not merely due to prevailing power-relations, but also because of certain deep-rooted Buddhist beliefs.Learn more about your ad choices.

Why would the Chinese Communist Party revive this former ritual? What powers lie in the symbolism of the “Golden Urn”? Why was this tradition invented? Using both archival sources in the Manchu language and chronicles of Tibetan elites, Max Oidtmann answers these burning questions and reveals in Forging the Golden Urn: The Qing Empire and the Politics of Reincarnation in Tibet(Columbia University Press, 2018) the origins of the Golden Urn tradition, as well as its implication in modern and contemporary geopolitics of Asia. In the book, Oidtmann highlights the original polyglot conversations that existed in the Qing era and suggests to see the Qing as colonial: that there was a deliberative process that lay behind the invention of the Golden Urn in 1792 by the Qing empire to possess a monopoly over diverse forms of divination and prognostication practiced at the crossroads between China, Tibet, and Mongolia.Daigengna Duoer is a PhD student at the Religious Studies Department, University of California, Santa Barbara.

Drawing inspiration from evolutionary biology and media theory, Veidlinger’s book begins by isolating some particular traits that were unique to (or at least most well-developed in) early Buddhism, and then tracing how these traits were particular well-suited for transmission in two specific historical, cultural, and communicative contexts: namely, communities in early India and along the Silk Road in the first centuries of the Common Era. His book concludes with a lengthy exploration of the ways that the Internet Age represents a third such epoch, and propounds the provocative theory that the technological, discursive and affective aspects of internet use can make frequent users more receptive to Buddhist ideas. Given this contemporary focus, we conclude our interview by considering the way(s) that Veidlinger’s theory can accommodate, and even respond to, the fact that the internet has also been used to foment hatred and divisiveness in the last three years of American history.Christopher Jensen teaches Buddhism and Chinese Religions at Carleton University.

These are some of the questions you will ask yourself while reading Remembering the Present: Mindfulness in Buddhist Asia (Cornell University Press). In today’s podcast, Prof. Julia Cassaniti takes us on a tour of three Theravada Buddhist countries (Thailand, Myanmar and Sri Lanka) to show us how mindfulness is understood in this region and what this, in turn, can teach the West about its own understanding of the concept.

We are especially familiar with those haunting images of the face of King Jayavarman VII, represented in the stone sculptures of the Bayon temple in Angkor Thom. Archaeologists and historians tend to relate the history of the Angkorean era through the dynasties of great kings. These are, of course, all male images. But this apparent maleness of the Angkorean state contrasts with one of the paradigms of Southeast Asia as a cultural zone: the comparatively high status of women. Ashley Thompson addresses this apparent contradiction in her new book titled, Engendering the Buddhist State: Territory, Sovereignty and Sexual Difference in the Inventions of Angkor (Routledge, 2016).

Focusing on the reasons women became nuns, their age at ordination, and the work they performed as nuns, Prof. Grumbach argues that women used ordination as a way to build and maintain homes rather than as a way to “leave home.” Autobiographical writings by women, historical and biographical information about nuns, and medieval literature are used to show that ordination and family life were not opposing categories for many women, suggesting that we need to revise our understanding of what it meant to be a “nun” in medieval Japan.Originally recorded on 22 September 2012(c) 2012 The Institute of Buddhist Studies and Lisa GrumbachAn audio-only version of this talk is also available.", 'chan_desc': 'The Institute of Buddhist Studies Podcast is a digital archive of audio and video recordings of academic lectures and Dharma talks.
