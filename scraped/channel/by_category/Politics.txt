Susan Glasser, the magazine’s Washington correspondent, notes that Republicans have attacked the inquiry but have not exactly defended the substance of Trump’s phone call to Zelensky. Joshua Yaffa, who has been reporting from Kiev, notes Ukraine’s disappointment in the conduct of the American President; Jane Mayer describes how an impeachment scenario in the era of Fox News could play out very differently than it did in the age of Richard Nixon; Jelani Cobb reflects on the likelihood of violence; and Jill Lepore argues that, regardless of the outcome, impeachment is the only constitutional response to Donald Trump’s actions. “This is the Presidential equivalent of shooting someone on Fifth Avenue,” she tells Remnick.\xa0 | On Monday, the\xa0Wall Street Journal\xa0reported that\xa0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\xa0was on the line for President Trump’s July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian President,\xa0Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump urged Zelensky to assist in an investigation into Trump’s political rival,\xa0Joe Biden. Pompeo, a fierce Trump loyalist and the last surviving member of his original national-security team, is now implicated in\xa0a scandal that threatens Trump’s Presidency.\xa0Susan B. Glasser\xa0joins Dorothy Wickenden to discuss the rapidly unfolding Ukraine story and Pompeo’s place within it.\xa0 | Senator Cory Booker burst onto the national scene about a decade ago, after serving as the mayor of the notoriously impoverished and dangerous city of Newark, New Jersey. To get that job, Booker challenged an entrenched establishment. “My political training comes from the roughest of rough campaigns,” he tells David Remnick. “You just won’t think it’s America, the kind of stuff we had to go up against. And it [was] such a great way to learn [that campaigning] has to be retail—grassroots. And so much of this, in those early primary states, is about that.”\xa0\xa0Booker spoke with Remnick about growing up black in a largely white area of New Jersey, where his parents had to fight to be able to buy a home; about his long relationship with the Kushner family, which started back when Jared Kushner’s father, Charles, was a leading Democratic donor; and why he’s proud to collaborate with even his direst political opponents on issues such as criminal-justice reform. “Donald Trump signed my bill,” Booker states. “I worked with him and his White House to pass a bill that liberated thousands of black people from prison” by retroactively reducing unjustly high sentences related to crack cocaine. “Tell that liberated person that Cory Booker should not deal with somebody that he fundamentally disagrees with.”\xa0Note: In this interview, Senator Booker asserts, “We now have more African-Americans in this country under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.” The historical accuracy of this comparison has been challenged. More accurately, the number of African-American men under criminal supervision today has been compared to the number of African-American men enslaved in 1850.\xa0 | This week, evidence emerged that Trump tried to enlist the help of a foreign power to discredit his political opponents—in this case, Democratic Presidential hopeful\xa0Joe Biden. Further disclosures revealed that the President may have been aided in his efforts by his personal lawyer,\xa0Rudy Giuliani,\xa0Vice-President Mike Pence, and\xa0Attorney General William Barr. On Tuesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump, saying that he had betrayed his oath of office, the nation’s security, and the integrity of U.S. elections.\xa0Jeffrey Toobin,\xa0Jane Mayer, and\xa0David Rohde—three\xa0New Yorker\xa0writers who have reported extensively about the Administration—join Dorothy Wickenden to discuss the case against Trump, and how his inner circle may have helped jeopardize his Presidency. | People of color have suffered disproportionately under cannabis criminalization, and social-justice advocates have played a major role in the push for legalization; Michelle Alexander’s book “The New Jim Crow” changed many people’s minds on this issue. But, as the legal cannabis market takes off into a multibillion-dollar economy, this “green rush” is likely to leave behind those who suffered. An entrepreneur in New York tells the staff writer\xa0Jelani Cobb\xa0that “while we’re waiting [for legalization], huge corporations are . . . working on their packaging, how they’re going to come to the market. If we don’t have that same freedom, how is it fair?” Cobb reports on how legalization bills are seeking to address that historical inequity. In Oakland, California, a bill stipulates that half of dispensary permits must be awarded to people who have been harmed by criminalization in the past. But one businessman tells Cobb that, without access to capital, would-be dispensary owners will be shut out, and will likely end up selling those permits for cheap. | This past Saturday,\xa0a series of air strikes in Saudi Arabia\xa0damaged more than a dozen oil installations, including one of the most critical oil-production facilities in the world. The attack threw global fuel markets into disarray. Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed that they launched the strikes, but they have long been armed by Iran, fuelling conjecture that the attacks were carried out by Tehran.\xa0Robin Wright\xa0joins Dorothy Wickenden to discuss how Iran views U.S. policies in the Gulf and how the\xa0Trump Administration\xa0has unwittingly strengthened the regime’s hard-liners. | An exodus is under way in the House of Representatives: not even halfway into the congressional term, fifteen Republicans have announced that they will not run in 2020. One of the exiting members is Will Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer who was elected in 2014. His district in Texas includes nearly a third of the state’s border with Mexico. Although he is reluctant to criticize the G.O.P. directly, Hurd tells the Washington correspondent\xa0Susan B. Glasser\xa0that he thinks the President’s border policy is ineffective: a wall isn’t the answer, Border Patrol is underfunded relative to the area it covers, and the technology in use for border security is both out of date and overly complicated, “requiring a Ph.D. in computer science to operate,” he says. “I wish I could pass a piece of legislation,” Hurd tells Glasser, “that says you can’t talk about the border unless you’ve been down to the border a few times.” Hurd’s departure is particularly significant because he is—for the sixteen months he has left to serve—the only African-American in the House Republican caucus, and he worries that the President’s negative rhetoric toward people of color is contributing to a demographic shift that’s turning Texas from deep red to purple. “When you have statements the equivalent of, ‘go back to Africa,’ ” Hurd notes, “that is not helpful.”\xa0 | One of the big stories of the 2016 presidential election was the rupture within the Republican Party. "Never Trump" traditionalists lost their fight to prevent the nomination of Donald Trump, but a small faction still strenuously objects to his scorched-earth style and many of his policies. Earlier this month, Catholic University hosted a debate between two prominent conservatives representing two distinct visions. On one side, the constitutional lawyer and\xa0National Review\xa0staff writer David French, a voice for traditional Republicanism who sees Trump as a threat to democracy. On the other side, Sohrab Ahmari, the op-ed editor of the New York\xa0Post\xa0and who fervently supports the president and describes politics as "war and enmity." Benjamin Wallace-Wells joins Dorothy Wickenden to discuss what their opposing positions mean for the future of the Republican Party. | The New Yorker’s\xa0fiction editor, Deborah Treisman, talks with Salman Rushdie about “Quichotte,” his apocalyptic quest novel. A few years ago, when the four hundredth anniversary of “Don Quixote” was being celebrated, Rushdie reread Cervantes’s book and found himself newly engaged by a much-improved translation. He immediately began thinking of writing his own story about a “silly old fool,” like Quixote, who becomes obsessed with an unattainable woman and undertakes a quest to win her love. This character became Quichotte (named for the French opera loosely based on “Don Quixote”), who is seeking the love of—or, as she sees it, stalking—a popular talk-show host. As Quichotte journeys to find her, he encounters the truths of contemporary America: the opioid epidemic, white supremacy, the fallout from the War on Terror, and more. “I’ve always really liked the risky thing of writing very close up against the present moment,” Rushdie tells Treisman. “If you do it wrong, it’s a catastrophe. If you do it right, with luck, you somehow capture a moment.” At the same time, the novel gives full rein to Rushdie’s fantastical streak—at one point, for instance, Quichotte comes across a New Jersey town where people turn into mastodons. Treisman talks with the author about the influence of science fiction on his imagination, and about his personal connection to the tragedy of opioids. Rushdie’s much younger sister died from the consequences of addiction, and the book is centrally concerned with siblings trying to reconnect after separation. | After more than two years of debates and one deadline extension, the United Kingdom is set to leave the European Union on October 31st. Last week, with no Brexit deal in sight,\xa0Prime Minister Boris Johnson\xa0moved to suspend Parliament for five weeks leading up to that deadline. The move outraged members of Parliament and spurred\xa0a revolt in Johnson’s own party, resulting in legislation that may prohibit him from executing a no-deal Brexit. Johnson has called for a general election, though he no longer has the legislative majority he needs to force a vote. Sam Knight joins Dorothy Wickenden to discuss the week in Parliament and what it might mean for the future of British democracy.', 'chan_desc': "A weekly discussion about politics, hosted by The New Yorker's executive editor, Dorothy Wickenden.\n\n", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/59/2b/ce/592bcea6-20f3-099d-1613-6ccd86f42ff4/mza_6017913097191788954.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2014-03-08'}}

It is typically understood as a form of deep inner prejudice — something that people actively feel and consciously express. My guest today, Ibram X. Kendi, wants to redefine racism. He defines the idea simply: support for policies that widen racial inequality.Kendi is a professor of African-American Studies and director of the Antiracist Policy Center at American University. His National Book Award-winning Stamped From the Beginning argued that racist policies beget racist ideas, not the other way around. His new book, How to Be an Antiracist, is a continuation of that project. It focuses on racism as a structural ecosystem that black people face, not a prejudice that white people feel.The implications of this redefinition are far-reaching. Are you a racist if you loathe people who aren’t of your race but don’t want to pass policy on it? Are you a racist if you tried to narrow racial inequality but your program backfired?In this conversation, we map the boundaries of Kendi’s definition and its implications. We discuss his admission that he “used to be racist most of the time,” his argument against racial integration, whether it’s giving too much power to policy to blame it for all racial inequality, whether the word “racist” is too charged for the more nuanced conversations we need to have, the meta-philosophy behind African-American studies, and much more.Book recommendations: Autobiography of Malcolm X (as told to Alex Haley)The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Malcolm Gladwell’s work is nothing short of an intellectual adventure. Sometimes, as in his podcast Revisionist History, he takes something small and mundane — a hockey statistic, a semicolon, a verbal tic — and draws a broad, sweeping conclusion that shatters your worldview. Other times, as in his new book Talking to Strangers, he takes something big and contentious — the death of Sandra Bland, the wrongful conviction of Amanda Knox, the ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff — and produces insights that challenge conventional wisdom, leaving you wondering how you missed what he saw all along. In either case, once you’ve experienced what Gladwell has to say, you can never see things in quite the same way again. This conversation is an adventure of its own. We cover everything from the secrets behind Gladwell’s creative process to the basic social ingredient that undergirds all of modern society to the story of how an entire field office of the CIA got infiltrated by Cuban spies — and what that teaches us about human nature.So, tune in and be a part of this adventure with us.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Samantha Power reported from the killing fields of Bosnia. She watched a genocide that could’ve been stopped years earlier grind on amidst international indifference. What she saw there led to A Problem From Hell, her Pulitzer-prize winning exploration of why the world permits genocide to happen. She emerged as a fierce critic of America’s morally lax foreign policy, a position that led to a friendship with Barack Obama, and then a series of top jobs in his administration, culminating in ambassador to the UN. Power’s new book, The Education of an Idealist, is a memoir of this journey.It is rare that an outspoken critic of the foreign policy establishment becomes so powerful within it. But that’s what makes Power’s career, and the lessons she learned, so interesting. In this conversation we discuss:- What causes ordinary people to participate in genocide- Why policymakers so often fail to respond to genocide before it is too late- Whether foreign policy decisions are too restrained by the overreaches and mistakes of the previous generation- Power’s reflections on Libya, Syria, South Sudan, and more- How the US’s inconsistent moral stances undermine its strategic interests- The blurry line between morality and strategy in foreign policy- How the next administration should handle US relationships with China and Russia.- The case for being “unreasonable,” even as a policymakerAnd much more. This conversation is weedsy at times, but in a way that I think is telling: It’s a window into the agonizing complexity and impossible choices that define foreign policymaking.Book recommendations: Switch by the Heath Brothers The Abandonment of the Jews by David S.

We also discuss:- The economics of slavery, and the role of the cotton gin- Why it took a civil war to end slavery in America, but not elsewhere- What it means to love a country that doesn’t love you back- Whether busing worked- Why Southern schools are the most racially integrated in the US- The long-term effects of school integration- Whether class-based policies can solve racial inequity- What America can learn from Cuba- Whether racism blocked social democracy in America- Whether any presidential candidates has a serious school integration plan- Why housing and education segregation are so rarely discussed by politicians- Why Hannah-Jones dislikes “gifted and talented” programs in schoolAnd much more.References: Hannah-Jones\' opening essay of the 1619 project Hannah-Jones\' essay on choosing a school for her daughter Book recommendations: Black Reconstruction in America 1860-1880 W.E.B.

Or the book Thing Explainer, which used only the 1,000 most common words in the English language to explain some of the hardest ideas in the world.XKCD is the work of one person, Randall Munroe, and I’ve wanted to talk with him for years. Now he’s out with a new book, How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems, and I got my chance.

So I only bring on candidates now if there’s a conversation directly related to themes of this show.In this case, there is.There’s a quiet moral radicalism powering Julián Castro’s presidential campaign. Laced through his policy agenda are proposals to decriminalize the movements of undocumented immigrants, to involve the homeless in housing policy, to establish American obligations to those displaced by climate change, to protect animals from human cruelty.This is an agenda to expand the moral circle. To redefine who counts in the “we” of American politics.I asked Castro if this wasn’t all a step too far, if Democrats didn’t need to play it safer to eject Trump from office in 2020. This broader moral vision, he replied, “is not just trying to backfill the negative. It gives people a positive purpose that they can reach for. That’s what I’m trying to do.”This is a candidate interview worth hearing.Book recommendations: Influence by Robert Cialdini The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros Roots: The Saga of an American Family by Alex Haley Read the transcript of this interview here Want to contact the show?

It is, to you, a rolling horror. But to the people you love, the world you live in — it’s normal. You’re the weird one.So what do you do? How do you engage, politically and personally, when so few see what you see?Leah Garcés is the Executive President of Mercy for Animals and the author of Grilled: Turning Adversaries into Allies to Change the Chicken Industry ,which documents her journey to reduce the suffering of chickens by building coalitions with none other than well… industrial chicken farmers.I wanted Garcés on the show because her story is about more than animal suffering. It’s about the core question of politics: the choice we face, every day, between condemnation and compromise. Whether your issue is health care or climate or civil rights or abortion or taxes or foreign policy, you’re faced daily with people working for a world you find repellent. What do you do when they’re the majority and you’re the minority? How do you maintain your own morality when the system itself is sick? When do you draw bright lines, and when do you erase the lines you’ve spent your life drawing?This conversation gets uncomfortable at times — the realities of factory farming are not easy to face. But, trust me, you will want to stick with it.

"Antiracism… is now a new and increasingly dominant religion” writes John McWhorter, “it is what we worship, as sincerely and fervently as many worship God and Jesus.”McWhorter is a Professor of English at Columbia University, a contributing editor to The Atlantic, and an outspoken critic of what he calls “third-wave antiracism.” He believes that our increasingly religious national discourse around race -- with its focus on “safe spaces,” “wokeness” and “white privilege” -- is not only wrongheaded, but even dangerous.But McWhorter isn\'t that easy to pin down. He acknowledges racism’s pernicious effects on communities of color, but believes that while we are busy calling out individual racism, we are ignoring the issues that most impact black lives: an endless War on Drugs, an unequal education system, and attacks on reproductive and voting rights.In this conversation, we explore what terms like “woke” and “diversity” actually mean, the types of issues that really do impact black communities, the legacy of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the potential virtues of virtue signaling, why The Phantom Menace was (objectively) a terrible movie and much more. I hope y’all have as much fun with this conversation as I did.References: John\'s essay "The Virtue Signalers Won’t Change the World" Book recommendations: A Death in the Rainforest: How a Language and a Way of Life Came to an End in Papua\xa0New Guinea by Don Kulick American Pastoral by Philip Roth Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee by Casey CepFollow Jane on Twitter @cjane87Want to contact the show?

You may think they do, but they don’t. \xa0Instead, an algorithm picks which ones to show you -- and which\xa0\xa0not\xa0to show you. How do they decide? The companies won\'t reveal the details. Glenn Beck, publisher of the major conservative outlet The Blaze,\xa0(add link\xa0https://www.theblaze.com)\xa0tells John Stossl social media companies are biased against conservatives. Beck says Facebook reduces his posts\' reach. And he notes that when a video made fun of Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi by slowing down her voice, Facebook put a warning on the post and reduced its reach. In contrast, Beck notes, while the companies censor right-wing sites that might advocate violence, similar left-wing groups still have Twitter accounts. In Portland, Oregon, Antifa thugs attacked journalist Andy Ngo because he had criticized Antifa’s violence. They kicked him and punched him in the head. The attack left Ngo with brain damage. \xa0 But the account of the local Antifa group, Rose City Antifa,\xa0is still on Twitter\xa0. The group\xa0justifies the attack on Ngo on their\xa0website\xa0: "If you rally the far-right to attack our city and profit by their violence, you are one of them. And the community will stop you, however it can." Other Antifa accounts are still up--despite supporting violence, Beck points out. "In Austin they were actually calling for the next phase to have people \xa0be a paramilitary operation. That was up forever,”\xa0he tells Stossel.\xa0 The Austin Antifa group\'s Facebook page\xa0is still up\xa0, linking to\xa0a manifesto\xa0calling for Antifa\'s opponents to be “beaten bloody … annihilated.” Beck says a double standard exists because social media companies are based in left-wing San Francisco. \xa0Also, they mostly hire Democrats. An\xa0Spinquark analysis found\xa0dozens of former Democratic staffers working at social media companies. Stossel pushes back at Beck: "they must hire some Republicans, too." "They do, but it\'s about 20% and they\'re not from top level positions," Beck replies. In the case of the Pelosi video that was shown to few people, Beck says: "The person who was in charge happened to be ... one of the leaders in Nancy Pelosi\'s office, who had just left Nancy Pelosi\'s office to go to work [at Facebook]." But Beck doesn’t want hiring quotas. \xa0He says he opposes affirmative action for conservatives in social media. "It bothers me that there are so many conservatives want more regulation," Beck says. \xa0Stossel suggests Beck is not consistent about that. After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed immigrants were "being told by [border patrol] officers to drink out of the toilet,” Beck, demanded that she be punished. "I would prosecute anyone making outrageous charges like this," he said on Blaze TV. When Stossel asks about that, Beck laughed and backed off the idea. "I speak five hours off script everyday. There\'s a lot of stuff that I vomit out!" he replies. "So, you\'re not eager to prosecute Cortez?" Stossel asks. "No. No. No," Beck replies. Stossel says he\'s glad Beck walked that back. “Truth comes out through argument--open debate. The more social media companies censor, the less we learn." Stossel notes that social media companies have a right to censor -- but that, on at least some social media platforms, if not all, ALL speech should be free. Beck agrees,\xa0“we can handle it. Stop treating us like children." \xa0 \xa0 Live Free at Sea https://youtu.be/vDYO4_845Is John Stossel Maybe the ocean is a place where we can experiment with new ways of living. -------- Don\'t miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe --------- How can we live free? Governments impose rules and control all land on earth. "We need a new place to experiment with new rules,” says Joe\xa0Quirk of the Seasteading Institute. Quirk says that if people move 12 miles off the coast, they can build their own cities, or even countries, and make their own rules. Seasteaders dream of building huge platforms in the ocean, places where free people can live and work and practice free association. A few have already tried to make this dream a reality. Chad and Nadia Elwartowski built a small seastead 12 miles off the coast of Thailand.\xa0 But it didn\'t go so well. The Thai navy cracked down and charged Chad and Nadia with breaking the law. The couple are now on the run. Despite this setback, Quirk is optimistic about the future of living at sea. How might it work? Quirk points out that a form of seasteads already exist: cruise ships.“Most cruise ships fly the flag of say, Panama or Liberia and they\'re sort of de facto self-governing … So a captain is a de facto dictator. Why doesn\'t he become a tyrant? And the answer is because people can choose another cruise line.” On land, some governments have done something a bit similar to seasteading, Quirk notes. They\'re created "special economic zones". After seeing the success of Hong Kong, even communist China set up such zones so cities could experiment with fewer rules. Those zones have thrived. There should be more of them. Of course, lots of people are nervous about getting rid of rules. Stossel tells Quirk that some would say: "Without American rules some will be shooting up heroin or abusing children!" \xa0 Quirk replies: "We have that in our country right now ...\xa0But if I ... move 12 miles off shore ... I\'m going to be so incentivized to set a better example ... Because the world\'s eyes are going to be on me. I got to convince investors to invest in it. I got to convince people to move there," he says. Quirk adds: “Seasteaders don\'t have a problem with regulations per se. Humans need rules to interact. We have a problem with the monopoly over the provision and enforcement of regulations ... we don\'t need politicians. They\'re not smart enough to make decisions for us!” Quirk tells Stossel that he wants people to govern themselves. “It\'s irresponsible\xa0not\xa0to improve society by setting better examples," he says. \xa0 \xa0 Life is Getting Better https://youtu.be/UBeY6RJxafc John Stossel Reason Magazine shows how our lives are healthier, richer, and safer, while most media make people think life gets worse. \xa0-------- Don\'t miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe --------- News reports often give the impression that humans have wrecked the earth, the middle class is disappearing, and the world is getting more dangerous. "We are destroying the planet," Michael Moore says on CNN. MSNBC says that "t\xa0he middle class is disappearing.”\xa0 All media warn us about things like a "d\xa0eadly Ebola outbreak." \xa0 This negativity comes from the way humans are wired by evolution, says Reason Magazine Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward. She\xa0tells John Stossel: "\xa0If you are a caveman who hears a little rustling in the weeds, and you say, \'oh, it\'s probably fine,\' the other guy who says, \'It\'s probably a tiger,\' that\'s the guy who lives. That guy was our ancestors." \xa0 But our instincts are wrong, she says. We needn\'t be so scared. The cover of her magazine features a glass that is not just half full, but\xa0\xa0completely\xa0full. Reason Magazine points out that today there is less war and more food. We’re healthier, and working safer and more fulfilling jobs. \xa0 She points out that today, we have medical breakthroughs that would’ve once been called miracles. Deaf children receive cochlear implants that allow them to hear for the first time. Artificial limbs “allow the lame to walk.” “These are things that, in another era, would have caused the founding of an entire religion!” says Ward. Stossel pushes back: “What about this constant complaint from the media? ... The middle\xa0class is shrinking.” "Mostly it’s because people are getting richer,” Mangu-Ward responds. She\'s right.\xa0 A graph in Reason Magazine shows that about 50 years ago, 53% of people were middle-income, making between $35,000 and $100,000 per year. That fell to 42%. But it fell because people mostly moved into\xa0upper\xa0income brackets. The share making more than $100,000 rose from 8% to almost \xa028%. (All the numbers are inflation-adjusted.) \xa0\xa0 Another Reason article is titled "\xa0Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death are All on the Decline”. \xa0 “You wouldn’t know that watching news programs,” Stossel said. \xa0 “That’s right, and yet it’s absolutely true,” Added Mangu-Ward. Even with the rise in terrorism, she notes, "there are fewer wars and fewer people die in those wars than has ever been true in the past." \xa0 Stossel pushes back again: “Lately, life expectancy dropped a bit.”\xa0 \xa0 “Overall, that is the tiniest blip," Mangu-Ward replies. The long-term trend is still up. \xa0 In an article titled "\xa0Work Got Good",\xa0 Reason Magazine says people are more fulfilled in modern jobs. \xa0 “A couple hundred years ago, work was dangerous,"\xa0Mangu-Ward\xa0\xa0adds. "It was very easy to die at work… work was extremely boring, even for people that had good jobs. Jobs are pretty interesting now, and they mostly don\'t kill you, and we should be grateful for that.” \xa0 But there are problems, and Reason magazine understands that.\xa0 The back half of the magazine is filled with the bad news:\xa0\xa0Misery in\xa0Venezuela, threats to an open internet,young people liking socialism.\xa0 “Everything that’s bad is politics, everything that’s good is the market.”\xa0Mangu-Ward\xa0\xa0argues. \xa0“Life gets better. We have the opportunity to look \xa0to a future where those trends will continue-- if we can just manage to keep politicians from screwing it up.” \xa0 \xa0 Let Charter Schools Teach John Stossel Governments limit charter schools, even though charters often do better than government-run schools -------- Don\'t miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe --------- Many parents try to escape government-run schools for less-regulated "charter schools". Philadelphia mom Elaine Wells tells John Stossel that she wanted to get her boys into a charter because her local government-run school in inner-city Philadelphia was “horrible ... there were fights after school every day." Her kids spent years losing lotteries that they hoped would get them into a charter. "It\'s heartbreaking," Wells says. In Philadelphia, thanks to government limits, only 7,000 kids get into charters. 29,000 apply. But eventually, Wells got her kids into a new charter school: Boys\' Latin, founded by David Hardy. Boys\' Latin does many unusual things: all kids learn Latin, wear uniforms, stay longer hours, and it\'s all-boys. "The rules are there to set the stage for the students," Hardy tells Stossel. "If the teacher can tell you to tuck in your shirt, they can tell you to be quiet in class ... tell you to do your homework." Wells says that worked for her kids. "Before Boys Latin I would come home and say, \'okay, I need you to read for an hour -- read a book.\' And their response would be \'why? What did we do?\' Like reading was a punishment! [After] Boys\' Latin... I would find books in the bathroom on the floor!" Wells said. Her son, Ibrahim, added, "It came to the point where the teacher would tell our mom that I\'d taken too many books." The school was better at hiring teachers who tried hard. Wells recalls being shocked to find her sons talking to teachers at night: "He\'s in his room and I hear him talking on the phone and it was 10 o\'clock at night. I\'m like \'who are you on the phone with?\' and he was like, \'well, Mr. Bumbulsky told me to call him if I needed help with homework.\'" Stossel pushed back at some of David Hardy’s ideas, like making every student take four years of Latin. "It\'s ridiculous. Nobody speaks Latin," Stossel suggests to founder David Hardy. "Well we picked Latin because it was hard," Hardy replies. "What\'s the point of that?" Stossel asks. "Because LIFE is hard -- to be prepared you have to work hard. We wanted to get that into the psyche of our students," Hardy says. Overall, Boys\' Latin gets somewhat better test scores than surrounding schools in most subjects. "We deliver," Hardy says. "Since the very first class we\'ve sent more black boys to college than any high school in Pennsylvania." Despite that, government officials rejected his proposal to open a "Girls\' Latin" school. They\'ve rejected a bunch of schools. Charter opponents complain that charters "drain scarce resources" from government-run schools. "You can’t tell me that," Wells responds. "Every parent pays taxes... if I choose for my child to go to a charter school, then that\'s where my taxes should go!" In fact, Philadelphia and other cities don’t give charters the same amount of money they give to schools they control. Philadelphia gives them only 70% of that. So per student, Stossel notes, the government schools make money whenever a kid leaves for a charter. Over 13 years of schooling, Philadelphia saves 70k per kid. Stossel asks Wells: what if those savings were passed onto the child? “Absolutely! Give them the rest of the money!" Wells laughed. But it won\'t happen because, as Hardy notes, "it would also mean that there would be a whole lot less union jobs. The unions are not going to be for that." \xa0 \xa0 Lessons from Africa https://youtu.be/qwIYgZZhehA John Stossel Why is Africa poor? \xa0-------- Don\'t miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://www.johnstossel.com/#subscribe --------- More than half of the world\'s poorest people live in sub-Saharan Africa. Why? Why is that region so poor? There are lots of theories -- some blame a "colonial history." Others blame the weather or discrimination. But Magatte Wade, an African entrepreneur, tells John Stossel that she knows the biggest reason from her own first-hand experience: it’s crushing government regulation. "Once you hire someone, good luck getting rid of them for any reason," she says. Her home country, Senegal, requires government permission to fire an employee. That makes it hard to run a business. It also makes entrepreneurs reluctant to hire. Then there\'s the complicated tax code. "Some people say it\'s worth at least two or three truckloads of paper," she says. Hiring an accountant to wade through that is expensive for new businesses. Magatte started a business anyway -- she makes lip balm. She has to import several ingredients that are not made in Senegal. "Some of them have a 70 percent import tariff on them!" Wade complains. High taxes and complex rules often lead to corruption, because people pay bribes to get around the rules. Wade says corruption "a natural consequence of stupid senseless idiot laws... the only way to fix corruption is to simplify." Wade\'s business survives without corruption, she says. One reason is that she was fortunate to find a bureaucrat who helped her find a way around the ruinous tariffs. "We found a clause in one of the binders saying actually if you\'re exporting at least 80 percent of your products and if you\'ve been in business for two years then you can ask for an exemption," she said. Well-meaning westerners often try to help Africa with aid. Tom\'s Shoes gives a pair of shoes to someone in the developing world for every pair customers buy. But Wade points out that such donations destroy local African shoe makers. Instead of aid, she says, demand that rules be cut. That would create jobs. "If I have a job then, guess what?" Wade asks. "My malnutrition problem goes poof! My uneven access to clean water goes poof. It’s just poof, poof, poof!" “Create greater economic freedom... in all countries," Wade concludes. "So that all people everywhere get a chance to experience free enterprise." \xa0 \xa0 Dennis Prager -Another nutrition myth exploded.

This episode is a follow-up to our first #Brexit show, which was Episode 315. Find out what, if anything, Andrew got wrong in that show, while Emma also helps us break down the U.K. Supreme Court\'s (shocking to Andrew) 11-0 decision that PM Boris Johnson\'s decision to prorogue Parliament was an abuse of his powers and done for an improper purpose. We compare legal systems and learn a ton about what law is like in England. You won\'t want to miss this episode!   After the interview, we head back to a tricky #T3BE regarding a 12-year-old who sneaks out and falls in thin ice. This is one of those questions that Andrew admits he would have gotten wrong!

Remember that this your LAST CHANCE to come see Opening Arguments LIVE in Los Angeles, CA on October 12, 2019.\xa0Here is the link!!   We begin today\'s show with an (unfortunately lengthy) Andrew Was Wrong segment about the Javelin missile, Al Gore\'s non-tie-breaking non-vote in 1999, and more. But was Andrew actually right about anything? (Maybe one or two things.)   Then, it\'s time for the main segment in which Andrew breaks down exactly why "hearsay" isn\'t the same as "stuff you maybe kinda overheard in the neighborhood." Learn what hearsay actually is, and why the latest round of unhinged Republican talking points are even more laughable than they seem.   After that, it\'s time for a frenzied visit back to Yodel Mountain, where we explain exactly what happens next in the House impeachment investigation.   As a bonus, we tackle a question many of you asked on social media: what exactly does happen if President Trump is removed from office via impeachment? Could he run again?? Listen and find out!   We conclude, as always, with #T3BE, including next week\'s guest, solicitor Emma McClure, and a wandering 12-year-old who falls through the ice.   Upcoming Appearances   None!

Here\'s the  latest news from  The Guardian about the President committing bribery on national television. And yes, it\'s bribery, 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(1)(B) and not extortion or any other crime. Curious about that 1955 law review article summarizing that grand juries can issue indictments based on nothing but expert hearsay testimony?  We\'ve got you covered. And if you liked that, you probably also want to check out the Federal Rules of Evidence on hearsay, Rule 801 et seq. If you see anyone sharing the  absolute lie propagated in the  Federalist that the intel community "secretly gutted" the requirement that whistleblower complaints be based on first-hand knowledge, you can send them to the May 2018 form 401. If you need a quick response, just share out this graphic that clearly shows it\'s a complete fabrication. Oh, and don\'t forget to curl up with  this subpoena served on Rudy Giuliani.    -Support us on Patreon at:\xa0patreon.com/law   -Follow us on Twitter: \xa0@Openargs   -Facebook: \xa0https://www.facebook.com/openargs/, and don’t forget the\xa0OA Facebook Community!   -For show-related questions, check out the\xa0Opening Arguments Wiki, which now has its own Twitter feed!\xa0\xa0@oawiki   -And finally, remember that you can email us at\xa0openarguments@gmail.com!  |  Today\'s Deep Dive can\'t help but stay high atop Yodel Mountain.

We begin, however, with a brief update on #Brexit; no, we haven\'t forgotten that our closest ally is also suffering under the weight of an insane leader hell-bent on a racist policy that everyone knows is an impending disaster. But unlike the U.S., it looks like the U.K. Supreme Court.... still understands the rule of law? What a novel concept.   Then, it\'s time for a deep dive into impeachment, where we tackle:    Exactly why President Trump\'s conduct towards Ukraine in particular is so reprehensible; Why beginning an "impeachment inquiry" matters; What the Nixon articles of impeachment looked like; The Clinton impeachment timeline; ALL the ways Mitch McConnell and the Republicans can try and screw this up; and much, much more.    Then, it\'s time for the answer to Friday\'s #T3BE involving real property, and specifically, the condition to a contract requiring the buyer to procure a loan at 10% and whether that allows the seller to back out even if the buyer turns over the purchase price.

Today\'s episode breaks down the tipping point that finally got House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to back an impeachment inquiry: the now-disclosed whistleblower complaint that lays out exactly how Donald Trump abused our foreign policy to pressure a foreign leader to aid him in his 2020 re-election campaign. It\'s every bit as bad as it looks, and we walk you through exactly what it means.   Don’t forget Opening Arguments LIVE in Los Angeles, CA on October 12, 2019.\xa0Here is the link!!   Here\'s the topline: Acting DNI Maguire changed his story as to why he withheld the whistleblower complaint to a completely bogus claim of executive privilege. We\'ll tell you why that won\'t hold up. We\'ll also answer:    What\'s a TELCON, and do we have reasons to believe that the "transcript" of the President\'s July 25 conversation with Ukranian President Zelenskyy was "Bill Barr"ed? Are we at PEAK YODEL MOUNTAIN? Did the Republicans really email their stupid talking points to Nancy Pelosi? And if so, how do we spot a hack? (Hint: he -- and they\'re pretty much all \'he\'s -- will have an "R" after his name.) What did we learn from Maguire\'s testimony today, and how incriminating was it? (Very.) What does the complaint say and how bad is it? And finally -- what are the FIVE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT Andrew thinks will be brought against this President?    After all that, it\'s time for a brand-new #T3BE, this time a dreaded real property question that Thomas feels oddly confident about his answer. Do you share his optimism? Let us know!

Remember that the operative statute requiring Maguire to have turned over the whistleblower complaint is 50 U.S.C. § 3033, and particularly subsection (k)(5). Here\'s the  New York Times  reporting that Trump mentioned Giuliani way back in his first call to Zelenskyy on April 21, 2019. Extortion is 18 U.S.C. § 355(c)(2); treason is 18 U.S.C. § 2381, and neither are a good fit here. What laws are a good fit? Well, how about (a) illegal solicitation of a campaign contribution, 52 U.S.C. § 30121; (b) bribery, 18 U.S.C. § 201 ; (c) obstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. § 1505, and much more??

Oh, and we also check in on Trump\'s taxes, emoluments, that crazy whistleblower case and so much more from this corrupt administration.   We begin, however, with few little self-congratulatory remarks and some further information about #Brexit that we covered in  Episode 315.   Then, it\'s time to tackle In re Application of the House Committee on the Judiciary regarding the unsealing of grand jury testimony. Learn how this argument interacts with McKeever v. Barr, which we last discussed in Episode 272.   After that, we pause briefly to discuss the latest ruling on emoluments from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as the latest apportionment lawsuit that may have been inspired by a previous episode. And we discuss Corey Lewandowski\'s sideshow, and the four pending lawsuits involving Trump\'s taxes, and so much more....

In this week’s episode, host Max Bergmann, the director of the Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, breaks down those efforts, from pressuring witnesses not to cooperate to pushing out his attorney general so he could rein in the Mueller investigation.\xa0With help from experts like former FBI Special Agent Asha Rangappa and former CIA Operative John Sipher, we discuss whether Trump is a witting or unwitting asset of Russia. And finally, we break down what happened and how we are where we are – with Trump, a Russian asset, still in office, and posed to fight for reelection with Russia primed to interfere again. | After the election, Russia sought to cash in for its efforts during the election. Collusion didn’t end with the 2016 election, as the Trump transition team and the Kremlin continued working together to plot ways the incoming Trump administration could deliver for Russia.\xa0This week on\xa0The Asset, host Max\xa0Bergmann, the director of the Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress, analyzes the Trump transition team’s various backchannels to the Kremlin, from phone calls with the Russian ambassador to a rendezvous in the Seychelles to meetings right under everyone’s noses in Trump Tower.\xa0For more than two years, Trump has acted like a Russian asset in the Oval Office trying to deliver for Putin. He sought to get rid of sanctions, push a Russian plan for Ukraine, attacked America’s allies, and undermined democratic norms at home. | Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election is the most damning document ever published about a sitting president. But as much as it told us, the Mueller report said it found “insufficient evidence” to establish that there was a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Not that there was\xa0no evidence\xa0of a conspiracy, just not enough to prove it in court.\xa0This week on\xa0The Asset, we sift through the evidence pointing toward a conspiracy and explore some of the questions the Mueller report didn’t answer. Why did Paul Manafort share confidential polling data with a suspected Russian agent? Why was a server for the Trump Organization communicating with a server for a Kremlin-linked Russian bank? What did Russia do with the data it stole from the Democratic National Committee that didn’t wind up on WikiLeaks? Where does Cambridge Analytica, the shady data-digital firm the Trump campaign hired, fit in?With the help of experts like journalist Franklin Foer and Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon, host Max Bergmann, the director of the Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, breaks down what we know about the possible answers to these questions—and what we don’t. | October 7th, 2016, was one of the most important days in American political history. At 4:03 pm that day, the Access Hollywood tape was released. Just 29 minutes later, WikiLeaks – at 4:32pm on a Friday –began releasing emails hacked by Russian military officers from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s account. The timing of this dump made no sense for WikiLeaks. But it made a lot of sense for Donald Trump.\xa0Last week on\xa0The Asset, we talked about the five steps to collusion: Hack. Inform. Collude. Release. Campaign. This week, we take a deep dive into that final step and break down how Trump campaigned on the stolen email releases. Russia hacked in March, gave WikiLeaks emails in September, WikiLeaks released them in October 2016, and Trump ran on these emails through November, mentioning WikiLeaks more than 150 times in the final weeks of the campaign.\xa0The email releases from WikiLeaks were core to Trump’s campaign strategy in the home stretch of the election.\xa0In this episode of The Asset, host Max Bergmann, the director of The Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, breaks down how the Trump team ran their campaign of collusion all the way to the White House. The episode explores how these two campaigns, the Russian campaign and the Trump campaign, worked together in tandem. And if this sounds like the definition of collusion, that’s because it is.\xa0The Asset tells the full story of Trump and Russia. Each week, we will examine the colorful characters and dirty deals that populate the story of how Russia helped the son of a shady real estate mogul became President of the United States. | Friday, July 22, 2016 was the day it became clear that the 2016 presidential election would be like no other ever experienced in the United States. On that day, the Russian cut-out WikiLeaks released a massive trove of hacked emails from the DNC. And Russia had just shown that it was all-in in support of Donald Trump.\xa0We break down Trump’s collusion with Russia into five easy steps: Hack. Inform. Collude. Release. Campaign. Throughout each of these steps, the Russians were looking for feedback, looking for access, and looking for assurance from the Trump campaign that they wouldn’t be left high and dry. And they got it, again and again.\xa0In this episode of The Asset, host Max Bergmann, the director of The Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, outlines how two campaigns worked to elect Donald Trump: one run by the Trump team, and one run out of the Kremlin. These campaigns worked in tandem, meeting and communicating to collude to elect Trump as president. This is how collusion occurred.\xa0The Asset tells the full story of Trump and Russia. Each week, we will examine the colorful characters and dirty deals that populate the story of how Russia helped the son of a shady real estate mogul became President of the United States. | We break down the beginnings of the two campaigns to elect Donald Trump: one run out of Trump Tower, and the other run out of the Kremlin.\xa0From the moment Trump announced he was running for president, he was unabashedly pro-Russia. It made no sense. Until we learned that throughout the campaign, the Trump Organization was actively seeking to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow. \xa0In this episode of\xa0The Asset, host Max Bergmann, the director of The Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, details the early connections between the two campaigns. Trump surrounded himself with shady actors with ties to the Kremlin, including his campaign chairman Paul Manafort, national security adviser Michael Flynn, and campaign aides George Papadopoulos and Carter Page.\xa0Lastly, the episode breaks down the beginning of the Russian campaign to elect Donald Trump and the origins of its online efforts. Russia created an online army online designed to poison American discourse on social media and advance Trump’s campaign. The Russian efforts worked like a political campaign and we will break down their impact on the 2016 election.  | Join us as we go through the murky world of Russian intelligence. In Vladimir Putin’s Russia, the old-style KGB tactics didn’t go away. Instead, the Russian intelligence apparatus has been empowered. This episode goes through the story of the Russian “illegals” spy ring operating in the U.S., examining the back story of these deep cover Russian agents who would later become the inspiration for the hit television series “The Americans”. We also show how one of the American men recruited by a Russian spy, Carter Page, eventually rose up to become one of Trump’s initial foreign policy advisors.In this episode of The Asset, host Max Bergmann, the director of The Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, shows how Russia sought to infiltrate and cultivate the far right movement in the United States, locking in on guns and the NRA as the most effective way to do so. It breaks down the story of Maria Butina, a Russian agent currently behind bars.This episode also hones in on Donald Trump’s reemergence on the political scene with his embrace of the birther conspiracy theory and shows how that conspiracy mirrors the same sorts of disinformation campaigns that Soviet and Russian intelligence love to push.Lastly, the episode breaks down the idea of kompromat and examines Trump’s 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow. This isn’t just the trip where that infamous tape took place. It is also where Trump once again was seeking to do business in Russia.The Asset tells the full story of Trump and Russia. Each week, we will examine the colorful characters and dirty deals that populate the story of how Russia helped the son of a shady real estate mogul became President of the United States. | The fight over Ukraine’s future is key to the Trump-Russia story. It is central to understanding why, in 2016, Russia undertook such a brazen and risky assault on American democracy.\xa0Russia’s attempt to reassert itself as a great power and exert control over Ukraine led to a collapse in U.S.-Russia relations. Color revolutions in former Soviet states, including two major uprisings in Ukraine, aggravated Putin’s suspicions of the West and made him determined to prevent similar dissent within Russia. When massive protests broke out in Russia following the December 2011 elections, he blamed then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\xa0In this episode of The Asset, host Max Bergmann, the director of The Moscow Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, traces how Putin, in fighting for control of Ukraine, brought on a new confrontation with the United States. But Russia’s weak economy and inability to directly respond to US and EU sanctions, ultimately forced Putin to get creative and brush off the old KGB playbook. The target: American democracy.\xa0The Asset tells the full story of Trump and Russia. Each week, we will examine the colorful characters and dirty deals that populate the story of how Russia helped the son of a shady real estate mogul became President of the United States.", 'chan_desc': "The Asset is a deep dive into Trump's history with Russia, from his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs to his presidential campaign and the investigations that have sent some of his closest associates to prison.Hosted by Max Bergmann, a senior fellow and director of the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, and featuring expert guests, The Asset will put together the pieces of Trump’s relationship with Russia.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/43/fa/46/43fa4634-5197-e6c0-4d31-2a36fc294b29/mza_6516278040605724854.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-25'}}

A new whistleblower from inside the IRS says the Treasury Department tried to interfere with an audit of Trump’s tax returns. And lastly, progressives warn of a stealth privatization effort by the White House as Trump signs an executive order aimed at undermining the Medicare for All movement.\xa0  And\xa0our\xa0QUICKER\xa0QUICKIES\xa0HEADLINES: CNN reports that President Trump mentioned the political prospects of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren in a June 18 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\xa0During the call, Trump reportedly told Xi that he would stay quiet about the violent Hong Kong protests as trade talks between the two countries progressed From the BBC; Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers to ban face masks at the city’s pro-democracy protests, threatening offenders with one year in jail if they prevent themselves from being identified by police.

Sources tell Politico that Perry’s exit is unrelated to Ukraine, however, the energy secretary is the subject of two congressional subpoenas targeted at Rudy Giuliani efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son. | Good morning, Eric Levitz joins the Majority Report to discuss his essay in\xa0New York,\xa0"The Bernie vs. Warren Debate We Need,"\xa0and provide some clarity to the intra-left "Bernie or Warren" discourse. Sam and Levitz begin their conversation exploring the idea that "the American left\'s bark is louder than its bite." The left has helped shift the country\'s political discussion in the past several years and has gotten the ear of mainstream political elites and media, but it does not have the institutional power held by centrist Democrats like Schumer, Manchin, and Tester. Levitz argues that there\'s a gulf between the elite media discourse (which is young and left) and institutional power (which is old and rural) in terms of their desired goals and deliverable actions. Shifting gears, Sam and Levitz discuss the apparent differences between Sanders and Warren. For Levitz, it\'s not apparent that Sanders would stretch executive power more than Warren. The distinction worth making is that the two progressive frontrunners will push progressive policies through executive action more so than the leading centrist candidate Joe Biden. Sam also explains the political stakes of a Bernie Sanders presidency, and its commitment to a principled policy like Medicare for All. Calling for a vote on real progressive policy will draw more apparent distinctions within the Democratic party. Sam and Levitz conclude their conversation considering what constitutes the Democratic party now and what it would take to build a broader coalition of Democratic voters moving beyond 2020.\xa0 And in the Fun Half: we have the president of Finland ask him a question, Trump would investigate the Bidens if he were Zelensky, Trump has decided his foreign policy actions in the Ukraine are now perfectly lawful,\xa0Corey Lewandowski is drunk on Fox Business News,\xa0the Blaze\'s Dave Rubin defends Jordan Peterson\'s enforced monogamy, the courtroom scenes from the Amber Guyger sentencing, the Ghost of Retroactively Classified documents calls from San Antonio, Ken Langone thinks Bernie Sanders wants to shoot him, Beto goes after Mayor Pete, but Yang is now the premier skater in the Democratic field, plus your calls and IMs!

For perspective; over the equivalent period in 2011, President Obama raised nearly $70 million for his re-election campaign.\xa0 Politico reports that House investigators are looking into an allegation that groups — including at least one foreign government — tried to ingratiate themselves to President Trump by booking rooms at his hotels but never staying in them. Three House committee chairmen sent a letter addressed to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan on the grounds that the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “now appears to have an obvious conflict of interest,” the Wall Street Journal reports. Pompeo’s participation in the call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, the lawmakers wrote, renders him a witness in the congressional impeachment inquiry, and as a result, “he should not be making any decisions regarding witness testimony or document production in order to protect himself or the president. And finally, Rudy Giuliani wants to sue congress. That’s right, Trump’s bumbling lawyer told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham that he wants to bring a lawsuit against House Democrats for investigating the president in the wake of revelations involving Trump\'s interactions with Ukraine.\xa0 Ingraham called Giuliani’s proposal “novel” before ending Rudy’s legal fantasy when she reminded the former Associate Attorney General that members of Congress have immunity for anything they say on the floor. | Marshall Steinbaum (@Econ_Marshall), assistant professor of economics at the University of Utah, joins Sam to discuss his latest piece in Current Affairs, "Cancelling Student Debt Reduces the Racial Wealth Gap."

Thousands have been imprisoned, including political leaders. Movement is tightly restricted. Phone lines have been cut off. Modi appears set on ending Jammu and Kashmir’s special semi-autonomous status and bringing it fully under the control of New Delhi, a move which residents of the Muslim-majority region strongly reject. Arundhati Roy, India’s most famous novelist and a passionate voice for Kashmiri self-determination, joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss the Kashmir crisis and India’s troubling rightward tilt. | It finally happened: on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The final straw was a July phone call in which Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and appeared to suggest that US aid to Ukraine might be contingent upon his compliance. Nearly all of the 2020 Democratic candidates have come out in support of impeachment proceedings. On this week’s Deconstructed, one of those candidates, former HUD Secretary Julián Castro, joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss the week’s developments. Intercept DC Bureau Chief Ryan Grim stops by to break down the political prospects for impeachment. | Israeli voters returned to the polls this week for the second time in five months to elect the 120 members of the Knesset, the country’s legislative body. The outcome remains too close to call, but it looks like Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest serving Prime Minister, may be denied a majority. His likely successor is former army chief of staff Benny Gantz of the Blue and White Party. Yet missing from so much of the international conversation is the fact that five million Palestinian residents of the occupied territories remain unable to vote in elections that could determine their future. Given that Gantz, like Netanyahu, has adopted bellicose rhetoric toward Palestine in the past, can they really expect things to change? Noura Erakat, Palestinian American legal scholar and author of Justice for Some: Law and the Question of Palestine, joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss whether it’s fair to describe Israel as an apartheid state. | The Democratic candidates met in Houston on Thursday night for a third round of televised debates. This time the format was limited to a single night with 10 participants, which meant that for the first time, all the top-tier candidates were onstage together. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren defended their respective healthcare plans, but the center of attention was frontrunner Joe Biden, who spent the night fending off attacks from his rivals. As the evening wore on, Biden's answers became increasingly difficult to decipher. Intercept DC Bureau Chief Ryan Grim joins Mehdi Hasan to breakdown the latest debate, as do Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas and Pod Save the World host Tommy Vietor. | A whopping 20 Democratic presidential candidates met in Miami, Florida this week for the first in what promises to be a very long season of primary debates. Pre-debate buzz centered around frontrunners like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren—or Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, who let the fireworks fly on the second night in a heated exchange over the ex-Vice President’s record on school bussing. One surprise standout was former HUD Secretary Julián Castro, who made headlines on the first night for his radical immigration proposals and for clashing with fellow Texan Beto O’Rourke. Castro joins Mehdi to talk about his big night, and Intercept DC Bureau Chief Ryan Grim stops by to analyze the debates. | Calls for military action against Iran grew louder this week in response to the Trump Administration’s claims that the Islamic Republic was responsible for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Many analysts and politicians, both in the US and abroad, expressed skepticism of those claims. But the US media appears to be falling into a familiar pattern, providing a sympathetic platform for the administration without fundamentally questioning its premises. What can we learn from the last push for a war in the Middle East 17 years ago? Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Chief of Staff to then Secretary of State Colin Powell during the runup to the Iraq War, joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss the lessons of recent history. | The Democratic candidates have introduced a raft of radical progressive proposals on the domestic policy front, from Medicare for All to free public college to universal basic income. Yet that appetite for radicalism has been sorely lacking on the foreign policy front, with the candidates mostly mouthing the same noncommittal platitudes we’ve come to expect from cautious presidential contenders. Why is it that the policy area in which American presidents have the most power and the most freedom to shape world events is so often overlooked in our political campaigns? Atlantic contributor and CUNY professor Peter Beinart joins Mehdi Hasan to talk about why Democrats are so timid on foreign policy. | Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a 44-year-old former businessman and philanthropist, has garnered a devoted fanbase (dubbed the “Yang Gang”) for his unique raft of progressive and technocratic reform proposals. His signature policy, the “freedom dividend”, would see every American receive $1000 every month, no strings attached. Yang has garnered enough support to secure a spot on the Democratic debate stage later this month, in spite of his total lack of political or government experience. On this week’s Deconstructed, Mehdi Hasan sits down with the candidate to talk about his platform, his qualifications, and why he seems to have attracted online interest from the alt-right. | This week’s EU Parliament elections sent political shockwaves across Europe, with far-right nationalist parties racking up major victories in France, Italy, and even the UK. Established parties in Britain took a pounding as voters flocked to Nigel Farage’s newly-founded Brexit Party. Only days earlier, Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May resigned in the wake of repeated failures to secure a deal on Brexit. Where does all this leave the UK’s effort to withdraw from the European Union? And what can the US, in the midst of its own anti-immigrant populist moment, learn from the turmoil across the Atlantic? Guardian columnist Owen Jones joins Mehdi Hasan to talk about the rise of British Trumpism. | Former Vice President Joe Biden has jumped to a surprisingly large lead in the Democratic race. But in an era when Democrats are increasingly young, racially diverse, and socialist-leaning, are they really about to nominate a 76-year-old white male from the establishment wing of the party? The bigger problem with Biden of course is his political record—from his role in the Anita Hill hearings to his vote for the 1994 crime bill to his cozy relationship with the credit card industry.

But as Black and Puerto Rican parents in Ocean Hill-Brownsville tried to exercise power over their schools, they collided headfirst with the teachers’ union — leading to the longest teachers’ strike in American history, 51 years ago this fall.What started as a local pilot project turned into one of the most divisive racial confrontations ever witnessed in New York City. Ocean Hill-Brownsville made the national news for months, shattered political coalitions and created new ones, and fundamentally shaped the city we live in today.But as the strike shut down schools citywide, Ocean Hill-Brownsville mobilized to keep their schools open — and prove to the world that Black people could educate their own children and run their own institutions successfully.

Here’s a member of Johnson’s Conservative Party, Dominic Grieve, calling Johnson’s move "tantamount to a coup against Parliament."We referenced this BuzzFeed article about possible ideas Johnson has floated to try to force Brexit through.Business Insider has a good piece explaining the debate about how involved the queen should get in all this.Hosts:Jennifer Williams (@jenn_ruth), Senior Foreign Editor, VoxZack Beauchamp (@zackbeauchamp), Senior Correspondent, VoxAlex Ward (@AlexWardVox), National security reporter, VoxMore to explore:Subscribe for free to Today, Explained, Vox’s daily news podcast to help you understand the news, hosted by Sean Rameswaram.About Vox:Vox is a news network that helps you cut through the noise and understand what\'s really driving the events in the headlines.Follow Us:Vox.com\xa0Newsletter: Vox Sentences\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

They explain why preserving the health of the massive rainforest is vital to addressing climate change, and how the policies of Brazil’s right-wing populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, have helped cause the wildfires and jeopardized the Amazon rainforest’s very survival. Umair tells stories from his recent visit to Brazil, while Zack recalls a sweaty walk to work.Links!Here’s Umair’s piece on all the fires raging around the world right now.Vox’s Jen Kirby explained Bolsonaro 101.Some background on Bolsonaro’s environmental policy.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Zack, Jenn, and Alex discuss the recently deceased Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty — a Cold War-era agreement that was supposed to stop the US and Russia from putting destabilizing missiles too close to each other. They explain where the treaty came from, why it mattered, and why Trump pulled out of it — and cap it off with a discussion of whether the treaty’s demise was a good thing or not. Zack does his best (worst?) Yaakov Smirnoff impression, Jenn breaks down the song “99 Red Balloons” at length, and Alex laughs at Mikhail Gorbachev’s jokes.Alex’s recent INF treaty explainerUS President Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev sign the INF in 1987Here’s the full text of the treaty if you want to read it yourself.The Worldly hosts prefer this cover of “99 Red Balloons” by Goldfinger, but their producer Byrd maintains that the Nena version is best. Editorial director Liz Nelson, meanwhile, recommends this version from the punk band 7 Seconds.Zack mentioned that there were several times we came close to nuclear war thanks to misinterpretations or accidents. If you want to know even more, we recommend reading the chilling book Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety.Here’s more background on the Obama administration’s policy toward the INF treaty and Russia’s apparent violation of it. And here’s then-US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in November 2018 laying out the evidence the intelligence community has showing that Russia violated the terms of the treaty.Oh, and here’s Russia’s government denying it did so, and instead accusing the US of having violated the treaty.Also, more on the “missile gap”Here is a smart op-ed laying out the case for\xa0pulling out of the treaty and building more of these missiles, and here’s a smart op-ed laying out the case against\xa0pulling out of the treaty.Here’s some more background on National Security Adviser John Bolton’s well-known loathing of arms control agreements.\xa0 And we mentioned that China recently warned the US that it would take unspecified “countermeasures” if the US were to deploy these missiles near China.Learn more about your ad choices.

The Worldly team explains why Kashmiri autonomy is so sensitive, the ideological reasons why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to do something so destabilizing and provocative, and what this could mean for the always-volatile India-Pakistan relationship.Alex has an explainer about India’s Kashmir power grab.The New Yorker has a good piece on the India-Pakistan partition.Vox also has an explainer on the violence between Pakistan and India earlier this year.A part of Article 370 of India’s constitution reads: “[T]he President may, by public notification, declare that this article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify.”India’s home minister said Modi’s government would give Jammu and Kashmir its statehood back once normalcy returned to the area, but also that Modi’s government still lays claim to Pakistan’s part of Kashmir.People, including Pakistan’s prime minister, are afraid there will be ethnic cleansing. Pakistan’s army chief said his nation would “go to any extent” to protect Kashmir’s residents, and Imran Khan, the prime minister, warned that a fight could break out.Learn more about your ad choices.

The most recent fight is over Turkey’s purchase of a Russian missile system, but that’s emblematic of a much deeper rift relating to the Turkish government’s drift towards authoritarianism and the two ally’s diametrically opposed policies in Syria. They also then venture some guesses about whether this could get better — but since this is Worldly, you probably know where our hosts are going to come down on that.Links!Alex explains the background on the S-400 missile situation.Turkey’s bid to join NATO was approved in 1951 (though it was technically effective in 1952).Here’s a diplomatic cable from 1964 on how the Johnson administration’s handling of Cyprus shaped the US-Turkey relationship (wasn’t good!)Alex’s piece also has a good short explanation on Gulf War tensions between the US and Turkey.Here’s a Zack piece on the complicated US-Turkey-Kurdish tensions in Syria.And another Zack piece on Turkey’s conflict with Kurdish separatists inside its borders.Pastor Andrew Brunson, explained.And here’s some solid background on how Turkey and Russia are growing closer.Learn more about your ad choices.

What’s it like to be the son or daughter of a dictator? Why did one dictator’s son go from a high-flying life playing football in Italy to being shorn like a sheep in the hands of rebels? Why did the cannibal emperor of Bangui murder a woman who claimed to be his long-lost daughter? And in the cutthroat world of politics, is nepotism necessary to survive? We’ll answer those questions across the globe from Equatorial Guinea to Uzbekistan and from Libya to the United States.\xa0 \xa0 Thank you to all who have listened to Series 1 of the podcast.

The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh.  \xa0 | What makes ordinary people commit extraordinarily violent acts? Is it their brain chemistry? Social pressure? Or a charismatic leader telling them it's their patriotic duty? In this episode, we explore the morality of a scientist who gave life to billions--but also facilitated the murder of millions; a psychiatrist who studied the brains of Nazi war criminals; a Rwandan who lost most of her family in the 1994 genocide; and hear from two experts on how authoritarian leaders can convince seemingly kind people to murder their neighbors. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. | When you think of heists, you probably think of masked men, bank robbers, and priceless art. But governments carry out heists, too. In this episode, we explore a billion dollar bank heist carried out by North Korean hackers; a heist carried out by a dictator who pledged to rule for a billion years (and was obsessed with mayonnaise); and a jewel heist that destroyed diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Thailand for a generation.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. | Why do dictators and despots create outlandish myths about themselves? Why spread lies claiming that you've written 18,000 books or that you personally invented hamburgers? Why waste millions on a golden statue of yourself that rotates to face the sun? It turns out there's a method to their madness. In this episode, we examine some of the weirdest and most brutal dictators on the planet to understand the three step playbook for how despots across the globe try to transform themselves from flawed tyrants into seemingly flawless demigods with a cult of personality. \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. | The UK has a new prime minister. On his first day, Boris Johnson will handwrite four identical letters to the captains of Britain's nuclear submarines. They are one of the most closely guarded secrets of the British government. And those Letters of Last Resort will only be opened if London is wiped out by a nuclear blast. The letters must answer a straightforward but morally complex question: should the UK fire back with nuclear weapons? To deter nuclear attacks, the answer must be yes. But can we stomach that answer, given that nuclear retaliation could endanger the survival of our species?  ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh.  \xa0 | How did 2 guys you've never heard of save the world from nuclear apocalypse? Can nuclear weapons be hacked? What's the most consequential honeymoon in human history? Why was a British nuclear weapon designed to contain live chickens in the bomb casing? And why are nuclear bombs useful for detecting art forgeries? \xa0 \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. | You’ve probably heard of money laundering, but how does it actually work? How did billions of dollars of dirty gold from South America become clean cash in Florida and Ohio? How do crooks launder money using video games? Why are journalists getting killed for exposing money laundering? And what in the world is “cuckoo smurfing”? \xa0 \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. | Why are countries that are rich in natural resources so often poor and war-torn? You’ve probably heard of blood diamonds, but what about blood vanilla, blood microchips, or blood chocolate? How are rebels and terrorists funding themselves with watermelons and wheat? We crisscross the globe from Papua New Guinea to Madagascar to find out. \xa0 \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. \xa0 | Nick Yarris spent 22 years on death row. At one point, he even escaped. But then, right before he was slated to be executed, DNA evidence proved he was innocent. Is the death penalty justified? Can a just society execute people? Are you more likely to be executed if you kill a white person? And why do most death sentences come from a tiny number of American counties? \xa0 \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas. The executive producer and sound editor is George McDonagh. | What's something that you do every 2 weeks? For Michelle Lyons, over a span of 12 years, she watched someone get executed every two weeks in Texas. What are inmates like on their last day alive? Did she have misgivings watching people take their last breath? And what do people who are strapped to the gurney actually say for their final statements? \xa0  \xa0 ---- \xa0 Power Corrupts is written and narrated by Brian Klaas.

Brad Moss, a lawyer who specializes in whistleblower law, also weighs in on his concerns about protecting the whistleblower\'s identity in light of President Trump\'s claims that he deserves the right to confront his accuser. "If the president wants to be able to invoke his sixth amendment rights to confront his accusers, he can have DOJ rescind the memo saying he can\'t be indicted and we can try this through the criminal process. I don\'t think he wants that," Moss tells "The Investigation." | After a brief hiatus, "The Investigation" is back and diving into all angles of the launch of the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

After a 22 month investigation, a 448 page report, and countless Presidential tweets-Robert Mueller himself was sworn in to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees. Now, our co-hosts Chris Vlasto, John Santucci and Matt Mosk are joined by ABC News Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran to break down all the critical moments for both sides of the aisle, from Congressman Ted Lieu\'s question about the Office of Legal Counsel opinion that had Democrats temporarily rejoicing, to Mueller\'s passionate defense of his investigation: "It is not a witch hunt." Thomas, who has covered Mueller for decades, brings historical context to today\'s testimony: "he\'ll be remembered as a guy who didn’t want to play politics, he did not want to engage in a circus." | With less than 24 hours to go before Robert Mueller\'s anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill, "The Investigation" sits down with one of the members of the House Judiciary who will ask the special counsel questions - Congressman David Cicilline: "I think it\'s deadly serious and I think that\'s how the hearing will proceed." As for his thoughts on Mueller\'s final report, the Rhode Island Congressman sums it up: "The evidence he collected is explosive and damning and very, very disturbing." And when it comes to impeachment proceedings, Cicilline tells "The Investigation" it is a "serious undertaking... in my mind equivalent to a war vote." | In this episode of\xa0The Investigation,\xa0presidential candidate and US Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) talks about why he\'s ratcheting up calls for Trump\'s impeachment, even though it continues to be a contentious topic with his colleagues in the House and fellow 2020 contenders. "We\xa0spend too much time in this party debating the politics of impeachment, when the law is very clear and our constitutional duty is clear," Moulton says, explaining why he thinks that skimming over the topic in the lead up to the general election would be "a mistake," and why he believes that Robert Mueller\'s pending appearance on Capitol Hill could be a game changer. Later, the ABC team forecasts what to expect from Mueller\'s testimony and analyzes the political roadblocks facing congressional democrats who want to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump.', 'chan_desc': 'It\'s one of the rarest political events in American history, one that only three presidents have ever experienced before today.

Migrants from all over the world would arrive fleeing war, escaping poverty and seeking opportunity. Open borders made our country strong. But many Americans today are horrified — or frightened — by the idea of “open borders.” Harsh new immigration policies are making it more difficult than ever to come to the U.S. or even ask for asylum. Nevertheless, violence, oppression, poverty, desperation, and hope continue to drive migrants to our borders. Last year, more than 1,000 migrants from Central America gathered near the border of Guatemala and Mexico to travel north in search of asylum. Radical Imagination host Angela Glover Blackwell sits down with Roberto Corona, founder of People Without Borders, an organization that assisted this refugee caravan.

Murray examines the most divisive issues today, including sexuality, gender, and technology, and how new culture wars are playing out everywhere in the name of social justice, identity politics, and intersectionality. Is European culture and society in a death spiral caused by immigration and assimilation? Robinson and Murray also discuss the roles that Brexit and the rise of populism in European politics play in writing immigration laws across the European Union.\xa0 | Recorded on September 5, 2019.Peter Robinson opens the show by asking Thiel’s views on his own essay “The Straussian Moment.” Thiel responds by saying that people today believe in the power of the will but no longer trust the power of the intellect, the mind, and rationality. The question of human nature has been abandoned. We no longer trust people’s ability to think through issues. Thiel notes that this shift began to take place in 1969, when the United States put a man on the moon; three weeks later Woodstock took place, moving the culture in the direction of yoga and psychological retreat.\xa0Thiel further adds that there was still hope that things would open up for the world in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed, but that the leaders of China and other East Asian countries did not accept that openness would solve their problems. Instead they learned the opposite lessons from those events: that if you open things up too much, then things fall apart.Thiel ends the interview by noting that there is nothing automatic or deterministic about how history happens, and he expresses his views that economic growth plays a vital role in a country’s future. | Recorded on August 21, 2019Peter Robinson opens the show by asking General Jim Mattis, former secretary of defense, to explain the word “chaos” from the title of his new book, Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. (“Chaos” is an abbreviation for “Colonel Has Another Outstanding Suggestion.”) Mattis notes that chaos has been a part and parcel of his life growing up, in the marines, and traveling the world.Mattis further talks about how chaos has been introduced by organizations to disrupt order and keep opponents at the top of their game. But on the battlefield, it is better to introduce chaos early, in order to disrupt enemies’ plans and thus create problems for them and, ultimately, dominate them.Robinson asks about what led Mattis to join the marines and why he decided to serve so long. Mattis explains his love for the country and the great people he met in the service. The fellow soldiers kept him going and inspired him to jot down lessons he had learned that could help future generations learn to serve and lead in better ways. Mattis notes that it is the very high quality of the people whom he met in the armed services that kept him in the military for his career. Mattis talks about how soldiers are brave, rambunctious, and selfless, and how he would rather have crummy jobs at times and work with great people than have a great job and not work with the outstanding people Mattis encountered in the military.\xa0Additional resources:https://www.wsj.com/articles/jim-mattis-duty-democracy-and-the-threat-of-tribalism-11566984601https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gen-jim-mattis-on-war-and-trump/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/james-mattis-on-why-he-left-the-trump-administration-but-wont-criticize-ithttps://www.npr.org/2019/09/02/756681750/jim-mattis-nations-with-allies-thrive-nations-without-allies-wither | Recorded on April 18, 2019Peter Robinson opens the session by discussing the major improvements that happened over the last one hundred years in the United States, between 1919 and 2019. For example, the GDP per person rose by 760 percent, life expectancy improved from 59 to 79 years, and various other automotive, technological, medical, and quality-of-life advances were achieved.Robinson then starts the discussion with former secretary of state George Shultz, who encourages a broader vision as we look for the reasons for prosperity. Shultz discusses some of the major events that occurred during the 20th century, e.g., the Great Depression, currency manipulation, World War II, and the Holocaust, whose negative impacts framed the mindset of Americans to question the institutions underlying society. Robinson then asks John Cogan about these institutions—private property, the rule of law, free markets—and the importance of these for prosperity. Cogan explains those institutions are necessary for sustained prosperity, which demands conditions that are stable in order to fuel economic growth.Robinson asks Terry Anderson about the importance of property rights. Terry says that property rights are the key to providing people with incentives to care for and maintain the property they own. Anderson notes that nobody washes rental cars, because they don’t own them.Robinson asks Lee Ohanian about the role of immigration in prosperity. Ohanian says that the United States has been fortunate in attracting the best talents from all over the world, which has played a major role in sustaining prosperity. Ohanian notes that having an inflow of immigrants like Sergey Brin from Soviet Union, Elon Musk from South Africa, and others has helped the United States stay on the cutting edge of innovation with new and fresh ideas. | Recorded on July 18, 2019What did Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin want at the beginning of the Second World War? Peter Robinson starts the discussion by why the “big three” came together as allies in response to Operation Barbarossa during the war. What did the leaders of the “grand alliance” of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union want? What were their national interests?Robinson asks Roberts if Churchill aimed to preserve the British Empire. Roberts explains that Churchill’s interests were just in national survival. As Britain was under the threat of massive invasion from Germany, he wanted to make sure that the Russians stayed in the war until the Germans were wiped out completely. Roberts also notes that Churchill wanted Russia to ensure that the Americans, when they did finally enter the war in December 1941, were guided toward a Mediterranean strategy.Kennedy discusses Roosevelt’s motive for joining into an alliance in the aftermath of Operation Barbarossa, before officially entering the war. Kennedy says that Roosevelt wanted to make the world safe for the democratic practices and institutions that had already been established, but he did not seek to expand democracy throughout the world. Next, Robinson asks Kotkin about Stalin’s aim for allying with Britain and United States as well as why Stalin did not quickly respond to Hitler’s actions in Soviet Union despite having one of the biggest armies in the world. Kotkin replies that there was misinformation that made Stalin think that Hitler would not actually attack, that Hitler was only amassing the troops to blackmail Stalin into giving up Ukraine and other territories without actually having to fight. Lastly, Kotkin explains, Stalin also joined the grand alliance for national survival.Robinson then continues the discussion with Roberts, Kennedy, and Kotkin by asking how things turned out for the three allies after the war. They examine who won and who lost over both the short term and the long term, as well as how the postwar world set the stage for the emergence of new strong powers, particularly China.This event addresses these and many other important lessons and questions:What happens when an international system that is supposed to keep the peace among nations breaks down?How do nations deal with the breakdown and rebuilding of international order?How can Western civilization remain strong?What are the defense resources required to protect free countries from unpleasant predators in the world? | Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin’s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or\xa0replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin’s theory in their two books and essay, respectively\xa0The Deniable Darwin,\xa0Darwin’s Doubt, and “Giving Up Darwin” (published in the\xa0Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term “species” has not been defined by the authors to Darwin’s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin’s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): “Beauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe—walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track—most of the time.” Gelernter notes that there’s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture—not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin’s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.Robinson then asks the panel whether Darwin’s theory of gradual evolution is contradicted by the explosion of fossil records in the Cambrian period, when there was a sudden occurrence of many species over the span of approximately seventy million years (Meyer’s noted that the date range for the Cambrian period is actually narrowing). Meyer replies that even population genetics, the mathematical branch of Darwinian theory, has not been able to support the explosion of fossil records during the Cambrian period, biologically or geologically.Robinson than asks about Darwin’s main problem, molecular biology, to which Meyer explains, comparing it to digital world, that building a new biological function is similar to building a new code, which Darwin could not understand in his era. Berlinski does not second this and states that the cell represents very complex machinery, with complexities increasing over time, which is difficult to explain by a theory. Gelernter throws light on this by giving an example of a necklace on which the positioning of different beads can lead to different permutations and combinations; it is really tough to choose the best possible combination, more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack. He seconds Meyer’s statement that it was impossible for Darwin to understand that in his era, since the math is easy but he did not have the facts. Meyer further explains how difficult it is to know what a protein can do to a cell, the vast combinations it can produce, and how rare is the possibility of finding a functional protein. He then talks about the formation of brand-new organisms, for which mutation must affect genes early in the life form’s development in order to control the expression of other genes as the organism grows.“Intelligent design” is something only Meyer agrees with, but Berlinski replies that as a scientific approach, one can agree or disagree with it, but should not reject it. Meyer talks about the major discovery in the 1950s and ’60s concerning the DNA molecule, which encodes information in a somewhat digital format, providing researchers with the opportunity to trace the information back to its source. Gelernter argues that if there was/is an intelligent designer then why is the design not the most efficient, rather than prone to all sorts of problems, including the mental and emotional.Robinson quotes Gelernter: “Darwinism is no longer just a scientific theory but a basis of a worldview, and an emergency . . . religion for the many troubled souls who need one.” Gelernter further adds that it’s a fantastically challenging problem that Darwin chose to address. How difficult will it be for scientists to move on from Darwin’s theory of evolution? Will each scientist need to examine the evidence for his or herself? These are some of most important questions facing science in the 21st century. | David Berlinski is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, a contributing editor at Inference: International Review of Science, and author of many books. Berlinski discusses his book The Deniable Darwin and lays out how Charles Darwin has failed to explain the origin of species through his theory of evolution.Berlinski explains that change in biology is not continuous—it’s radical, something which Darwinian theory fails to explain. He discusses how Darwinian evolution is blind to the future as there is no fidelity to the facts. He gives examples of amino acids and dogs and explains why there cannot be just one species. He further strengthens his statement by saying that everything cannot be accounted for as being random: there should be some scientific evidence to support it.Berlinski responds to Peter Robinson’s question about Razib Khan’s statement to the effect that, “The seeds of both tyranny and democracy were sown by the evolutionary pressures that shaped humans over millions of years.” He argues that the deepest aspects of our nature are not formed by evolutionary pressures because evolution is relatively neutral. He also replies to Robinson’s question about a remark of Pope Benedict XVI to the effect that Western thought, by its very nature, “excludes the question of God, making it appear an unscientific or pre-scientific question.” He explains that it is not right to argue that physical theories imply that the conclusion is antitheist, as mere exclusion in these theories does not imply that.Robinson further asks Berlinski’s views about the growing population of Islam and decreasing population of Europeans in Europe. Berlinski explains that Muslims take religion seriously, but theology/religion has more or less disappeared from the Western habit of thought. He states that faith and religion should come together.Berlinski further talks about how Albert Einstein’s comments disprove God, not because he is an antitheist, but because Einstein wanted to push quantum theory and his belief in the rational universe.Finally, Robinson asks about Europe’s survival in terms of economy, population, and growth, and Berlinski says that the nation-state is an idea that is no longer there and that patriotism is disappearing. | Recorded: Recorded on May 15, 2019David Davenport, Hoover fellow and coauthor of How Public Policy Became War, analyzes how presidents have too readily declared war (on terror, drugs, poverty, you name it) and called the nation into crisis, partly to tackle the problem and partly to increase their own power.Davenport explains how policy options have been left behind because the war metaphor reduces the constraints and expands the power of what a president can do. Davenport discusses how Franklin Roosevelt used the declaration of war to expand government and shift the balance of power in the United States in a new direction, away from Congress and the states and toward a strong executive branch. Davenport notes that Roosevelt exchanged the founders’ vision of deliberation and moderation in the federal government for war and action.Davenport explains how, through the course of time, Congress has lost its ability to deliberate, negotiate, compromise, and draft bills, which results in giving more power to the executive branch. Davenport says that members of Congress are sent to Washington to represent us, and they need to be statesmen rather than party loyalists and step up to their proper constitutional role.Davenport also discusses executive orders that permit the president to issue an order on his own without any congressional legislation. He talks about the number of executive orders that have been used by presidents throughout history and how they have impacted the nation.As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers.Finally, Davenport says he believes that President Trump is on the right track when he takes measures to limit the administrative state. | Recorded on May 15, 2019.What’s wrong with public education in the United States? Betsy DeVos, US secretary of education, analyzes the role of government in the US education system and the changes she’s making to the Department of Education. She discusses her proposal to overhaul the federal education system by rolling back government overreach from the previous administration. She argues that states and parents need to be empowered to make better informed and flexible decisions for where students attend schools. Her plan is to offer states the opportunity to enroll in an optional tax-credit program that would enable more parents to choose where their children go to school, including charter schools.Secretary DeVos briefly touches on Title IX. She argues that, even though one sexual assault on a college campus is too many, better protections need to be put into place for the accused to be considered innocent until proven guilty. Peter Robinson and Secretary DeVos also discuss the trials of working in her current position and her dedication to serving the parents and students of the United States. | Recorded on April 1, 2019Is discrimination the reason behind economic inequality in the United States? Thomas Sowell dismisses that \xa0\xa0\xa0 question with a newly revised edition of his book\xa0Discrimination and Disparities. He sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss the long history of disparities among humans around the world and throughout time. He argues that discrimination has significantly less of a role to play in inequality than contemporary politicians give it credit for, and that something as incontrovertible as birth order of children has a more significant and statistically higher impact on success than discrimination. He discusses why parental attention is the most important aspect of a child’s intellectual development.Sowell goes on to break down different minority groups around the world who went on to have more economic and political success than their majority counterparts, such as the Indians in East Africa, Jewish people in Eastern Europe, Cubans in the United States, and the Chinese in Malaysia. He argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong.Sowell goes on to discuss changes in crime rates and poverty since the expansion of US welfare programs in the 1960s and how this has had a huge impact on the success of African Americans. He talks about his own experience growing up in New York, how housing projects used to be considered a positive place to live, and his experience as the first member of his family to enter the seventh grade. Robinson asks Sowell his thoughts on the case for reparations currently being made in Congress, and Sowell presents an argument about why a plan for reparations is not only illogical but also impossible to implement, with so many US citizens’ ancestors arriving long after the Civil War. He also explains that slavery was common throughout the known world for thousands of years and that abolition movements didn’t begin anywhere in the world until the late 18th century.

Drew and John discuss Drew\'s experience with the criminal justice system and his road to addiction recovery. Drew is an addict in recovery and a libertarian.

He was later arrested for “Trafficking in Dangerous Drugs”, the result of being the target of multiple controlled buys by a former friend. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison, serving the last 6 months in a halfway house. After his release, Matt taught himself how to repair cars in order to make himself marketable and has been working in the field ever since.\xa0 Matt hosts a podcast called The Statist Quo, which seeks to fill in the blanks left by the mainstream media on war and military matters, as well as exploring history, current events, politics and economics from a libertarian perspective. | On this week\'s Electric Libertyland comedian Ryan Stout joins Brian for the 3rd time to offer his hilarious and insightful take on the current state of comedy. Ryan and Brian talk about the Chappelle special reaction and then get into cancel culture taking out quickly fired Saturday Night Live cast member Shane Gillis over "racist" remarks from a podcast.

Donnie describes his political beliefs while serving in the military and how he began to look at government differently after leaving. Donnie and Marc discuss Donnie\'s idea of how blockchain technology will essentially make everyone "their own Senator", and just how it paves the way for what the "direct Republic" referred to in his book title. This is a really intriguing idea on how we can achieve a more free society, and I think you\'re all going to enjoy it!

Migrants from all over the world would arrive fleeing war, escaping poverty and seeking opportunity. Open borders made our country strong. But many Americans today are horrified by the idea of “open borders.” Harsh new immigration policies are making it more difficult than ever to come to the U.S. or even ask for asylum. Nevertheless, violence, oppression, poverty, desperation, and hope continue to drive migrants to our borders. Last year, more than 1,000 migrants from Central America gathered near the border of Guatemala and Mexico to travel north in search of asylum.\xa0 \xa0 Radical\xa0Imagination\xa0host\xa0Angela Glover Blackwell\xa0of\xa0PolicyLink\xa0sits down with Roberto Corona, founder of\xa0People Without Borders, an organization that assisted this refugee caravan.
