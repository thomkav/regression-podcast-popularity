Listen as we chat about everything from toxic masculinity to his amazing skin-care routine. Enjoy!Resources:Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love\xa0by Jonathan Van Ness | "Body positivity to me means being able to love yourself as you are right now. So that doesn\'t mean [like] I love myself when I can fit into this dress..." This episode, Michelle and\xa0Tess Holliday\xa0caught up right in the midst of New York Fashion Week. Fashion, beauty, and culture at large are experiencing this tipping point in which this model, activist, and industry influencer is intimately connected. The air is ripe for self-acceptance, for self-care, and for self-love — finally, and these two are so here for it. A woman who radiates charisma and kindness, Tess is an inspiring, honest, and all-around empowering force for change. | This episode, Michelle caught up with\xa0Patrick\xa0Starrr. He was in LA, and Michelle was in her office in New York - but we made it happen!\xa0Patrick\xa0is part of this cultural change - this seismic shift - where we’re making a space for everyone in our world of beauty. We\'re really excited for you all to hear about his journey, his point-of-view on the industry today, and the ways he is working to change and shift culture even further.\xa0 | The third episode of the podcast features Bozoma Saint John. Bozoma has become one of the most influential marketers of our generation working at companies like Pepsi, Beats, and now as the Chief Marketing Officer at Endeavor, a global media agency. And in the process, she’s broken down numerous barriers: becoming one of the few black women to make it to the C-suite in Silicon Valley, promoting self-acceptance and self-worth and showing us what it means to be both powerful and vulnerable in her career. "She’s one of the most inspiring speakers I’ve ever seen whether at an event OR recording a podcast on the sofa in my office," says Michelle. | Gone are the days when women were expected to be coy — even lie — about their real age, as though it’s a shameful secret. Today, the conversation around getting older is changing — and some of the sharpest minds in the business are leading the discussion. In the second episode of Allure’s new podcast, our guest Maye Musk reveals her own story with editor in chief Michelle Lee — a story that, as you’ll hear, shows the cultural impact of increased representation for age groups that have historically been neglected, particularly as it pertains to beauty. An impossibly charming and successful woman, 70-year-old Maye reveals how her professional and personal experiences shaped her career, her approach to parenting, and, of course, her beauty must-haves. And don’t forget to catch up on our very first episode below!Thank you to this episode\'s sponsor, Ulta Beauty.  | In the first installment, Youtube-rapper-turned-blockbuster-star Awkwafina (who you likely laughed out loud at in Oceans 8 and Crazy Rich Asians) opens up about her meteoric rise, the importance of representation, her beauty routine and... slime.

Brown discusses her career\'s origin story in unwittingly creating the "no makeup" makeup look, her stint as Yahoo\'s beauty editor ("which was amazing for someone who doesn\'t know how to type"), and why 2016 was high time for her to leave Estée Lauder Companies. | This week, beauty editor Priya Rao sits down with Anne Maza, the co-owner and vice president of sales and marketing at hair brand Olivia Garden. Maza discusses evolving a 52-year-old brand for today\'s customer, walking the line between the professional and consumer hair segments, and protecting the company\'s top quality products against counterfeits. | This week, beauty editor Priya Rao sits down with Katia Beauchamp, CEO and co-founder of Birchbox, the company that sends monthly packages with a few samples of beauty products -- after that, it\'s up to the user to determine whether they want to take their relationship with this or that swatch of makeup to the next level. Katia discusses establishing Birchbox\'s appeal to the everyday beauty consumer, its recent partnership with Walgreens, and its plans for international expansion. | This week, beauty editor Priya Rao sits down with Nicola Kilner, CEO and co-founder of Deciem, umbrella company to cult-favorite skin-care brand The Ordinary. Kilner discusses why demand should lead product supply, why fashion retailers make good partners and how Deciem is faring following founder Brandon Truaxe’s removal from the company and subsequent death early this year.\xa0 | In two short years, direct-to-consumer company Hims launched a sister brand Hers, raised nearly $200 million in funding and became one of few digital-only unicorns. And it all started with taking medicines like finasteride and sildenafil (better known by brand names Propecia and Viagra, respectively), and repositioning them with the end customer in mind. On this week\'s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, Hilary Coles, cofounder and vice president of product development at Hims and Hers, sits down with Glossy\'s Priya Rao to discuss whether telemedicine is wellness, how Hims and Hers have evolved their out-of-the-box engagement efforts, and what the company is planning for retail. | Michael Bumgarner was not an avid beauty consumer before launching his CBD skin-care brand Cannuka in 2017, but he did have a history in rural farming that led him to see the power of cannabis. "Because of my background in farming, I got really interested in industrial hemp, and I wanted to create a brand that was very much approachable to the canna-curious consumer," he said. "Looking at the cannabis industry, we saw a big gap in products being developed specifically for that consumer, and so we looked at it as an opportunity to reintroduce cannabis in a different way." Shortly after the Farm Bill passed in December 2018, Cannuka ramped up distribution in nearly all Ulta stores, as well as at Free People, Anthropologie, Riley Rose and Neiman Marcus. On this week’s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, Bumgarner sits down with Glossy’s Priya Rao to discuss why betting on a direct-to-consumer strategy was not viable, why retailers are taking a risk on cannabis and how making a splash in skin care will open the door for cannabis wellness products and ingestibles.\xa0 | When beauty influencer and content creator Jackie Aina got her start on YouTube over a decade ago, her very new, public persona wasn\'t something she necessarily wanted to shout from the roof tops. "If you were a YouTuber in 2009 you were a weirdo," she said. "People were like, \'You\'re literally talking to yourself\' and you\'re recording the process, so it wasn\'t something that I was like, \'Oh guys, look what I\'m doing.\' Clearly, that has changed today as Aina has a 5 million-plus social following across platforms. Her take on beatuy extends to culture, which is why some of the most talked about brands in beauty, like Too Faced and Anastasia Beverly Hills, have come knocking on her door. On this week\'s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, Aina sits down with Glossy\'s Priya Rao to discuss developing her social voice, the business of being an influencer and yes, the Kardashians. | Perfect Corp. is on a mission to transform the beauty industry through AR and AI innovation. For Alice Chang, the CEO of the Taiwanese tech company, it all started when she realized the power of giving someone the tools to make themselves feel beautiful. Founded in 2014, the tech company has launched a series of AR apps, like YouCam Perfect, which uses a \'beautify\' function and other photo editing software to help users craft the perfect selfie. Perfect Corp. has also partnered with brands and retailers, such as Ulta, to create an in-store, virtual try-on experience, so customers can interact with cosmetics before committing to a purchase. On this week\'s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, beauty editor Priya Rao sits down with Chang to discuss how Perfect Corp. is marrying tech and beauty, how it\'s individualizing in-store AR experiences for each brand, and how AI could revolutionize a consumer\'s beauty experience. | Unlike those suddenly hopping on the bandwagon, Robert Rosenheck has been working in cannabis for years. Growing up in a conservative family, Rosenheck avoided the recreational drug until finally sampling it with some friends during his senior year of college. He found it gave him a temporary release from the depression he had been struggling with for years. A few short years later, after a rock climbing accident left him with a broken ankle and chronic pain, he discovered that topicals infused with cannabis helped alleviate some of his suffering. In 2013, Rosenheck and his wife, Cindy Capobianco, decided it was time to create a brand of their own that celebrated cannabis. Thus, Lord Jones was born. Over the past six years, Lord Jones has garnered endorsements from celebs like Mandy Moore, entered retail partnerships with SoulCycle and Sephora, and most recently, announced a $300 million acquisition from Canadian pot company Cronos. But with all of the brand\'s success, Rosenheck said the stigma and confusing regulations surrounding CBD and cannabis remain big challenges. On this week\'s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, Lord Jones founder and CEO Robert Rosenheck sits down with Glossy\'s Priya Rao to discuss what makes a quality CBD product, what makes SoulCycle and Sephora the perfect retail partners, and whether the brand will branch out to THC. | Since its launch in 2012, Violet Grey has made a name for itself among multi-brand beauty retailers, thanks to a carefully curated selection of products that helps consumers cut through the clutter and get straight to the good stuff. As the company continues to grow and develop its offering, it\'s making a big push toward content and storytelling, to help consumers learn what Violet Grey is and what it stands for, said CEO April Uchitel. In this week\'s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, beauty editor Priya Rao sits down with Uchitel to discuss how Violet Grey differentiates itself from other retailers, how it\'s using editorial content to make luxury seem more accessible and how it\'s strategizing to build brand awareness.', 'chan_desc': 'The Glossy Beauty Podcast is the newest podcast from Glossy. \nEach 30-minute episode features candid conversations about how today’s trends, such as CBD and self-care, are shaping the future of the beauty and wellness industries.

I give you my top recommendations and the key reason why it is important to start treatment sooner than later. I help patients-women and men- to regrow their hair. I evaluate patients with blood tests, a scalp/hair examination, and hormone/thyroid/vitamin level testing. There are many things we can do to stimulate hair follicles and promote hair growth.\xa0 I perform cutting-edge Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections using your own stem cell growth factors to the scalp. I also recommend physician strength vitamins, DHT blockers, and physician strength topical hair regrowth treatments.Don\'t wait until thinning is permanent.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | On this edition of Fashioning Identity, we hosted a live panel at NeueHouse during New York Fashion Week with a special focus on intersectionality.The Fashioning Identity episodes examine one layer of identity – gender or race, for example – but the reality is many of us check off more than one minority box. As a result, these overlapping layers of identity create unique experiences and systems of discrimination that shape our lives. To explore this, we invited a guest from each of our past episodes to share their point of view on intersectionality and fashion’s role in it. Our panelists included social activist and author Jodie Patterson; journalist, producer, and speaker Noor Tagouri; Suited magazine founder, tailor, and designer Ash Owens; and Sneeze magazine partner and brand director Bradley Carbone. NeueHouse, the private workspace located in New York City and Los Angeles, is known for bringing together creatives and thought-leaders to dissect new ideas and, thus, provided an ideal environment to facilitate this important conversation. Host Sachin Bhola kicked things off with a discussion on the past and present state of inclusion in the fashion industry and why it’s been able to get away with the lack of it for so long. Bhola then probed into intersectionality and what that meant for our panelists. “I\'m not even sure if people want to peel back all the layers,” Patterson commented. “I have a son who\'s a black transgender boy and I find that to be hard for people to wrap their head around. I\'m a black woman who\'s lived hetero and I\'m in a queer relationship now and people are like, ‘Well, what does that mean?’" We then wrapped up by considering what the future of fashion and identity politics looks like. This episode of Fashioning Identity was recorded live at NeueHouse, and calls attention to people with intersectional identities, how fashion overlaps with them, what people can do to influence change, and more.Learn more about your ad choices.

The Daily Paper dudes also have some spicy #muleboyz takes when Hussein addresses Jian and Noah’s questionable taste in shoes (6:06). Though admittedly—most of that funny swag comes from Noah. The conversation takes a more serious turn in discussing B.STROY’s controversial collection featuring hoodies emblazoned with the names of schools where shootings have taken place (20:43). Jian and Noah were at the show last week and talked to the designers—and previous Dropcast guests—about why they chose to make such a polarizing statement on the runway, as well as fashion’s previous brushes with controversial matter.

To begin, host Sachin Bhola speaks to Stephanie Thomas, the founder and CEO of Cur8able, a company that specializes in dressing with disabilities. Thomas provides a snapshot of the role clothing played for people with disabilities in the past and then discusses the challenges they face in participating in fashion today. She also offers advice on how the industry can better serve the market, which includes a discussion on the appropriate language to use.Next, Jian DeLeon, Highsnobiety\'s editorial director, speaks to Bradley Carbone.

Why does that even matter? Do you waste time on social media and then complain you don’t have time to do the things that would actually move you forward in your business? Do you ever feel like you’re on a never-ending hamster wheel, always moving but going nowhere? Danielle and Ani take on these topics in this week’s episode of the Big Money Stylist.\xa0  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In\xa0This Week’s Episode…..PRODUCTION Point #1: I’m Too Busy  With artists working behind the chair, there are simple marketing tactics they get to work on that are designed to increase their momentum and ultimately their business. One of them is called the Daily Four, which many complain they don’t have time to do. However, artists often fill their days with shit that doesn’t fucking matter. They’ll sit on Instagram for thirty minutes, scroll endlessly, and then do some shopping. “You could have been doing something that will make you money instead of just taking up your time.”  QUESTION  When you say you don’t have time for marketing or self-improvement, how are you\xa0really\xa0spending your time?  Point #2: False Loop  Sometimes in life, you’re moving so fast that the idea of trying to fit one more thing inside your life seems completely unfathomable. You feel like you’re almost sinking and can barely maintain what you already have on your plate. Danielle: A lot of times, we’ll be busy running on this hamster wheel, and it’s almost like we self-sabotage because we want to feel like we’re growing and learning, when in fact, we’re not even progressing. That is when we experience the false lift or false loop.  QUESTION  Where in your world are you experiencing this false loop?  Point #3: You’re Not Quite There Yet  Some artists are worried about things that are ten steps ahead of them. “Why are you worried about firing your fucking assistant if you don’t even have one?” This can actually hold you back in life and in business. Instead, concentrate on where you are\xa0right now\xa0and then take one step at a time. Example: start doing Daily Four, begin taking before/after photos, or start going live.  QUESTION  What is one thing you can begin implementing today rather than worrying about what’s ten steps ahead of you?  Point #4: Awareness  Awareness is\xa0so\xa0important, but it is not something that comes easily. It takes having the courage to be really honest with yourself. “I’m a very emotional person, but I’m not sensitive,” offers Ani. “And inside of that, I feel like I am a very self-aware person. I can take myself out of my feelings, take a step back, and take a look from the outside and ask myself, “If you weren’t emotionally attached to this, would you be upset?”  QUESTION  How is being self-aware a game-changer for you? \xa0  Point #5:\xa0 Zero Fucks Given  Danielle: Garrett tells me that my superpower is Zero Fucks Given, and asks how I do that? I HAVE to do that. I’ve gotten to a place in business where what another person says doesn’t impact me. Ani is the same way. “I can take emotion out of something, put it in a little box, and logically ask, what’s happening right now?” It’s imperative to take the raw emotion out of something to be able to solve problems; otherwise, things tend to spiral out of control.  QUESTION  What is\xa0your\xa0superpower? \xa0   Quote of the Week:  \xa0“It’s almost like we have our blinders on when we look at our art because art is so personal. But if you can learn to look at yourself constructively, that will help you progress and become a better artist.”  –Danielle K White  “I don’t aspire to be busy. I want to be productive, I want to be inventive, I want to be calm and balanced.”  –Anianne Rivera | In this week’s episode, Danielle arrives in an impressive head-to-toe 80s look as she and Ani take a walk down the memory lane of fashion and style. They also explore the ever-important topic of research, how to handle your clients’ expectations, and share the steps they are taking that are radically challenging the hair industry’s wide-spread “pay-to-play” policy. *Repeat Episode From January 2019* \xa0 \xa0  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  \xa0 \xa0 In\xa0This Week’s Episode…..PROTECTION \xa0 \xa0 Point #1: Embrace Change \xa0  Fashions and styles come and go and have a tendency to repeat every thirty years or so. Danielle remarks, “Let go of the old and accept the new. The old becomes the\xa0new\xa0new, so just let go.” “While short haircuts are trendy, extensions are\xa0always\xa0going to be classic and cool. We just need to make sure the styles stay consistent with the times.”  \xa0 QUESTION \xa0 \xa0  What fashions or styles have been\xa0your\xa0favorites through the years?  \xa0 \xa0 Point #2: Hand-Tied Hair \xa0 \xa0  Extension hair comes machine-tied and hand-tied. Sixteen years ago, Danielle discovered hand-tied hair. She liked it because the weft was so much thinner and the density from top to bottom was so much fuller. \xa0Hand-tied hair is\xa0super\xa0trendy right now. It’s important to do your research because there are\xa0so many different installation methods. Natural Beaded Rows is\xa0one\xa0of the installation methods of the hand-tied hair.  \xa0 \xa0 QUESTION \xa0 \xa0  As an Artist, what different types of installation methods have you exerienced? \xa0 \xa0  Point #3: Time, Reps & Experience \xa0 \xa0  Ani: You can be doing something for ten years but are only doing it for five minutes\xa0every day,\xa0or\xa0you can be doing something for a year but are spending\xa0seven\xa0hours a day doing it. I’ll choose the seven-hour person every time. Danielle: You have to have reps in something in order to become an expert. When people say they’ve been doing hair for 20-30 years,\xa0they\xa0don’t understand that the experience you’ve had, Ani, could be equal to\xa0or more\xa0than what they’ve done.  \xa0 \xa0 QUESTION \xa0 \xa0  Where in your world do you know you’re lacking reps? \xa0 \xa0  Point #4: Managing Client Expectations \xa0 \xa0  When you have a client who hasn’t experienced extensions, you need to take more time with them and describe how to take care of the extensions. You almost need to baby them at first. It’s also important to be able to have\xa0direct communication\xa0with them which you may not be accustomed to doing. Yet, as the professional, it’s vital that you have these direct conversations with them. (What is your hair policy? Do they need new hair? How long is your work guaranteed?)  \xa0 QUESTION \xa0 \xa0  How can your improve the direct conversations with your clients? \xa0 \xa0  Point #5:\xa0 The World of Pay to Play \xa0 \xa0  Ani: Inside the hair world, you pay to play. You paid your money so now you’re ‘qualified and certified.’ The changes we’ve made inside of our education\xa0now means something. It means something to do NBR, it means something to be a licensed artist, not just, “I paid money, took one class, and now I’m certified.” Danielle: We had to make some hard decisions within our education. We pumped on the brakes and put qualifications in place. We received a lot of backlash for it but that’s ok. There’s no point being in business if you’re not trying to up the game. It’s\xa0always important to take a step back and look at the reality of where you are.  \xa0 QUESTION \xa0 \xa0  What have you done lately to “up your game?”   \xa0 Quote of the Week:  \xa0“People are giving\xa0way too much\xa0credit to popularity vs actually doing the research. Not every artist, salon, or technique is created equal.”  –Danielle K White  “As a consumer myself, I do\xa0crazy\xa0research and am\xa0super psycho\xa0about it. It’s that important to me.”  –Anianne Rivera | In this fresh new episode of the BMS Podcast, Danielle and Ani (with a cameo appearance by baby Isla) have a conversation about fear vs intuition. What causes you to seek outside validation? What can you do to silence the noise and opinions of others? What voices do you have inside your head, and which one should you listen to? What about feedback? This is a must-watch-and-listen-to episode!  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In This Week’s Episode…..POWER  Point #1: Voices  Any time you’re about to do something new or make a decision, you’re always going to have two voices inside your head speaking to you. One of them is your legitimate intuition, the other one – which sounds exactly the same – is fear.\xa0 With fear, your mind goes to the worst-case scenario and gives you anxiety. The other voice, however, brings with it a gut feeling or sixth sense, commonly referred to as your spidey-sense.  QUESTION  Are you able to differentiate between the two voices? Which one do you find yourself most often paying attention to?  Point #2: But… What Will People Say?  Whenever we are investing in something, whether it be a class, an event, or a product, there are always going to be people who have an opinion about it. “Why would you spend so much money on\xa0that?\xa0I would NEVER do that!” Ani: We pay too much attention to what others think, and they end up projecting their fears onto us! Danielle: With our education, there is always a price point. Many might second guess themselves and ask, “Is it worth it? What are people going to think?” I invest a lot of money into my business, giving our artists the\xa0best experience\xa0they can possibly have, including months of pre-training.  QUESTION  When you make a decision, who do you tend to listen to: yourself, or\xa0everyone\xa0around you?  Point #3: Feedback  Feedback is HUGE at Danielle’s salon. When a client has a bad experience, it’s human nature to want to defend one’s actions. But instead of doing that, it’s better to look at what took place and ask yourself what you can learn from it and what can be done differently the next time in a similar scenario. Ani: Don’t look at feedback as an attack, it’s to help you fucking grow. Taking feedback isn’t about shutting your mouth, it’s about stepping back and having a conversation about the situation from all viewpoints and then course correcting.  QUESTION  How do you give and receive feedback? \xa0  Point #4: Tune Out the Noise  Ani: It’s SO easy to have an opinion from far away. In the words of one of our trainers, Candice, “If I am standing here on the stage, don’t fucking come to me if you’re sitting in the bleachers not doing a damn thing.” In other words, until you are in my fucking shoes, I really don’t want your fucking opinion. There came a time in Danielle’s life when she had to let go of everything she was raised with. “I knew in my gut there was another path. I had to TUNE OUT everything and everyone, and instead focus on MY vision of what I saw for myself and my family. When you have that little voice, use it to your advantage; use it as fuel.”  QUESTION  What can you do to tune out the noise in your life? \xa0  Point #5: Know Yourself  Sometimes people second guess themselves because they don’t know or understand themselves well enough and instead rely on others to give them the validation they are seeking. Journaling, meditation, and reading books that add value to your life and help you grow as a human being will help you understand and trust yourself. Ani talked about how it’s important to be able to recognize the difference between “This is a bad idea, my stomach hurts!” as opposed to “That would be amazing if it works, but I am so scared.” Sometimes it IS scary, and we don’t know how to come out on the other side of that fear.”  QUESTION  What do you do on a regular basis to get to know and understand who you are?  \xa0   Quote of the Week: \xa0  “Mama’s comin’ back!”  —Danielle K White  “Sometimes you just have to do the radically opposite thing than what you’ve been doing to actually get past that fear.”  –Anianne Rivera | *New Episode*\xa0Danielle and Ani are joined in the studio by baby Isla in this new episode of the Big Money Stylist, and have a conversation about the importance of surrounding yourself with those who are excited about your growth & success, and describe some of the exciting highlights of the new DKW Styling Academy coming in 2020.  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In This Week’s Episode…..POWER Point #1: Good Vibes  The vibe inside of your salon is SO important. If it’s a happy place where clients feel welcomed and at home, and where the artists genuinely get along and love working together, it’s going to make an impression on your clientele, and it’s going to affect their overall experience. Everybody would rather go to a salon where the artists love their job and create a fun atmosphere than a salon where catfights and negative vibes permeate. A great experience for the client births repeat business.  QUESTION  How is the vibe in your salon or suite? What could you do to improve it?  Point #2: Mindset  There are some artists who just want to learn the NBR method without delving into the business aspect or the ever-important mindset. Danielle used to be the same way, having an attitude of, “I just want to do hair and have a margarita.” These days, she and Ani are life coaches inside their educational programs and know what a vital role mindset plays in an artist’s life.\xa0  QUESTION  What do you do on a regular basis to work on and improve your mindset?  Point #3: DKW Styling Academy  One of the exciting announcements of 2020 is the launch of the DKW Styling Academy where artists can expect more structure and where they will learn and work at their own pace and abilities, while at the same time progress to the next phase. Danielle: With the way the academy is structured, I feel like we’re setting people up to win. Before it was like we had a bucket of content, and people tended to get overwhelmed. Even with the weekly trainings where we’re pouring our hearts out and adding a ton of value, if you’re not ready to hear what we're telling you, you’ll get overwhelmed, and you won’t be able to apply it.  QUESTION  What are you most looking forward to about the DKW Styling Academy?  Point #4: Your Legacy  Ani: At the end of the day, if Danielle and I do our job and what we’re so passionate about – and if we do it correctly – the students aren’t here forever. Our goal is to have them so confident in the art and have their business so structured & strong that it can actually work without them. That’s what creates a legacy. You’re going to get a ton of training about all things NBR, about life, and also about the technical aspect which is a HUGE part of the business, especially in today’s over-saturated market.  QUESTION  Are you willing to invest in yourself to create a legacy?  Point #5:\xa0Get In Alignment  Danielle: We’re always so worried and concerned about what other people think about us. The reality is, nobody really cares about you. They’re really more interested in themselves. So… get out of your own way. I always tell people to have tunnel vision, know your goals, and align yourself with people that have the same values as you do. And when those values don’t align, don’t be afraid to find yourself a new group or a new tribe that will align with you in the direction you want to go, and with what your values are.  QUESTION  What is the current state of your alignment? Is it serving you & propelling you forward, or is it slowing you down?  \xa0   Quote of the Week: \xa0  “Tune out the noise, be accountable to yourself, and just go with your gut.”  —Danielle K White  “Look, you can’t be pissed at the people who are taking from you if you keep willingly give. Stop giving that much. You can’t be pissed at your client for coming in on a Saturday if you let her. It’s up to you at the end of the day.”  –Anianne Rivera |  *REPEAT EPISODE FROM APRIL 2019* If the world is moving forward and you’re not, that means you’re not current, you’re behind…and you’re actually regressing. Where are you becoming stagnant in your business? Where are you feeling stuck? In this week’s episode, Danielle & Ani take on this important conversation and present five of the “Ten Reasons Why Your Business Could Be Stagnant…and What To Do About It – Part 1.”  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In This Week’s Episode…..PRODUCTION Point #1: COMMUNICATION  Danielle finds that many stylists are scared to have certain conversations with their clients, especially when it comes to raising their prices. She suggests going into a conversation with the mindset of ‘this is business.’ “Speak with clarity and give your client a chance to either stay with you or go with someone else. Remember, your client is a transaction.” Ani believes, “You don’t have to take it personally. If they choose to leave, it’s not them saying ‘I hate you’ or ‘I don’t like you.’ As artists, we take it personally because our art IS personal and we don’t understand why they would want to go to anyone else, especially after we have done such a good job on their hair.”  QUESTION  In what ways do you take it personally when a client leaves and takes their business elsewhere? How can embracing the reality that clients are a transaction make your life easier?  Point #2: IT’S NOT A GOOD FIT  Sometimes you and a client are simply not a good fit, especially when they want you to do something that you know, in good conscience, is not good for their hair. You want to make your client happy, AND you also must take a firm stand on what you will and will not do, based on your experience as a professional.  QUESTION  How are your conversations with your clients when it comes to your professional opinion about what you will and will not do?  Point #3: SLAVE BEHIND THE CHAIR  Ani: How does being a slave behind the chair keep you stagnant? We have artists who come into BMS making no money but are working six days a week, and then once they start crushing it in NBR & BMS, they’re STILL working six days a week, bringing in $40k-$50k a month…BUT they are STILL slaves behind the chair. Danielle: I get it. The money can be kind of addicting. It’s hard to say no to people. My advice? If you don’t want to be a slave behind the chair, you have to set clear boundaries for yourself and STICK TO THEM.  QUESTION  Where do you see yourself in all of this? Are you a salve behind the chair? Or, have you been able to make the shift out of that position?  Point #4: KNOW YOUR NUMBERS  There are usually two camps inside of this. You’re either the person who says, ’I’m fucking crushing it!” but in reality, you’re not. OR, you’re the person who says, ‘Oh my God, I’m doing terrible!” … until you look at your numbers and realize you’re doing really well. Artists have approached Ani expressing how they felt they were not doing well…UNTIL they started running their numbers. Oftentimes when artists begin tracking their numbers and compare their current numbers to past years’ pre-BMS/NBR numbers, what they’re finding is their numbers are doubling and tripling.  QUESTION  What has been the biggest eye-opener for you since you started tracking your numbers?  Point #5:\xa0YOU FEEL ALONE & ISOLATED  ANI: So often we think we don’t need anybody and can do everything by ourselves… but we don’t realize how much HARDER it is to be alone. Plus, when you’re alone, it’s your pace and ONLY yours that you’re looking at. It’s also easier to fall into the victim and blame mentality. DANIELLE: People lose momentum because they don’t have that community. This is why people want to get back into BMS Mastermind. Not only are they noticing that they’re becoming stagnant but they’re also realizing they’re losing momentum and don’t have the results, which ultimately means they’re digressing. When you surround yourself with people who are doing what you want to do, it pushes you forward, faster.  QUESTION  What has been your experience with this?  \xa0   Quote of the Week: \xa0  “If you’re that business owner who’s running on the hamster wheel because you can’t let go, I want you to keep in mind that it’s most likely keeping you a slave behind the chair AND a slave to your business. It’s also keeping you very stagnant.”  —Danielle K White  “I feel if you are wanting to progress to a level six and you’re at a level three, you can’t keep hanging out with people who are at a level three. You should probably be hanging out with people you\xa0aspire\xa0to\xa0become.”  –Anianne Rivera  \xa0 | In\xa0This Week’s Episode…..POWER In this brand new episode of the Big Money Stylist, Danielle and Ani take a look at how women justify their ambitions, the ways we tend to feel guilt and pressure, and how filling our plates to overload is a common occurrence among the feminine gender…and what we can do about it. Point #1: Ladyballs  It takes some serious “lady balls” to course-correct and recognize when it’s time to make changes…and then actually implement those changes. Otherwise, your business starts falling apart. In business, however, it seems that if women are passionate, they are labeled a bitch – either in their own minds or by others who will actually refer to them as a raging bitch.  QUESTION  Where in your world are you labeled a bitch? Who’s doing the labeling?  Point #2: Where Are You Feeling Pressure Or Guilt?  Oftentimes, moms experience “mommy guilt” and feel as though they have to choose between work and family.\xa0 But Danielle feels that working has actually made her a better mother. Ani is five months away from 30, unmarried & doesn’t have children and faces a different kind of pressure. “If I keep investing in my work and business and grow that way, am I going to look back when I’m 35 and be like OMG I’m alone, I’m fucking going to die alone, and I can’t have kids!?”  QUESTION  Where do you tend to feel guilt or pressure in your world?  Point #3: What Are You Sacrificing?  With Ani being single with no children, she’s often the first to give up her personal & vacation time. She rationalizes, “It’s ok because so and so has kids and her time is obviously way more valuable, so I’ll just work a little bit more, I’ll put a little bit more on my plate… ”\xa0 “I’m so willing to sacrifice all of my time and the things that keep me sane as a human being because there’s no one, really, except for *me*\xa0 counting on me.”  QUESTION  What are you sacrificing? What are the reasons you’re telling yourself that “justify” that sacrifice?  Point #4: Creating Space For You  There are times when Danielle feels like she has to “do it all” and is always\xa0that\xa0person whose plate is too full. As women, many of us feel like we need to take on more and more and more. “Life forces us into situations that we need to see AND where we need to be. If you ignore those signs, you keep running into the same damn challenges.”  QUESTION  What message is life currently trying to tell you?  Point #5:\xa0Energy Suckers  Ani: I’m a very powerful woman, and I’m certain in the things I do. And because of that, I can be looked at as bitch. Why is it that I should have to minimize myself to then produce and go forward? I feel like I’m not looking for collision, but I don’t mind having a face-to-face forward conversation because, to me, I just don’t want that to be an open energy suck.”  QUESTION  Where in your world are the lack of direct conversations sucking your energy?   Quote of the Week:  “I think it’s important not to have to justify our ambitions and also to remember that you can ask for help along the way. You’re not going to grow a business if you’re not willing to delegate and let go of some of that control. If it’s not fun and it’s stressing you out, let go of the guilt and delegate.”  –Danielle K White  “At the end of the day, no one else can dictate what’s right or wrong for you. That includes any preconceived notion of what you “should” or “should not” be doing, and the opinions of others. You are the ONLY person who knows what is right for you…and that’s the ONLY voice you should listen to.”  –Anianne Rivera | And…they’re back!! It’s a fresh, new episode of the Big Money Stylist Podcast filmed in their brand new gorgeous studio! This week’s episode is filled with exciting BMS & NBR announcements, as well as baby and post-pregnancy updates, delivered in the classic Danielle & Ani style that you’ve come to love!  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In\xa0This Week’s Episode…..PRODUCTION Point #1: “It’s Easy…Anyone Can Do It!”  Building, creating & sustaining anything is hard work. Yet, many people have NO clue about what it actually takes to build it. They only see the end result in which they ignorantly & mistakingly believe, “It’s so easy…anyone can do it!” The ladies agree that once you start building something yourself, that’s when you begin to have respect and appreciation for those who have put in the time and work to make it possible … even if you may not vibe with their brand or with them personally.  QUESTION  How often do you find yourself downplaying or not appreciating & respecting what others have built or created?  Point #2: Teamwork & Sustainability  When you have a business, podcasts, events, and trainings, it takes a team to pull this off, not just a couple of people. “There’s the face of the brand, and then there’s a TON that goes on behind the scenes that nobody sees.” Wanting the business to grow the correct way AND desiring to have sustainability & longevity is of UTMOST importance to Danielle & Ani, which is what they are focusing on moving forward.  QUESTION  Where in your personal or business world would a team benefit you greatly?  Point #3: Peek Into 2020  The ladies have received a lot of feedback from artists who just want to learn the NBR technique without the BMS business aspect. So…next year, they’re going to start offering NBR only classes! There will be trainers ACROSS THE COUNTRY who will be able to teach, train, and service more artists inside of NBR, as well in BMS…if they desire. It’s all about serving people at the level they’re at.  QUESTION  Looking ahead into 2020, what are some of the things you will be doing differently inside of your personal or business life?  Point #4: DKW Styling Academy  The current Mastermind program is turning into DKW Styling Academy where there will be specific requirements artists will have to hit. Graduation will take place after 1 to 1 1/2 years, with the option of testing out if you’re further advanced in some areas.\xa0 Ani: At the end of the day, our place is to train people in two parts: NBR (the Art) and BMS (the Business). Here’s how to build an entire business so you don’t have to be there every day to succeed. It’s your legacy.  QUESTION  What are you most excited about the newly announced DKW Styling Academy?  Point #5: Taking the Leap  Danielle: I think people are scared to start anything, which ends up holding them back. If you’re an entrepreneur or business owner, there’s this moment where you have to jump into the unknown; where you have to free-fall a little bit.. which I did a lot of these past couple of years. Whatever you’re trying to start, I would encourage you to go in with a plan and understand that, at any level, you’re going to have to\xa0leap… and then be willing to course-correct.\xa0  QUESTION  Where in your world do you know it’s time to spread your wings and take a leap?   Quote of the Week:  “If you don’t vibe with me, or if you leave the program…what I care about is this: market your business in whatever way you feel will personally benefit your business and help you succeed. The End.”  –Danielle K White  “At the end of the day, if you and I do our jobs – and we do it right and we fucking crush it – that means THEY’RE crushing it. And there comes a point where it becomes, “Hi little birdie, it’s time to leave the nest. You’re off into the world!”  –Anianne Rivera | In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In\xa0This Week’s Episode…..POWER Point #1: Recognize the Wins  Danielle: If I could rewind to just three years ago and see me now, I’d be like, “Oh my God! I did it! I made it!” If you don’t stop to have gratitude for who you are or how far you’ve come, you will become a miserable, unhappy person. Inside of that energy, the ability to create and expand is\xa0severely\xa0diminished.  QUESTION  In this moment, what is one thing you’re grateful for?  Point #2: Things\xa0Aren’t\xa0What They Seem  The problem with social media is that most people tend to only post the highlight reel of their life, which gives a false impression of the way their life\xa0really\xa0is. Inside of that world, it is so easy to get triggered by what we see as we’re scrolling, which can easily throw us off our game..  QUESTION  When is the last time you posted a scene that\xa0wasn’t\xa0from your highlight reel? What’s stopping you from doing that?  Point #3: The Drama Club  When people are on the prowl for drama, they don’t always realize they’re being sucked into it. It makes you wonder what else they could be doing with their time, and what amazing things could they be creating. Find something in your life that gives you purpose, something that isn’t drama-driven. Ultimately, drama doesn’t serve you or make you happy. And, it trickles down into every aspect of your life.  QUESTION  Are you queen of the drama club in your life? How is\xa0that\xa0really\xa0working out for you?  Point #4: What Triggers You?  Was it a bad day, or was it a bad\xa0two minutes\xa0that you stretched into a whole day? What are you paying attention to? What triggers you? What are you focusing your energy on? There was a time when Danielle was a slave to her workout routine, so much so that if she didn’t get her workout in for the day, she became Monster Mommy.  QUESTION  What are some of the things that trigger you and send you into the land of Monster Mommy?  Point #5:\xa0 Gratitude & Intentions  Ani: Every morning when I wake up, I write down something in my journal that I’m grateful for. I also set an intention for the day. Sometimes my intention is creation, space, or freedom, while other times it’s just letting the day unfold as it will. Starting my morning like this always puts me in a good frame of mind.  QUESTION  What are the daily rituals and habits that set you up for your day?   Quote of the Week:  “We can’t rewrite history, so the time you invest THEN, matters now. It’s important to take moments where you have that quality time with others so that you can live a life where you feel like you’re having moments that matter.”  –Danielle K White  “I LOVE what you just said that social media isn’t free. You pay for everything in your life one way or another, and not necessarily with money. You pay for it with time and with energy, and that’s massive, which I don’t think most people realize.”  –Anianne Rivera | From knowing your numbers to recognizing when it’s time to create space for yourself as an Artist, in this week’s episode of the Big Money Stylist podcast, Danielle and Ani take on areas of the hair industry that are vital to one’s growth, success, and sanity.\xa0*EPISODE REPLAY*  In Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection  In This Week’s Episode…..PRODUCTION Point #1: Don’t Quit  Danielle: It’s not until you hit so many “Oh shit!” moments that you actually start having a little more respect for people who have done what you’re doing, even if you don’t like them. Shit’s a lot harder than you think. There were so many times I wanted to quit but didn’t. And in the\xa0not quitting, I have become a better educator, a better person, a better mom.  QUESTION  What have you learned about yourself by not quitting?  Point #2: Continuing Education  Continuing education is key inside of the hair industry, both for the student AND the teacher. Danielle and Ani agree the more they teach, the more they learn how to become better educators. Ani: By scaling down inside of BMS we’re really pouring into the 250 students we have. Each week we have a small group of 15 students where the attention to detail is making a huge difference in their work.  QUESTION  Where in your world do you know you need to level up? What steps are you taking do to so?  Point #3: Do the Work  What has frustrated Ani for so long is when people look at her life and her job and only the fun aspects of it – the podcasts, being on stage, teaching, hanging out with Danielle – and want to experience ALL of that but are unwilling to do the work required. Ani: “In reality, that is a minuscule amount of what I actually do. Everything else I do doesn’t look fun. It’s a lot of work. It’s a lot of late nights, a lot of early mornings. You’re telling me you want to step into the company, get paid as a trainer underneath the umbrella of DKW, NBR, and BMS…but you don’t want to do any work for it?”  QUESTION  Where in your world are you unwilling to do the work required?  Point #4: Know Your Numbers  Ani: By the time artists attend BMS, many are nearly through with the industry. They’re working\xa0tons\xa0of hours and making next to nothing a lot of times. Danielle: If they actually looked at their numbers based off on the number of hours they’re working, even if they’re super successful, a lot of them want to break down and cry. Danielle: When I first started out, I was doing my numbers but they were very vague and were based on the deposits in my bank account. What I’ve learned is the power lies in the ability to look at your numbers and know how to adjust and problem solve so you’re constantly moving forward, otherwise, you’re regressing.  QUESTION  When is the last time you looked closely at your numbers?  Point #5:\xa0Create Space to Breathe  Danielle: When you own your own boutique, it’s not just the physical hours spent doing the art; there’s SO much more that goes into it. And without a full team supporting you, it’s so easy to run yourself into the ground. Ani: Once you start getting to overwhelm, it leads to exhaustion and irritability. EVERYTHING in your life is affected and you find you don’t have time to breathe. You NEED space to breathe. It’s vital for your sanity.  QUESTION  Where are you missing out on opportunities because you’re feeling overwhelmed and can’t see the clear picture of where you currently are in your business?   Quote of the Week:  “Don’t call yourself an educator and an expert inside of education if you don’t have reps educating. If you’re a client, do your research! Whether you’re going to a class or a salon, make sure you go to somebody you feel comfortable with AND who has reps inside of the industry you’re looking to get the service from.”  –Danielle K White  “It’s so cool to actually see people willing to go forward and do the work without feeling entitled, knowing it’s going to take more than one day, more than one mannequin head, and more than one client to actually become good at something.”  | *PODCAST REPEAT*\xa0As the doors of 2019 fly wide open, Danielle and Ani are hitting the ground running! BMS University and Mastermind are off to a strong start as the entire crew takes steps to build a strong foundation and an unstoppable team of Elite Artists. The driving message in this week’s conversation is to just jump in and go!  Big Money Stylist, we go over the following formula each month: Week #1: Power Week #2: Production Week #3: Profit Week #4: Protection In This Week’s Episode…..Power  Point #1: Choose In  Ani is beyond excited for the changes taking place inside of BMS and has been conducting back-to-back interviews for those applying to the newly revamped Mastermind program.   “It’s so cool to see how proud they are after all of their hard work, dedication, and everything they have accomplished. It wasn’t a matter of them paying a fee and showing up; they\xa0earned\xa0their place in Mastermind.”  QUESTION  What have you worked really hard to accomplish? How does it make you feel?  Point #2: State of Overwhelm  Danielle believes that when you’re in a place of feeling burned out or stagnant, one of two things usually needs to happen: either decrease business or increase business. “Both places can be really scary to be in. A lot of times, people a) don’t know where to start or b) they start brain scheming this far out path that overwhelms them.  QUESTION  What are some choices you can make today to begin moving forward?  Point #3: The Power of “B”  Danielle: If you don’t know the things you need to change, then going over the facts is one thing you can do. Every time you do that, you discover things that you can improve upon. Start there and then just keep taking the next step. “The power is in the“B” because that means you started. When you start something and are consistent with it, you never know where it can actually take you.”  QUESTION  Where in your world do you know you need to take that “next step” but have been putting it off?  Point #4: Be Willing to Fail  Ani has always been one to accept a challenge from Garrett and Danielle. From the very beginning, she has jumped in, no matter what, and recalls a moment when she failed miserably but learned a huge lesson. The ladies both agree that anything you do that you haven’t done before, you’re going to suck at it. The fact that you’re actually\xa0doing\xa0it says a lot about you.  QUESTION  What is one lesson you have learned because you were willing to fail?  Point #5: Focus on the Basics  Danielle: You can’t be given a big break when you’re not ready. You don’t get there overnight; you have to become that person and that character. Everybody wants these big breaks but you really just need to simmer down and focus on the basics first. If you can’t consistently do the small things, you can’t expect to do the big things.  QUESTION  Where in your world is it time to return to the basics?   Quotes of the Week “Take each step as it comes, and you’ll figure things out as you go. Stop trying to have a map of how you’re going to do it all.” — Danielle White  “You can never find anything beautiful or amazing, and you’ll never find your place\xa0if\xa0you don’t start doing\xa0something.” –Anianne Rivera", 'chan_desc': 'Danielle K White, owner of DKW Styling and creator of Natural Beaded Rows (NBR) had a vision as a hair stylist to bring value and purpose to others through hair extensions, taking this industry to an even greater level with Lead Stylists Valerie Plunk and Anianne Rivera, merging their elite skills as Artists with the business aspect of being a Salon Owner with Danielle’s husband, Garrett J White, founder of Wake Up Warrior and co-owner of DKW Styling.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/60/e6/13/60e6139b-66ba-2996-6618-fff4ed9fabca/mza_7094904544964238170.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-01-05'}}

Even just a decade ago, we would tend to use the word entrepreneur to describe the personalities driving big conglomerates and reserve the epithet for figures like Richard Branson. Now though, entrepreneurs are just as likely to be individual makers and creatives launching businesses from kitchen tables. This wider use of the label entrepreneur can still be daunting for the small indie beauty brand founder. We may fall into comparisonitis and doubt ourselves capable of executing our plans and following through on our dreams. Our guest in this episode of Green Beauty Conversations removes the mystery of beauty entrepreneurship by taking us on her own business journey. Zeze Oriaikhi-Sao, founder of Malée Natural Science, says that the mindset of a beauty entrepreneur can most certainly be learned and is not something we are born with. Zeze\'s story is one of a young African woman in the UK who had to become entrepreneurial after a move to South Africa where she faced a period of unemployment. Creating an ethical, luxury fragrance, bath and body care range was furthest from Zeze\'s mind when she started her working life. Having gained two degrees at just age 24, Zeze was aiming for a corporate consulting career when life changed and set her on her entrepreneurial path. Zeze is a woman who discovered by chance almost her passion for the people, natural beauty and healing rituals of her home continent. She went on to harness those to create a brand that could change her life and others’ for the better. Her motto to any would-be beauty entrepreneur is to stay true to your beliefs even in times of failure:  "My biggest successes have come when I was focused on my beliefs. It doesn’t matter if you fail, but don’t let your fears rule you. Focus on the people you want to solve problems for. That becomes more enriching. How you approach your journey is the most important point."  In this episode on the mindset of a skincare entrepreneur, you\'ll hear about:  The four types of entrepreneur around today and how the indie beautypreneur is likely to be a blend of all four; Why knowing your purpose - the reason why you started out - is the most important guiding factor in your journey; Why running an ethical business that is founded on beliefs will give you more joy and be able to sustain your passion for business; How not only adopting the mindset of a beauty entrepreneur but becoming a sustainable, successful business takes time; remember, Amazon took 19 years to become profitable! Be patient and give things time to work  Key take-outs include:  Setting business goals is fine, but what you really need to focus on is the purpose of those goals and understand them thoroughly. Your overriding goal should to be the best you can at what you do and what you offer. Every rejection or failure has its reason. For example, if a retailer turns your brand down then realise that it\'s probably not the right time in your business journey to be stocked with them. See the rejection or failure as a way to sharpen your tools and get back out there with a better offer, mindset and approach. Remember that work-life balance is not some idealised vision or version of your life. Just work on your own terms and own that balance, making it individual to your needs and lifestyle. Work smarter not harder. Document what you do and when so you can see where time is wasted on non-priority actions. Time is the only finite in our lives as entrepreneurs, so don\'t squander it.

Cosmetics Business commented in early 2019 that online beauty sales were set to help Asia-Pacific outpace North America as global cosmetics\' leader: "Growing e-commerce and online shopping will shift the country leading the biggest beauty spends and change the nation of \'beauty obsessed". While  Cosmetics Design Asia noted that the demand for premium and prestige global beauty brands, particularly in China, is continuing apace in line with the growth of disposable income and the rise of a middle class traveling internationally. These headlines tend to focus on the success of mainstream, premium global cosmetics\' giants like the Estee Lauders and L\'Oréals of this world, but there are signs that the  natural beauty market in Asia is gaining foothold. Our guest in this episode of Green Beauty Conversations gives us fascinating insider insights into the natural cosmetics\' market in Asia and dispels the myth that the business opportunities are only for large multinational brands. Allie Rooke studied Chinese at university and then spent nearly a decade living and working in Asia for luxury brands Chanel, L\'Oréal and Burberry before setting up her consultancy Clean Beauty Asia. Allie focuses on helping natural and indie beauty brands gain the know-how, confidence, strategies and cultural savviness to grasp the business opportunities this region offers. Her key message is not to be scared of setting your sights on selling in the Asian beauty market.  "Don’t be scared of Asia and especially don\'t feel it’s all about big brands. Don\'t be put off because they are not English-speaking markets. There is absolutely an indie beauty market in Asia Pacific, and when a new beauty idea, trend or product does grow, it can grow fast and explode."  If you have aspirations to retail your beauty brand in Asia, our interview with Allie will give you a good feel for what\'s required to succeed in the dynamic, vast and diverse beauty markets the region offers; and importantly, what is going on behind those headlines. \xa0 In this episode on the natural beauty market in Asia, you\'ll hear about:  The diversity of markets and consumers across the Asia-Pacific region and how each market lends itself to different brand propositions and positioning. For example, China offers huge potential to prestige brand, while Singapore and Taiwan are more price sensitive; Why distributors in the region are key brand allies and can be powerful advocates for your brand but why you need to be actively involved in brand building in local Asian markets as well; The importance of being established and sufficiently known in your own home markets before expecting to make it in Asia. Typically, Asian consumers like to check out a new brand online and feel they can trust it, even if they are keen to embrace the new experiences and products international indie beauty brands can offer; Why you need to understand the social media scene in your chosen Asian market as both beauty brands and influencers are big on key Asian platforms and run sophisticated set-ups. Again, start out getting known on social media in your home markets as Asian consumers comb these platforms for \'the next big thing\' as well.  Key take-outs include:  Asian consumers are often more interested in the safety of a product than whether it\'s sustainable or not. They need the information to judge whether they trust a new brand, and this is all the more so for indie, natural brands. Ensure transparency in all your communcations, media collateral, marketing and social media aimed at Asian markets. Don\'t leap into signing an exclusive distributorship that spans several Asian countries. The region\'s diversity means that few distributors will truly have the ability to support your brand sufficiently in multiple markets. You can sell to Chinese consumers and avoid the issue of animal testing. Hong Kong\'s Freeport status offers one route to gaining access to Chinese customers who flock to the autonomous territory which is a major shopping destination. In addition, you can sell online to the Chinese mainland using fulfillment warehouses in Hong Kong. To get to know more about Asia-Pacific customers and consumer habits, especially those of the Chinese, start by understanding Asian consumer behaviour in your home market. See if you can find out where, for example, Chinese tourists like to shop and what they seek out. Even a local Chinese community can be an ambassador for your products in Asian markets.

However, as Dr Sarah Villafranco, founder of Osmia organics and our guest in this episode says, while her career change certainly raised some eyebrows back in 2012, it proved a logical move that had parallels with her role as a doctor.  As as an emergency physician, I felt I was a fire fighter and I wasn\'t sure I was helping people prevent disease. I wanted to intervene sooner in people’s health and their daily choices and focus on the important pillars of good health that Western medicine had largely forgotten, such as diet, stress management, joy and fitness. The more medical research I did on effect of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the more I realised what a big piece of medicine was involved in skincare.  Sarah Villafranco launched Osmia Organics as a way to help people not only choose natural skincare, but also as a space to learn about a more holistic approach to health and self care. Osmia\'s blog and social media offers insights and advice on developing a health-focused, positive-living mindset to generate the conversation on what Sarah says traditional medicine sees as \'alternative\' routes to health. Transitioning from a high-stress, emergency physician\'s role where split-second decisions can be life determining, to running a natural skincare business designed to impact our longer-term health and well-being is quite a leap to make. Sarah Villafranco says it can be scary to follow your dreams but adds that building a natural skincare business isn\'t about dreaming, but hard realities. "You can’t leave a career that makes money for one that won’t. You need to plan your dreams as it takes time to build a business." Dr Sarah Villafranco has a unique vantage point from which to assess the current shape of the green beauty movement. Her medical background and ability to interpret and filter the science enables her to cut through the scepticism and also the green washing that can surround green beauty. In this wide-ranging interview, Dr Sarah Villafranco gives invaluable advice to budding natural skincare entrepreneurs, from whatever walk of life. In this episode on choosing natural skincare as a career, you\'ll hear about:  Why the natural, organic skincare sector is a rigorous, demanding yet rewarding a career choice for someone from any background; Why the green beauty sector needs more people involved in the industry who are prepared to train, hone their professional skills as formulators and dig deep into the science of skincare to tackle green washing and strengthen the industry as a whole; How becoming a skincare entrepreneur and running a business and a team is not something to be scared of but a role you grow into and make part of your lifelong learning; Why honesty and transparency in your business dealings with everyone from suppliers to customers and staff is paramount to your success; and How being courteous to other business leaders and brands in the naturals\' sector and sharing the green space amicably will help your brand and others grow mutually: "A rising tide lifts all boats\' should be your motto.  Key take-outs include:  As a product formulator, you will need the patience and resilience to persevere and to take formulation failures in your stride. See any failure as learning your trade. Think consciously about the environment in all aspects of your business. Realise that there is no such thing as \'eco friendly\' but rather prefer to use the term eco conscious. Don\'t green wash - be prepared to answer consumers, trade and media queries about your products or business honestly and research before you reply. If you don\'t know something, admit it and say you will find out. Try to enjoy life\'s sensory moments and the ride that being an entrepreneur brings with it.

The behemoth of e-tailing may be our go-to place to shop for everything these days, yet for all our familiarity with it as consumers, many new beauty brand entrepreneurs find Amazon an impenetrable platform and beyond their grasp. A few years ago, the mantra used to be \'if you\'re not on social media, you don\'t exist\'. However, our guest in this episode of Green Beauty Conversations would be more likely to say \'if you\'re not on Amazon, you don\'t exist\'. Marc Bonn, senior account manager at Expert Edge a London-based, digital consultancy focused on Amazon retailing, generously gives us a tip-packed hour of practical advice in this episode on the whys and wherefores of selling your beauty products on Amazon. If there is one single, valuable piece of advice to come away with from our interview with Marc, it is that it\'s never too early in your beauty brand\'s life to get selling on Amazon. If you don\'t stake your claim on your retail space on Amazon, the chances are that in time, middlemen will be selling your products and will probably not present them in line with your brand values and positioning. Marc admits that Amazon has its own particular e-tailing eco-system and that brands need to adopt a totally different approach to selling there compared to dealing with regular online, or off-line stores. However, he says that the benefits of potential reach and volumes can outweigh the costs involved in that initial learning curve. Even as we start to see Amazon selling its own brand beauty products on its platform, the opportunities are there for new brands. In many respects, Amazon presents smaller brands with a level playing field vis a vis established names, so long as indie brands learn how to work the Amazon system. Plus, beauty brands need to be on Amazon even if just for PR purposes, rather than ramping up sales. In this episode on selling your beauty products on Amazon, you\'ll hear about:  Why getting on Amazon early in your brand\'s retail life is ideal as you will learn the ropes and also protect your brand from erosion by middlemen reselling your products on Amazon. Amazon\'s three selling options and learn which is best for you: seller accounts, which are ideal for new entrants and where you, the merchant, fulfill deliveries; seller status but where orders are fulfilled by Amazon (FBA); and vendor status, which Amazon itself fulfills and which includes the bonus of attracting Prime customers. How Amazon\'s lowest price-match mechanism works and why it isn\'t something to fear as a small or indie brand. The key aspects of your seller\'s page to focus on such as quality product imagery, optimised Amazon SEO and well-honed content.  Key take-outs from our chat with Marc Bonn include:  Details of how Amazon helps smaller, niche beauty brands on its platform with initiatives such as its \'Launchpad\', and its Indie Beauty and Luxury Beauty zones. Why you may need expert help in listing your brand and products on Amazon successfully as even what seem like simple issues such as choosing relevant retail categories or keywords can be make or break. Why you need an advertising strategy and to promote branded adverts to ensure you make the most of the platform and counter the big, established names in beauty. Why Amazon is useful to have a presence on even if you don\'t have sales as a main aim; remember, consumers\xa0 will often search on Amazon to read about your brand and check prices even if completing a purchase in high-street stores. Amazon may be a PR tool for you instead.  Find out more about Expert Edge consultancy and how it can help beauty brands sell on Amazon: Expert Edge website. Expert Edge on LinkedIn.

The misnomer \'anti-ageing\' has been viewed as politically incorrect for quite some time. If our guest in this episode of Green Beauty Conversations has her way, it will be a thing of the past sooner rather than later. Kari Gran, founder of Kari Gran skincare, which she runs with business partner Lisa Strain, has developed commonsense natural skincare products that talk about skin health and vitality as part of a more holistic way of living; with no mention of age groups or anti-ageing. Kari Gran says that many of us when faced with a constant barrage of talk about anti-ageing feel shamed into not doing our best to look younger, or at least holding back the visible signs of time on our skin. She counterpoints this beauty industry accepted norm by saying that the conversation should shift to focus on the fact that our lifestyles play a major role in how we look and feel at any age:  "If there were a single miracle, time-defying product, there wouldn\'t be the thousands of other skincare products out there on the market. At Kari Gran, we talk about the bigger, holistic picture. I can’t sell something without being honest about it. Skincare products can\'t work in isolation on their own."  Kari Gran knows all about skincare products hyping up promise and yet under delivering. Kari battled with autoimmune illnesses throughout her life until she started to really scrutinise food and personal care product labels and make significant changes to her diet and personal care routine. Kari Gran skincare was born out of real necessity when Kari needed to take control of her health and move to natural skincare as a way to alleviate the acute dryness of her skin and reduce her exposure to certain chemicals. She realised that talk of anti-ageing was irrelevant and that what mattered above all else was looking and feeling good in your own skin rather than be stressed about age. With Trust Pilot reviews from customers aged anywhere from their 40s to 70s saying how they love the way Kari Gran products make them feel - not just look - it\'s clear that people, if not the traditional beauty industry, are quite happy to embrace and live life to the full at every age. Podcast host Gemma and Kari Gran have a wide-ranging discussion about the need for transparency and honesty in the beauty industry and for commonsense language using terms like ageless beauty to replace the dominant discourse on women\'s ageing, menopause and beauty. \xa0 In this episode on ageless beauty, you\'ll hear about:  Why honesty in your skincare brand and product messaging is vital especially these days when customers are more aware of the value of an all-round feeling of wellness and won\'t believe anti-ageing claims. How products aimed less at fads and so-called trends and more at promoting simple, easy-to-grasp beauty routines such as cleanse, hydrate and protect may be more appealing to consumers. How you can move the conversation and create a point of difference for your skincare brand not by disrupting necessarily, but by appealing to consumers\' commonsense. Why not all your target customers are fixated about their beauty routine - nor their age - and how that impacts your beauty brand\'s positioning.  Key take-outs include:  Think about putting Trust Pilot or similar third-party review apps on your sales\' website. They might seem a risk as you can\'t edit or block reviews, only reply to them, but consumers will value your level of honesty and in return, you gain a valuable, ongoing \'focus group\' for your products. Realise that much of the higher echelons of the mainstream cosmetics\' industry is dominated by men - in management and in the cosmetic labs. Their legacy, while valid and informed, has also created in part a normalised discourse about women\'s beauty, which suggests, among other things, that women should constantly seek products to \'turn back the clock\' in order to feel good about themselves. Just like ageing, other times in women\'s lives such as childbirth and menopause aren\'t \'trends\' to be addressed by cosmetics\' products. There are of course products that have a place in helping issues such as dry skin or alleviate signs of stretch marks but they should be marketed not as products to \'fix\' issues that are in fact all part of life\'s normal passage. Be aware we are still mostly presented with a stereotypical view of how we should look and feel at various stages in our life, whether when turning 40, having children or passing through menopause. Ageless beauty eschews this view. Kari took Formula Botanica\'s Skincare Expert Program whose courses were instructive in helping her not only formulate advanced products but also deep dive into the well-being that is possible using natural, organic skincare ingredients. It is vital to take a cue from Kari\'s approach and celebrate naturals for their unique benefits rather than use negative claims or scaremongering in your brand\'s marketing.

You may have seen pro-, pre- and even post-biotic skincare products and wondered what they are and what they do for our skin. We came across all three microbiome skincare products trending at the 2019 edition of industry fair  In-Cosmetics Global. A microbiome is defined as the entire colony of micro-organisms that live inside or outside the human body. Our skin biome is composed of micro-organisms ranging from bacteria, fungi and viruses to mites. This gathering of micro-organisms doesn\'t sound too appealing. After all, cosmetics aren\'t manufactured (usually) with the intention of containing live, active bacteria, which is why they are regulated and must pass stringent microbial challenge tests to be placed legally on the market. In this podcast, we hear about how scientific research into the skin biome is revealing the important role a healthy, micro-organism colony plays in maintaining the overall wellness and balance of our skin. We hear also about how our overuse of traditional personal care products is partly to blame for disrupting the skin\'s balanced pH. Anti-bacterial cosmetic products contribute to stripping away our skin\'s microbiome - including the so-called friendly bacteria - which is a first line of defence for our largest organ, skin, and our body as a whole. Our podcast guest Jasmina Aganovic is a chemical and biological engineer, alumni of MIT and co-founder of Mother Dirt, a skincare company whose tagline is \'rethinking clean\'. Mother Dirt, a spin-off from AO Biome, a world-leading, clinical-stage microbiome company, was born out of research aimed at finding a scientific answer to the question: "Why are we cleaner than ever, have more products than ever, and yet a growing number of us have sensitivities, allergies, and other skin issues?". Mother Dirt\'s hero product - AO+ Mist - contains a live culture of a specific bacteria that has been clinically proven to restore clarity and balance to skin within four weeks. Jasmina explains that even though their science showed that \'rethinking clean\' was indeed the way to go, Mother Dirt faced almost insurmountable challenges in getting AO+ Mist to market. The beauty industry, from manufacturers to distribution networks and retailers, isn\'t geared up to handle cosmetic products with live cultures requiring refrigeration. It is used to dealing with long shelf-life products. Listening to Jasmina, you\'ll learn to sort the facts from the fiction in skin microbiome skincare. You\'ll also hear about never giving up if you have a sound, revolutionising beauty concept to bring to the market - even if it flies in the face of received industry wisdom!\xa0 In this episode on skin microbiome skincare, you\'ll hear about:  How Mother Dirt is challenging the traditional, perceived notions of healthy skin and personal care products and what that means for the beauty industry; Why not all bacteria are bad and what damage the accepted norms of eradicating and sterilising bacteria can do to skin; How dirt, literally soil, contains bacteria that can in fact help alleviate skincare issues such as inflammation and hyper dryness; and Why skin microbiome skincare products need to be backed by sound science not hyperbole.  Key take-outs include:  If you are bringing a new cosmetic concept to market, be prepared to educate your market, including your partners such as potential retailers and distributors on the product, its needs and how to sell it to consumers. A totally new-concept skincare product might be best served selling direct to consumer to start with. Do your market research and, if you can, run your products through focus groups to hone your positioning and messaging. Being a first mover comes with a price but there are rewards. If your product is niche but has no specific consumer niche, you will need to work hard to think through how to position it in the market and about its branding and brand story. On the other hand, there are advantages to be had from cutting across traditional marketing silos. Get to understand your early-adopter customers and gauge their responses to help guide you in your marketing and retail choices.

At Formula Botanica, we teach diplomas and certificates in cosmetic product formulating. An increasing number of our graduates go on to formulate beautiful, high-performance products as well as run successful indie beauty businesses having been inspired and empowered by the courses they took with us. This is possible because in nearly all parts of the world, irrespective of whether the formulator is a cosmetic chemist or skincare formulator, the cosmetic products themselves must meet strict  compliance regulations to be sold legally. What we teach at Formula Botanica are the key concepts of chemistry; a competent cosmetic product formulator would need to know to create products that are safe, stable and meet - and often exceed - consumer expectations. Some core components of cosmetic chemistry that we include in our Diplomas are pH measurement and monitoring, emulsification, methods of natural cosmetics\' preservation, and the use of solubilisers and surfactants. Some Differences\xa0between a cosmetic chemist vs skincare formulator There are of course some fundamental differences between a cosmetic chemist and skincare formulator. A cosmetic chemist would be steeped in the science of how cosmetic ingredients work together and would know the likely outcome of any formula even without a practical lab trial. A cosmetic chemist would need formal, recognised, usually graduate-level qualifications in chemistry along with a specialist training (a post-graduate qualification) in cosmetic science. They may well end up working in the R&D lab of a large cosmetics\' firm. A cosmetic product formulator would not necessarily know the in-depth science of how ingredients work but could, through applied study and practical application of their formulating skills coupled with detailed observation, build up a considerable knowledge bank about their ingredients and formulation outcomes. A cosmetic chemist working in a large lab might not be the one who dreams up the lovely new formulas as they might be more restricted in how much of the route from first creative idea to marketable product they get their hands on. However, they may be at the forefront of R&D bringing innovative cosmetic ingredients to market. It is inevitable that there is some overlap in roles and also a lot of grey areas and misconceptions about what both careers involve. In this podcast, Formula Botanica School Director, Lorraine Dallmeier and podcast host and Relationship Manager Gemma discuss the two roles and career paths along with their respective pros and cons. This podcast is a must-listen for anyone wondering about the training and career options in formulating cosmetics\' products especially if looking to focus on natural, organic formulation. In this episode tackling the roles of a cosmetic chemist vs skincare formulator, you\'ll hear about:  Why your decision to choose one training route over the other may be more down to personal circumstances such as lifestyle, finances, commitments and time, and your desired career in the cosmetics\' industry; How a cosmetic chemist has the chance to work in world-leading beauty brand labs but conversely how a product formulator may enjoy more freedom and creativity in formulating products and in career options; Why a cosmetic product placed for sale in most parts of the world, whether it is formulated by a chemist or product formulator, will have had to undergone the safety, stability and microbial testing to be placed legally on the market for sale; Why it is imperative that any cosmetics\' business founder is transparent about their own personal or their employees\' cosmetic formulating qualifications and must be confident in explaining how and why their qualifications\xa0 - whichever route they choose - enable them to do their job professionally; Why building a successful cosmetics\' brand requires a swathe of skills that are not inherent in either product formulation nor chemistry backgrounds and would require extra skill sets; Why the lack of formal, tertiary-level cosmetic chemistry courses worldwide and the costs entailed in continuing in higher education might make a shorter-term, distance-learning formulation course a more accessible option for some.  Key take-outs include the three main steps to becoming a competent, natural cosmetics\' skincare formulator:  Step one: First, get to know your ingredients thoroughly and learn how to research their properties. This will give you a sound basis on which to build your formulating skills. Step two: Practice formulating and never stop testing out new combinations and ratios of ingredients. Only through practice can you create more advanced formulas that consumers demand. Step three: Learn how to test your formulations professionally (safety, stability and microbial tests are mandatory). Develop the patience to test and make understanding testing one of your most important learning goals as a cosmetics formulator.

Understanding what a retailer is looking for in your beauty brand and getting to know their retail space inside out is just some of the groundwork you need to do before approaching a buyer. After all, they get hundreds of email pitches every day and you need to grab their attention. In this near hour-long episode of Green Beauty Conversations, our guest Gemma Harling of Lumi Consultancy provides a goldmine of information for the beauty entrepreneur serious about getting stocked in top retailers. As a former senior buyer for one of the UK\'s largest beauty retailers, Gemma gives us insights into the role of the time-poor beauty buyer. She knows what gets buyers to sit up and take notice of a new beauty brand and has seen also just about every pitfall eager start-up founders make. As Gemma says, she has seen "the good, the bad and the ugly" of brand pitches, and is here to see your brand stands out and gains traction with your target retailers. Getting a reply to an email, let alone a foot in the door to pitch your beauty products to a buyer in person is tougher than ever in a fast-moving beauty retail world where brands can come and go off shelves in less than six months. Buyers are on the look out for the \'next big thing\' and while they don\'t wish to miss the chance of discovering a truly innovative, exciting indie brand, they also need to keep their large, established cosmetics\' brands happy. Your pitch needs to be strategic if you\'re to get noticed! Be prepared to take notes as Gemma walks us through her top 5 tips on how to pitch your beauty products effectively, from first email to buyer presentation.\xa0 Gemma has kindly prepared a workbook to download -\xa0  \'Race to Retail\' - which is a brilliant roadmap to follow in preparing to get retail ready. In this episode on how to pitch your beauty products, you\'ll hear about:  Why it is important to be clear about who your\xa0 target customers are. Don\'t just think of an avatar but drill into any data you have to back up your brand\'s customer profile. Understand too the retailers\' customers and see if yours match their customers\' profile. How to select your target retailers with intention. For example, a luxury-end department store with one branch might not be appropriate for your brand even if it seems a glittering prize. Think laterally and do your homework on which retailers are more suited to your brand. Why you need a clear retailer USP: understand how your product range and brand give the retailer an edge, perhaps by filling a gap in their current offer. Why you need to know your target retailers inside out. Walk the walk by going into their stores and seeing which brands and trends they promote. How visiting some live beauty events or trade fairs can be a great way to meet your target retailers and buyers. They are also brilliant opportunities to understand retail trends. See our post on latest indie beauty trends in our round up of  In-Cosmetics Global 2019.  Key take-outs on your brand\'s pitch include:  Find the right buyer to contact. Try using LinkedIn to research them and then follow them on social media. Many beauty buyers have their own accounts. You will pick up on what they are looking for in a brand and understand more about their approach to retailing. Include a \'power statement\' about your brand in your initial email. You could use impressive sales statistics, testimonials or press coverage. Don\'t be woolly about your business projections in your pitch; present sales\' forecasts for each retailer but don\'t pluck figures out of the air - do your homework! Include your pitch presentation in the first email, but ensure it\'s clear, concise and visually impressive. Some buyers might be curious about your power statement and want to see immediately whether your brand is worth following up on. Be persistent in following up any communications with prospective buyers, but don\'t pester them.

Now, barely a week passes without us hearing of a big brand in the personal care industry buying up clean, green, organic beauty brands as well as creating their own ranges on the naturals\' spectrum. However, we might not know just how difficult it was for organic brands entering the market a couple of decades ago when their voices and valid claims would fall on deaf ears. Our guest in this episode, serial wellness entrepreneur Karen Behnke, took a leap of faith back in 2004 to start a high-performance organic skincare brand under the name \'Juice Beauty\'. Now a highly-acclaimed international beauty brand, Juice Beauty offers award-winning skincare and make-up products that meet rigorous USA organic regulations. Karen\'s declared mission at the outset was to create high-performance organic skincare with scientifically-proven efficacy that was also backed by solid eco values. She found herself in the early noughties pitching Juice Beauty against an industry largely sceptical of natural and organic products\' ability to match, let alone exceed the benefits of traditional personal care products whose formulas were composed largely of synthetic ingredients. As an exemplar for emerging, organic beauty brands, Karen talks us through the secrets of success in building and growing a truly high-performance organic skincare brand. She explains that it is as important as ever, if not more so, to stay true to your declared, transparent mission and ensure you create truly high-performance organic skincare products that do deliver on promise. In this episode on high-performance organic skincare, you\'ll find out about:  Why it\'s best not to rush your products to market. Dedicating budget, time and effort to creating something innovative can be key to your brand\'s point of difference in the market. Why efficacy is the holy grail of high-performance organic skincare if you wish to grow your beauty business and gain loyal customers in the increasingly crowded naturals\' sector. Why budgeting for scientific tests to prove any efficacy claims your formulations offer can be the most important decision you make in starting an organic skincare brand. Formulating high-performance skincare is also about creating the right emotional and sensual consumer experiences. How a cream, for example, glides on - the \'slip\' - is just one criterion that customers will review your products\' performance on. Why transparency in how and where you source ingredients - from field to supplier\xa0 - gives you more control over your supply chain, valuable insights into the provenance of your organic products and messages that can empower your brand.  Key take-outs include:  Science-led innovation helps you stay ahead in the organic beauty sector. Be aware that any organic, vegan, or other business claims will be investigated, so ensure you have a declared mission statement and principles guiding your business from the start. Decide which certification and/or claims are more important to your mission - whether vegan, sustainability, ethical business and so on - and be prepared to go the extra mile to ensure your brand adheres rigorously to your mission. Consumers are very demanding these days so understand the implications of any \'way of life\' you or your brand project in your marketing messages.

In-Cosmetics is one of the beauty industry\'s key calendar events, and is a vast gathering of all branches of the cosmetics\' sector and is open to both trade and the public. The Formula Botanica team comprising School Director Lorraine, Education Manager Timi and Business and Relationship Manager Gemma spread out among the vast exhibition halls to cover as many niche and sectoral beauty zones, workshops, supplier stands and talks as possible to give us a rounded and hot-off-the-press perspective on the top beauty trends for 2019. Formula Botanica also garnered a prestigious slot at the event; Lorraine was invited to give a keynote presentation and chose to tackle the traditional polarisation of synthetics vs naturals in a keynote entitled \'Challenging the assumptions of naturals in cosmetics\'. Comparing notes and looking back to previous editions of In-Cosmetics, this podcast sees the team dive into some 10 top beauty trends; some evolving still; some contentious; some fascinating; and most all three at once! The trends we focus on include: formulation and ingredient innovations; the industry\'s focus on the skin\'s microbiome; water-reduced and waterless beauty; sustainability; greenwashing; food\'s influence on cosmetics; and bewildering and less than transparent new terms that cropped up such as \'sub-zero waste\'. One theme that stood out throughout In-Cosmetics was how indie has gone mainstream; a fact acknowledged by In-Cosmetics 2019 as this was the first fair that included a dedicated Indie Beauty Trail. We came across around 50 Formula Botanica graduates and students at In-Cosmetics and would encourage more of you to attend next year\'s fair in Barcelona. Our team offer advice on how to make the most of In-Cosmetics, which can be an overwhelming experience. Listen in, be inspired and discover how to include the top beauty trends 2019 in your formulations and brands. In this episode, you\'ll find out about how:  A new breed of emulsifiers is giving rise to innovative products with transformational textures and dual purposes. We discovered incredible \'jelly\' textures that turn into powders and creams, as well as thick cleansers that turn to foaming products. Food-inspired cosmetics are hitting the market big time and catching attention with names borrowed from food products. Examples include: Body Vinegar, and Face Chutney. Cosmetic products aimed at helping protect and nurture the skin\'s microbiome are on the rise and forking into three branches of functional products using pre-, pro- and post-biotic ingredients. We\'re curious to discover more about the underlying science behind their claims. More suppliers are gaining certification (Ecocert, Cosmos etc) for their ingredients. This should make life easier for formulators and brands seeking certification of their end products. Simplicity is the new ace card for formulators. We saw a noticeable absence of suppliers and cosmetics\' brands promoting the latest exotic ingredients and far more emphasis on \'less is more\' and locally supplied is better; and How greenwashing is still rife but masquerading in different guises. For example, products claiming sustainable credentials not because of their inherent ingredients or recyclable packaging, but because they donate to green or ethical projects.  Key take-outs on how to make the most of In-Cosmetics as an indie brand include:  To avoid overwhelm at the vast In-Cosmetics fair over three days, plan well in advance which zones to visit and book workshops and talks before you go. You can do this on the In-Cosmetics\' website. Register for free to get updates. Before you go, buddy up with fellow Formula Botanica graduates and students on our online classroom or Skincare Entrepreneur Mastermind Facebook groups. Together you can cover more bases and feel less intimidated especially if it\'s your first big beauty trade fair. Don\'t be worried about representing a small, indie beauty brand. We found suppliers this year far more willing and helpful to the indie sector than in the past. Suppliers were eager to talk about smaller MOQs (minimum order quantities) and seemed to have geared up to the indie sector\'s needs. Do try to attend some formulation workshops as you will learn a lot about how to work with new, innovative ingredients like emulsifiers. Do visit the Sensory Bar and any other innovation zones even if a lot of the products showcased are not natural. You can gain invaluable insights into upcoming trends from mainstream cosmetic brands which can open your eyes to possibilities in your natural formulating.

I said to myself, wow — for 15 years, in the big corporate beauty world, my whole job was to come up with ideas of products, develop them, position them, and convince you that this was the holy grail, and then whatever ingredient I was talking about in that product was going to transform your skin and your life.” - Tina Hedges, Founder of LOLI Beauty On this week’s show, Tina shares more on her background in the corporate beauty industry, as well as how growing up in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica influenced her beliefs around the ingredients we use in products. She also shares more on what led her to build LOLI, and what she felt like was missing from the mainstream beauty market. For LOLI, less is more when it comes to products (they build products for multiple purposes), and their packaging is built on a foundation of sustainability and asking a ton of questions. The below thoughts, ideas + organizations were brought up in this chat:   Most beauty brands out there are making their products of 80-95% water while creating tons of waste along the way.   In the beauty industry, the packaging usually costs more than what’s in the actual product.   “192 billion beauty packages end up in landfills a year.”   LOLI’s Plum Elixir — “the ultimate multitasker” — it replaces your moisturizer, your serum, you can use it on your face and your hair, your lips, your neck, your nails.   MadeSafe, certification body that LOLI uses to certify all of their ingredients and products   LOLI’s Date Nut Brûlée — “miracle melting balm” — can be a solid oil cleaner, works like an aquaphor or vaseline, can minimize scars or stretch marks, or be used for chapped lips and elbows   Tina’s top go-to products: Chamomile Lavender Water + Plum Elixir   From the intro — “25 Of The Funniest Signs From The Global Climate Strike” via Reconsidered Newsletter   CURIOUS TO TRY LOLI?

Covering the fashion and luxury sectors in Europe, Lizzie’s writing focuses on business, tech and sustainability, along with Fashion Week coverage from London, Milan and Paris. “For me, it’s about being fair in my reporting, but it’s also about not being afraid of blowback from a brand for writing the truth.” - Elizabeth Paton, Reporter For New York Times Style On this week’s show, Lizzie shares more on her background, and how she originally planned to be a lawyer, but the recession among other events led her to become a fashion journalist. Kestrel + Lizzie also dive deeper into some of her articles on The New York Times, including her writing about whether using prison labor in fashion supply chains can be ethical, and her questions around the new Fashion Pact.

A brand new sustainable towel company, ANACT is all about taking simple acts to make an impact. “I chose hemp because it has these natural performance features that don’t need any manipulation with putting a chemical or a treatment or a finish on it. And so it made sense to me to use earth’s natural resources to solve these problems.” - Brianna Kilcullen, Founder of ANACT On this week’s show, Brianna shares more on her journey into sustainability, and how she built her own role at Under Armour, to become the first full-time sustainability employee on their team. She also walks us through the inspiration behind ANACT — basically, her search for a solution for smelly towels. :) Brianna explains several of the superpowers of hemp, and where we are currently in the United States when it comes to the industrialization of hemp.

Handcrafting jewelry for over 7 years, and collecting crystals and sea glass for over 20, Sloane is a master maker, and creates all of her cast pieces for Eliza Sloane Jewelry from recycled metals. “I just think that not boxing ourselves in or pigeon-holing ourselves too much — that’s just what ultimate creative freedom is.” - Sloane, Founder + Maker Behind Eliza Sloane Jewelry On this week’s show, Sloane shares more of her journey, and how an internship sourcing vintage gems in New York City motivated her to build an Etsy shop, and eventually inspired her to start making her own jewelry. Sloane dives into more on how surfing inspires her creative work, and vice versa — and how they seem to feed each other consistently, helping her maintain a fluidity in both her lifestyle and creative work.

A zero waste, ethical fashion brand, Tonlé is on a big mission, to reduce waste generated by larger factories and change the way business is done in the fashion industry. “Lots of people define zero waste in different ways, and for us, it’s basically about reducing the waste that’s already being created in the fashion industry, and using every piece of our own waste.” - Rachel Faller, Founder of Tonlé On this week’s show, Rachel shares more on her journey, and how a Fulbright fellowship to Cambodia helped plant the seeds for her to build Tonlé. Also, we explore more in depth what zero waste means to the brand, and how for Tonlé, it naturally overlaps with their approach to manufacturing, and addressing social issues. Sreyoun, the General Manager of Tonlé’s production operations in Cambodia, also shares how she started working with Tonlé, originally as an accountant. She had the opportunity to move into other positions, learn a lot about the business and sustainable fashion, and now has moved into the General Manager role.

Inspired by ethical and sustainable thinking and with an eye to the future, Frank And Oak has set out to create clothing that is made for good living. “So I think that for us, the idea is actually to create a deeper relationship with our customers, and make sure that we really understand them before we create something.” On this week’s show, Ethan shares more on how his entrepreneurial dreams led him to the fashion industry, and how Frank and Oak was initially the response to he and his cofounder not being able to find brands that shared their values. Also, Ethan dives into what sustainability really means to Frank and Oak, and how for them, it’s about: first —minimizing impact, second — restore. Kestrel asks Ethan to comment on sustainability when it comes to subscription box services. For Ethan and Frank and Oak, they believe their subscription service can help them learn more about their shoppers, and in turn, produce more accurately, reducing waste. The below thoughts, ideas + organizations were brought up in this chat:   SeaCell, a new fabric that Frank and Oak recently launched in their collection   StylePlan, Frank and Oak’s subscription box service   Frank and Oak’s Circular + Hydro-Less Denim   |  In episode 172, Kestrel welcomes Jen Long, the CEO and Creative Director of Noble Carriage, to the show. A thoughtfully curated store, Noble Carriage offers a collection of organic & sustainably made baby goods. “I think as a new mom, you’re told that you need to buy all of these things — that you need all of these things to make raising your child easier or just to survive, and I don’t believe that. I think you need fewer, better things.” -Jen Long, CEO of Noble Carriage On this week’s show, Jen shares more on what led her to starting her own curated shop for little ones. She also talks about how she thinks sustainability as a lifestyle can really start with moms, as they are already tuned into starting fresh and doing whatever they can to provide a safe, healthy environment for their babies. The below thoughts, ideas + organizations were brought up in this chat:   Watch more on Noble Carriage’s story >   “You need to lead with good design — good design I think can change the world.

A platform that explores why we wear what we wear, and the relationships between emotions, personality and aesthetic, The Psychology of Fashion™ also examines current issues in the fashion industry through the lens of psychology. “You know, if we get away from this sort of like trends just because, buy it because all these people have it — if we think about who we are, why we like what we like, the way that fashion actually can be powerful for us, I think we’re going to buy less but buy better, and invest in things because we’re sure.” -Anabel Maldonado, Founder of The Psychology of Fashion™ On this show, Anabel shares more on her background, and how she has fused her interests to build The Psychology Of Fashion™. When she realized she wanted to build this platform and write about these topics together, she started a research project, to develop a framework to better talk about fashion through the lens of psychology. The below thoughts, ideas + organizations were brought up in this chat:   “We believe that personal style is not random. The clothes that feel best tap into our truest qualities, are a consequence of our different inner needs, and reflect our most deep-seated narratives about ourselves.”   “6 Reasons Why Fashion Is Losing Its Appeal” on The Psychology Of Fashion   Alain de Botton, writer and philosopher who has inspired Anabel   “It’s funny because it’s not just about the optical effect or making an impression on others — it’s about triggering a certain mindset in yourself.”   Enclothed Cognition: how clothes affect your cognitive process, anything cerebral (thinking, feeling, anything that happens in the brain)   “Self knowledge is the antidote to mindless consumption.”   Big 5 Personality Test   PSYKHE, a new e-commerce platform Anabel is launching, that is powered by personality science, machine learning and the psychology of fashion.   Article in the Washington Post Kestrel referred to, “Kamala Harris embraced black. That was both unremarkable and theatrically powerful.”   |  In episode 170, Kestrel welcomes Nicole Rattner, the founder of Sourcery The Label, to the show. A brand focused on cleaning up fashion with beautifully designed, naturally sourced garments, Sourcery is known for their Innovative Machine Washable silk. “I think it’s important that we start to offer the customer, the consumer, something that works for her too, and invite her into this world of sustainability through better functionality. So, for me, a washable silk kind of did both of those things.” -Nicole Rattner, Founder of Sourcery The Label On this week’s show, Nicole shares more on her past experiences working in design and textile development with larger brands like Victoria’s Secret, Polo Ralph Lauren, Urban Outfitters, Nordstrom and others. Through working on more of a global scale with these bigger brands, Nicole started to realize that, as the designer, she had a larger responsibility to start working to clean up fashion. The below thoughts, ideas + organizations were brought up in this chat:   “60% of the clothing that hangs on the racks of major retailers is made of polyester, a petroleum-based synthetic fabric.”   “First and foremost, I believe we have to start focusing on natural materials. I really believe the future of fashion is going to be in innovative takes on those natural materials.”   “Silk is such an under-appreciated and underexposed product.”   Vogue article mentioned in the intro — “As Zara Announces Its Latest Sustainability Goals, Three of Its Design Team Weigh In on Going Slower and Creating Responsibly”   |  In episode 169, Kestrel welcomes Adam Taubenfligel, the designer + creative director at Triarchy, to the show. An LA-based sustainable denim brand,\xa0Triarchy has a focus on conserving water, and reducing the massive consumption that is typically used to make jeans. “We’re trying to be as sustainable as possible, but then, if we bring something to market that’s not giving you those things you love about the jeans that hold you in and do all this stuff, then they won’t sell, and then you’re not running a business. And so, you have to also remember this is a business and not a not-for-profit sustainable thing.” -Adam Taubenfligel, Creative Director + Cofounder of Triarchy On this week’s show, Adam shares more on what led him from film to fashion, and how he discovered the destructive nature of the apparel industry. He also elaborates on how he believes mindfulness could be the key to transforming the fashion industry. After being on a month-long Instagram cleanse, Adam describes the power in disconnecting, when it comes to enhancing our creativity and productivity. The below thoughts, ideas + organizations were brought up in this chat:   Ozone Denim Systems   e-flow Technology   “When you go into every major department store in the world, it’s basically the same 5 brands that are on that wall. And so, I really do think there’s room on those walls for brands that really are dedicated to making the denim industry as good as possibly can be, and that maybe have the ability to do that because they aren’t juggernauts, yet.”  ', 'chan_desc': "An inclusive audio space, Conscious Chatter opens the door to conversations about our clothing + the layers of stories, meaning and potential impact connected to what we wear. It's a venue that allows us to continue to learn more about the garment industry and how we can all be a bigger part of positive change in the industry.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/a5/38/d5/a538d584-13d6-f93c-f47f-7aba7f2ffe69/mza_766368371769526346.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2016-02-18'}}

She and Bunnie also talk about dream cars, favorite positions, and why Alysia will never be the one who gets ghosted.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways:\xa0  Alysia is from a small town in Nebraska, full of churches and bars. She had planned to go into the military since her early 20’s, but decided to enroll in the Air Force. She served for 9 years and 6 days, and learned a lot in her role as an Air Force dentist.\xa0 Alysia is far from your typical midwesterner. She has a big Portuguese family who has traveled all over the world.\xa0 Boot Camp wasn’t too bad when the instructors were hot, but not too much fun with bush-loving instructors that banned shaving.\xa0 One of the biggest steps to success Alysia found when transitioning to civilian life was to make sure she had structure, goals, and a plan to carry them out.\xa0 Alysia is rethinking her bikini competition involvement, so be sure to stay tuned to her social media for announcements.\xa0 Inside her OnlyFans account, subscribers get exclusive content and sexy private messages from Alysia.

Reya also answers your questions on everything from her first kiss, worst date, how to know if she’s flirting with you, and the craziest thing she has done drunk.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways:\xa0  Reya grew up in the Bay Area and started stripping after college. She is one smart ray of sunshine, and graduated Magna Cum Laude. Once she started dancing, she was hooked and knew she wanted to do more in the adult industry. Reya grew up in a strict household, and that may have been a factor in her being extra open minded and fun as an adult.\xa0 Dancing and other jobs in the adult industry aren’t as easy as people think. You have unpredictable hours, often times you aren’t sure when the next paycheck is coming in, and it’s a constant hustle to get your name out there and stay top of mind.\xa0 Reya’s favorite thing about tour is getting out there to meet her fans and show them an unforgettable performance.\xa0 What Reya and Bunnie will notice about you when they first meet you: your general vibe and energy, sense of humor and...teeth.\xa0 Reya was once kicked out of ski resort while on a family vacation because she was too drunk and getting everyone all riled up. Our kinda gal.\xa0 Part of being a smart business woman and hustler is staying away as much as possible from the piracy and catfishing in the adult industry.\xa0 Get ready for Reya to shine even more in 2020!

Francia also shares her deepest fantasy, the athletes that can’t get enough of sliding into her DM’s, and the strangest place she’s ever had sex.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways:\xa0  Francia has been on Instagram for 11 months and now has a whopping 2.3 million followers. She is always hustling, posting, and interacting with fans for that impressive engagement!\xa0 Not only is Francia super hot and sexy, but this girl is funny and creative. You can check out her sexy skits and comedy also on the ‘gram at @francety.\xa0 Francia got into taking photos by default, after a few other careers such as being an esthetician didn’t go as well as she thought they would. A friend told her that with her body and personality, she would do awesome on social media, and they were certainly right.\xa0 Francia, like Bunnie, is all about spreading positivity and empowering others. She doesn’t pay much attention to the haters, even though she definitely gets her fair share.\xa0 Of course Francia loves to go out partying and dancing - she’s Colombian! One of the biggest challenges in Francia’s life was leaving her family and friends in Columbia and making a name for herself in the US.\xa0 If you are going to send Francia an intimate pic of yourself through a DM, be sure your situation isn’t shaped like Captain Hook’s claw.\xa0 If you happen to see Francia on a plane, know that one of her biggest fantasies is joining the mile high club having sex on an airplane.\xa0 Want a happier life?

Bailee also spills the secrets on a real typical family night at home, what it’s like having Bunnie and Jelly as parents, how she stays so strong, and what’s going on for her in the world of music and writing.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways:\xa0  Bailee made the big move this year from elementary school to junior high, and is killing the 6th grade game so far. She just made it into choir and picked up the drums as an instrument in addition to playing the guitar.\xa0 Bailee is a natural born performer and entertainer. She didn’t have a shred of stage fright with joining Jelly in front of 800 people in Dallas, Texas.\xa0 As proven with her great work writing a verse on Jelly’s “Sunshine After the Rain,'' Bailee loves the mixture of rapping, singing, and songwriting. Once she starts writing more, Jelly will take her into the studio and help her produce some tracks.\xa0 Bailee has been making up her own lyrics and songs since she was very little. Jelly fully supports her creativity, but also is very protective of her in the music business.\xa0 Jelly has been focusing more on his health lately, and has been hitting the weights so much Bunnie thought his rock hard arm was actually his elbow!\xa0 Yes, Bunnie and Jelly will have a wedding one day in the near future, and Bailee will get a brother or sister. They have baby fever and promise to bring everyone along on the journey.\xa0 Bailee and Bunnie accidentally met first on FaceTime 8 months before they met in person. Bailee wasted no time and asked Bunnie what her intentions were for Jelly, and she was happy to hear Bunnie just wanted to look out and care for them both as a family.\xa0 The whole family goes absolutely crazy for Halloween, and embraces it fully. This year they are thinking of being the Adams Family, so keep your eyes peeled for a super hot Morticia.\xa0 Bailee stayed strong while her biological mother battled with addiction. She is a role model to all of us that it’s powerful to express our feelings and even cry.\xa0 Bunnie doesn’t mind being the “bad cop” when it comes to keeping miss Bailee safe, sound, and a little lady with great manners. It’s all in the name of love.\xa0  \xa0 Quotes:\xa0  “It’s easier for me to sing or be able to do something musical about my story or how I’m feeling than to talk about it.”\xa0 “The worst thing you tell a fat person is that they are shaped like a refrigerator.”\xa0\xa0 “I never get in trouble, except on holidays.”\xa0 “Being strong means allowing yourself to hurt, and then healing from it.”\xa0 “The whole being a girl thing is what my dad is strict about.”\xa0  \xa0 Mentioned:\xa0 “Sunshine After the Rain”\xa0 \xa0 Check out Bunnie:\xa0 @xomgitsbunnie BunnieXo\xa0 @officialdumbblonde | Bunnie is ready to put in the twerk work this week and get those booty cheeks clapping, and there’s no better expert she could welcome other than entrepreneur, business woman, and former dancer Nina Galy. Not only does Nina have a body to die for, and she can pop and lock it like no other, but she has her hands in a bunch of money making endeavors. Nina talks about her “Bag Talk” YouTube series, her retail line for handpicked clothing, and teaches us the secret of twerking like a six figure stripper.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways:\xa0  In dancing and stripping, it’s common etiquette to tip when someone helps you out. Nina took that mindset and applied it to her YouTube channel and digital platforms. In her “Bag Talk” series, and formerly Striptea, she teaches girls about everything from investing wisely, getting the good sections as a dancer, and advice for the average woman.\xa0 “Bag Talk” evolved into an ongoing series every Monday, and Nina is seeing a huge response from women of all types loving the knowledge she drops weekly. One of the most popular topics is how to start a business and grow your online presence through Instagram.\xa0 Nina personally approves the clothes she sells on her Six Figure Stripper retail line. She works with her favorite manufacturers and only picks clothes she would wear herself.\xa0 It takes practice and dedication to perfect the twerk, so don’t get discouraged if you can’t get it right away. Nina has been twerking since she was 15 and on the dance team.\xa0 Not only can Nina do the basic twerk perfectly, but the girl can do it upside down with no wall. True baller.\xa0 If you are lucky enough to live in a location where they teach twerking classes, sign up!\xa0  \xa0 Quotes:\xa0  “I was doing home parties, and it reminded me of selling tupperware.”\xa0 “I’ve seen girls who are basically trying to do a split in doggie style, and that’s too open.”\xa0 “I look like a dog dry heaving right now.”\xa0 “I’m a white girl from Texas.

She’s beautiful, she’s savage, and she’s well versed in forensic psychology, so don’t try and pull anything past her. Heather talks about how she got into competing and went on to become the WBO women’s featherweight champion. She also shares about the personal times in life that she was down but then got back up to win. \xa0 Takeaways:  In school, Heather dreamed of becoming the first female pitcher for the Yankees. We still wouldn’t rule it out. Heather was a tomboy growing up, and majored in forensic psychology. She fell into fighting in 2010 after a divorce left her feeling alone and searching for more meaning and joy in life. Within 3 weeks she had her first fight and won, and then went on to win every title you can win as amateur. Heather is very vocal about the tremendous pay disparity in women’s sports and advocates for equal opportunities for women and men. Heather will be defending her WBO world title for boxing next with two big fights coming up. Two major lessons Heather learned from working in a male dominated industry: know your worth, and speak up for your own truth. Heather is a very proud mom of her 15 year old daughter Annie, and Annie is her reason to wake up and conquer every morning. Yes, cutting weight is as hard as it sounds.  \xa0 Quotes:  “I diagnose people as they walk by me.” “The minute the ref held my hand and I won, it was like nothing I’ve ever felt before.” “I wanted my banner to hang as a world champion. It was my dream from day one.” “When you get real with yourself, life becomes so much easier.”  \xa0 Mentioned: Jelly Roll @heathertheheat Heather Hardy @HeatherHardyBox Gleason’s Gym  @ArielHelwani @claressashields  @billieeilish \xa0 Check out Bunnie: @xomgitsbunnie BunnieXo @officialdumbblonde | Kayleigh Swenson, aka the Viking Barbie, has lived a life and then some. She’s felt like an outcast from a young age, was addicted to drugs by the time she was a teen, then found sobriety and used her story to help others by opening The Viking House. Kayleigh talks with Bunnie about what led her from poetry to the rap game, what’s next for her in music, and embracing the rocky ups and downs of mental health.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways:\xa0  Kayleigh is originally a Texas gal - her mom was a dancer and her dad, Jeep Swenson, was a well known actor (Bane in Batman & Robin) and wrestler. They moved out to California to pursue Jeep’s acting career.\xa0 Before she was Viking Barbie, Kayleigh was often called Gothic Barbie. She was blonde, emo, and often felt like an outcast.\xa0 Kayleigh is super open about her own story, because it can serve as a survival guide for someone else. She started doing drugs at 16, and was doing them consistently up until about age 25.\xa0 Kayleigh’s life lessons she learned about herself in both drug use and sobriety are put to use with the recovery home called the Viking House.\xa0 Writing poetry came naturally to Kayleigh at a young age, and that combined with her love of underground hip hop and Snoop led her to pursue rap. Her song with Tech N9ne, “All the Way to the Bank” and Crooked I “My Heart Belongs to Daddy” will be coming out soon. No wonder she’s like the Marilyn Monroe of hot rappers.\xa0 Just like most of us, Kayleigh has days where she feels super fine and on top of the world and others where she feels self doubt. Her advice to get through the tough days is to eat right, keep working out, and keep supportive people around you.\xa0 We all need a friend like Kayleigh. She gave KarmaRX her first orgasm, the gift that just keeps giving.\xa0  \xa0 Quotes:\xa0  “I can blend in, but I prefer to be alone.”\xa0 “I’ve done crazy ass sh*t, people wouldn’t even believe half of it.”\xa0 “If a guy isn’t obsessed and on his knees for me, ya gotta go.”\xa0   Mentioned:\xa0 Jelly Roll\xa0 @viking.barbie VikingBarbie @vikingbarbie.tv  Viking Barbie YouTube Viking House\xa0 Jeep Swenson @karma_Rx\xa0 \xa0 Check out Bunnie:\xa0 @xomgitsbunnie BunnieXo\xa0 @officialdumbblonde\xa0 | Bunnie welcomes the super hot and mysterious femme fatale, Mistress Neena, aka Neena De Ville. She makes her clients’ deepest fantasies come true, and even shares a few of her favorites. She also explains what it is a dominatrix actually does, how she got into it, and gives a glimpse into working in the kink and fetish industry. Mistress Neena shares what she will and won't do and her specialty fetishes, and what it means to be a submissive. Welcome to the dungeon, weirdos. \xa0 Takeaways:  Mistress Neena has been a professional dominatrix for two years, and now has her own play space including all the good whips and toys. She has always been a powerful woman, and loves working with people to make their deepest, darkest fantasies come to life. Neena’s advice to people looking to find a dom - do your research. Make sure the person you pick is in it for the right reasons and has some sense of safety and respect for both parties. The one thing both Neena and Bunnie really don’t like? Being tickled. Stop! A “sub” or submissive conforms to the authority of Neena, and willingly (and very happily) follows her orders. Every person has different fetishes, and that’s okay. Neena sees it all - everything from whips and chains to worship, humiliation and even food play or “sploshing”. Yes, there is a thing called small penis humiliation. It’s about reclaiming a fear they have and reframing it to make it sexual and to make it a turn on instead of something negative. Chastity is one of Neena’s favorites. This is where she has the key to a man’s d*ck, and they can’t do anything without her. Shibari, the beautiful art of Japanese rope bondage, is another one of Neena’s faves. A large part of what makes Neena a true professional is that she is very aware of hurting someone (if that is what their fantasy allows) without damaging them seriously. Neena is only a dom, and never a sub. A switch is someone that can do both dom and sub. Ladies, listen up! Neena is bi and loves playing with women, and wishes more came to her. Neena doesn’t sleep with her clients, and it is sexual, but it is more psychosexual.  \xa0 Quotes:  “The stranger the better for me, and the more exciting it is for me.” “I love reading people’s dirty little secrets.” “Chastity is the best way to control men. You can get a man to do anything you want when you have his cock locked up.” “Don’t settle for a man who won’t accept you for who you are.”  \xa0 Mentioned: Jelly Roll Mistress Neena De Ville @mistress_neena Mistress Neena Fetishes (movie on Pandora’s Box) Dungeon East Mistress Adrienne \xa0 Check out Bunnie: @xomgitsbunnie BunnieXo @officialdumbblonde | Blimes Brixton and Gifted Gab join Bunnie this week to talk about the crazy night in Seattle that started their career, when they will drop the next album, and what it’s like to be two successful female rappers coming together to break the mold as a duo. They also talk about their background in music and how it influences their joint style, how their single “Come Correct” blew up and broke the internet, and why they don’t need to sell their sexuality to be on top of the game. Bunnie also gives them a super special BFF quiz to see how well they really know the fun stuff about each other like horrible dates, favorite breakfast foods and songs to get in the mood. \xa0 Takeaways:  Blimes and Gab met in person one debaucherous night (maybe new album title?!) in Seattle. They already had much digital respect for each other, and found they complimented each others style. They fought off some crazy people, realized they had each other’s backs, and it was friendship ever since. Blimes is originally from San Francisco and Gab is from Seattle. They are each influenced by artists and music from all over the world, and music has been a part of each of their lives since they were young. Blimes was a battle rapper “Come Correct” was their first unintentional project as a duo. The internet loved what they heard, saw how original they are together and it caught a ton of people’s attention. Blimes and Gab have been in the game so long together that they are both meticulous about their business and confident about their worth. They are in charge of all their own business decisions, and are their own creative directors. Comfort is the bottom line, and their nature isn’t overtly sexual. If they feel like being sexy, it’s for themselves. Blimes finds it a little more accepting now than 2017 to be in the LGBTQ community. She remembers a time when it wasn’t cool to be different, and remembers of y’all that tried to hold her back. The Blimes and Gab joint album will be coming out soon, with a tour to follow. In the meantime, check out each of their solo work. Blimes just released her album Castles in the spring, and Gab released Cause and Effect.  \xa0 Quotes:  “I’ll be a zombie and eat motherf*ckers when a girl tries to fight me, dude.” “Nothing solidifies a friendship like beating ass together, I swear.” “Every hat that you have to wear, we wear it.”  \xa0 Mentioned: Jelly Roll @blimesbrixton @gifted_gab @blimesandgab @BlimesandGab Blimes and Gab “Come Correct” C89.5 Tourettes Without Regrets Tommy Castro and the Painkillers | Dancer and lap dance extraordinaire, Audrey Angstrom, is live and direct from Los Angeles this week with Bunnie to teach you how to do a real lap dance for your man. Audrey talks about how she got started as a dancer, how much money she makes, the tough part of hustling your body, and what her time in rehab taught her. She and Bunnie also talk about getting out of abusive relationships, and her poetry book Overwhelmed. Get those headphones on and be ready to blow your man’s mind with this one. \xa0 Takeaways:  Audrey has been dancing for 5 years, and found that she made more money doing it than any job she had before. On a good night, she makes $1,000 or more. It’s not all just dollar bills flying though. The dancers work super hard to promote, and have to sell bottle service or else eat that charge on their own. Maybe Bunnie will start a Strippers Union soon to represent justice for all!? Audrey self published her poetry book Overwhelmed, to help process her own trauma and recovery and help others out through whatever demons they are fighting on their end. Audrey was in rehab in a super intense in-patient treatment, and learned so much about her own strength and resilience throughout the process. She takes it one day at a time and does a lot of self care in between giving the best lap dances. You can break out of an abusive relationship. Audrey did so herself, and shares the pain of how brainwashed you become when you are in an abuse cycle. Audrey is pansexual, which means she doesn’t see people as gender. She loves who she loves, and her love has no boundaries. Okay here it is — the most basic lap dance rules: give steady eye contact, make your touch soft and sensual and not like a Neanderthal, move slow, and shake it all.  \xa0\xa0 Quotes:  “They don’t call it a house fee, our manager calls it a ‘donation’.” “Made double my paycheck on the first night.” “I can sell used underwear back to someone.” “Square bitches are rude as f*ck.” “Going to rehab was a blessing.”  \xa0 Mentioned: Crazy Girls  Overwhelmed @audreyangstrom \xa0 Check out Bunnie: @xomgitsbunnie BunnieXo @officialdumbblonde", 'chan_desc': 'The degenerate love child of Dolly Parton & Dr. Ruth.

Horrendous, right? But change is possible.Kirsten Brodde is a former science journalist on a mission to clean up fashion. Meet the Greenpeace activist who led the Detox My Fashion campaign, which spurred an industry-wide commitment to phase out harmful chemicals from clothing production.In this interview, we unpick what it takes to be an effective activist (think dogged persistence!) and passion but also a willingness to be unpopular.The Detox campaign took time, major pressure and careful negotiation, but it actually worked. Kirsten describes what’s happened as a result as “a paradigm shift,” and says there’s no going back.The message, activism matters.

Most brands would rather you didn\'t.Meet the fashion disruptor who is happy to tell you exactly what it costs his company to make its products, and exactly how much profit they make on each style.Michael Preysman founded Everlane on the concept of "radical transparency" and says: “We believe our customers have a right to know how much their clothes cost to make. We reveal the true costs behind all of our products—from materials to labor to transportation—then offer them to you, minus the traditional retail markup.”Why is transparency important in the fashion industry? How does that idea apply when it comes to garment workers and factory supply chains? How did this Californian start up become a major global player, and what drives Michael Preysman? In this interview we discuss what it takes to succeed, the power of disruption, and being okay with not being perfect.\xa0Check out the shownotes on clarepress.com for links and more info.Enjoying Wardrobe Crisis?

Since a large proportion of them work from home, this is an often hidden and unregulated sector.Post Rana Plaza, there’s been more attention on garment factories, but how often do we consider outworkers - homeworkers - who are often contracted by third parties?This week’s guest is Rebecca van Bergen, founder of fab New York-based NGO, Nest. They are on a mission to “build a new handworker economy to increase global workforce inclusivity, improve women’s wellbeing beyond factories, and preserve important cultural traditions around the world.”In this interview, we discuss what it takes to make it as a social entrepreneur, the importance of practical plan as well as a big vision, the familiar story of women\'s work being values and what\'s being done about it.\xa0Enjoying the show?

Searches on Lyst increased by 66% last year. Vogue has a sustainability editor. Slow fashion is so popular that even Zara is trying to convince us they\'re not a fast fashion brand.\xa0But what does it take to make it as an independent designer working in this space? To cut through the noise to become a sustainable label people talk about? And buy?Are hard work and dedication enough?\xa0Nope, says Courtney Holm, the Australian designer behind buzzy independent fashion label A.BCH. She argues that new gen designers need to rethink the whole system. Holm is on a mission to revolutionise how we buy, wear and dispose of clothing.In this interview we discuss the instinct to have a go yourself when you see something isn\'t being done, the importance of doing your homework and the usefulness of having a stubborn streak.

He was scouted on his lunch break when he was working a London office job, and walked his first show for Margiela in Paris in 2015. He went on to appear in ads for Calvin Klein Underwear and Hugo Boss.His first book of poetry, titled Wait, explores consumerism, contemporary culture and waste. It sprang from an art show he held in a London gallery, after he interned for his photographer friend Harley Weir.Now, as well as writing, he’s making short films about the fashion industry’s impacts on the environment. Wilson says poetry is just another way to communicate his ideas to his audience, and that when he began it didn’t worry him one bit that he hadn’t read loads of poetry - he just gave it a go and it worked.\xa0 This interview is about how we reach different people, how we story tell, and - ultimately - how we change the world.Enjoying the show?

Despite her tiny stature I have come to realize that she is a MASSIVE force in barbering. Over the years we have shared some incredible conversations on many different continents and on this occasion. We got into the nuts and bolts of photography, photoshop, and how to stand out from the pack in a sea of talented individuals by carving your own path. | We have all dreamed about making it big. Being celebrated in our field, and working at the highest level... travelling the world... surrounded by famous atheletes, fashionistas, and supermodels. Sounds great right?  But the toad to that kind of success is seldom an easy one as my friend Harry Josh can tell you.  He is one of the most celebrated hairstylists in fashion and is responsible for some of the most iconic looks and supermodels in recent history but the road to get here was marked with so many failures and he took so many blows to his ego that at one point he had just given up completely...   every stylist or barber that dreams of “making it big”. Needs to hear this story. | Almost a year ater the suicide of a close friend left him reeling, KEUNE’s Global Men’s Creative Director Tom Chapman helped create THE LIONS COLLECTIVE. An international group of barbers committed to making a difference in men’s mental health and suicide prevention. Hear his story and the conversation that we recorded LIVE on stage at the Community Barber Showcase in Vancouver BC. | Part 2 of our epic conversation with @ANDREWDOESHAIR. Couldn’t wait until the weekend for this one! | @andrewdoeshair is a force in our industry. From the very early days on Instagram he has built a solid following by sharing his tips, tricks, and opinions with everyone that would listen. By sharing a lot of things other people won’t, focussing on the things he feels helped him actually succeed and steering clear of corporate sponsorships, he has created a niche for himself in the Indie hair education community. Join us for part one of a two-part conversation that covers everything from the state of the industry to why he doesn’t consider himself an influencer but still preaches the importance of social media and content creation in today’s market. | Panasonic’s global creative director @kevinluchmun is a creative powerhouse with an avalanche of awards and titles under his belt. He has created some iconic looks for top male models like @rickyhall and @whoiselijah , worked on stages around the world, and has recently built one of the best online education platforms available. Long story short... Kevin is impressive... but I know him as something else... a completely loveable goofball that I have shared more than a few laughs and crazy experiences with. Listen to his story and learn about how he has built his brand and why he keeps pushing himself to be better than he was yesterday. | Larissa love is undeniably a huge influence in the beauty world. She is an artist who started building her Instagram following early on and re-defined what it means to be an influencer. But sometimes things are not always what they’re cracked up to be. Listen in as we talk to Larissa about what it means to be an influencer and the toll it can take on your personal life. | If you haven’t heard of Menspire they are a men’s grooming education program that started out of a shop in the UK with their sights set on world domination. Some people think it is the evolution of men’s grooming and some feel like it is hurting the industry and detracting from what traditional barbering is all about. I’ll admit as a barber I’ve had my reservations about it. But, I’ll also admit that most of my experiences that I judged it by have stemmed from the relative arrogance of people I run into who have taken the course... not from the people who have created it. Kind of like judging a religion by its followers instead of its doctrine.... So I decided to sit down with Charlie Gray one of the co-creators of Menspire and asked him what all of the fuss is about... | Mari De Monte is a rising star in the education side of the hair industry. After slugging it out in the competitive world of NYC hair salons and training under some of the worlds best... her approach to customer service, personalized style, and building relationships has allowed her to keep her single chair studio in Brooklyn packed with clients who will pay a premium for her talents. She is changing the conversation about women in the “male dominated” industry of men’s grooming. | Buddy Porter is a well known celebrity hairstylist whose client roster boasts names like Halle Berry, Justin Theroux, Olivia Holt and many more (but he’d never let you know that). His passion for music and his impressive collection of tattoos makes him seem more at home at a hardcore concert than behind the chair of a fancy Beverly Hills salon but his work ethic and his tireless commitment to his craft has made him one of tinsel towns most sought after stylists. Listen to his career journey and his advice on how to survive in one of the most competitive hair styling markets in the world where the “wash-out” rate does not leave the odds in your favour.', 'chan_desc': 'International men’s grooming icon Matty Conrad has travelled the world inspiring countless stylists to be better barbers and better humans.

However, for Laura Cox, inspiration for premium toxin-free skincare brand Oars + Alps didn\'t come from her, or her business partner, but instead from the active lifestyle of their husbands -- and from wanting to break the black and white mold of skincare of men. Laura shares the brand\'s story with Karen Moon and Abby Wallach. | In many industries, including beauty, it’s whom you know (or whom you know of), that can make the difference.\xa0MakeUp-In makes it clear that it is the only B-to-B makeup event, and is the beauty professional’s chance to connect with suppliers, brands and trend-setters who come together in the heart of centers of beauty activity like Paris, New York, Seoul, Sao Paulo, Los Angeles & Shanghai.

He takes us beyond glitzy runways into a place that gave him inspiration for his latest creation, a beauty brand called Costa Brazil. He shares his creative process conceiving and developing a unique skincare and fragrance company with an exotic ingredient that is "food for your skin". Most indie brand founders start with product and build from there; Francisco did the opposite -- he started with inspiration. | When a single mother of three girls had three friends with breast cancer, she learned that their doctors stressed using natural products on the body.\xa0After being unable to find a natural deodorant that worked for her, she decided to invent one herself and started by mixing up formulas in her kitchen. She took her new product which is human-tested to ensure effectiveness, and natural enough to be safe from spa door to spa door on the Las Vegas Strip until she found a buyer at the very last door she knocked on.

We are still alive and still love you and fashion and podcasts. In other news, French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the fashion industry get its shit together in terms of sustainability and other "initiatives." So Mr. Salma Hayek himself, Francois-Henri Pinault (of fashion conglomerate Kering) has spearheaded a "Sustainability Pact"\xa0 for members of large fashion companies like H&M, Chanel, Prada, etc to present to members of the G7. So wtf does that mean? To us, a whole lot of not much yet. Want to hear us get into it as well as a bunch of other highly important topics (ie: summer, moths), get on it! | Do you ever think about the impact our clothes-buying has on the world? On our culture? On each other? Maybe not. But our guest Jess Montgomery sure has. And lucky for us (and you!) she took some time to come over to the hot hot basement and chat with us about these impacts, how to train yourself to buy things differently, and her project Think The World Differently. It turns out she’s not just super knowledgable and passionate, she’s also an absolute delight to talk to. Give it a listen, you’ll see. | Ever been to a store to buy a thing and all they had at the store was just things to buy? Just go in, get it, and leave? Well that kind of transaction isn\'t enough for some brands, especially big ones, who want you to have a whole experience\xa0while at the store — maybe get a beer and draw a picture, see a DJ do a set, skate on a skateboard. In this episode, we chit chat about the new retail trend of experiential stores. Is it a coincidence that they are coming along at a time when traditional retail is dying and online shopping is easier and more popular than ever? We think not. | Lots to cover this week, Hags! We can’t\xa0not talk about the Met gala and all the hits and misses (there were a few) but the real deal is a kiki about line reviews. A line review is basically an internal show for buyers and other members of the production team by the designers for a specific season. Have no idea what any of that means? Better listen in and learn all about it. | It\'s just about time for the annual MET Gala and we are ready to dish. This year\'s theme is Camp: Notes on Fashion, based on Susan Sontag\'s 1964 essay\xa0Notes on Camp.\xa0It is such a fun theme that is almost impossible to get wrong, although we are pretty sure there will be people that will, which is one of the reasons we are excited to see it all unfold. Plus, we swoon over Beyonce\'s\xa0Homecoming and the usual nonsense. Put on a pink feathered gown and come join! | It\'s always fun to look back at school and talk about the good times, the bad times, the stress, the rewards, the blood, sweat, and tears, and how we could all do so much better now with the gift of hindsight. | We are thrilled to have academic researcher, blogger, author, networker, lecturer and generally delightful lady Kat Sark join us on this episode! She walks us through fashion networking, the wide world of academia and where fashion fits into it, her city-based fashion history books, impacts of colonialism on fashion and culture, and also starts up a few good giggles.\xa0Get ready for some great stories, stuff you never knew before, big words that sound impressive, and of course, obsessions. | Karl Lagerfeld is a name even non-fashion-y people can recognize, and now that he\'s gone what will fashion look like? His contributions to fashion are unmatched but there are definitely things we are not going to miss. Listen to the tea spilling\'! | REBEL REBEL! Fashion has always been a rebellious act, from those who create it, to those who refuse to embrace it, to those who actively reject it. Rebels continually push things forward to new limits and new directions by updating the status quo, but rebellion doesn’t have to be as obvious as wearing a torn jean jacket with safety pins and a mile high mohawk, even though that’s pretty fun. It can be as subtle as buying clothes from a small business run by POC, and, obviously, everything in between. Let’s take a big ol’ dive into it, shall we? Get those fists in the air, Hags! Or not, it’s up to you | Have you ever been seduced by a weird Instagram ad? Or a product some random "Influencer" posted about? The answer is probably yes! But why tho?

The cult-favorite was founded by Mario Guzman, aka Mr. Sherbinski, the renowned grower and creator of world-famous, dessert-titled genetics like Sunset Sherbert, Mochi, and Leafly\'s 2018 Strain of the Year- the ever-popular Gelato.Connoisseurs of the brand include many of today’s greatest artists, designers, and creators, including Wiz Khalifa, John Mayer, Lil Uzi Vert, Migos, Ty Dolla Sign, and Famous Dex. You have to look no further than Young Dolph\'s “Gelato,” Calvin Harris\'s “Slide," or Famous Dex\'s “Nervous” to get a taste of the strain\'s influence.Set to open a new retail space on Fairfax Avenue in L.A. this spring, Sherbinskis\' new cannabis club will literally be down the street from Supreme. Until then you can find the brand\'s premium cannabis products, which includes cannabis flower, pre-rolls, a variety of concentrates, vape cartridges, and lifestyle home goods, in select dispensaries across North America as well as Barneys\' newly opened High End.So just how did Sherbinskis go from growing weed in a Sunset District garage to breeding the most sought-after cannabis strains in the world?To find out, we invited Mario and his right-hand man G Putt to tell us the Sherbinskis story on the latest episode of Conversations.Learn more about your ad choices.

While there, we co-hosted a panel with Bodega and Reebok, who revealed several Innersect-exclusive collaborations.It was there we met Wes Chen, a hip-hop head and host of\xa0 “Xi Ha Gong Yuan”—aka The Park—arguably China’s most mainstream hip-hop show where he interviews artists, plays tracks, and talks about the latest happenings in the scene.Chen was instrumental to the rise of artists like the Chengu-based Higher Brothers, and is also the host of a documentary series documenting the rise of China’s trap scene. We stopped by his Shanghai studio to get a brief look at how hip-hop spread in China, the difficulties American artists may face while touring the country, and in contrast—the difficulties faced by Asian artists when it comes to breaking into the American music industry.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Late last year we went to Shanghai, China to experience Innersect, a two-day celebration of all things sneaker, streetwear, and fashion founded by Edison Chen of CLOT. It brought out many of the city\'s best-dressed denizens, but it also gave us a closer look at the Chinese streetwear consumer, and what separates them from their counterparts in America and Europe.Of course, street culture is now a global culture—and there\'s a lot of crossover in what brands are popular. The convention saw limited releases from Jordan Brand, UNDERCOVER, NEIGHBORHOOD, and PLEASURES, but also really dope installations that told a great story. Take for example, what Boston-based Bodega built out to promote their Innersect-exclusive collaborations.But even though some of the same brands are popular the world over, there\'s still a very regional aspect to how they\'re worn and what pieces pop off in different countries. On this episode of Highsnobiety\'s Conversations podcast, we take a deeper dive into what makes the Chinese streetwear market something plenty of brands and retailers are paying attention to today.Bodega\'s Oliver Mak and Alex James of PLEASURES talk about how a lot of their consumers come from China, and what it is about the country\'s massive population and culture of consumption that have made it an influential force in street culture.

The girls put two and two together and realized that they had classmates who were missing school a few days each month because they couldn’t afford the supplies they needed. Their educations were suffering because of it. An idea was born and a foundation was started, Girls Helping Girls. Period. What this family learned along the way about systemic, economic discrimination against women and girls could fill a book, or at least a podcast episode. Their remarkable teen-powered story of reaching out with something so simple yet so essential is an important one. Join us for the full episode.\xa0#wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcastwherebrainsmeetbeauty.com\xa0 | Any entrepreneur, me included, will tell you that your brand is your baby. So when you go to sell it, whether willingly and lucratively or not so much, you’re losing a bit of your soul. Our guest, Dr. Gregory Brown, Founder of RéVive Skincare, has lived through this more than most, as his company was bounced around from owner to owner. Along the way, he faced personal challenges that would have flattened most of us, including getting sober and living an authentic, open life. Listen to our full conversation, inspiring for every entrepreneur...and everyone else! \xa0#wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcastwherebrainsmeetbeauty.com | \xa0\xa0You never quite know where that BIG IDEA is going to come from. When I asked our guest, Jacqueline Gutierrez, Founder of Beauty Backer, how she developed her concept for the beauty-centric crowdfunding platform, she mentioned several inspirations, among them her inventor’s mindset which she first recognized as a teenager. Then when she was all grown up and trying to launch her own beauty business, she experienced the founder’s perpetual stumbling block: lack of early-stage money. That’s when her let’s-solve-this attitude took over and the rest is soon to be history as she launches Beauty Backer in just a few weeks. Her passion and drive are infectious, and I loved connecting with right before she becomes a star. Make sure you tune in to my full conversation with this amazing woman who just might change the game for beauty start-ups.#wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcast<!--/* Style Definitions

Wiley, was working full-time at an SEO and content marketing agency, she was pursuing her influencer interest on the side, blogging on food and crafts. As the agency started getting requests for influencer marketing from clients, they turned to Kristen who was the only one within the relatively small firm with influencer experience…or really any professional social media experience. So they gave her a budget and told her to run with it. As she did, she noticed a pattern that turned into an opportunity: while the platforms were mostly catering to the larger influencers, it was actually the smaller influencers who were having the biggest impact. But how to reach them effectively was a challenge. This disconnect between brands and bloggers planted the seed for Statusphere, the micro influencer agency Kristen started to get the right brand to the right influencer. Join us to hear her full story on how she filled this essential marketing need.\xa0#wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcastwherebrainsmeetbeauty.com\xa0 | When our guest, Jane Larkworthy, brand consultant and Beauty Editor-at-Large for\xa0The Cut, was a young intern and then a full-time member of the beauty staff at\xa0Glamour magazine, she dared to inquire of her new boss if she could try her hand at writing. It didn’t go well. This unenlightened woman cut Jane down with a stinging response that echoed in her head for years and kept her from sticking her toe in the writing pool again for ages. Cut to much later when Jane was hired as the first Beauty Director at the brand new\xa0Jane magazine with the following mandate: “Write in your own voice. Write in the first person. I want our readers to get to know who you are.” After she recovered from the whiplash of these oh-so different approaches to nurturing (or not nurturing) a writer, she vowed to be that talent scout, that door opener, that mentor for others. She sums it up, “If you have a boss who breeds competition versus a boss who says, ‘If you fail, it’s okay. Do it again because I know you can do it,” that makes all the difference. Join us for Jane’s story of where she started and how she got here. #wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcastwherebrainsmeetbeauty.com \xa0 | For Amy Shecter, CEO of Glamsquad, the handshake is full of meaning. She has observed throughout her career—working with major brands such as Lady Foot Locker, Diesel, Donna Karan, Cole Haan and Tory Burch—how much is revealed in the way someone shakes hands…and how it’s something that boys are raised to know about but girls are not. She observes, “How you shake a hand indicates how you feel about yourself and how you feel about the job.” She believes that when someone has a firm handshake, stands tall and looks you in the eye, they project confidence. As she grows Glamsquad, the on-demand hair, make-up and nail beauty service and product line, she’s always mentoring, teaching and helping her team to develop the skills and experience they need to move into leadership positions. While she loves her current role, she always has her eye on the bigger picture of helping people—including herself—to thrive professionally while being fulfilled personal, embracing the lessons of a handshake all along the way. Join us for Amy’s full story. #wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcastwherebrainsmeetbeauty.com\xa0 | Our first WBMB guest who has a college degree in scent, Erika Shumate acknowledges that she was probably destined to become a perfumer. As a child she was always fascinated by and sensitive to smells and science, reminiscing that “I was the kid in 7th and 8th grade to go to the state science fair and try to get the blue ribbon. I was always doing experiments in my basement.” Loving how perfumery combines science and art, she started her fragrance brand to embrace both. She combined these passions with her business acumen, first putting in a few years working for a startup to learn about growing a business, watching the company go from 10 employees to 50 and seeing all the related challenges. How she used that experience to start Pinrose is a delightful and helpful story for any business, whether it’s starting, growing or humming along.

Well, that’s exactly what our guests, Julian and Cody Levine, Co-Founders of Twice, are doing. But they’re doing much more than just creating a fabulous tasting, good-for-you toothpaste without questionable ingredients. Inspired by their dentist dad’s work in organizing volunteer teams of dental professionals to bring dental care to underserved communities, they set up their business to support and expand the outreach of the non-profit GLO Good. Having observed the difference healthy teeth can make in someone’s life—from alleviating pain to instilling the confidence that comes with feeling great about your smile—they have committed their brand to improving the experience of oral care for the first world while sharing their passion and good fortune with the developing world. It’s a riveting story…join us. #wherebrainsmeetbeauty@wherebrainsmeetbeautypodcastwherebrainsmeetbeauty.com \xa0 | It’s safe to say that Asha Coco, VP of Sales and Business Development at Givaudan, is the only WBMB guest who has been a Rockette. She acknowledges how lucky she was to have found her two passions—dance and fragrance—early in life. The challenge was choosing between them. She tried to pursue them both for as long as she could but finally came to that proverbial fork in the road—a job offer from Clarins Fragrance Group that forced her to answer the question, “Which way?” She chose the business route for its long-term possibilities, not realizing that these two worlds would overlap here and there. As she happily discovered, “the world of beauty completely intersects with art and culture, especially in fragrance.” Though not in a kick line any more, Asha is completely thrilled with her choice, her work and the creative opportunities it offers.

[04:10] You can't put a price on the unique experience, it only happens once in a lifetime. [04:35] People getting married seem to want to focus more on the people that are attending the wedding.\xa0 [05:12] Four-day weddings allow more opportunities to spend time with the people that attend and it gives more opportunity to wear more outfits! [07:05] Valerie says that millennials were born into this digital world and they are very adept at finding out any information they need in minutes. [08:43] They discuss that people today want events that are more personal and that are an extension of their entertainment style. [11:05] Millenials are of a mindset that things can change on a dime. Nothing is guaranteed. [11:25] They chat about Carrie's view of brides returning to the essentials and what makes it unique. [12:29] Valerie believes that there is a return to a more general consideration of people's feelings. [13:58] Brides and grooms feel a sense of empowerment because they can contribute to their own event.

She is the Digital Travel & Weddings Editor at Harpers Bazaar where she oversees all things weddings and travel for HarpersBazaar.com. She is in charge of content, strategy, and visuals for Bazaar's digital travel and wedding verticals and editor of their new membership program Bazaar Bride. She has worked on Live with Regis and Kelly at ABC and as fashion editor for Martha Stewart Weddings to name a few. When she joined Harpers Bazaar, they didn't really focus on weddings and she changed all of that. Since then she has published dozens of original fashion and decor content for the site, plus she has created a considerable brand voice.\xa0 Carrie and Andy chat about her internships and working the red carpet at the Oscars with Faith Cromas, Kelly Ripa's stylist. She speaks to us about working with Martha Stewart Weddings, which helped her gain the knowledge to succeed in her job at Harpers Bazaar. Carrie says she has the job she always wanted, even as a small child, and couldn't be happier. Listen in as she gives us insight into weddings, styling, and why she is passionate about the notion of luxury being redefined. \xa0 Show Highlights: [02:07] Welcome to the show, Carrie! [03:05] Carrie tells us that in 4th grade she didn't go to school for a week because she felt she didn't have anything to wear. [04:25] She grew up in New York City and always had a hunger for fashion and art. [05:25] In high school, she did an internship at a fashion PR firm and stayed until after college. [06:03] She went to a call at ABC studio for Live with Regis and Kelly for a digital internship.\xa0 [07:35] Working on the Oscars with Faith Cromas, Kelly's stylist, she was able to learn evening gowns and evening wear. [09:00] Carrie says there is very little difference between doing weddings and doing things like the Oscars. [10:10] She believes that people are not really sentimental about weddings like they used to be. [11:03] The trend now is for couples to pay for their weddings instead of asking their parents. [11:43] What are some interesting statistics that you can share with us? [12:40] They developed a members club for their faithful readers in the form of a subscription. [14:20] Carrie tells us she is surprised that more women aren't planning their weddings on their phones. [15:10] She believes that women's personal styles are more layered than they ever realized. [17:14] Do you have any thoughts on something that might compete with Instagram? [19:03] Graduating their readers from honeymoon travel to regular travel is a way for them to keep their readers longer. [20:30] She feels very passionate about redefining what luxury is. Luxury is no longer a synonym for expensive. [23:47] Martha Stewart Weddings was a finishing school in styling for Carrie. Taking the red carpet style on people and putting it on the printed page was something she had never done. [26:15] Lighting is huge because it can invoke a feeling depending on what kind of lighting is used. [27:03] She has accumulated and publishes a list of the best planners, best florists, and best photographers. [29:13] She asks real brides who they could or couldn't use and why. She keeps them in mind to watch for her list. [31:10] How are you dealing with the immediacy of today's digital world and people's ability to instantly share content? [33:15] Fashion is the first thing that grabs her attention for the magazine, second is diversity in every way. [36:58] They discuss how ironic it is that weddings are circling back to the traditional style. [38:15] She has had speaking engagements about the notion of redefining luxury. She has also talked about ridding the industry of styled shoots in favor of working on real weddings. [39:30] What is something you haven't spoken about that you would like to in the future? [40:18] Where do you see yourself in three to five years? [42:58] She hopes that she handles the pressure of her position gracefully. [43:40] Have you thought about your own wedding? What would you do? \xa0 LINKS & RESOURCES Follow The Wedding Biz on Social:\xa0 The Wedding Biz The Wedding Biz on Instagram: @theweddingbiz The Wedding Biz on Facebook: @theweddingbiz \xa0 Title Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by Kushner Entertainment\xa0 www.KushnerEntertainment.com \xa0 Carrie Goldberg Carrie on Instagram: @harpersbazaarus or @carrielauren Email Carrie at: carrielgoldberg.com Harpers Bazaar  Harpers Bazaar Bride Membership \xa0 Mentioned during the interview: Faith Cromas Marth Stewart Weddings Rachel Zoe | Today on The Next Level, Andy Kushner is speaking with Lynn Easton, creator of Easton Destination Events, a worldwide luxury destination wedding design, and planning company. She is also the Co-Founder of Easton Porter Group, a luxury hospitality company with a portfolio of award-winning boutique hotels, vineyards, restaurants and event venues in North America and Europe. The discussion this week is on Marcy Blum, an internationally sought-after event planner, and entertainment expert. She has been named one of the best in the world by Vogue, Martha Stuart Weddings, Harper's Bazaar and the New York Times magazine.\xa0 Marcy has worked with celebrities including LeBron James, George and Tamika Soros, Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, to name a few. She has also appeared on television shows including Oprah, Live with Regis and Kelly and the Rachel Ray Show. Lynn speaks about how events need to evolve as they unfold. She also believes that every event should be customized for each client. Planners always need to up their game, plan more creative activities, and Marcy is the master at planning experiences. This is a conversation you won't want to miss.  Show Highlights:  [01:23] Welcome to the show Lynn, it's great to have you back! [03:30] Lynn chats about how she met Marcy on a panel at an Engage Summit. [05:20] They both agree with Marcy that using a pre-determined template for an event is not appropriate. [07:20] Every event should be customized for the client, and what the client wants. There should not be a set formula. [08:50] They discuss how Marcy is a master at planning experiences at her events. [09:55] Most weddings now are at least three or four days, and destination weddings can be five or more days. [12:36] Lynn chats about planning an event in a country she's never been to and how she finds the vendors she needs. [14:28] Where have you never been that you would love to do an event? [15:40] She agrees with Marcy that an event needs to unfold as it goes, there should be surprising moments. [18:10] Andy and Lynn agree that having a comedy type of event in the days before a wedding can relieve stress so that everyone warms up and has a great time. [19:22] Using place cards and seating guests around the tables, with intention, allows them to connect with other guests they may not know.  \xa0 Follow The Wedding Biz on Social:\xa0 The Wedding Biz The Wedding Biz on Instagram: @theweddingbiz The Wedding Biz on Facebook: @theweddingbiz \xa0 Title Sponsor: This episode is sponsored by PartySlate - the first website designed specifically for event professionals and venues! \xa0 Follow Marcy Blum Marcy Blum Marcy on Instagram: @marcyblum Marcy on Facebook: @marcyblumassociates Marcy on Twitter: @marcyblum Marcy on Pinterest: @marcyblum This Week's Guest Co-Host, Lynn Easton creator of Easton Destination Events Easton Events Lynn on Instagram: @eastonevents Lynn on Facebook: @eastonevents Lynn on Pinterest: @eastonevents Lynn on Twitter: @eastonevents Lynn's Episodes on The Wedding Biz: Part 1 https://theweddingbiz.com/lynn-easton/ Part 2 https://theweddingbiz.com/lynn-easton-2-2/\xa0 | Andy is very excited to welcome Marcy Blum, an internationally sought after event planner and entertaining expert who has 30 years experience. She has been named one of the best in the world by Vogue, Martha Stuart Weddings, Harper's Bazaar and the New York Times magazine. Marcy has appeared on many television shows and, with event planner Sarah Haywood, has developed EPIC, the Event Planners International Collaborative that offers an intensive and advanced wedding and event planning education. In this episode, Andy and Marcy discuss how she got started in the industry, when she started her own business and how scary it was to strike out on her own. She tells us about wanting her event designs to be different from everyone else and looking for clients who wanted the same thing. She also gives us insight into what the business looked like when she got started in the 80’s and how it has evolved today. Listen in as Marcy talks to us about some of the weddings she remembers, the way she structures the rates she charges for her services, her advice for people starting out in the industry today and about EPIC, the program she started with her friend Sarah Haywood. Marcy is a pioneer in the event industry and you won’t want to miss all of the knowledge she has to share about the industry. Show Highlights: [03:02] Welcome to the show Marcy! [04:30] Was there anything when she was growing up that was related to being in events? [05:20] She went to the CIA to be a chef but after graduating and working in restaurants decided that it wasn’t what she wanted to do, it was too repetitive, not creative enough for her. [06:20] She was planning parties at restaurants and some of the customers started asking her if she could plan events for them. [06:45] Was she scared when she started out on her own? [08:47] She said if she knew then what she knows now, about how difficult it is, she would never have started her business. Good thing she wasn’t aware of it at the time! [09:26] Is there a relationship between acting and event planning? [10:29] Back in 1986 how did people view her as a party planner? Did she try to do things differently than other party planners? [14:18] Did she have visions of how she wanted her events to be different? [16:35] She felt that everything was so canned and stiff back then, she wanted clients who wanted something different. [18:23] How did she balance the art with business decisions? Were they emotional decisions? [19:20] Marcy changed her business perspective by thinking more about the numbers instead of just the design. [20:18] She now spends more of her time on events that are profitable and points out we can’t stay around this long unless we seriously consider the financial end. [21:13] Her advice for someone just starting in the business is to get knowledgeable about what you are trying to do. [22:13] You can’t be successful without templates but you have to be able to customize them for each client. [22:48] She is all about the experiential approach to event planning, sell the sizzle not the steak. [24:45] Do you pay attention to the news on a daily basis? Does a possible recession scare you? [25:33] People, for the most part now, are more interested in what they are bringing to their friends and family than their own experience. [28:42] Is the demographic of the guests at a wedding important when planning the event? [29:35] Music should have a beginning, middle and end.\xa0 Hear Marcy’s favorite way of presenting music for ceremonies.\xa0 [33:58] Marcy said guests really appreciate place cards at events, it can give guests a different experience and they can meet people they wouldn’t normally have talked to. [34:57] Here her take on the best timeline for weddings. [35:53] Marcy talks about planning 3 or more day events before a wedding, starting with the rehearsal and lasting until after the wedding. [37:58] Marcy would love to take a lighting design course - the visual nature of it can take events to another level. [38:35] How involved is she in the lighting design of her events? [41:08] Is there a dream project she hasn’t yet been able to do? [43:53] Learn about Marcy’s pricing policy.\xa0 [45:37] EPIC is hands-on education for someone wanting to take a deep dive into event planning.\xa0 It is very intensive and lasts 3 to 4 days. [47:28] Within the next five years, Marcy would like to write a novel based around the event business. [48:21] What is her morning routine? [48:35] What is her work schedule like?\xa0\xa0 [49:25] How does Marcy define success at this point in her life?

[02:08] King encouraged his team members to bring their own voice and personality to productions. [03:00] They chat about how it takes a top leader to empower and inspire people and not tell them what to do, but rather to ask their input. [04:52] King said we are always reinventing ourselves on a personal level and your career is just an extension of that. [05:15] King left his career for two years, just walked away from everything. [05:50] Phil chose freedom as his ultimate value point so every decision he makes circles around that point. [06:40] Phil spends about 10 days a month just doing what he wants to enjoy life. [07:38] Andy talks about how he took five weeks off, spending it on an island, which cleared his head, and gave him perspective and inspiration to start this podcast. [08:01] King said he didn’t want to work 48 to 50 weeks a year so that he could only have a few weeks off...he wanted more time with his family. [09:55] Is Phil turning down work so that he can maintain his time off? [10:23] Phil has added photographers to his team so that he can delegate and maintain his way of life while earning what he needs. [13:05] King realized that in two to three years he would have to work again and realized he apply musical improvisation skills to his personal life. [14:20] Phil says that people who can improvise have a higher risk tolerance. [15:30] After 2 years King was asked to consult for MGM Resorts and other companies, which allowed him to work on his own schedule.\xa0\xa0 [17:05] Prioritizing means you can build your job around your life instead of the other way around.

King began in the event industry with  Cheryl Fish before starting his own company King Dahl event design, which he later sold. King is known for large dramatic productions and he became an inductee of the Event Solutions Magazine Hall of Fame. King left it all behind to design his dream life, taking time with his family and traveling but also to allow the young guns in the event industry to spread their wings and see what they could do. He now works when he wants, on the events he wants to design and produce, and works around his life instead of living around his work.

[04:05] King was born in Indiana and grew up in Coco Beach Florida, his father was the youngest bank president at the time. He saw the Apollo take off from his backyard. 05:32] He got his love of music from his father who was a very good trumpet player and played with some of the greats of the time. [07:43] King is a bass player which is why music played a big part in his event planning, it was where he got his creativity. [12:05] He got a job in his brother’s new company, an event planning company, building props where he met Cheryl Fish. [13:35] King gives us a rundown on the kinds of events they did those many years ago when this industry really got going. [17:28] He was given the opportunity to open his own company which he jumped on. [20:43] Cheryl offered him the position at the MGM to run the sales and creative division. [23:48] He surrounded himself with the best event designers in the industry and earned their trust and respect because he let them work creatively on their own. [26:43] King managed by breaking things down by team leaders and department heads. He then worked with them individually to make sure things were handled correctly. [28:53] You have to allow people on your team to spread their wings and take on responsibility, bringing in their own voices. [31:03] Have you ever reinvented yourself? Your business? Do you need to? [32:15] King handled events by understanding where the client is coming from and what the purpose of the event is. [35:15] He tells us a story of one of his favorite events for the Keep Memory Alive Foundation. [40:43] King left it all and moved with his wife to Washington State to slow down, relax and travel.

Over Sophia\'s delicious homemade spagbol and glass of red wine you\'re about to ears drop into a lovely social evening between myself and Sophia. It\'s not to be missed!Friend of the show and a previous guest in Episode 06 and 66, I bumped into Sophia at the judging day of the British Hairdressing Business Awards. Here she suggested turning the microphone round on to myself and have herself interviewing me about my hairdressing career, podcasting and an exclusive announcement I have on HairClubLive – something I\'m incredibly honoured to share with you all for the first time today.In the company of one of the most respected industry figures in the world and a Verified name on Instagram, I sat down to dinner with Sophia in her home to answer her brilliant questions. Asking me on why I set out on my journey in podcasting and the dreams I have for the show, this conversation with Sophia is to reveal so much about me, my hairdressing career and why I love bringing you all the \'How To Cut It\' podcast show. But like all great hosts, Sophia was also out for an industry scoop, and you know what, she got one!!Curious to know what this is, then you\'ll need to keep tuned in. Sophia\'s exquisite interviewing techniques got so much out of me that evening. This episode is not only a great insight into the podcast and myself, but for all you Sophia super-fans to hear her in a rare moment where she\'s away from work and at home socialising.It was a wonderful evening spent with Sophia. I\'d like to take this moment to say thank you for Sophia inviting me into her home and taking the time to interview myself!

Goodbye | The hairdressing industry is currently facing it\'s biggest challenge: a global shortage of apprentices. A major challenge for every salon, big and small, Piloroo.com is an online platform that has created an innovative solution to help finding a way to solving this challenge by placing assistants into salons. To tell us more about how this exciting concept works is it\'s co-founder and good friend of mine, Clive Allwright.Being at the forefront of hairdressing for over 30 years, Clive has played an instrumental part in my early hairdressing career. In the late 80\'s I had the pleasure to not only work alongside Clive, but be trained by him, too. Fast track forward to 2019 and our paths have reconnected us again. Learning of the piloroom.com, I was excited to hear that Clive was part of this platform where salons can now book assistants online.In late 2016 Clive Allwright and Kelly Grant co-founded piloroo.com. Proving itself as the ultimate online booking platform that enables salons to book assistants and educators on demand. Just like booking an Uber / hotel / airline ticket online, Piloroo.com was born out of understanding and identifying many of the challenges of operating hairdressing salons in Australia. Salons across Ausrtralia are now booking assistant’s online using piloroo.com.Assisting salons with an extra pair of hands that helps salons increase their productivity and profitability, I love how piloroo.com is connecting salons with assistants at times when needed. With Piloroo.com looking to expand into other national and international markets in the near future, I believe we are witnessing the start of a game changing approach to finding assistants and educators for salons globally.

Goodbye | The hair industry has changed so quickly in ways never witnessed before! So what does this mean to be a young hairdresser who\'s part of this new hairdressing landscape in 2019? At 21 years of age, todays guest Lizzie Williams represents the new heartbeat of young hairdressers. With social media and digital platforms in the palm of their hands no matter where they go, it\'s well documented how this has played a major part in the way they operate. Let\'s find out how!Following on from last weeks episode with Sean Dawson, we\'ll be keeping on theme by discussing young hairdressers. Regularly coming out in many episodes is that we need to keep young hairdressers engaged. So when all asked "How?", they nearly all reply with education and competitions. Well\xa0this is exactly what Lizzie suggests too when advising her fellow peers. Little wonder when you look at how Lizzie\'s career is excelling so quickly.A senior stylist at KH Hair Salons in Hinkley, Lizzie defines all what it is means to be an engaged young hairdresser and the rewards that this can bring. Part of the Wella Generation Now team 18/19, Lizzie was shortlisted as a \'Rising Star\' 2019 finalist at Creative Head\'s Most Wanted/It awards. But be aware that this podcast comes with a public warning that contains words that may offend some; hard work, continual development and commitment!If you want to get into the mindset of what it means to be a young hairdresser in 2019, then you won\'t be disappointed with today\'s episode. There\'s bucket loads of this from a well balanced young hairdresser who\'s going places. And if you\'re a young hairdresser yourself, then take on board what Lizzie shares – she a voice of wise words way above her tender years.\xa0Now time to get to it by hitting that play button!Thanks for ListeningTo share your thoughts:Leave a note in the comment section below.Ask a question by emailing me HEREShare this show on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.To help out the show:Leave an honest review on iTunes.

Goodbye | You\'ve heard it all before. Young hairdressers, they\'re not passionate! They can\'t be bothered! They don\'t work the hours we used too! Maybe you agree with these statements, but it so happens that todays guest certainly doesn\'t. Joining me to discuss this contentious topic is one of our most respected British hairdressers, Sean Dawson. Today we\'ll be learning from Sean on why he believes we need to give\xa0young hairdressers a break!I have long admired Sean Dawson. Continually producing stunning hair work over the last 3 decades, I also love how he never shy\'s away from being open and honest in discussing and debating controversial topics. Most certainly young people and how they want to do things different to the generation before it never fails to deliver some heated conversations.Having worked within the hairdressing industry for over 33 years, Sean is a multi-award winning session stylist and educator. With a true passion for educating, he has nurtured and developed many young people to go on to become great hairdressers themselves. This has led him to see that young people are willing to work hard and are committed to what they do – if we get them engaged and inspired. Moaning how they can\'t be bothered is simply not good enough or acceptable! As Sean says: "It\'s our responsibility and duty to develop young people!".Having the same old approach to how we used to work for young hairdressers is outdated thinking. Instead you need to individually tap into what motivates them and then tailor a dynamic plan to fuel their ambitions. Sean has some great ideas to this, along with a new approach to apprenticeships. All of this and more in today\'s podcast, so be sure to listen in.\xa0Thanks for ListeningTo share your thoughts:Leave a note in the comment section below.Ask a question by emailing me HEREShare this show on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.To help out the show:Leave an honest review on iTunes.

With this pressure he ended up having a total breakdown in October 2013 and a suicide attempt, when it appeared that he had lost both his business and young family.Hitting rock bottom was the turning point for Niall to rebuild his life. With Six years of sobriety later and with his partner of ten years, Melie, by his side and his two young sons, they have gone from strength to strength.Niall is a truly inspirational being. Listen in to hear his words on recovery from the depths of being rock bottom, and how he\'s rebuilt both his life and thriving salon business out of a hard working ethic and huge passion for hair.

Goodbye. | These days the popularity of being a mens hairdresser is huge.\xa0There are fewer industries in the UK that have grown to the same extent as barbering.\xa0This means you\'ve to be seriously talented and equipped with all the right technical skills in mens hair fashion work to rise above the competition in this barber explosion era. That\'s why I\'m excited to have on the show today leading mens hair specialist, Charlie Cullen, to share his invaluable advice on how you can smash it in mens hair fashion work.With no signs of the male grooming market slowing down, there is a cultural shift beginning to take place in mens hair. Fashion guys are beginning to outgrow their hair again and they will be expecting us all to deliver them the looks they desire. For the bloodline of the barbering industry to stay cool and relevant to these fashionistas, it\'s critical that it adapts to their demands. We are going to learn on how to do all of this from Charlie, so that we are all technically prepared for this trend shift in mens hair that is evolving fast. If not, we could get left behind!We are spoilt in having on the podcast someone of Charlie\'s standing within the industry. A\xa0men’s hair specialist and International Educator who is famed for his longer hair work. As the former International Artistic Director and Head of Mens Education for Toni &\xa0Guy,\xa0he has worked backstage at various Fashion Weeks for the last 12 seasons – regularly heading up teams at London Fashion Week Mens – you get the sense of standing Charlie has in mens hair fashion work.One of the big takeaways from Charlie today is no matter what direction mens hair fashions takes, you will need to be competent in all forms of mens hair cutting and styling. \xa0From messy or military, to cuts that favour texture and grunge-style long hair, the barber landscape is changing. Now tune in and get buzzed on getting ahead in mens hair fashion work.

At worst we may even be loosing some of our most loyal customers to rival businesses who do offer hair extensions as part of their hairdressing services.For some the image of doing hair extensions can seem daunting. Long service hours, choosing the right method of application, extensions damaging the hair, extensions falling out. Fear no more, because I\'m joined by one of the most influential hair extensionists in the world, Michelle Griffin of Griffins Salons. Today she\'ll be debunking all the myths, latest techniques and benefits to what you really need to know when it comes to offering quality hair extensions as part of your hairdressing services.Michelle has trained and worked with hairpieces and wigs from the age of 16 years. After 30 years of working with added hair and running a salon,\xa0Michelle has now developed her own line of luxury hair extensions called LoxBox. LoxBox provides all methods of hair extensions, coupled with training courses, which are taught throughout the UK and Internationally.Renowned for her passion and enthusiasm towards hair extensions, you\'ll be confident to know that you\'re going to be getting an audio masterclass on hair extensions from this multi-award winning hairdresser. You\'ll learn everything you need to know on hair extensions from selecting the right method of application, how to book the correct appointment time, and a complete step by step guide to getting you set up in using hair extensions.This episode is great if you\'ve been sitting on the fence to whether or not you should be offering hair extensions as part of your business. I\'m confident that after listening in to this brilliant conversation with Michelle you\'ll be chomping at the bit to get going and maybe one day, becoming a hair extensions expert yourself. Now all you need to get going with your journey in hair extensions is hit that play button.

Sam’s brand, Manhattan Knights, was born when he started refashioning vintage tee shirts for himself and his friends in middle school.\xa0 \xa0 Sam got his brand where it is today by starting small, leveraging the ability to sell his work on consignment, and knocking on a LOT of doors. In the interview he shares details on everything he did in the first few years of launching a fashion brand.\xa0 In the interview (which you’ll love), we will cover:  How Sam transitioned from making shirts for his friends to selling to the public Why his brand was a little too niche, and what he did about it How he self-funded the early days of his brand The hugely valuable job that most people underestimate How he chose the first factory that produced his designs The little ways he made his pieces feel more upscale How working with a showroom helped evolve his brand Why he let go of one of the core tenets of his original brand The pros and cons of selling on consignment as a new designer The CRAZY way he got the word out about his brand And more!  It started with tee shirts Despite a lifelong interest in fashion, Sam Murkoff didn’t intend to become a fashion designer. In his early teens, he cut up and reassembled garments, infusing his own unique style into clothes for himself and his friends. When he got to college, he majored in theater and began working in luxury retail. Aside from a little screenprinting, design wasn’t really on his mind. But when he realized he needed a creative outlet, he started making shirts again. That’s when Manhattan Knights really began. NYC Streetwear\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sam quickly discovered that there was more interest in the clothes he was creating than just his inner circle. When the screen printer he’d been using encouraged him to get his work out there, he started offering his designs on consignment at small boutiques.\xa0 \xa0 This first line of streetwear, which played on his private school experience and satirized some major brands, came to be known as Cease & Desist. It appealed to a niche New York audience that grew his confidence and convinced him to make a real go at launching a brand. Bold Moves Since that first success, Sam has faced a steep learning curve. He’s continued to sell his work on consignment, worked with a showroom, and changed his production methods repeatedly. He’s now designing clothing that takes the sardonic humor of his early designs to a cut-and-sew line that transcends season and defies description. He’s had to pivot over and over in the process of creating a fashion brand that can actually sell. He also made one of the boldest moves we’ve heard of to publicize his fledgeling label!\xa0 Through it all, Sam has kept his eye on the goal of taking his bold inspiration and irreverent sartorial attitude to a wider market, without losing the essence of where Manhattan Knights began. \xa0 Resources & People Mentioned  Manhattan Knights on Instagram Sam Murkoff on Instagram Shop Manhattan Knights  Enjoy the show?

And when you don’t have big investors and influential connections, it can seem impossible. But these three young entrepreneurs found a way to beat the odds and make their brand a reality.\xa0 \xa0 Meet Salvatore Graci, Angelo Acquista, and Luca Graci, founders of luxury streetwear brand CSNV (Casanova). Their passion and seemingly endless determination helped them take CSNV from just an idea to the runway at LA Fashion Week and beyond. \xa0 It sounds like a fairytale, but it wasn’t an easy journey. They share their highs, their lows, and the many lessons they learned along the way! \xa0 In the interview (which you’ll love), we will cover:  The first steps Salvo, Angelo, and Luca took when they decided to launch a brand How they made cold emailing work for them The personality traits that helped make them successful What moves helped them grow their brand’s exposure--and what fell flat! How they went about finding factories that could produce their designs (when searching on the internet got them nowhere!) The marketing campaign that failed, and how they regained their footing Why they turned down a huge investor How they got ready for LA Fashion Week When they quit their day jobs And more!  \xa0 “WHY NOT?” Luca, Angelo, and Salvatore were all less than 24 years old when they decided to turn their passion for elevated, Italian-inspired streetwear into a label of their own.\xa0 \xa0 It started with a phone call. Salvatore and Angelo had joked about starting a fashion line since high school, but a few years later, Salvo called Angelo and told him they should really do it.\xa0 \xa0 Angelo’s response? “Why not?” They had no experience and no real connections in the industry when they started. Yet in less than two years they went from cold-emailing influencers from Instagram, to being invited to LA Fashion Week.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 IT WASN’T ALWAYS EASY\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The road wasn’t without its obstacles. The guys recall starting out with optimism and enthusiasm, but they had plenty of setbacks. They sent hundreds of emails that never got a response. They made trip after trip to Italy to search for factories and suppliers, spending their savings and coming back exhausted, with nothing to show for it.\xa0 \xa0 “We’d come back from a trip and feel like we\'re still at zero. We\'re like, what? We just spent so much money, we spent so much time and effort... and yet we\'re still at zero. So what do we do?” \xa0 What they did was keep on going. Although they all had times where they wanted to give up, eventually they found their footing, and gained the traction they needed to turn Casanova into a successful brand.\xa0 DISCOVERING WHAT’S NEXT\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The guys and their brand are still evolving. Since recording the episode, they’ve rebranded again, and they’re still working on new pieces and new ways of getting their designs seen all over the world. One thing’s for sure: from “No way,” to the jetway, to the runway, these three were relentless in pursuing their dream. And it’s just the beginning.\xa0 \xa0 Resources & People Mentioned  CSNVstudio.com CSNV on Instagram  Enjoy the show? Help us out by:  Rating us on iTunes – it really helps!

In such a competitive industry, it can feel like an uphill battle to even get noticed by fashion hiring managers among stiff competition.\xa0 \xa0 On this episode, we talk to London designer Barbara Houghton. With over 15 years of experience in the fashion industry, Barbara has been on both ends of the hiring process, and she wants to share what she’s learned about standing out in fashion and always getting the job! In the interview (which you’ll love), we will cover:  Important things to look for when choosing a fashion school--because not all programs do this! The downside to working for high-end brands early in your career What Barbara did before the interview for her first job to give herself an edge (it’s something you should definitely be doing, too!) How Barbara survived her first job in London, and the realities of starting your fashion career in a major city\xa0 The super creative way Barbara scored her next job as a fashion designer Her experience in a super creative role… and why she decided to leave it How she transitioned to working for a brand she really loves As a hiring manager, the top things she looks for when interviewing potential hires And more!  EVOLVING SUCCESS From landing her first job in the fashion industry before she even finished fashion school, to working as a senior designer for a major supplier, UK fashion designer Barbara Houghton knows what it takes to get noticed by employers in the fashion industry. Over the course of her career, Barbara has gone from an assistant job she compares to The Devil Wears Prada to leading a division for one of the biggest suppliers of UK highstreet fashion.\xa0 \xa0 Through creativity and an intelligent and intentional approach to the job market, Barbara has been able to consistently move forward in her career. She has managed to always land that next great opportunity as her goals and desires have evolved. \xa0 BREAKING IN\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Barbara still recalls feeling lucky to have found a job in fashion starting right after graduation (and she tells us how she did it!).\xa0 Barbara didn’t have the advantage of her family paying for her education. So when she graduated from fashion school, she had to begin repaying her loans while surviving in London on a shoestring salary.\xa0 \xa0 That first job was incredibly demanding, with long hours and little reward. But putting in her time and giving 100% to that entry level position was worth it--when she was ready to move on, she was told she was very employable, because she “had worked in one of the hardest places there is to work.”\xa0 \xa0 MAKING OPPORTUNITIES COUNT Barbara happily moved on to bigger and better things, from creating collections start to finish for a highstreet boutique, to spotting trends for Miss Selfridge. She traveled the world as a freelance fashion designer for brands like New Look, Tesco, and Joy, before moving on to building and running a successful department for a major highstreet supplier.\xa0 \xa0 Barbara’s hard work and creative moves have taken her far in her fashion career. With a little determination and Barbara’s smart approach to job success, you too can stand out, upgrade your fashion career, and score the opportunity you’ve been dreaming of! \xa0 Resources & People Mentioned  Barbara’s Instagram  University of Central Lancashire WGSN  Enjoy the show?

This episode, which originally aired November 26, 2018, was nominated as one listeners loved! Being a lingerie designer is its own unique and interesting niche of working in the fashion industry. There are tons of different things you have to think about compared to designing, let’s say, shirts or jackets. But it’s a pretty cool job! Laurie Van Jonsson knows this firsthand. From launching her own lingerie brand that was sold in TopShop to working for other companies, she knows the ins and outs of being a lingerie designer. Her 15 years of experience make her an expert in this category, and in this interview, she shares it all. From how she broke into the lingerie industry, how she sold her designs to global retailers, and how she ultimately became a freelance lingerie designer. In the interview (which you’ll love) we cover:  Designing within constraints and restrictions in the lingerie design industry (that’s how she found her niche!) The mistakes (many people make) of trying to cater to too many markets Working with large manufacturers as a lingerie designer Having the passion and belief in your product to sew it all yourself (by hand!) How to be the lingerie designer that stands out with major retail buyers (being “pest-like” was described as a positive trait here!) How Laurie started blogging, grew her business, wrote and published a book, and managed the supply and demand for niche lingerie sizes. How Laurie’s freelance work built off of the momentum of her other projects The mistakes people make when starting their own fashion brand Advice on the best way to start strong, save time, and save money Working with people as a freelancer in the lingerie fashion industry Setting clear expectations and scope with freelance clients How Laurie built a foundation of inbound referrals that led to projects The challenges of working with people across the globe And so much more!\xa0\xa0  Freelance Designer with Lingerie Leanings Laurie van Johnson, a lingerie designer who started out in the industry back in 2003, first worked as a lingerie designer for brands, but quickly built her own brand of full cup, small back bras that she\'s sold throughout the world, including TopShop. Laurie now works as a freelance fashion designer working with other startup brands to help them launch labels and get patterns, grading, and tech packs all in order so that their bras and lingerie fit perfectly.

This episode, which originally aired January 7, 2019, was nominated as one listeners loved.  There are a lot of different paths to becoming a freelance fashion designer. And Heather Royer took one I’d never heard of before. Instead of working directly with brands, she got her first freelance opportunity designing for a factory in China. The best part? There are ways you can create the same freelance opportunities for yourself, and she shares step by step her best advice to do this. In her 20+ years in the industry, Heather has worked for brands like Target, LL Bean, REI and Talbots. She now runs a team of 9 full time fashion designers located around the world while working remote from her home in south Florida. And it all started with one freelance gig from LinkedIn. In the interview (which you’ll love) we will cover:  The simple change you can make to your LinkedIn profile to attract brands or factories looking for freelancers How to turn one freelance project into many to get more work and make more money What brands are looking for when interviewing and hiring freelance fashion designers How to give your opinion and feedback about design without sounding pushy or negative Why staying in touch with past coworkers and industry friends can make or break your success (even if you’re uncomfortable “networking”) What Heather’s transition from working as an employee to working freelance looked like and how you can do the same What Heather learned at her first (big!) freelance project for a Chinese company How she made the decision to start hiring designers to help her The skills Heather looks for in her own freelance candidates-for-hire How Heather runs her freelance business and the freelancers that work for her  FROM 4H TO FASHION Heather Royer has created a job for herself that is unlike anything we’ve heard of before here at Successful Fashion Designer. But like most fashion designers, fashion was just a hobby in her early life. But she\xa0did\xa0get an early start! Heather was in 4H when she was little (the kids club that does hands-on projects surrounding health, science, and agriculture), and loved the sewing aspect of the group. She started making clothing when she was 7 years old! We’d say “the rest is history,” but we’d be leaving\xa0a lot\xa0out (like when she worked for the park service in Alaska building hiking trails–how cool is that??). Knowing she always had a passion for working in the fashion industry, she took fashion classes on the side, and then made the commitment to going to Rhode Island School of Design. She started designing kids’ outdoor clothes (talk about blending her loves), and then got a great first job as “just” an assistant–but she loved it! It was “the bottom of the barrel,” but she got\xa0great\xa0exposure to the industry that way. THEN CAME THE FREELANCING Heather’s freelancing career came about as more of a necessity–she wanted to move to Florida, but knew there weren’t going to be a lot of jobs in the fashion industry. So she took her fate into her own hands: she started working on her portfolio, working on her own projects, and branching out. She started her own jewelry line, and got a taste of business for herself. When one of her contacts on LinkedIn reached out to her about an opportunity, she was ready. This is where her career path delved into the unknown. Much like her work for the park service, Heather made her own…\xa0fashion-hiking-trail, if you will. What started as a simple proposal for a factory in China for men’s cold weather goods turned into a\xa0huge\xa0project and eventually a team of 9 full-time designers working for her. How? Partly the usual way: she gave it her all. She worked long long (long) hours, did tight turns, bent over backwards. But she also vocalized her ideas, drew on her previous experience, and eventually started outsourcing her workload to other freelancers, as well. Freelancing begets more freelancing! As much as she cringed at “networking,” she made it work with her friends and contacts. SUCCESSFUL (FREELANCE) FASHION DESIGNER Now that she’s the Vice President of Design and Operations for Weihai Luda Company, Heather is still looking forward. She has plans to build a private label, her own brands, and chooses to think of her company as an investment portfolio that she diversifies and keeps flexible. Heather’s rich experience building her own business has led to enormous insight into the life of a successful freelance fashion designer, and her advice is applicable to almost any fashion designer. She’s learned how to delegate, how to build a team, how to outline tangible results, and how to make sure things are getting done, all while acknowledging that the fashion industry is “not always glamorous. If you can see the humor in that, it’ll go a lot farther.” We loved hearing Heather’s inspirational story–you really can create the job you want!

Shellie and her team at Atrium are creating a more personable relationship between top talent candidates and recruiters. She shares her 4 best practices for aspiring fashion professionals, and her insights will surely make your job search process easier and more enjoyable.\xa0She also explains the common freelance/employee dilemma, how to get started with a talent recruiter, and the one area that should NOT be the biggest highlight in post-internship interviews. Shellie shares this advice in a transparent and honest way that you don’t want to miss. \xa0 Shellie’s best advice for presenting your portfolio in an effective way A fashion professional’s most effective tool is their portfolio\xa0– a creative display of your most effective ideas and a showcase of your design process. Shellie explains that interviewers want to see your work in Adobe Creative Suite programs and how you complete your design process.\xa0It’s also critical to demonstrate through your portfolio where you draw your inspiration from. Regarding the size of your portfolio, you can highlight your capabilities without overwhelming your interviewer. Including every project since your fashion school days may not be necessary –\xa0ensure you tailor your portfolio specifically for every company.\xa0Hear the full details on why portfolios can be your biggest asset when completed well by listening to this episode.\xa0 \xa0 Resumes receive 6 seconds worth of attention – make yours stand out! Resumes go through trends, just as every other segment in the fashion industry. The current best practice is to keep it simple! Shellie explains that\xa0many interviewers favor easy to scan, bullet-point format resumes.\xa0Results-driven resume language can also set you apart from the competition.\xa0Go beyond just a list of tasks that you performed!\xa0Be sure to explain if one of your designs became a best-seller, or if you increased revenue by a certain percentage. Shellie also explains the importance of letting your recruiter and/or interviewer know about any gaps in employment that may be on your resume. It will come up in conversation, and it’s important to explain why the gap is present and what you were working on during that time period.\xa0Remember, the average interviewer only spends 6 seconds per resume, so yours needs to highlight your best achievements in a succinct, engaging way. \xa0 Perfect these interviewing skills and land your dream job! After you’ve worked with a recruiter, fine-tuned your resume, and perfected your portfolio the final step is to interview in-person with an employer. If you chose to work with a recruiter, they will help prepare you for the interview because they know the client. It’s essential to research the company and know their product well before walking through the door. You should also study your own resume ahead of time.\xa0Develop ways to explain your resume in an engaging, storytelling manner.\xa0Consider bringing printed tech packs, swatches, knits, or other physical items to supplement your portfolio and resume.\xa0Shellie explains, “Whatever physical items you decide to bring, they should show how you’re always drawing inspiration from the world around you.” Keeping everything organizing, being authentic and relatable, and asking questions are sure to allow you the greatest chances of success in your in-person interviews.\xa0For more tips, don’t miss this episode. \xa0 This one step is key for success in your post-graduation fashion job search The most important takeaway from this episode of The Successful Fashion Designer is the importance of internships. Shellie says that “They’re so key to getting a position in the industry, and they’ll help elevate you moving forward.”\xa0Internships completed while in school and post-graduation will allow you to build your network and work on “real world” projects. Even if they are unpaid opportunities, don’t immediately shy away from them. The academic credit and resume-building experience alone will put you light years ahead of students who have fewer internships under their belt. The sweat equity will be worth it, we promise.

The long days, late nights, and cutthroat competition can make balancing a fashion career and motherhood seem impossible. \xa0 But the reality is that women everywhere are finding ways to make it work. While there’s no magic answer for every situation, there are many ways to balance a career in fashion with being a mom. \xa0 In today’s episode, you’ll hear from Karrie Foley. Karrie has a successful career as a freelance fashion designer, and has done it all while raising four young children. She’s here to share some of her secrets for success! \xa0 In the interview (which you’ll love), we will cover:  How Karrie got started working in the fashion industry Why a “top” fashion design school isn’t always the best option How Karrie managed to grow her career without living in New York or LA How she kept working after the birth of her first child What she did to get back into the fashion industry after taking three years off! How she jumped across fashion design categories and avoided getting pigeonholed What Karrie believes have been the keys to her continued success (Hint: You can do this too!) How she landed a great job right out of college Why it’s worth it to be kind in an unkind industry How Karrie is balancing her fashion design career with motherhood today And more!  \xa0 STARTING RIGHT From a young age, Karrie Foley knew she wanted to work in the fashion industry. Like many young aspiring designers, she dreamed of attending Parsons or FIT. But when the time came for college, her parents encouraged her to stay open to other options. Karrie ultimately settled on the University of Cincinnati, and that decision would have a profound effect on the direction of her fashion career. \xa0 When she graduated, Karrie was able to turn an internship with Limited Too into a full-time job. From there, she went on to work for other big brands, including Disney Stores and Lane Bryant. LIFE HAPPENS \xa0\xa0\xa0 When Karrie became pregnant with her first child, she knew things would have to change. As a full-time fashion designer, she’d been working long hours that she knew she couldn’t sustain once her baby was born. She originally planned to resign. But her hard work, and her great relationship with her boss, lead to a rare part-time position. That gave her the opportunity to work in the fashion industry while raising her first and second children. \xa0 \xa0 Karrie did eventually take time off when she had twins. But when she was ready, she managed to jump back into the industry--with multiple offers! \xa0 BALANCING ACT Today, Karrie works full-time hours as a freelance designer for Thirty-One Gifts. She puts a lot into her job, and still makes time to be there with her kids. While she doesn’t have a perfect life, Karrie shows us that it’s really possible to balance motherhood with a successful career in fashion. \xa0 Resources & People Mentioned  Karrie’s Instagram Karrie on LinkedIn Karrie’s Facebook University of Cincinnati DAAP School of Design Thirty-One Gifts  Enjoy the show?

Nine years ago, he co-founded The Armoury, a menswear emporium with shops in New York and Hong Kong that is now a mythic destination for admirers of timeless men’s clothing. Known for its faultless service, dependable buy and meticulous approach to product development, The Armoury has become the benchmark for all other menswear retailers to aspire to.In this episode, Mark talks Aleks through some of the things that he feels sets The Armoury apart today, and some of the things he’s learned while building the business over the last decade. We also explore Mark’s passion for technology, fine watches and get his take on how to grow a luxury brand sustainably.

Instead, he embarked on a successful career as an investment banker, but all the while an idea was slowly forming in his mind.Looking for a change of scene, he left the corporate world in 2013 to create an online store where other men like him could come to access tailored clothes made by artisans, at a time when, pre-Mr Porter, there were almost no options to pick up classic menswear outside of eBay.Skip forward to 2019, and No Man Walks Alone has established itself as one of the most respected online retailers in our space. In this episode, Greg talks to Aleks about what drove him to make the switch into menswear retail, and why he felt the time was right to launch a digital platform when online menswear retail was in its infancy. We also hear Greg’s take on the industry today, unpick the problems of “sprezzatura”, and get his tips on dressing well in a conservative business environment.***This episode of HandCut Radio is sponsored by Floris.

In 2005, he quit a career in engineering, remortgaged his house and sold his car to buy Norton & Sons, a failing Savile Row tailoring house.

That was in 2012, and since then, Alice has turned Alice Made This into one of independent menswear’s coolest accessory brands, stocked at Mr Porter, Liberty and The Conran Shop.

Dag Granath and Saman Amel met as toddlers, and have been friends (and latterly business partners) ever since.Atelier Saman Amel is now nine-years-old, and during that time the pair have worked tirelessly to create a dynamic menswear brand with clothes that are neither formal, nor casual, but for those ‘in-between’ moments in a man’s life. They create clothes that make flawless use of texture and a tonal colour palette, inspired by art, architecture and interior design. Building a brand has been a real adventure for this pair, and to have the chance to hear their story gave all of us at HandCut Radio real pleasure.

She was fixed on that course, studying to become a tax attorney, and was, in her words, \'super square - I was a super student.\'The death of her beloved grandmother changed that: \'I always wanted to be an actor, but I was too afraid. Everyone [in LA] was an actor slash model slash singer and I thought "I can do better than that, I\'m good at school, I can do something with myself, by golly."\'When I was studying abroad in Paris, my grandma has just passed away and it was very weird being in her city without her. I remember walking the streets of Paris, and there was this weird thing that happened where I thought \'wow, she\'d be so sad that I was so afraid of my dreams that before I even begun, I stopped. She\'d be the one person in my corner really pushing me to go for my dreams and here I was so afraid of them that I wasn\'t even going to try. And I felt this overwhelming sense of regret and disappointment, and at that moment, I just decided I was going to try.\'After landing a job fairly quickly in Days of Our Lives and then going on to work steadily as an actress in LA, Ayda met British singer Robbie Williams and decamped to the UK to be with him.Today, Ayda primarily lives in the UK with Robbie and their three children, a family set up she talks about in today\'s episode as being her biggest triumph: \'I never thought I was going to have this amazing life where I got to be in love and be a mummy. There were definitely times and horrid relationships where I thought I\'d be alone.\'We discuss all the above, including the products Ayda loves, how she looks after her physical and mental health, and how the passage of time - and having those children - has affected her perspective.Ayda Mentions:YSL Paree Scent, Kevyn Aucoin Face Forward book, Stila Lip Glaze, Lancome Juicy Tubes, MAC Lip Glass, MAC Spice lip liner, Omorovicza Blue Diamond Super Cream, Omorovicza Thermal Cleansing Balm, B683 Marc Antoine Barrois Cologne, Le Labo Santal 33, Rose 31, and AnOther 13, Dr Sebagh Rose Serum, Charlotte Tilbury nude lipstick, John Masters Organics, STRIIIKE in LA, Cowshed massages, Sarah Chapman\'s facial, Josh Wood for hair colour, Perfect 10 for waxes and tan by Fake Bake or Sienna XBeauty Full Lives is hosted by\xa0Madeleine Spencer, produced by\xa0Charlie Jones, and with artwork by\xa0Sung Lee.

As a result suicide rates in many countries - particularly amongst young men - are higher than ever. \xa0 On todays Podcast I speak with Australian hairdresser Stevie English, who is creating an online hairdressing education platform with the aim of raising ‘awareness and support’ for the issues surrounding mental health and suicide prevention. \xa0 Regardless of where you are in the world this is well worth listening to. | My guest today is Geno Stampora a hairdresser, author, speaker, business guru, consultant, entertainer and general all-round industry expert and nice guy.

But can you really lose excess fat and inches from a sweat-free session? Dr. Jennifer MacGregor, a leading\xa0researcher in dermatology, talks about what we can REALLY expect from these non-surgical procedures, and who the best candidates are.\xa0 She also explains the various\xa0non-invasive options for excess fat removal, including: Radio Frequency, Cryo-based devices like CoolSculpting, Low level laser therapy and Ultrasound. | Close to 80 million men and women suffer from hereditary hair loss. For many years, the only treatment options supported by research were Minoxidil and Propecia. More recent research is showing that Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is also successful at stimulating hair growth. Studies prove that PRP stimulates a faster transition to the anagen phase of hair cycling back from the resting and transitional phases, as well as an increase in the number and thickness of newly formed follicles.Our guest, Dr. Jennifer Chwalek, researched hair loss at the University of California, San Francisco. Since entering private practice, she has helped thousands of patients of all ages and genders who struggle with hair loss and thinning. She weighs in on some of the treatments available to stimulate follicular hair growth, and debunks some common hair-growth myths.To hear one woman\'s experience with PRP and hair growth, don\'t miss our episode on Dealing with Hair Loss: From Shame to Finding a Solution. | We\'ve all done a deep-dive into the annals of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter...the list goes on and admit it: you\'ve been down that rabbit hole, too! But aside from making sure your ex\'s current is a total meh, can social media be used for healthy research?\xa0 Our guest, Dr. Maryam Nazemzadeh, explains why checking out a potential doctor on social media, might be good for both you AND them.\xa0 | We get it: too much fun in the sun this summer, and now your hair, skin and nails are fried. Don\'t worry, all is not lost. Amber and Ryan will cover the best ways to repair your hair, skin and nails.\xa0 They\'ll share some of their favorite products, and go over the treatments to start now, and the ones you absolutely need to wait to begin. | If you\'re starting to see your cheeks go south, it may be time to consider a chin implant.\xa0 No longer just for Jay Leno wannabes, a chin implant can work to restore facial structure and make you appear more youthful and firm.\xa0 We talk to Dr. Yael Halaas about this minimally invasive procedure that provides instant results...and P.S. Ryan is already signed up. | p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px \'Helvetica Neue\'}Like many pregnant women, Kelsey Bolar experienced almost crippling morning sickness. But unlike many moms-to-be, when she was feeling her worst she had to look her best. The on-air Fox News correspondent and certified yoga instructor shares her favorite hair and skin products, the mom-friendly brands she swears by, and secrets to looking camera-ready while expecting. She also reveals the single piece of career advice that helped her push through the worst of her morning sickness. Ryan helps to debunk some of the mommy-myths when it comes to coloring your hair – whether you’re pregnant or doing fertility treatments, | It\'s no secret that the key to looking younger is to appear well-rested. We sit down with one of the best and brightest oculo-facial and reconstructive surgeons in the country to talk about what you need to know before getting filler under the eyes. Dr. Maryam\xa0Nazemzadeh of Sanctuary Cosmetic Center,\xa0talks about which common filler areas can cause blindness (it\'s not the tear trough but it is somewhere you wouldn\'t expect), and takes us through exactly what happens in this non-surgical procedure. This is a must-listen for anyone who wants to tackle dark circles and under-eye bags. | If you\'ve ever thought about giving up your monthly in-office facial to buy a trendy at-home device (laser, pen or other such thing) you NEED to hear this before spending your money.\xa0Raechel\xa0Lowe, a licensed aesthetician, clinical educator and laser specialist, on the efficacy of at-home lasers, microneedling devices and hair removal tools, and what you absolutely need to do in order to operate these in a safe manner.\xa0 | Here\'s a little secret: if you\'ve ever iced a pulled muscle, you\'ve already done cryotherapy, which literally means\xa0“cold therapy." Put simply, cryotherapy is a technique where the body is exposed to extremely cold temperatures for several minutes. The treatment can be delivered to just one area (localized), or you can opt for whole-body cryotherapy. Similar to the ice bath that professional athletes utilize after an extreme workout, cryotherapy reduces inflammation, resulting in quicker muscle recovery and decreased muscle soreness.\xa0It can also offer relief for people suffering from chronic pain, inflammation-related diseases and skin disorders like fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and eczema and has been used to promote quicker healing post injury or surgery.\xa0Recently, cryotherapy has been popularized by athletes and fitness enthusiasts, the stressed-out and overworked, those looking to get their bodies back on track from injury and chronic pain, and those seeking general health and wellness. Amber and Ryan hit Capital Cryo to see if this extreme cold could cure Amber\'s summer sickness, and to talk to a cryo therapist about what to expect from your first cryo session. | If you\'ve been looking for a way to instantly reveal smoother, brighter, celeb-worthy skin, it\'s time to try dermaplaning. This procedure is an exfoliating treatment in which a\xa0licensed medical aesthetician gently scrapes the surface of your skin with a surgical scalpel to remove dead skin and vellus hair (the peach fuzz). While once only available in MediSpas, you can now go fuzz-free and\xa0maintain your flawless foundation affordably, at home. We sit down with\xa0Dermaflash founder (and original #bossbabe) Dara Levy to talk about the benefits of dermaplaning and how she built a beauty empire from a simple ah-ha moment.

As a result, these overlapping layers of identity create unique experiences and systems of discrimination that shape our lives. To explore this, we invited a guest from each of our past episodes to share their point of view on intersectionality and fashion’s role in it. Our panelists included social activist and author Jodie Patterson; journalist, producer, and speaker Noor Tagouri; Suited magazine founder, tailor, and designer Ash Owens; and Sneeze magazine partner and brand director Bradley Carbone. NeueHouse, the private workspace located in New York City and Los Angeles, is known for bringing together creatives and thought-leaders to dissect new ideas and, thus, provided an ideal environment to facilitate this important conversation. Host Sachin Bhola kicked things off with a discussion on the past and present state of inclusion in the fashion industry and why it’s been able to get away with the lack of it for so long. Bhola then probed into intersectionality and what that meant for our panelists. “I\'m not even sure if people want to peel back all the layers,” Patterson commented. “I have a son who\'s a black transgender boy and I find that to be hard for people to wrap their head around. I\'m a black woman who\'s lived hetero and I\'m in a queer relationship now and people are like, ‘Well, what does that mean?’" We then wrapped up by considering what the future of fashion and identity politics looks like. This episode of Fashioning Identity was recorded live at NeueHouse, and calls attention to people with intersectional identities, how fashion overlaps with them, what people can do to influence change, and more. | On this episode, we investigate the relationship people with disabilities have with fashion and why they’re so invisible in the industry. To begin, host Sachin Bhola speaks to Stephanie Thomas, the founder and CEO of Cur8able, a company that specializes in dressing with disabilities. Thomas provides a snapshot of the role clothing played for people with disabilities in the past and then discusses the challenges they face in participating in fashion today. She also offers advice on how the industry can better serve the market, which includes a discussion on the appropriate language to use.Next, Jian DeLeon, Highsnobiety\'s editorial director, speaks to Bradley Carbone. After a snowboarding accident, Carbone was left requiring the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Currently working on skateboarding magazine Sneeze, and as a former adidas trend marketing manager, Carbone talks about how media and streetwear can provide a community for people with disabilities.Bhola then sits down with Quin Lewis, who works for the state department in Washington D.C. by day and is a fashion enthusiast off duty. He shares his story about an accident that left him with a prosthetic leg and gives advice to both the industry and to people with disabilities on how to move forward. | On this episode, we delve into the relationship between the fashion industry and race. To begin, Patrick Michael Hughes, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design, describes what racial diversity looked like throughout fashion history, starting from the beginning of the 20th century. He also highlights groundbreaking moments for racial inclusion in fashion.To bridge the past with the present, and to introduce streetwear to the conversation, host Sachin Bhola turns to two of the most respected people in the industry. The first is Chris Gibbs of Union Los Angeles, who details what he\'s observed about fashion and race over the last two decades, including streetwear\'s gentrification of "urban" fashion and the importance of brands that are owned and operated by people of color. The second is Bobby Hundreds of The Hundreds, who talks about the browning of America and the influence that has on consumer culture and on an industry he says is predominantly run by white people. He also discusses issues he sees between minority groups when it comes to race politics and fashion.Next, Bhola sits down with Libyan American journalist, activist, and speaker Noor Tagouri, who was misidentified in American Vogue’s February print issue earlier this year. Tagouri, a Muslim woman, shares what the consequences of being mis-raced by the media are. We then consider how the industry can address race and racism in the future by speaking to civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson, who sits on Gucci\'s newly created Changemakers Council, an initiative designed to promote cultural awareness and diversity.This episode of Fashioning Identity scrutinizes the fashion industry\'s troubling history with race, offers advice on what people can do to demand the industry changes, and more. | With the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots and WorldPride happening this month, we turn our attention to LGBTQIA+ people and their relationship to fashion. To begin, Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, discusses the role fashion has played for queer people throughout history. She references “A Queer History of Fashion: From the Closet to the Catwalk,” an exhibit she co-curated that was the first in-depth look at LGBTQIA+ contributions to fashion over the past 300 years. To get an understanding of the issues young queer people are facing today – and fashion’s role in telling their stories – host Sachin Bhola speaks to a few leading voices in the community. The first is rapper Taylor Bennett, who came out as bisexual in 2017. Next, Pierre Davis and Arin Hayes, the founders of streetwear brand No Sesso, weigh in on fashion’s commodification of sexual identity, particularly around Pride. To get the perspectives of people who don’t work in fashion, Bhola solicits the opinions of Jackie O and Mercy Kelly from The Hetrick-Martin Institute.\xa0One brand that has long been invested in supporting the LBGTQIA+ community is Gap, and its 2019 Pride campaign features author and activist Jodie Patterson. She talks about her chosen family and what she’s learned raising her transgendered son. We then take a global perspective on the LGBTQIA+ identity and talk to Ian Daniel, co-host and co-producer of Gaycation, who gives us a snapshot of queer people’s experience around the world and their relationship to fashion.\xa0This episode of Fashioning Identity examines the hardships and the triumphs of LBGTQIA+ people, thinks critically about the role fashion plays in their lives, and more. | On our first episode, we explore the relationship between what we wear and the politics of gender. To begin, Jack Halberstam, a professor of gender studies at Columbia University, defines gender and helps contextualize it in fashion. Next, Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, shares some critical moments in history when fashion challenged traditional gender norms.To investigate whether or not fashion has the power to change people’s ideas about gender, host Sachin Bhola speaks to a few gender-bending people in fashion, including Hood By Air’s Ian Isiah, musician Shamir, and Suited Magazine‘s Ash Owens. Also, Highsnobiety’s editorial director, Jian DeLeon, weighs in on the current state of heterosexual masculinity and what fashion can tell us about it.We then consider the future of gender identity through the lens of fashion by speaking to Jackie O and Mercy Kelly from The Hetrick-Martin Institute, and look outside traditional gender binaries, notably to those who identify as transgendered. Bhola speaks to Ian Alexander, best-known for playing Buck on Netflix’s The OA, to get his perspective on the trans identity.This episode of Fashioning Identity unpacks fashion’s role in constructing – and deconstructing – gender identity, recognizes the diversity in gender, and much more.\xa0 | From gender and sexuality to race and socio-economic status, listen to some of the most inspiring people in fashion, alongside the voices of today’s youth, as we unpack identity through the lens of fashion. In reporting on the hardships and the triumphs of identity politics, Highsnobiety shines a light on marginalized voices in street culture.\xa0', 'chan_desc': "Fashioning Identity examines how fashion intersects with various aspects of identity, including gender, sexuality, race, age, and socio-economic status, to name a few, through the lens of street culture. \n\nEach topic explores its history, where we are today, and what’s to come.

Give it a try! | Osmel Sousa had a dream that was born out of an obsession with beauty. He longed to create a world that was filled with beauty of every kind. Like many artists, his desire to be surrounded by beauty was to somehow erase the ugliness and pain that he witnessed and internalized as a child.As a boy, he remembers spending all of his time drawing. He would draw rows of women – always women – and then pick out the best and draw them again with all sorts of dresses that he would clip on and off.\xa0In essence, he was designing a fashion show. One day his mother saw him and forbade him from ever doing it again. She couldn’t stand the thought that he was making silly little "paper dolls".He suffered from learning disabilities that went undiagnosed until he was an adult, so he constantly struggled with his studies. But, instead of sitting in class and feeling frustrated, he would use that time to draw images of women, constantly trying to create what he viewed as the perfect, most angelic face.Tragically, Sousa’s parents did not share in his appreciation for beauty nor did they support their son’s remarkable artistic talents. In fact, they were so disturbed by his behavior and personal interests, that when he was still just a young child, they forced him to undergo hormonal treatments to try to deepen his voice, in order to make him more "masculine".Sousa’s parents did not stop there. Because they perceived his developing sexual orientation as such a threat, when he was just 13 years old, they sent him away from his home in Cuba to live with his grandmother in Venezuela.\xa0\xa0\xa0After graduating from high school, in his newly adopted country of Venezuela, he\xa0studied acting, but quickly realized that he was not cut out to be an actor.He then briefly held jobs as an advertising draftsman and art designer for the two large television networks in Venezuela. Although, these jobs were a dead end for him artistically, fate stepped in while he was working for one of the television networks.It was there that Sousa would meet Lupita Ferrer, who eventually became a famous actress. She convinced him to take a chance and move to the sprawling metropolis of Caracus.Little did he know that because of this move, his paper dolls would finally come to life… Listen to this week’s episode to learn more about the life of Osmel Sousa.This week everything is 10% inside of Pageant Planet’s Shop when you use the coupon code PODCAST.

Chopra’s aunt’s family also moved frequently. She attended schools in Newton, Massachusetts, Queens, New York and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. While attending school in Massachusetts, Chopra participated in several theatre productions. She also studied Western classical music, choral singing and Kathak dance.After three years in the United States, Chopra returned to India to finish her senior year of high-school education at the Army Public School in Bareilly. During this period, she entered and won the local "May Queen" beauty pageant.After her win, she was pursued by admirers, leading her family to equip their home with bars for her protection. After Chopra’s win, her mother then entered her in the 2000 Femina Miss India contest.The pageant today selects India’s representatives to the Miss Universe, Miss World, Miss Supranational, Miss Grand International, Miss United Continents and Miss Intercontinental pageants. Chopra was first runner-up at the pageant earning her the title of Miss World India 2000.Chopra then went on to compete in the 2000 Miss World pageant.

There is constant planning, traveling and connecting. However, this is a labor of love for directors. Directors start pageants for a number of reasons, but mostly to give back. No one knows this better than Julia Morley, chairwoman of the Miss World Organization. Julia Evelyn Morley is a British businesswoman, charity worker and former model. She is the current chairwoman of the Miss World Organization which runs the annual Miss World and biennial Mister World competition.She was born Julia Evelyn Pritchard on October 2, 1939 in London. She was working as a model when she met her husband, Eric Morley. At the time, he was a director of Mecca Dancing, at a dance hall located in Leeds, England. The two married in 1960 when she was 21.Before their marriage, Eric Morley laid the groundwork for the Miss World pageant in 1951.This week\'s promotional item is our OneX50 All-In-One Styling & Finishing Spray!

A headshot gives the judges and audience a glimpse into who you are. Therefore, the message you convey with your headshot is the first thing you convey to everyone. The most important part of having a great headshot is to have a great photographer.No one knows this better than Fadil Berisha. He’s been in the industry for over 35 years and has been instrumental in bringing the glamour and fashion out in the pageant world.\xa0Berisha was born in Kosovo to Albanian parents in 1960 and even to this day, both countries remain close to his heart.At age 8, he moved to Italy for a year where he started to develop his passion for beauty and art.According to an interview with Kosovo Diaspora, faces were of great interest to Berisha growing up. He said in the interview:\xa0“As a kid, I loved faces, all faces, and I was genuinely curious about them.”One year later, he and his family then migrated to New York City, New York at the age of nine and his upbringing was similar to that of any average immigrant family. Every major decision, he recalls, revolved around personal finances.After graduating from high school, Berisha attended the Fashion Institute of Technology where he studied Men’s Fashion Design and Photography. When he chose to major in men’s fashion design, his family was not particularly thrilled.He was the first person in his family to study art, but the degree did very little to quench his thirst for art. Put simply, Berisha didn’t feel like he was in the right career path, yet.To hear more about the life of Fadil Berisha, his journey of breaking boundaries, and what you can learn from his life, listen in.This week\'s promotional item is our Pageant Prep Membership!

It’s meant to highlight a contestant’s poise and elegance and choosing the right gown is crucial to nailing this part of the competition.Contestants spend hundreds, or sometimes thousands on the “right” dress that they hope wins them the title.

This is a luxury retailer that opened a new physical store in London’s Mayfair last year and hosted more than 100 different events in its first 9 months. Join us as we also explore exactly what that takes to pull off, what it means to think about personal shopping through the eyes of technology today, and the role content plays in connecting online and offline together. | The success of Stadium Goods comes off the back of unprecedented consumer desire for sneakers and the need for a rich brand experience in which to buy them, says the platform’s co-founder and co-CEO, John McPheters, on this episode of the Innovators podcast. This is a consignment site that launched in 2015 and was acquired by ecommerce marketplace Farfetch in 2018 for $250 million. Very few emerging businesses have seen such rapid growth. Join us as we explore the cultural relevance of sneakers today, the evolving role of exclusivity and desire in luxury as a result, and just how what McPheters is doing is really about teaching the industry to give up control. | Living in such a connected world is damaging our ability to think creatively, says Brian Solis, a world-leading anthropologist and futurist, on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global.By being constantly online, we are constantly distracted, he suggests. He refers to this particularly applying to "Generation C", where the C stands for "Connected."We all live in a similar lifestyle. And when you live that lifestyle, you\'re rewiring your brain. You\'re speeding it up; you\'re moving faster, you\'re becoming less patient, you\'re becoming incredibly narcissistic. The world literally revolves around you," he explains. "You have followers, your friends, you feel like you need to constantly feed that system, but you\'re also feeding off the system. So you might find yourself endlessly scrolling for no good reason whatsoever."Solis experienced this himself: after writing seven best-selling books, he struggled with distraction while trying to write this eighth.Getting caught up in cycles of sharing and consuming social media is one of the main reasons why people get less and less creative over time, he suggests. "The real problem is that I\'m placing greater emphasis on what happens on this screen than I am in this moment right now. That means that I\'m not placing value in the people that I\'m around, or the places that I\'m at, which means that becomes forgettable."But his quest to understand society\'s digital realities, behaviors and expectations did indeed end up inspiring a new book after all. In Lifescale, he reflects on how we ended up opening ourselves up to so many distractions and what changed to make people value this way of living – points that he also touches on in the podcast.In this conversation, recorded with the Current Global\'s Liz Bacelar at our Innovation Mansion at SXSW this year, Solis explains his techniques to taking control over tech, shares how brands can be more authentic by being more empathic; and reveals what the key is to transforming us into the leaders of the future. | "We really and truly believe that the plus size woman will never be serviced as well as she will be when there\'s no such thing as plus size," say Alexandra Waldman and Polina Veksler, co-founders of size-inclusive label, Universal Standard, on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global.Fashion tends to segregate women who are on the larger end of the spectrum, they say, and so they\'re on a mission to level the playing field and make clothes for everyone. To that end, the brand, which had already gained a cult-like following for its size-inclusive clothing since launching in 2015, introduced an even larger range in 2018, from 00 to 40 – an industry first.Understanding how women of all sizes shop has been key to the brand\'s success, which last year also raised its first round of investment from the likes of GOOP\'s Gwyneth Paltrow, TOMS\' Blake Mycoskie and Imaginary Ventures\' Natalie Massenet.Much like many direct-to-consumer counterparts, the e-commerce experience is playing a major part in its popularity: all of its SKUs can be viewed at every size available within the range, making it easier for women to compare and make confident decisions; and its Universal Fit Liberty Program allows shoppers to replace their purchase, free of charge, within a year of completing it, should they go up or down in size.During this conversation, recorded at the Current Global\'s Innovation Mansion at SXSW this year, Waldman and Veksler break down the many product development challenges that come with the industry\'s traditional fit formula; tell co-host Rachel Arthur what they\'re putting in place to reduce hostility to women of larger size ranges, and share why their bold moves are shifting the way the whole industry approaches this market. | "[The fashion industry] is 60% larger than it needs to be relative to the actual quantity of demand," says Paul Dillinger, Head of Global Product Innovation at Levi\'s, on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global.He is referring to the fact six out of 10 garments produced every year are being discarded to landfill or incinerated within the first year of their production. The result is that those working in this world need to either think about how you can eliminate overproduction, or instead build new business models around only making and selling the four that are actually wanted, he explains, even if it affects business growth.An alternative response to that concept is the so-called "circular economy", whereby items are not discarded but put back into the system, which to overly simplify matters, enables businesses to continue with growth while aiming for lesser impact. But Dillinger believes such moves are merely providing brands with a guilt-free alternative to keep overproducing at a point when the technology for a truly circular system isn\'t yet scalable. He instead refers to the idea of credible "circular industrial ecologies", which are much more complex to operate and achieve."One of them is a corporate compliance officer selling a new shiny penny to a board of directors in the C-suite, and the other one is a studious and scientific approach to really tackling a real challenge," he explains.At Levi\'s, Dillinger is otherwise looking at key areas like reducing the brand\'s use of water. "I think people\'s right to drink fresh water should be prioritized above a company\'s right to access fresh water for production," he explains.In this conversation, hosted in front of a live audience at the Current Global\'s Innovation Mansion at SXSW 2019, he explains what that looks like through theinnovative work he\'s been doing with hemp. He also gets technical with host Rachel Arthur about the many ways in which Levi\'s is working to make its supply chain responsible in one of the most complex industries in the world. | "We\'re operating under the thesis that billion dollar brands will not exist in the future," says Zak Normandin, founder and CEO of Iris Nova, the company behind wellness drink brand, Dirty Lemon, on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global."I know Dirty Lemon isn\'t going to be popular in a few years. And I want to already have three type of products in the pipeline that we\'re launching right now, because consumers are very transient in their decisions to buy products," he explains.Dirty Lemon launched in 2015 and quickly gained the type of cult following that only brands born online manage to achieve. It did so through a mixture of being at the right place, at the right time – in this case, right in the middle of the wellness boom – and carefully crafted branding that positioned it as a lifestyle offering, rather than just a product.But Normandin, a CPG entrepreneur at heart, has much bigger plans than creating fleeting frenzy around a single product line. From inception, his Instagrammable bottles could only be bought online, with purchase being completed via text message. In 2018, it launched the Drug Store, an unmanned retail concept where customers could pick up a Dirty Lemon drink and simply walk out, texting to complete their purchase as they did so. This innovative retail model, alongside a stream of new product launches happening over the next few months, demonstrates Normandin\'s ambitions to keep reacting to customer needs and behaviors before they move onto the next hot thing.During this conversation, recorded at this year\'s SXSW at the Current Global\'s Innovation Mansion, Normandin also share with Liz Bacelar the new products launching under the Irs Nova family, what the retail experience is doing to inform future product development, and how Coca Cola is not only one of the brand\'s biggest investors, but also its competitor. | There\'s a big difference today between the role of commerce, and that of shopping, says Tim Weingarten, head of shopping product at Pinterest, on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global."Commerce has this implication of pushing for the transaction – about reducing friction in the conversion. Whereas shopping is one of joy. It\'s one of serendipity, it\'s one of discovering something you didn\'t know existed," he explains.It\'s that mentality that underpins everything his team does at the company, focusing primarily on how to better the user experience with discovery and personalization at its core. This includes the introduction of a series of tools that filter and predict needs – from Pinterest Lens, which allows customers to find items from the database by photographing similar ones, to the newly announced Catalogs feature, where brands can upload their entire product catalog as shoppable pins.What makes Pinterest stand out among its competitors, is that its users navigate the platform for entirely personal reasons, such as renovating their kitchens or achieving the perfect hairstyle, as opposed to pushing aspirational content to followers, Weingarten comments. Being able to capitalize on that then comes down to having the right algorithms in place."The more data you have, the more you can personalize. But on an e commerce site, the only data they have is based on prior transactions. That\'s a very sparse dataset and it happens very infrequently. If you switch gears to Pinterest, what you have is someone visiting every day doing this authentic thing – saving things for particular use cases. This engagement signal can be applied to all products... And because we have this authentic form of engagement, we\'re able to understand what you\'re trying to accomplish, and actually personalize it to your tastes," he says.Pinterest has been around for nearly a decade with a quiet yet steady climb to the top. As of 2018, users on the platform had pinned 175 billion items on three billion virtual boards. The company is now on track to top $1bn in revenue, and is rumored to be moving forward with an IPO this summer at a valuation of $12bn.During this conversation recorded at Shoptalk with the Current Global\'s Rachel Arthur, Weingarten dissects how Pinterest is only getting better at predicting consumer needs before they\'re voiced; shares how the platform balances being commercial with keeping the joy of inspiration alive, and hints at the types of technologies he\'s looking at to further personalize the shopping experience. | Artificial intelligence is not yet good enough to simulate creativity, says British fashion photographer Nick Knight on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global.Speaking live at a FashMash event in London, he explained that AI as it stands today, is a long way from what creativity is: "When you create a picture, it is done through desire, accident, failure, fear, love, and arousal. Predicting what I will do by how I did past steps is not a good way to create my next piece of art; it\'s not a good way to simulate creativity."He was referring to the way in which AI looks back at past behavior in order to work out what is probable next. But that doesn\'t mean that it won\'t one day figure out how to do so, he noted, adding that he is working on new projects that will keep him on the frontline of it so as to have a say in what it could look like down the road.Knight has built his career on pushing the boundaries of image making. He has photographed some of the world\'s biggest celebrities and models – from Lady Gaga and Bjork to Kate Moss and the late Alexander McQueen. Almost two decades ago, he launched SHOWstudio, an online platform celebrating fashion film, and changing the way fashion was consumed through the internet.Now his next act is understanding how technologies like AI and robotics will impact creativity, and how he can become a part of such a movement.During this conversation with guest host Rosanna Falconer, Knight explains what the smartphone has to do with Shakespeare; how SHOWstudio broke the internet but created history with the first ever live streamed fashion show for Alexander McQueen in late 2009; and why he is an eternal optimist about the future. | Successful retail decisions are made when physical space is seen as another media channel, says Ross Bailey, founder and CEO of Appear Here, the online marketplace for short retail leases on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global.Retail is failing when it\'s not thinking about audience first, Ross insists. The industry doesn\'t think twice about spending huge budgets on Google Ads, but customer acquisition can prove increasingly more valuable through spend on physical footprint, he explains. It\'s for that reason, Appear Here increasingly sees the likes of Google or Instagram as greater competition than other brokers."[If you\'re playing] the audience game that means that as a brand, what\'s the best most authentic, great return on investment medium, that I can reach an audience at for that moment in time, for that campaign, for that product, for that season.And if that happens to be retail, you\'re going to be making that decision over what you\'re spending on AdWords or over what you\'re spending anywhere else," he comments.Appear Here launched in 2013 hoping to disrupt a long-established market that no longer corresponded to how customers shopped. While commercial landlords demanded an average five-year commitment from brands, customers were dispersing from the high street and shopping in a much more flexible, non-committal way. Today, AppearHere\'s short-term rental model – often referred to as the "Airbnb of retail" – sees the company operate an average of 350 stores in London alone at any given time, making it the largest retailer currently operating in the city.Bailey hopes the model gives brands and retailers much more flexibility to appear and disappear whenever they see fit, rather than wait for the consumer to do so first. For brands across the spectrum, of which he has 180,000 on his platform, there are different approaches however. For luxury names like Chanel, Nike or Netflix, all Appear Here clients, it\'s about reaching a new audience or promoting a particular product or campaign; for more independent brands, it\'s about creating awareness outside their online bubble where competition is too high without enormous ad budgets, he suggests.During this conversation Bailey also explains why he sees no problem with an in-store ballpit as a popular experiential idea as long as it is authentic to the brand; how Selfridges\' early retail days inspires him to think about how to bring back showmanship; and why technology, much like children, he says, should be seen but not heard. | "Collaborations to me, are a love affair," says Eno Polo, US president of Alpagartas, the parent company of the world\'s most popular flip flop brand, Havaianas, on the latest episode of the Innovators podcast by the Current Global.Collaborations are at the core of both the brand\'s success and its wide reach, but in order to become successful, they need to remain authentic, he explains. "It has to be two-way. I think a lot of brands out there force collaborations, they pay for collaborations. But if you pay for going out with a girl, I don\'t call that a love affair. I\'d rather it be a natural feeling – she likes me, I like her – and we go out together. That\'s what I call a true collaboration, and those are the ones I think are most successful."Havaianas shot onto the international stage when French designer Jean Paul Gaultier accessorized his models on the New York and Paris catwalks with the flip flops in 1999, instantly turning them into an object of desire. What followed was a series of fashion brands wanting to collaborate with the now-iconic brand, hoping to borrow some of the color and freshness that only a Brazilian label could bring to the table.Today, Havaianas produces over 250 million pairs a year, or 10 pairs a second, and is Europe\'s number one sandal brand.Beyond its ambitious expansion plans across the globe comes a mounting pressure for the brand to tackle the issue of sustainability, which may well still be in toddler stages in its native country, but is steadily becoming a business imperative elsewhere.For Polo, the fact that the company is scaling its retail footprint and office count across Europe and the US means there is a growing internal pressure to become more sustainable. The brand is doing so by focusing on employee welfare, but also wants to tackle and own the fight for sustainability at the beaches where its products are so ever-present.During this conversation, Polo also talks through the company\'s history from catering to Brazil\'s working class to hitting the beaches of Ibiza; the importance of creating a retail experience that puts a smile on the customer\'s feet; and why creating such a simple product allows the brand to remain fun.', 'chan_desc': 'Innovators is a weekly conversation with leaders pushing for change through the lens of innovation.

Listen as Mariella meets the man who brought chocolate samosas to Harrods.\xa0“I cook from my heart and I cook from my mind. That’s the way I put food down.”After arriving in London in 1993, Vineet Bhatia set out on a mission to transform Indian cuisine in the UK. Eight years later, he became the first Indian chef-proprietor to be awarded the industry\'s highest accolade — a Michelin star. Spearheading a cuisine that combines the authentic food of his mother country with modern, innovative twists, Bhatia joined the Harrods family in 2019 with a new restaurant in The Dining Hall — Kama by Vineet. Come for the signature thali, stay for the chocomosas. | One of the UK’s most successful and independent fashion brands with global recognition, Jenny Packham has become the design house of choice when it comes to social dressing. Red carpets the world over are graced with Packham’s designs worn by the most iconic and influential women of our generation including: Taylor Swift, Uma Thurman, Angelina Jolie, Emily Blunt, Kate Winslet, Dita Von Teese, Kate Hudson, Oscar winner Adele Adkins and The Duchess of Cambridge. | Amy Powney of British label Mother of Pearl is on a mission to change how we think about sustainable fashion. She tells Mariella how we can overturn the bad habits of fast fashion — without compromising on style."By 2050, the fashion industry is set to make up 25% of the carbon footprint on the planet, which is harrowing."The latest buzzword in fashion and more relevant than ever, sustainability is Amy Powney\'s gospel at Mother of Pearl. Creative Director at the British brand, her commitment to ethics and the environment takes form in transparent supply chains, organic materials and social responsibility — without compromising on creativity. The result? Fashion-forward, affordable pieces that perfect the balance between style and substance. From the ready-to-wear collection to the fully sustainable \'No Frills\' diffusion line, her pieces are designed to make you look great, and feel great about the story behind your outfit. | Something of an artistic polymath at the age of 28, poet, actress and filmmaker Greta Bellamacina is Harrods’ first poet-in-residence. In episode two, Mariella meets the woman of many talents.“I think poetry and all good art should be for the people – it shouldn’t be reserved in dusty old books and art galleries.”Popularising poetry for a new generation, 28-year-old Greta Bellamacina is our first poet-in-residence here at Harrods. At the age of 23, she was shortlisted as Young Poet Laureate, before going on to edit three internationally-loved books including Smear, a powerful feminist anthology for young women. Not to be confined to pen and paper, Bellamacina first dipped her toe into the world of cinema on the set of Harry Potter, and has since co-written, directed and starred in an award-nominated new film Hurt By Paradise. | Since his very first Vogue cover in 1977, hair stylist Sam McKnight has been behind some of the most iconic fashion shoots of all time. Here, he tells Mariella how he found himself in the vanguard of the most glamorous industry in the world.\xa0"I wanted to be part of that world — it looked so luxurious and glamorous, a kind of world I had never seen before."\xa0\xa0"Hair is transformative", so says Sam McKnight. Captivated by the pages of glossy magazines as a teen, the now-lauded hair stylist moved to London from the small mining town of New Cumnock to find himself landing a job in the capital\'s most illustrious hair salon and styling Vogue shoots by 1977. After four decades of iconic covers, catwalk shows and celebrity clientele (he was personal hair stylist to Princess Diana for seven years), he marked his star-studded career with the launch of an eponymous line of hair products in 2017. | Mariella is back for more True Tales of Luxury with a host of new guests, including Sam McKnight and the duo behind palmer // harding. | A name synonymous with luxurious nights, Olivia von Halle rewrote the rules of sleepwear with her silk creations. Here, Mariella meets the designer who took pyjamas into our everyday wardrobes, blurring the lines between lounge and ready-to-wear.\xa0"You have to give yourself space for your imagination to be able to run riot."\xa0Sparked by a love of her tailor-made pyjamas, Olivia von Halle put nightwear on the map with her eponymous brand. The original advocate of sleepwear as outerwear, the British designer has long been wearing her silk nightclothes beyond the bedroom. Launching with the archetypal Lila pyjamas in 2011, her classic aesthetic has since evolved into ready-to-wear with boudoir-esque slips and bias-cut skirts, with comfort and luxury ever at the forefront of her designs. | Designer and philanthropist Gabriela Hearst is paving the way to a sustainable future for luxury fashion. Mariella meets the woman behind the eponymous label that\'s captured hearts with its steadfast ethics and quiet elegance.\xa0"Sustainability is luxury — it shouldn\'t be two competing concepts."\xa0Having grown up herding cattle on the family ranch in Uruguay, Gabriela Hearst\'s childhood was far from conventional — much like her approach to the business of fashion. Her focus on sustainability speaks to a \'buy less, wear more\' mentality, creating pieces you\'ll love for life and never need to replace. Hearst\'s luxury is one of integrity and subtlety, from ranch-reared wool and recycled cashmere to anti-radiation pocket linings. But it\'s her eye for design that brings in the style set, with her cult Nina bag attracting a lengthy waitlist since being spotted on the arm of many an A-lister.\xa0"My sense of luxury is this well-crafted, beautiful product that can last. It\'s made with integrity and noble materials." | It was in 2012 that Annoushka Ducas was decorated as a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Recognised for her three decades of service to the jewellery industry, hers is a name that’s synonymous with luxury.\xa0“Jewellery is so much about moments in time. Those are the luxuries: the moments that it commemorates, or what they mean to you.”Annoushka Ducas MBE wasn’t always destined for the world of luxury jewellery. The keen businesswoman, and now mother of four – who co-founded Links of London in 1990 alongside her husband, John Ayton – studied at the Sorbonne before alighting in the industry almost by chance. Despite her lack of formal training, Ducas’ innate sense of style and inimitable aesthetic has redefined the jewellery industry as we know it today. | After a serendipitous meeting on the streets of London, power couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo launched a label that would become the biggest British couture house in over 100 years. Hear their extraordinary story as Mariella gets the low-down on the business of haute couture.\xa0"We have this belief together that nothing is impossible. We have no doubt in our minds that what we\'re trying to create is one of the biggest luxury houses ever."\xa0The enormous success of couture label Ralph & Russo can be traced back to one chance meeting between its eponymous founders on the streets of London. Love at first sight between a designer and a banker grew into, years later, the foundation of a fashion house that would become the first British label in 100 years to be invited to show at Paris Couture Week. Today, the brand\'s creations are spotted on a prestigious roster of clients from Angelina Jolie to Meghan Markle, who wore Ralph & Russo for her official engagement photograph with Prince Harry.', 'chan_desc': 'In this series, presented by Mariella Frostrup, Harrods explores people’s ideas of what luxury is.

This episode is a direct response to the many readers and listeners who’ve told us that they struggled to fill the gap after their vows had been exchanged, and the confetti had been thrown. Post-wedding blues, otherwise known as post-wedding comedown, are extremely common, and quite natural when you consider what an exciting couple of months you\'ve had. So, over the next half an hour or so, we’ll give you some useful tips and tools for how to deal with the post-wedding slump, and hopefully help you get excited for what the next phase of life brings!Episode Breakdown: Post-Wedding Comedown: The Struggle is RealWedding tip: Claire\'s top tip this week is to make a plan for peeing in your wedding dress!Main topic: Today\'s main topic is all about the very real phenomenon of post-wedding comedown, also known as post-wedding blues. Many couples report feeling sad, lonely, and a little directionless after their big day, so we wanted to offer some advice on how to manage this potentially tricky transition. Obviously, if at any point during the post-wedding period, your feelings become overwhelming, it’s time to pay your GP, counsellor or psychotherapist a visit. In most cases, though, you should benefit from following the tried-and-tested tips in this episode!Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “I was just wondering if you had any tips or anything for a bride who\'s realising throughout planning that she’s a little bit of a loner? I\'ve never had strong friendship groups, and always sat on the outskirts with one or two good friends, but it’s only now as I’ve sat down to check over the guest list, that I realise that I only have three friends coming to the day (plus their partners), and six coming to the evening. For reference, our daytime total is 75 guests and evening about 130 guests. My fiance’s friend count for the day is seven guests, but his evening is 32 guests! Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not complaining that he’s got a big guest list, but I suppose, until now, I never really thought I was such a loner that I don\'t even have 10 friends to invite to my own wedding. I find I\'m relying heavily on the two people closest to me, but only because I don\'t have enough other friends to spread the wedstress out to! Any tips or ways to just get over it are greatly appreciated!” Our advice for this bride is to ditch the word "loner" from her vocabulary and try to let go of the idea that there\'s a perfect number of close friends a person should have at their wedding!Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: Grab a potter\'s wheel and someone who boasts the animal magnetism of a 1990s Patrick Swayze, because, in this episode, Claire\'s recommending you take up pottery!Thanks for listening!

We’ve talked through the most frequently asked questions on this topic - whether you should invite children to your wedding, how to break the news to parents that they’re not invited, and how to keep them occupied if they are going to be there on the day. Whether you\'re having an adults-only wedding, or a kid-friendly bash, this should be helpful listening for every couple!\xa0Episode Breakdown: Episode 30: Should You Invite Children to Your Wedding?Wedding tip: Claire\'s top tip this week is all about why you need to assign one of your guests with the job of \'photo manager\'!Main topic: Today\'s main topic is all about children at weddings, a subject that can all too often be divisive! As always, there are no hard and fast rules about whether or not you should have children at your wedding, but hopefully our chat will help you figure out what\'s suitable for your wedding, how to discuss the topic with your guests, and, if you end up inviting kids along, how to make it a more enjoyable day for them!\xa0Wedding dilemma: We had a lovely email from a groom who’s having a same-sex wedding. He writes, “My significant other wants us to get ready together the morning of the wedding, but I\'m conflicted with this. On one hand, I think we would have some great wedding photos and it would be sweet on our video, but on the other hand, I want to get ready with my wedding party and feel a momentum of adrenaline seeing him during the ceremony. There are no dresses involved as we are both wearing suits but I still think the thrill might be nice!”Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: In this episode, Claire\'s recommending some great new Irish books out this month by female authors. Sophie White\'s Filter This, Vicky Phelan\'s autobiography with Naomi Linehan, Overcoming and the new Aisling book, by Sarah Breen and Emer McLysaght are currently at the top of her reading list.\xa0Thanks for listening!Thanks for listening!

It\'s also chock full of practical wedding money saving tips, which you\'ll probably thank us for 12 months after your wedding!Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “My significant other and I are going for a DJ only. Any ideas on what we could do to entertain our guests in the between time of the DJ playing and after speeches are done? We\'re eating beforehand. We definitely don\'t want a band, and are kinda stumped with what to do. We may get a talented singer who will sing a few songs, but I was thinking something hands-on would be nice for guests. If I’m right, there should only be about 30 to 45 minutes of down time." Our ideas include hiring an instrumental group, a magician, or a caricaturist, or organising a photo booth. We also recommend re-evaluating your need for post-dinner entertainment at all!Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: In this episode, Celina\'s recommending the Be Kind Rewind video essays on YouTube, which tell the fascinating stories behind some of the most hotly-contested Best Actress Oscar races in history.Thanks for listening!Thanks for listening!

We\'re the first to admit that this is a confusing concept. After all, if you Google "unique wedding ideas", you\'re going to end up with a list of suggestions that are quite the opposite! But in reality, couples often find inspiration for their own personal touches by hearing about other weddings. Making your wedding unique is also about thinking outside the box, which is why we invited Aoife McElwain, the woman behind party phenomenon Singalong Social and author of the book Slow at Work, to share some cool details from her own wedding!Episode Breakdown: How to Make your Wedding UniqueWedding tip: Claire\'s nugget of wisdom this week is to make a plan for which friends, family members, and/or wedding party members should get buttonholes and corsages.Main topic: Today\'s main topic is making your wedding unique, but we don\'t mean exchanging vows during a bungee jump or hosting an underwater reception! We\'re talking about the sweet details and personal touches that make a wedding a true reflection of your personality. Think giving out little pots of your Granny\'s jam as wedding favours, or ditching the speeches for a table quiz! To kick off the conversation, we spoke to master party-thrower Aoife McElwain, who is best known as founder of Sing Along Social and author of the book Slow at Work. We hit on some really fun, unique wedding ideas over the course of this chat, so we hope you enjoy!Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “How do I put a disclaimer on the invite that basically says there’s no pressure to come? How do I word this? Our wedding is on the Aran Islands so it may well require people taking Friday and Monday off work, as the wedding is Saturday, and the first ferry doesn’t leave a lot of time to get ready. I absolutely want everyone to come, and friends in Australia have already booked flights home as soon as we set the date, but I want to acknowledge that it’s far and awkward and that we won’t be annoyed if people can’t come.” Our advice this week includes a few handy suggestions for how to word the wedding invitations.Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: In this episode, Claire\'s recommending a spot of DIY to take your mind off the spreadsheets and supplier emails.Thanks for listening!

This could be anything from pre-ceremony nerves to the kind of severe anxiety that warrants a trip to see a doctor or mental health professional. We asked psychotherapist and author Stella O’Malley to help us answer some of the bigger questions on this topic, including, "How can I minimise conflict with my family members around my wedding?"and "How do I know that it\'s time to see a councellor about my anxiety?", as well as offering our own practical tips, and handy coping mechanisms for managing wedding-related stress.Episode Breakdown: Anxiety, Stress and Your Wedding: How to DealWedding tip: Celina\'s nugget of wisdom this week is to avoid hitting the shops in the last few weeks of wedding planning. Sure, those Wifey for Lifey socks are cute, but not essential!Main topic: If you\'re currently planning a wedding, there\'s a very high chance that you\'ve already experienced a little bit of stress, be it guest list, budget or weather-related! That\'s why we wanted to clear a space in our podcast schedule for a frank discussion about anxiety and weddings, including some invaluable tips from psychologist Stella O’Malley on managing your frustrations, be they large or small, and practical advice that will leave you in the best possible position to enjoy the planning process!Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “My sister showed me a picture of the dress she’s bought for my wedding and although it’s not a wedding dress, it’s pretty close! It’s white and knee-length, and kind of bridalish, it’s the sort of dress that a bride would wear to a civil ceremony or city hall wedding. She’s really excited about it, so obviously I don’t want to wreck her buzz, but at the same time, I know she can easily find another dress that isn’t so bridal. Am I being unreasonable if I ask her to return the dress and get another one?" Our advice this week includes evaluating the bridal factor of your own wedding-day outfit, and asking a family member or mutual friend to have a quiet word with your sister!Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: In this episode, Celina\'s recommending a digital detox, but only for one night!Thanks for listening!

My problem is that I think his daughter is feeling quite left out. She’s 13 and we get on really well so I know she’s OK with us getting married, but she just doesn’t seem like herself since we got engaged. I get the feeling that she thinks we’ll be so busy with the wedding that we won’t have time for her. Any idea how we can make her feel more included? She’s not really into clothes or makeup so I don’t think she’ll be interested in wedding dress shopping or being a bridesmaid." Our advice for this listener, and indeed anyone in a similar position, is to chat to the family member in question, aad find a role within the wedding that they\'re comfortable with and excited about!Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: In this episode, Celina tries to convince Claire to pay a leisurely weekend visit to her chosen garden centre, with mixed results!Thanks for listening!

This is an area of wedding planning that we get so many questions on, so this week, we\'re putting those questions to an expert, Aidan Corcoran of the Brown Thomas Beauty Style Team.

That\'s why we recruited the help of Aidan Corcoran from the Brown Thomas Beauty Style Team, to offer expert skincare and make-up advice, and tell us about some of his favourite products across the department store\'s extensive Beauty Hall.Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “My best friend in the whole world is pregnant and her due date is 11 days after the wedding. I’m really hoping that she’ll be able to attend but, of course, she’ll have to wait and see how she feels on the day, but I’m wondering, if she does make it, is there anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable? I would love to still include her in the day in some way, too, if possible. We previously asked her to sing at the ceremony but, on her suggestion, we changed things around when she told us about the pregnancy!"\xa0Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: In the theme of this week’s episode, we\'re recommending that you treat yourself to a really indulgent pre-wedding beauty treatment.Thanks for listening!

For this, we recruited the help of newlyweds Joey and Liam, who celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary around the time of recording. They told us all about their prom-themed wedding - which was planned in nine months, from two different countries! - and what they would do differently, if given half the chance.Episode Breakdown: Episode 24: 365 Days Later - Wedding Tips and Regrets from a Real CoupleWedding tip: This week, our tip is to create some handy playlists for your big day (or borrow them from the One Fab Day archive!), and have them downloaded on yours or your wedding party members\' phones. They\'ll come in very handy in the event of a musical emergency!Main topic: The most valuable advice you receive about your wedding often comes from a couple who have been married for a while, and have a clear idea of what really mattered on the big day, and crucially, what didn’t! Well, that’s exactly the kind of wisdom we were shooting for with this week\'s episode, and married couple Joey and Liam certainly delivered. 365 days after they tied the knot, they chatted with us about the highs and lows of wedding planning, sharing everything they learned along the way.Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “We\'re planning on having three bridesmaids; my best friend, my sister and one of my fiancé\'s two sisters. How can I ask one sister without offending the other? We can\'t afford to have another bridesmaid and we don\'t get on that well, plus I don\'t think it\'s really her kind of thing either, but I want her to feel included. I thought maybe she could be an usher, but we\'re getting married in a registry office so it\'s not really necessary. Do you have any suggestions?” Our advice this week includes asking your fiancé\'s sister to do a reading at the ceremony or give a toast at the reception.Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: Claire\'s latest recommendation is the TV show Shrill, based on the book by Lindy West, and starring Aidy Bryant.Thanks for listening!

Claire\'s advising you to wait until the day before the wedding to finalise your seating chart or table plan display, or, even better, to make it editable!Main topic: Our chat this week is all about wedding movies - the good, the bad and the just plain ridiculous! We begin by discussing our own favourite wedding-themed films - Stephen\'s pick is Four Weddings and a Funeral, Celina\'s pick is Muriel\'s Wedding, and Claire\'s pick is Bridesmaids. All three of these films are fun and frothy comedies, but we\'ve managed to find a few golden nuggets of wedding-planning advice lurking beneath the surface. We\'ll also be dishing out wedding movie awards, including a Best Entertainer gong for the rapping Granny in The Wedding Singer (apologies to Liza Minnelli of Sex and the City 2 notoriety, remember that it\'s an honour just to be nominated!)Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “We\'re having a Catholic ceremony and it\'s a serious amount of paperwork (that\'s a dilemma in itself), but the problem is that we don\'t have a local priest as we don\'t go to mass every Sunday, and just want a super nice sound guy who can marry us and the priest in the nearby church isn\'t fantastic. Are we going to have to go to a different church every Sunday and try and corner the priest we like? What\'s the etiquette? Or do we have to make do with a priest that may not exactly be our style?" In this episode, we\'re delivering an answer that the listener probably doesn\'t want to hear - no, you generally can\'t choose your priest according to their personality!Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: Claire\'s recommendation this week is a great one - plan a one-on-one date with your parents and/or siblings.Thanks for listening!

That\'s why we wanted to devote a whole show to them! In this episode, we\'re discussing how to organise your speeches, who to trust with the microphone, and, crucially, how to write a speech that will keep your guests LOLing and tearing up in all the right places.Wedding dilemma: A listener writes, “I have been dating my boyfriend for 11 years and we are very happy. He is the best! We are planning on getting engaged at Christmas but will be picking out our rings in October. We are both very excited! However, both my parents have strongly voiced that they don\'t like us \'as a couple\'. I would love to have a traditional wedding with a large reception but I\'m afraid my parents will dampen the the lead up, the engagement and the wedding. We all live in a small village so we see them all the time. Because of this potential drama, we are contemplating an elopement. In your opinion, do you think we would regret eloping or should we deal with our parents and have our traditional wedding?" This is probably the trickiest dilemma to date, but we\'re suggesting lots of alternatives to the traditional wedding format, including a few ideas for post-elopement parties.Something to do when you\'re not planning your wedding: Celina\'s latest recommendation is a rousing round of the Song Association Game, as inspired by Elle.Thanks for listening!

On any given day, I never know exactly how my skin is going to react to my regular routine, or a new product I’m interested in testing out. | Let’s face it, once we hit our 30s, fine lines and wrinkles become a thing. Eye creams are now our best friends, and I’d honestly be lying if I said I didn’t mumble a little prayer each time I patted one on before bed. | The One Haircut That Works for Nearly Every Length and Texture  Whenever I’m looking to refresh my hair, the biggest issue I always run into is figuring out which cut to get.

Fascinated by the supernatural aura of ritual objects, such as amulets, charms and tribal power figures, he began to produce brightly enameled necklaces and brooches in gold, silver and gemstones, as well as nonprecious and found objects that evoke a similar and mysterious power. Many of his recent pieces are mythical and ironic self-portraits that suggest intense introspection. A dedicated educator, Bill taught at Florida State University from 1973 to 1992, and published “Step-by-Step Enameling: a Complete Introduction to the Craft of Enameling” in 1973. Bill’s work has been widely exhibited, including a one-person exhibition in 1977 at the Renwick Gallery of Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., and an internationally traveling retrospective in 1989.

In celebration of an impressive, five-decade career, the Fashion and Textile Museum has just opened Zandra Rhodes: 50 Years of Fabulous. A brilliant retrospective of the designer's work, highlighting more than 50 key looks, original textiles and never-seen-before garments and accessories.\xa0We meet in the library of Zandra's wonderful penthouse, piled high with beautiful books, photographs and mementoes. With her unmissable fuchsia bob, bold blue eyeshadow and super-sized jewellery, her singular style is even better in real life. With no plans to retire, and more plans to keep on creating, we discuss what Zandra Rhodes has been up to - curating her exhibition, appearing on Celebrity Masterchef, and collaborating with Ikea, for starters. Oh, and her fondness for throwing dinner parties and making bread and butter pudding. Stay tuned, because Zandra's best advice comes right at the very end...Thank you for listening.

To be honest, it was a bit of an experiment, and one I entered into with some trepidation because I knew it was a big undertaking, not dissimilar to writing another book. The aim was for it to be a ‘slow’ podcast, there isn’t a big production team behind it- and I'm chuffed to bits with the five guests I've already spoken to. The aim was to bring my interviews with extraordinary women (and the occasional man) to life, to delve a little deeper into the regular subjects of life and style and age.We're now taking a break for the summer holidays, the out of office is going on, and we'll be reviewing all the feedback we've received and will be back with series two at the end of September, with more fantastic guests. In the meantime all episodes are still available to listen to, download, rate and review on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher and Amazon Alexa amongst others. You can also find details of every episode on our new Podcast channel at the top of the site, and I've added players to each post so if you'd like to listen to it right here on TNMA you can.Thanks again for tuning in, see you in September!Support the show | For this podcast episode, That's Not My Age visits the House of Lords (the second chamber of the UK parliament) to talk to the brilliant Baroness Young of Hornsey OBE.

Along the way, we talk about Lola Young's career, first in acting and then in academia as a professor of Cultural Studies, and what she does in her downtime (plays 5-a-side walking football).

A self-proclaimed eyebrow queen, Boom Boom went to the Fashion Institute of Technology, trained as an esthetician, and is now a top brow educator-IBS New York is a constant. She knows there’s no such thing as natural beauty, but she does believe a perfectly done brow is an instant eye-lift. The K-BOOM Brow being the most popular style- a long, full, straight brow with less of an arch.  Boom Boom believes that shaping brows while sitting up is the best. It allows for symmetrical arches and better judgement of where brows should begin and end in relation to the other features on the face, which helps to make them proportionate. Features get distorted when lying down, making it harder to create a shape that will ultimately look good when standing up.

Daisy started Banish by accident; she had struggled with acne all her life and decided to create a YouTube channel documenting her struggle. That YouTube channel has over 700 videos and 70M views today.  From there, she realized many current skincare ingredients such as fragrances or fillers break her out and so she created her own products out of her kitchen. All the products are natural, vegan, cruelty-free, do not contain any of the ingredients that cause acne for her (namely silicones, mineral oil, petroleum, artificial preservatives colors and fragrances). The rest is history.  Daisy was awarded Forbes \'30 under 30\' in manufacturing, as well as an Inc.500 entrepreneur and awarded in LA\'s "Fastest-growing female-owned companies in Los Angeles". She also serves on the board Of Entrepreneur Organization-Los Angeles, is a member of Young Entrepreneur Council, and has sponsored and mentored many young female entrepreneurs through her alumni, the Duke Alumni Association. Most recently, she is a TEDx speaker and speaks regularly about the struggles we battle with perfection and how to overcome our own inner critic.  In our girl to girl talk, Daisy and I discussed what it was like to grow up feeling unattractive and having acne at a very tender age in a girl’s growing up years and what that was like. She candidly shares how she started with her first YouTube video in 2009 with absolutely no idea she would attract such a following. Her purpose was to help others with similar issues or concerns and she did that. This became her passion. In 2013 she decided to create Banish with the same goals. To help people who have skin issues. Daisy talks about how she uses social media with intention and purpose and how she avoids the "device addiction" so many people have. Yet, she also talks about the “skin positivity” movement and how that message IS supported through social media and specifically Instagram.\xa0  Daisy is focused, driven, and committed to making a difference and she has grown her business into a multi-million-dollar company. At the same time, her number one goal is to help others with similar issues and helping them overcome their own inner critic.\xa0  She has generously offered listeners of this podcast the opportunity to enjoy $10.00 off your purchase of Banish products by using this special code: https://banish.com/probeautytalks.

Started in 2005, they are best known for launching the first-to-mass lip exfoliator of its kind, The Lip Scrub, and the cult-adored glossy balm, The Lip Slip: One Luxe Balm. A Chicago native and USC alumna, Happ began formulating the "lip scrub" while working for ESPN in Connecticut where the freezing winters left her with persistently chapped lips. When a Google search for "lip scrub" returned no results, Happ decided to create what simply did not exist.  A broadcast journalist, Happ knew nothing about the cosmetic chemistry but knew exactly how she wanted her Lip Scrub to feel and taste- and more importantly, the results it needed to deliver. Using her kitchen as a test laboratory, she concocted The Lip Scrub through trial and error, mixing sugar and essential oils to produce an exfoliant that transformed the texture of lips, instantly.\xa0 Sara Happ is a celebrity favorite and has become a must-have for celebrities including Katie Holmes, Kate Hudson, and many more. Host Melanie Kopeikin has been a devotee to the entire range of lip care products created by Sara including her favorites the Lip Slip and Dream Slip.

I share what my internships were like and what they have taught me that I still apply to my business today. I also share why you should never stop learning and how there is always room for more growth. If you aren’t sure of the answer to something, go ahead and try to figure it out - what’s worked for somebody else, may not work for you but you can learn so much by just taking action.\xa0 \xa0 What’s in this episode:  How hard it is to decide on your college and career Her eagerness to get started with her career Meeting with her college advisor\xa0 Interning with Tommy Hilfiger How shes applied what she’s learned from internships into her business What she realized during her internship with Marchesa Her internship with Fendi in public relations Treating people with respect no matter how high up you are in a company Her favorite internship experience\xa0 Learning about the buying process and attending NY Fashion Week Her internship experiences and what they taught her about the industry   I am so glad you decided to tune in today.

If you have a fire inside of you that is telling you to follow a specific path, don’t let other people’s negativity put it out. Today on the podcast, I share why you shouldn’t allow what the naysayers say to get to you. Often times, people will tell you that you can’t do something, but that doesn’t mean its true. I also discuss how I got started in the fashion industry at such a young age and how something that I initially perceived as a setback in my life ended up being a blessing in disguise.\xa0 \xa0 What’s in this episode:  Why Nicole got started in Fashion Growing up as a tomboy\xa0 How her parents shaped her into a hardworking person Her tight-knit relationship with her grandparents\xa0 Why she decided to learn how to sew Making her own dresses for school dances How she started building her brand The set-back she faced when applying to her dream college How getting denied for her dream school was a blessing in disguise The scary transition of going to college in NYC  \xa0 I am so glad you decided to tune in today.

That sparks a discussion about the post plastic surgeon Dr. Galanis from Beverly Hills made on Instagram. Dr. Galanis is concerned that idolizing J LO and her beauty at her age are not based on reality. Marcella who is a huge J LO fan loves that she doesn\'t allow her age to define what she is going to wear, what movie she is going to make and to Marcella she is simply goals. Marcella also does not believe that you should ever say you are old and she goes on a rant about it. Then we start with our part 2 of what elegant women should never do. Elegant women do not obsess about what everyone else is doing.Elegant women don\'t try to change others behavior. Elegant women don\'t worry about what they cannot control. Elegant women don\'t dwell on the past. Elegant women don\'t flaunt their moneyElegant women don\'t do clutterElegant women don\'t wing their dayElegant women do not try to be perfectElegant women do not take life for grantedPenis and Pussy Talk with Miss Polly: Do blue balls really exist? What are they? How do they happen? Can it be fixed?Question of the Day: Have you ever been cat phished? | We are very passionate about this show as we read the controversial article written by Sharon Grigsby where she suggests that The Dallas Cowboys should retire the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. The article was published in the Dallas Morning News and inspired by local author Karen Blumenthal. Marcella gives a heartfelt speech about the passion of being a dancer and how many young people are inspired to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. People fly from all over the world to be a part of America\'s Sweethearts. Marcella tells us about one of her 10 year old students that cannot wait to become a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. When watching the CMT TV Show "Making the Team" you can clearly see how passionate the women are that are trying out. Gabrielle\'s brother flies all the way from Austria every year to watch the Cowboys game. There were 1200 little girls that attended the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader junior workshop this year. We are all very frustrated by Karen and Sharon\'s opinions and we are suggesting that both women should put on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader uniforms and try to do what the Cheerleaders do,before placing such harsh judgement. We also extend an invitation to both ladies to come on our show so we can have a discussion about this subject matter. The Cheerleaders work very, very hard, look incredible,are smart, have jobs, are highly educated, are mothers etc. and we are frustrated that the Sharon\'s and Karen\'s of this world are looking to cause problems for no reason.Marcella then talks about the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Director Kelly Finglass who she admires and looks up to and has the utmost respect for. Marcella says that she was not a Dallas Mavericks Dancer for attention but because she lived to perform. Bernie talks about some of his Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader friends who are highly respected and have amazing careers. Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders are highly respected and incredible role models that are held in the highest regards.  Why would you want to do away with them? IF there were some that are messing up then maybe make the argument but they are not. Marcella then talks about how difficult it is to be a dancer and being told NO NO NO constantly and how hard you have to push. It takes a lot to get up on stage and be judged. Marcella talks about the strict rules that the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have. She shares with us what happens after you make the team. Then she tells us what happened to her when she had a major wardrobe malfunction and she flashed 30.000 fans during her Dallas Mavericks days. We are offended that Sharon and Karen act like the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders are dumb asses and then read one of our Too Posh models Krista Nicole Burrell post about being an educated women that also models bikinis. No matter if she is wearing a swimsuit or a blazer she still is a classy, educated woman and amazing mother. We shouldn\'t be judged by what we wear but you can definitely judge us by our behavior. We talk more about Kelly Finglass and how you want her respect. Kelly Finglass is set in her southern traditional ways and that uniform has been around for 47 years and she is so particular how their bodies fit and look in it. We absolutely love the article written by Paige Skinner that was published in the Dallas Observer that there absolutely is room for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.Her points are powerful and extremely well written. She talks about how extremely athletic they are etc. We read Kelly Finglass comments The Dallas Cowboys uniform is in the Smithsonian museum.

We\'ve heard people making judgements on others solely on the fact that they’re wearing a nice pair of trousers. The whole problem reached its climax a few years ago, when a prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneur publicly declared “I never invest in someone who wears a suit”.This mentality is based on the silly theory that clothes make you smarter or dumber.
