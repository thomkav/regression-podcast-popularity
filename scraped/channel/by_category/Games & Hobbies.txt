In 2014, the Andreacchio family suffered a tragic loss, the mysterious death of 21-year-old Christian Andreacchio. A mere 45-minute investigation ruled his death a suicide, but overwhelming evidence points to murder. Despite road blocks by state and local agencies, Christian\'s mother Rae has continued to lead the fight for #JusticeForChristian. The family hired their own experts and conducted their own investigation, unearthing new evidence, but authorities refused to act. Host Dennis Cooper takes you inside this 5 year saga, and takes the investigation places that authorities have failed to go, shinning a spotlight on what many believe to be a small town murder and potential cover up.

This rant, in particular, comes from Dan Engber - a science writer who loves animals but despises animal intelligence research. Dan told us that so much of the way we study animals involves tests that we think show a human is smart ... not the animals we intend to study.\xa0Dan’s rant got us thinking: What is the smartest animal in the world? And if we threw out our human intelligence rubric, is there a fair way to figure it out?Obviously, there is. And it’s a live game show, judged by Jad, Robert … and a dog.For the last episode of G, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we’re sharing that game show with you. It was recorded as a live show back in May 2019 at the Greene Space in New York City. We invited two science writers, Dan Engber and Laurel Braitman, and two comedians, Tracy Clayton and Jordan Mendoza, to compete against one another to find the world’s smartest animal. What resulted were a series of funny, delightful stories about unexpectedly smart animals and a shift in the way we think about intelligence across all the animals - including us.Check out the video of our live event here!\xa0This episode was produced by Rachael Cusick and Pat Walters, with help from Nora Keller and Suzie Lechtenberg.

His law professors told him the case, Buck v Bell, was nothing to worry about, that the ruling was in a kind of legal limbo and could never be used against people. But he didn’t buy it. In this episode we follow Mark on a journey to one of the darkest consequences of humanity’s attempts to measure the human mind and put people in boxes, following him through history, science fiction and a version of eugenics that’s still very much alive today, and watch as he crusades to restore a dash of moral order to the universe.This episode was produced by Matt Kielty, Lulu Miller and Pat Walters.\xa0You can pre-order Lulu Miller’s new book Why Fish Don’t Exist here.Special thanks to Sara Luterman, Lynn Rainville, Alex Minna Stern, Steve Silberman and Lydia X.Z.

He didn’t want his grave, or his body, becoming a shrine to his genius. When he passed away in the early morning hours of April, 18, 1955, his family knew his wishes. There was only one problem: the pathologist who did the autopsy had different plans.In the third episode of “G”, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we go on one of the strangest scavenger hunts for genius the world has ever seen. We follow Einstein’s stolen brain from that Princeton autopsy table, to a cider box in Wichita, Kansas, to labs all across the country. And eventually, beyond the brain itself entirely.

In this bonus episode, we examine evidence and whether it supports that conclusion, as Wagner makes a series of strange and otherwise inexplicable decisions that end tragically with Natalie’s death. | Is Robert Wagner deceiving the public when he says Natalie Wood's death was an accident? Thirty-seven years after the Oscar winner’s inexplicable demise, the question lives on with the same vigor as when it was first asked—and the main person of interest continues his stonewalling. Now, we come as close to an answer as the world may ever come. In two explosive, face-to-face exchanges—one with a reporter from our investigative team and another with Natalie’s still-grieving sister, Lana—the Hollywood star is asked, point-blank, “Did you kill Natalie?” You’ll never believe his reply. Or the results of a lie detector test, performed by one of the world’s foremost experts. We also hear shocking final statements from those closest to the case who believe Natalie’s death was no accident and was, in fact, murder. | With the probe into Natalie Wood’s death officially reopened, shocking new details are made public as speculation mounts about what truly happened that night -- and her husband, Robert Wagner, is officially named a “person of interest.” In this episode, we look at how possible bungling by the coroner and the police — notably the mishandling of key witnesses and crucial evidence — impacted the initial investigation. We also explore how a fresh examination of the severe bruising on Natalie’s body and the emergence of new witnesses from the night she vanished forced detectives to take a closer look at the first investigation’s faulty findings. | Dennis Davern — the skipper of Natalie Wood’s death yacht — has made a dramatic escape from the virtual house arrest under which Robert Wagner placed him following the starlet’s suspicious demise. Nearly two years pass, but Dennis remains haunted by that night. Finally, he places a call to a good friend — author Martin Rulli. Dennis is finally willing to tell the truth and revise the statements he made to police. What he said, related here and accompanied by new and world exclusive details, including how he passed out Quaaludes to all aboard, will blow open the case into Natalie’s disappearance and lead to homicide cops to reopen the matter and ultimately name Wagner a person of interest.\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Princess Diana was an international icon.

If there were a Japanese version of Captain America, this would be his origin story. | Pain is at the root of most drama and entertainment. When does it get too real? This very disturbing and graphic show looks into some case studies and asks some deep questions. WARNING Very intense subject matter. | Julius Caesar is our travel guide as he takes us through his murderous subjugation of the native Celtic tribal peoples of ancient Gaul. It sounds vaguely like other, recent European colonial conquests...until the natives nearly win. | What happens if human beings can't handle the power of their own weaponry? This show\xa0 examines the dangerous early years of the Nuclear Age and humankind's efforts to avoid self-destruction at the hands of its own creation. | If this were a movie, the events and cameos would be too numerous and star-studded to mention. It includes Xerxes, Spartans, Immortals, Alexander the Great, scythed chariots, and several of the greatest battles in history. | From Biblical-era coup conspiracies to the horrific aftermath of ancient combat this second installment of the series on the Kings of Achaemenid Persia goes where only Dan can take it. For better or worse… | Often relegated to the role of slavish cannon fodder for Sparta's spears, the Achaemenid Persian empire had a glorious heritage. Under a single king they created the greatest empire the world had ever seen. | The Americans are coming, but will the war be over by the time they get there? Germany throws everything into a last series of stupendous attacks in the West while hoping to avoid getting burned by a fire in the East they helped fan. | Politics, diplomacy, revolution and mutiny take center stage at the start of this episode, but mud, blood, shells and tragedy drown all by the end.", 'chan_desc': 'In "Hardcore History" journalist and broadcaster Dan Carlin takes his "Martian", unorthodox way of thinking and applies it to the past.
