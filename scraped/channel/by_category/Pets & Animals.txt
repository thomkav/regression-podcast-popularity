When we started researching the insect, we kept coming across the name Dr. Justin Schmidt. Grady had already heard of him—you may have too. He invented what’s called the Schmidt Sting Pain Index. The index measures just what it sounds like it would—how painful different insects’ stings are to humans. Dr. Schmidt is also the author of a book called The Sting of the Wild, which we recommend you all read. We had the great pleasure of having a Skype conversation from Dr. Schmidt from his office in Tucson, Arizona. We talked about not just the tarantula hawk wasp, but also about other stinging insects, why some insects die after they sting you, how much it hurts to get stung by a bullet ant, and lots more.

She\'s based in my neck of the woods (Woodinville, Washington) and we talk in detail about what a typical session would look like for those interested in this type of method for training your dog.

We talk about her initial analysis and what initial evaluation steps are important to her.

Some of the fun stuff we talk about are;  How Angie got started (we have a similar story about our sort of "pre-dog training" corporate lives) What led her into the field of dog training Some of the important keys for her to analyze how a dog behaves on first approach What she thinks of training with treats What kind of criteria leads her to use a 3-week training approach We\'ll talk a bit about thoughts on "pack" training How a "boarding" style of training differs and what is involved in the process  Angie\'s website is ADogsLifeTrainingSchool.com and you can find her on Facebook by clicking here.

A listener, Vicki wrote in. I\'ll jump in by starting with Vicki\'s email: I listened to your podcast on Skinner\'s Four Quadrants, and while you did an adequate job of summarizing some of the conditioning history, I think you\'re operating on some outdated information.

He has been a great colleague in the business, and was a great guest on my podcast back in episode 69, where we spoke about his practice, and talked about tips for newer dog trainers. In this session Ryan and I will talk about some training commands for your dog WITHOUT food (yes, it is possible). Ryan’s steps include the following essential steps for the sit command:  The proper “minimum” age to effectively train to sit; What the “sit’ should actually look like; What the command means to the dog; How to go to the next level so that the dog will hold the position.  Ryan talks about the “style” sit versus the “tuck” sit and getting certain concepts worked out first as building blocks for further training.  “Am I sure my dog understands the sit command?”  Ryan suggests that many owners believe that their dogs already understand and carry out the plan. But a lot have a version of the command covered, but it is essential to set up a sit AND release command, how tone of voice is a significant factor, and how the leash comes into play. Sean talks with Ryan about exactly what the “release” command looks like for dog owners. If you don’t have a specific word for your dog, or if it’s too common a word – you’ll get lots of great information just from this part of the show! The “down” command is discussed as well, and how food use is really only there on a limited basis for recall. And thanks to PUP Dog Rescue for their support.

If you\'re reading this and haven\'t heard the previous show (episode 73), I\'d strongly suggest going back to listen to that first. It will give some context to my deeper dive into what the concepts mean. We\'ll talk in this episode about the broader argument of the "purely positive" trainers, why I use a mix of all four, and why. Positive-Only" or "Positive-Focused" trainers vs. "Balanced" trainers I\'ll talk about the critical importance between the theoretical application of these principals when studied in a classroom and the "real world" application of those principals. It is an important distinction to make when deciding how you will apply the same thinking to your pet. The considerations for keeping correction in the mix is that it is sometimes dependent on the temperament of the dog - they are all different and have different tendencies. I\'ll give some examples. Additionally, I\'ll give some instances where the positive only concept can kind of backfire. I\'ll talk about the default rule and how it applies in this situation. The keys to these applications is that it is heavily dependent on the type of situation you are facing.

I get asked a lot about the references I make to B.F. Skinner and Skinner\'s Four Quadrants so it makes sense to go a bit further into what the concepts are behind positive and negative reinforcements, how trainers adapt to those concepts and in this and episode 74 I go into depth on my methods as well and how to apply it to your own pet. It\'s a fascinating understanding of behavior, conditioning, and training. There was so much information to digest that I decided to split it into two podcast episodes. Skinner\'s four quadrants were broken up like this;  Positive Punishment Negative Punishment Positive Reinforcement Negative Reinforcement  The idea stemmed from a few important predecessors to Skinner, and I talk briefly about their history and the evolution to the concept as applied by Skinner and how it is used for training today. Russian research physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who helped bridge the gap with classical conditioning - the idea that pairing an otherwise neutral occurrence paired with another thing that does have some meaning to a subject. Operant conditioning, as an alternative is a learning behavior. I\'ll get into that as well. John Watson, behavioral researcher was next in the evolution of conditioning about 15 years or so after Pavlov. Systematic desensitization was the goal.

If you remember Bennie Copeland from  Episode 61, you\'re going to love our continued conversation. Bennie is a trainer in the Nashville area, and recently published a book,\xa0Family Dog Fusion. It\'s full of insights and tips on how best to teach, train, love and build an amazing bond that you may not have thought possible. It\'s got some great step-by-step tools about behaviors, patience, and talks about what your dog wants based on certain behaviors. I\'d love if you\'d consider taking a look at the book on Amazon. Some of the things we cover;  "Balanced" techniques with dog training How others using correction as a method The varying opinions by different trainers, and how you can sort through what\'s right or wrong for your pet An interesting example of obeying the "down" command The decision to reward a dog for behaviors as they become instinctive.  We also talk about people\'s opinions about other high profile trainers\' techniques (like Cesar Millan), and how best to interpret all of those outside opinions.

Pressure to conform is not positive socialization.  \xa0 “Socialization should consist of introducing your dog, in a controlled mindful way, to a variety of new circumstances” “Exposure is not positive socialization” “We want to give our dogs the freedom to choose” “Honour each dog as unique and beautiful” “Let’s not force them into compromising positions where they’re not feeling safe, calm and happy” “Positive and proper socialization means that we honour our dogs” \xa0 Want More of Kathy?

Ok, so today is a little bit of a rant episode about what we truly want from our dogs! Are we actually giving up what we want most, for what we want right now?\xa0 While it is a possibility that you may want these things, we tend to spend a lot of energy trying to train behaviors out of our dogs, or train new habits in, while we fail to ask why we’re doing it in the first place. In this episode of Enlightened By Dogs, Kathy really breaks down for us how to stop training and start partnering with our dogs. She gives tons of examples and stories to back up the silly things we do, and why they may not actually be the best use of your time and effort! \xa0  Are you doing this thing over and over again without even thinking about it?

They understand exactly what's acceptable and what's not. When they're living with us however we often struggle to come to terms with what is okay and what's not. I sometimes find myself working with people whose homes have been turned into fish bowls where their puppy is like a piranha fish trying to bite anything that moves.Listen to the podcastIn this free\xa0podcast\xa0I cover off 3 key topics on How to stop puppy biting and mouthing.\xa01. How Biting & Mouthing works in natureHere we take a look at how it all works in nature and why we are making things hard for ourselves with some very old school training methods. If you have a young puppy then you may well discover that you have been told to set your puppy up to fail without even realising it.2. Summary of the solutionThe thing about stopping puppies biting and mouthing is that it's actually very simple when you know how. There is no need for screaming and shouting and certainly no need for tapping or smacking your puppy. In fact these things will often only make things worth. A calm approach with a simple yet effective consequence if they continue is all you need.3. Why things go wrongHere I cover off some of the most common reasons why\xa0things go wrong and explain exactly what to do to turn it around, including the missing piece of the jigsaw... The one thing that every puppy owner needs to do to put an end, quickly and easily, to all that biting and mouthing.Understand the real battle that's taking placeAs well as covering off all the practical steps we need to take, we also take a more in depth look at why we're really running into trouble. For example we look at how a mother dog works patiently with her pups, putting up with so much hassle, however when she draws the line in the sand and says that's enough, the pups will respect her and stop. So the question has to be asked “Why do our puppies fight back so hard?”, and the answer may surprise you!Q & A and more help if you need itAt the end of the podcast I answer a selection of your questions and show you where you get a whole load more information on stopping this and many other issues if you want more help. Of course this puppy problem\xa0is completely covered off in my video training website, theonlinedogtrainer.com.If you’re struggling with puppy mouthing and biting or have an older puppy or dog and are in trouble then help is here, enjoy the podcast!Have a great training day, and as always, love your dog ☺Thanks for Listening!\xa0 | If you have a new puppy or you’re struggling with an older puppy, run puppy training classes or you just love dogs, then you’ll love this podcast. It’s all about a refreshing new approach to puppy training.Taking a standNow a little word of warning… I’ve decided to make a splash and be just a tad controversial, so please be open-minded as you listen.Hey, they say that in life you either fit into the current mold and go with the flow, or do something different and make a change. And I decided a long time ago that I could certainly improve the world of dog and puppy training.So this recording should shake up the ‘puppy-school’ industry a little (who knows… maybe a lot!).Why Puppy School\xa0needs to changeAs soon as I finished the podcast, two things happened that really made me smile. Firstly, I received a phone call from a lady enquiring about my puppy training consultations. She needed some way of controlling her new puppy and explained how she’d already attended 4 puppy classes for $120, however it hadn’t been very helpful.Well as you can imagine, I was intrigued. “What did you learn?” I asked her very innocently.There was a long pause, I could almost hear her thinking, then she replied (rather unsure)… “Well, they taught us about the importance of vaccinations, worming and flea treatments… Oh and we learnt how to do a sit.”I secretly smiled to myself. I’d heard this so many times before. Then within a couple of minutes I received an email from another lady. Here are her exact words.\xa0“Hi Dan,We have two small dogs that we adopted from the pound 4 years ago (we think they are Powder Puffs crossed with Maltese). We’ve had problems from the start that puppy training school didn’t help with.”I stopped and thought “So this lady has endured 4 years of problems that should have been addressed when they were puppies. What are they teaching at these so-called puppy schools? More to the point, what aren’t they teaching?”So this issue is something I feel strongly about, and why I’ve taken a certain stance on it.As you can imagine, I was really pleased that I’d just completed this podcast; finally here’s something useful you can actually learn in your puppy training.So what’s covered off?Well without going into it too much, I’ve broken the podcast down into 4 topics:Topic 1 – The problem with most puppy classesTopic 2 – The “Secret to having an amazing puppy” training that should be taught but\xa0never isTopic 3 – The importance of socializing and optionsTopic 4 – A complete puppy training program that’s available to everyoneGet started nowOk… so if you want to save heaps of money, stress and time then turn up the volume and get ready to find out how to get your puppy off to the perfect start.The alternative is to check out my puppy training program on The Online Dog Trainer where you get to watch everything I do on video. There’s also a weekly video diary of the raising of my puppy, Moses, so you get to see all the steps involved in how to bring up the dog you’ve always wanted. Check it out here:\xa0theonlinedogtrainer.comHave a great training day, and as always, love your dog\xa0 | When the walk becomes dangerous…Taking your dog for a walk is supposed to be one of those pleasant experiences; relaxing, enjoyable and memorable. However for many people it’s memorable for all the wrong reasons! Dragged down the street, pulled off your feet, arm yanked out of its socket, damaged wrists and a lot of stress.It can actually be quite frustrating to see other dog owners with their dogs walking nicely beside them off leash.One lady I worked with told me about her how she had just bought a coffee to enjoy whilst walking her two black Labradors, when they spotted another dog and charged towards it. She ended up clinging to a lamppost, arms and legs wrapped around it, coffee in one hand and two dogs in the other! That was the final straw… She called me for help as soon as she made it home.So how do you go from this crazy situation where your dog is out of control from the very start to having a nice calm walk?\xa0When it comes to\xa0leash training your dog when its too excited to walk, you have to start right at the beginning.A totally different approachIn this podcast I explain a technique that I suggest only dog owners with the most energetic dogs need to apply. For most of us this method is not necessary. Becoming the pack leader and waiting for your dog to calm down at every stage of preparing for the walk will be enough to regain control as you leave the house.\xa0Taking the top off the dog’s energy firstIn maybe 1-in-20 difficult dogs who pull on the lead, I will apply this method of draining some of the dog’s energy before attempting to get them under control. Many of these dogs have not been for a walk for a long time as it’s become too stressful and dangerous for the owners, the dog and the public.The approach I explain in the podcast is simple but it needs to be done correctly or you’ll get nowhere fast because it’s very subtle, and it’s easy to miss the whole point. Here’s the general idea of what we’re doing.The standard approachLet me first summarize the standard approach to calming your dog down before the walk. Usually when we’re training our dogs to stay calm and walk nicely on the leash, we only continue with the walk if your dog is calm. So we would only progress through the door if your dog has calmed down to a reasonable level. Then we would only progress down the garden path if your dog is still calm. Simple enough?\xa0However with a very small number of dogs, this is never going to happen!Some dogs are just so super-charged up, due to their age, character, lack of exercise, breed, situation and many other factors, that it’s almost impossible for them to calm down before we take the top off their energy.Breaking old habits and creating new onesThis approach looks at taking them for a good run at the park. The clever and very subtle part is how we take advantage of our tired out dog when we return home and immediately put in place some brand new habits!Breaking old habits and forming new ones, new associations and new ways of behaving is half the battle. Once you get started it’s so much easier to keep improving.If you love learning about dog training or you have a super-charged dog… enjoy the podcast ☺To take a look at my complete dog training package\xa0click here.Have a great training day, and as always, love your dog. | In this FREE podcast we take a look at one of the most basic of all commands. Something that's surely so natural for a dog… but sadly for many people it isn't.So simple in theoryThe recall, as I like to call it, is all about getting your dog to return to your side. And in theory it's so simple. You call your dog and they come running towards you wagging their tail. Yet in reality so many people struggle with this. Unfortunately it results in dogs being walked only on by leash their entire lives, or worse still, they aren’t walked at all for fear of them never coming back.The FrustrationYou’ve probably seen it dozens of times. A frustrated dog owner slowly asking, then calling, then shouting for their dog to come as the dog carries on running around in circles having the time of their life. It can be amusing to watch but so annoying when its happening to you. Sometimes it can be far more subtle… your dog stands just out of reach, refusing to come, or running around just out of your grasp. It can all be so frustrating.Is recall really that hard?So is recall a tricky exercise to master? Something that only a few owners will be able to achieve at any high level? Or is there something that we're missing?The truth is\xa0recall is one of the most natural commands for almost any dog, and so simple to train when you know how. In this podcast I explain why it's such a natural action for dogs and why it actually works WITH their nature.6 Keys to a successful recallThen I’ll walk you through 6 of the most powerful ways to turn your recall around, and get your dog running back to you every time you call them. We cover off…The Contract: This is where it all starts to go wrong. When you call your dog what do they think is going to happen? Most likely your dog is thinking “OK so they want to put me on the leash.”Rewards: Most people have either stopped rewarding their dog completely or are using rewards but not in a smart way. Understanding how to use the three types of rewards is key.Control of your environment: What do you do when your dog doesn’t come when called? And how to prevent it in the first place.Your body language: We take a look at how your body language, movement, stance and voice can all determine whether your dog comes or not when called.Pack Leader: Dogs will listen and follow the commands of pack leaders far more than those they see as below them in the pack.Frequency: The overuse of recall is one of the biggest reasons it fails. Knowing when and how often to call your dog is key.More recall training resourcesOften putting in place just a few of the suggestions in the podcast can turn around your recall. Sometimes in a very short time. For those of you who are looking to perfect your technique, take it to another level or have a particularly tricky dog, I also explain where you can get a heap more information including another audio from myself with loads more tips on this topic.For my complete dog training video program including audios and videos on the recall and\xa0how to train your dog to come every time, take a look at The Online Dog Trainer.What's your recall like?Tell me in the comments section below just how frustrating your recall is right now... I'd love to know, and offer some help!Have a great training day, and as always, love your dog. | In life you can accept what the norm is and go with the flow, or you can decide to do things differently. I feel that the dog and puppy training world needs a real shake up. There are so many accepted practices and beliefs that don’t really make any sense and need to be put into perspective. All of this is based on my experience of working with thousands of dogs… and this is what I’ve learnt from them. This is what I’ve seen and what they’ve shown me.Myth No.1: Dog training takes lots of time- Sadly some people spend years trying to get their dogs under control. However when you know what to do, dog training is simple, fun, straight forward and you can have a different dog often in just a matter of days…Myth No.2: Dogs will only have one pack leader in the home- Wrong. Dogs are happy to have more than one pack leader. If you are a family with many people in the home you really want your dog to respect everyone, not just one person.Myth No.3 Attending puppy school is imperative- Not so. There are thousands of people who attend puppy school and end up with serious behavioral issues. Many puppy schools do not provide the important information owners need such as how to establish yourself as the pack leader. Too much focus is put on learning a ‘sit’ and a ‘down!’ Socializing is an important aspect of puppy training however it can be achieved in many different ways for free.Myth No.4: Quality dog training is expensive- Not so. Most dog and puppy training is expensive for what you actually get. At the end of the training people seem to have learnt very little. When you know where to go you can get excellent information at a fraction of the cost. For a complete solution to puppy training and dog training have a look at my Online Dog Training resource.Myth No.5: You can train a dog using only positive reinforcement- No, but it sounds good. Very few dogs are just so perfectly behaved from puppy through to being an adult dog that they only need positive encouragement. Like children, most dogs also need to be guided, redirected, stopped, and sometimes shown that some behaviors are unacceptable.Myth No.6: You should never use food treats- Nope. Food treats have their place in dog training and great dog trainers know when and how to use them. Using food treats with a dog or puppy is just like rewarding your children for excellent behavior and it goes a long way to reinforcing that behavior.Myth No.7: You can’t teach an old dog new tricks- Oh yes you can! Many of the dogs that I work with are around a year old. A smaller percentage of them are much older, around 10 years old, and they can all change their behavior. Of course prevention is better than cure, but it’s never too late when you understand what’s going on.Myth No.8: Hard work and practice is all you need- Nope. Sometimes hard work and lots of practice is not enough. You need to actually change what you’re doing and try something else. The definition of insanity is to do the same thing and expect a different result. If it’s not working, you have to try a different approach.Myth No.9: Little dogs are easier to train than big dogs- Not always! Sometimes bigger dogs are calmer and easier, and sometimes little dogs are incredibly difficult. Of course the opposite can also be true. Just like with people, you can’t generalize all big people as being a certain way and all little people being another!Myth No.10: Most dogs causing trouble are stupid- Oh no they are not! In fact very often the dogs that cause trouble are the really clever, intelligent dogs who would naturally become the pack leaders in the wild.

If you have ever wondered whether or not you are using it correctly and making the most out of it, then this podcast will answer all those questions.Many people are using food when there’s absolutely no need for it, others are making things more complicated by using it, and some are not using it when it could really help with their training.It’s important to note that things in the dog training world have changed over time. Years ago, the use of food in training was absolutely unheard of. Now you will find some dog trainers shoving food into their dog’s mouths for doing virtually nothing. So if you find yourself confused, hoping that maybe there’s a middle ground that would make sense to you that has been overlooked then I think you will enjoy what I have to say.Here is a summary of what we go through in the podcast: How To Use Food In Your Dog Training1. Why you should use foodFood is like money to a dog… for many dogs it’s their training currency.There are some behavioral issues that can be fixed in an instant with food.I answer some of the key questions such as shouldn’t dogs just do as you say without having to use food?2. What are the exercises where we seriously consider using food?The use of food during the puppy training phase.How food can be used to help stop some behavioral issues.How to use food as a powerful distraction.3. When not to use foodWhy using food treats will never replace dog psychology.Why using food treats is only a part of the solution.The danger of not using treats wisely (when your dog outwits you!).How treats can actually encourage the behavioral issues you are trying to extinguish when they are used at the wrong time.4.

That food used correctly is a very powerful tool. Simply throwing a bowl of food down in front of your dog each morning without a second thought will become a thing of the past!So enjoy the podcast, and let me know what you think.Thanks for reading, have a great day and as always, love your dog. | This post will give you an overview of what’s included in this episode:\xa0Barking When Left Alone.\xa0If you have a dog that's barking and barking every time you leave the house, then this is for you…But if your pooch is calm when you're out, then please, in the comment section below, tell me what issues you’d like me to cover in future episodes.Alternatively if you have a dog or puppy and want help with other problems or you need some dog training, then go straight to my video website and watch over 250 of my training videos at\xa0The Online Dog Trainer\xa0- try it all for just a $1!Helping dogs who bark when they are left at home alone.So what’s in this podcast? Well let me explain:Understanding the causeThe first thing that I help explain is the reason behind why most dogs are barking when they are left. Very often we assume or think that it is our dogs way of showing us that they are bored, or just being naughty however this couldn’t be further from the truth.In fact a good way to test out the bored theory is to ask yourself if your dog is bored when you are at home… If they are calm and relaxed most of the day then the chances are that your dog is not simply bored! (And dogs are not naughty for the fun of it – so that rules that out).The two main causesIn fact the two main scenarios that cause your dog to bark are trigger barking\xa0and separation anxiety. They are very different scenarios. Trigger barking is where something sets your dog off and your dog simply does not stop. They are stressed and just keep on going. Whereas separation anxiety doesn’t need a trigger to get your dog barking, they simply become stressed when you leave and bark continuously.Inside the podcast I help explain fully what is going on in these two situations and explain what the solution is.Other techniquesThere are so many approaches to solving barking but most of them do not go to the root cause of the problem. In some situations they can certainly help and are worth trying however I would recommend only in conjunction with the basic solution that I have put together. On their own they are very unlikely to work.We cover all the home alone barking issuesHere is a short list of some of the other things that we also discuss which\xa0impact\xa0your dog's barking when they're alone…Exercise – does it help, is it the solution?The Environment – the impact that making your dog comfortable can haveHerbal remedies vs drugs – would I recommend them?Music, TV – whether it can help your dogInside vs outside – where is best for your dogLarge area or small – what will work bestWhy harsh methods that just try to “stop the barking” are missing the pointAs you can see it is an action packed podcast. At the end of it you will see barking dogs in a fresh new light and you will see that stopping barking dogs even when you are not at home is not complicated – you just need to know how :) and hopefully your neighbours will love you even more!Dogs are beautiful and amazing creatures. They deserve to be treated and understood for what they are. This podcast is all committed to us understanding them and helping them better.Getting it rightSo if you are wondering how to stop your dogs barking when they are left at home alone then you have found the right place. First listen to my free podcast and if you enjoy it and it all makes sense then I’d suggest you get straight onto solving the cause of the problem by checking out my video website\xa0The Online Dog Trainer\xa0- there's a whole section on Barking with loads of videos of me dealing with the problem in other people's homes, and specifically, videos on\xa0Barking When Left Alone.\xa0Join here:\xa0The Online Dog Trainer\xa0(for over 300+ detailed, step-by-step videos covering every issue of dog training, including The 5 Golden Rules of being the Pack Leader) | Listen to the Doggy Dan Podcast Show No.5 by using the player above, or subscribing to iTunes and listening on your mobile device. This post will give you an overview of what’s included in this episode: Socializing a new puppy. If you have a new puppy and want to understand what socializing is all about and why it’s so important then you’ve come to the right place…If you don’t have a puppy, or yours is already socialized properly, then please, in the comment section below, tell me what issues you’d like me to cover in future episodes.Alternatively if you have a puppy and want help with other puppy problems or dog training you can go straight to my video website for help and watch my training videos at The Online Dog Trainer\xa0- over 300 videos for just a $1 trial!Why, when, where and how should we socialize your puppy?Inside the podcast I cover off these important questions:\xa0WhySocializing your puppy is one of the most important activities that you can do. It allows them to experience a whole variety of different dogs at an age where they are most tolerant and submissive. Inside the podcast I help you see the whole experience through your dogs eyes so that they have the best experience possible when socializing. Think of it like taking a child to childcare when they are young. It is important that they learn how to behave around many children. This is not to say that they have to be best mates with everyone!\xa0WhenTiming is crucial when it comes to socializing. If you leave it too late then you can really run into trouble. Often you will find yourself balancing advice from your vets that you need to wait for more vaccinations before you socialize your puppy. Inside the podcast I talk through how I would weigh up these two important pieces of information and come to a decision.\xa0WhereThere are many different ways to socialize your puppy, one solution does not suit everyone. You can take your puppy to pre-puppy training, puppy training, doggy day care, the vet, or the park. Many people choose to do the socialization themselves and do a great job. Inside the podcast I point out the benefits and downsides of each option and leave you to decide what suits you best since there is no one way to go about socializing. Do-it-yourself is a perfectly good option when you do it correctly.HowThe most important part is knowing how to actually socialize your puppy in a way that will ensure that they have a good experience and can take that into the next doggy meet and greet. Knowing when and how to step-in to stop overly excited play and when to leave your puppy is crucial to helping set boundaries for your new puppy. Getting this wrong can make the situation worse and create a mountain out of a mole-hill!The three C’s to socializing\xa0I also cover off three important aspects to socializing:Calm – how to maintain a calm situation and how it affects your puppies experience.Control – why you need to be in control of your puppy and a simple way to achieve thisChoose – the importance of selecting the right dogs or puppies to socialize with and why older dogs are so important.As you can see there is a massive amount of tips and advice inside the podcast helping you to get this crucial aspect of your puppy training right, first time.\xa0Some classics mistakes to avoid\xa0To ensure your success I have decided it makes sense to alert you to some of the biggest mistakes that people make when socializing their puppy and how to avoid them. So often people only find out about these things when the opportunity has passed them by. Sometimes just a little bit of knowledge can make a big difference.So if you really want to end up with a dog friendly, well behaved, dog-sociable-dog then make sure you are aware of:\xa0The most common error that people make when socializing their puppyThe biggest reason that socializing goes wrong and does not workWhat you need to do to ensure that your puppy stays friendly with dogs as they grow up.There you go! If you have a new puppy then I suggest that you listen to the podcast and enjoy learning about why, when, where and how to socialize your puppy and the mistakes to avoid so that you end up with the dog of your dreams.\xa0And remember, for those of you after immediate help with your puppy training, check out my video website\xa0The Online Dog Trainer\xa0– you’ll also get access to Project Moses, the 8 week–1 year video diary of me raising my puppy, Moses (over 30 videos).And to say thanks for reading this post, I'm giving you free access to 5 videos from my training website.

Very often there has been no aggression but your gut instinct tells you that all is not well and it would be wise to nip the behaviour in the bud. I couldn’t agree more. Prevention is better than cure and that's what this podcast is all about.But first to that question…Excitement or Aggression?“So is my dog being aggressive or are they just excited?” This is the big question that many people are asking themselves, (and often me) as their dogs race up bounding and barking at dogs that they meet. The answer is not simply one or the other, and in most cases I would suggest it is a bit of both. As I explain in the podcast the more excited your dog is the more chance that their behaviour may be interpreted at aggressive or threatening and so the calmer your dog is the better your chances of a calm encounter.What should I do when my dog is pulling and lungingInside the podcast I go through in detail your three options...Walk away – if your dog is way too excitedLet them meet – if your dog is calmer than usualCalming your dog down, then make a decision – this is where the training comes inIt may sound a bit obvious but having those three options clear in your mind will give you some immediate direction as you approach a dog. Knowing what your options are helps you to select the right one which in turn will help you to achieve your goal.An amazing journey for answersI also look at one lady's quest to solve her dog's over-excited barking towards other dogs and how 4 different trainers had given 4 completely different solutions to this issue, none of which have brought her any joy. We look briefly at some of the unsuccessful approaches she has tried, what she has learnt from the 35 dog training books she has read and the fascinating insights that she has gained. This podcast is dedicated to her commitment to finding an answer!Calming your dog downThe real key to success is understanding how to calm your dog down. Inside the podcast I explain how the following areas will help you achieve this.Practical tools and techniques – some of the methods that I use everyday for calming your dog down that are especially useful on the walk and at the parkHow being the pack leader at home will result in a completely different dog at the park (calmer!)The trick of calming an over excited dog and what you are trying to achieve when you are training them to be calm. (this is a very subtle point but is crucial for success and often overlooked.)So if you are are wondering how to interpret and alter your dogs behavior as they approach other dogs then you have found the place.

This podcast is jammed packed with action ideas, time hacks and true Champion transformation strategies! Foster failing & why it is a great way to cherry pick the dog that best works for your family and existing dog(s).\xa0 Having your puppy drag the leash.\xa0 I almost always mention this.\xa0 If your puppy is a work in progress this is a must, must must!! I don’t want you to be patient.\xa0 F patience…Instead be anxious and excited to “drive your puppies drives!”\xa0 Mainly its prey/play drive (tug/fetch and play with other dogs) and it’s chewing drive.\xa0 In my course and part of some of my other podcasts I cover having your dog off leash or mimicking off leash by using a retractable leash. Great, thanks for following my advice to have your puppy rock the leash.\xa0 Now it’s chewing on it.\xa0 Check out my IGTV to get that leash out of your dogs mouth.\xa0 Remember, if given the choice between your kids, your pant leg or your rug you would rather have your puppy chew YOUR leash.\xa0 You can lightly, but directly take back control of the leash (your #1 guidance tool & key to good habits!). Sprint, cool down, rest: Get your puppy’s drive on the right station at the right time. Check out the daily regimen webinar in my app. Sprint: 1 of 5 activities that burns your puppy’s primal energy (short term relief), makes him more guidable when you pair confinement with a bone (the next step/medium term relief) and as you train “no” through “go” you develop your dogs overall disposition and CANINE CHARACTER (if done correctly)!!!  Food based training Tug/fetch Off leash simulation Loose leash walking Play with other dogs  Cool Down: Pair confinement (crate) or semi-confinement (leash/baby gates) and a bone. Rest: Super-duper passed out sleeping so you can act like you don’t have a puppy and catch up/get ahead so you can wake up junior before he wakes you up and do it again!! Stack activities to get more energy out of your dog.\xa0 For example play tug/fetch first then walk your puppy, especially as the last sprint of the day. Make sure to withhold a high value bone to help keep your puppy up longer!! Do what I just mentioned and then sic him on one of his favorite bones he hasn’t gotten for half a day, so you know he’ll go at it even if he is tired.\xa0 By doing this you are EARNING the right to sleep in. Doggie daycare as a very young puppy: If there aren’t illnesses floating around your local area get this puppy to doggie day care.\xa0 Just don’t become overly reliant on it. Take better care of yourself so you have peak energy to devote to your puppy. \xa0Hit the sac at a decent time.\xa0 Put the screens away.\xa0 No scrolling, no Netflix binging before bedtime.\xa0 You got a Champion that you need to wake up before!! You need to develop a relentless dog on the field and one that relents off the field.\xa0 They go hand-in-hand.\xa0 THIS IS KEY!! The best defense is a great offense.\xa0 Channel your puppy’s drives. If you get and train your dog in an excited state through play it lends well to situations off the field like when guests come over for example. Barking/whining is just another reason you need to drive the process.\xa0 It’s sooo much easier to manage your puppy’s energy and set it up for success in the crate (blanket over it, Alexa playing some music (my champions love Kenny G) in a quiet area of the house.\xa0 Once habituated to this you can then move the crate to a more convenient location for you. \xa0 You need to earn the right to sleep through the night. Stop managing time and management energy. Training versus development… Training to me means you are “going through the motions” doing societies version of having a checklist of non-life skills rich activities.\xa0 Development intentionally chips away at the rough edges of you puppy’s character until your dog is super easy to live and do things with. The only reason I train a dog is so I can set it up to be developed all day long.\xa0 What I say, “what we do on the field as a coach is the exact same thing we do off the field, all day long!” Pace your training sessions in a way that reduces it barking, laying down, checking out, scavenging. You need to develop a relationship with your local doggie daycare, so you have as many energy and boarding options as possible.

This should be done with tact and finesse.) I tell my clients you are dancing with your dance partner; you just happen to be lead partner. \xa0This concept allows the leash to be used for a split second in hopes of regaining an energy syncing.\xa0 Yes, much like good dance partners two being flow as one. \xa0 Have you ever watched a musician eyes closed become one with their instrument during a solo?\xa0 Have you ever joined in on that action while in the crowd (these last couple lines don’t sound right, but you know what I mean…)? \xa0Times like this at a concert, riding a wave, gliding down a hill, dancing with the one you love or being in a flow state with your dog to me is one of the best parts of life.\xa0 When I work with a dog I am not thinking about the next move, I am just moving.\xa0 If you think, you miss a note, step on your dance partners toe, fall off your board and loose the moment. \xa0\xa0Resetting sucks, but you should long to get back in that flow state. The massive dichotomy of the light leash pop and the flow combined with the more scientific, formula-based weaning off rewards and guidance is where at least in my system where the results come from.\xa0 Not to mention all the prep work making sure your puppy is ready to begin doing loose leash walking drills. Remember the manage first, coach second and if done correctly you won’t have to ref much at all. -Pressure-Present Leash Charging Prep Step.\xa0 -My systems training prep and actual training drills charges your verbal, leash and body language. Once charged how can we use it as gracefully and efficiently as possible? If you do this you should be able to get lost in the game without taking your eyes off of the achievement of your training objectives. -It is important to make the reward process an event so food can exit stage left while the predictable party is still occurring. Look at food as a TEMPORARY bridge.\xa0 The praise and affection will still be around long after the food/play hype has left town.

The primary topic is using the leash to communicate with your puppy. I jump in and out of rabbit holes covering these things as well: Leash (the spotting tool):  pop (NOT Punitive) pulsate pressure 2-inch slack (as you will be ready to spot your puppy)  My stance on “no” based training Running your puppy’s development like a business. Get out of surfacey puppy ownership mode. We should make it a point to connect deeper with all the relationships we have in our life, right?\xa0 Why not yourself and your puppy? To maintain your puppy’s sit say intervene when you see it’s chest moving forward.\xa0 Even better be calculating and smoothly manipulating the flow of the session to suite your puppy’s abilities.\xa0 Be astute to all the small things you can do to have your puppy not even begin to move it’s chest forward.\xa0 At that point you are already being reactive from a coaching standpoint.\xa0 Don’t think one step ahead as a checkers player think 3 steps ahead as a chess player.\xa0 Umbilical cord training, done right. Bridge extreme activity with extreme down time with a ______ bone and ______confinement (you have lots of options depending on the scenario). Skip up factor: When a puppy feels vulnerable in an unknown environment and seeks to stay with you because it feels more secure. \xa0\xa0This helps off leash tendencies naturally by tapping into your puppy’s fear state.\xa0 You want a healthy level of fear built into your puppy’s understanding of the world.\xa0 \xa0Coupling intentionally formed, natural tendencies with formal and game-based training is where the magic happens! Socialization before your puppy has had all it’s rounds of vaccines.\xa0 Utilize your friends and neighbors’ dogs for socialization.\xa0 Limited window to fit in a lot of development.\xa0 Dog Parks: It’s not a matter of if, but when and to what degree something stupid will happen. Establish a few “go to” places to train outside.\xa0 Modify or use the proper leash set up to compensate for them if necessary.\xa0 Having a big open area fenced in while allowing your dog to wear a long line give the feel of complete trust with max confidence.\xa0 It takes the fear out of off leash training. \xa0Outside separation anxiety is a bonded dog. Zip ties rock😊 Scaling up: Get more with less! \xa0Have an exit strategy in the beginning about weaning off guidance (verbal body language and leash) and rewards at the beginning of your training.\xa0 You will space out the amount of food rewards (you still need to acknowledge your puppy just gave you what you wanted by moving forward or rewarding via praise or play) and guidance at distractions levels 1-3.\xa0 Still, you’ll keep them frequent at distraction levels 4-7.\xa0 For distraction above 7 you’ll food reward your puppy for just staying in “the pocket” with you.\xa0 This is with your puppy’s normal kibble get off the treat train!!! What stance are you in? Your feet, arms, hand and general body position matters. E collars???? Puppy vacc bigger picture When you lightly pop and walk away you need to have some gusto to transition your pup back in the zone with you. \xa0\xa0Think flamboyant drill instructor. Loose leash vs. off leash vs. off leash simulation \xa0 Compliance training is your puppy’s ticket to future outings with the family!

Claiming: Charge your verbal feedback and use a light positive, negative or lack of verbal feedback to guide your puppy’s decisions.  Body Language:  Push: Maintain your sit stay, don’t proceed, cutting off energy. “No way little man.. for realsies" Pull: Create an energy wave to help captivate your puppy in coming to you.\xa0 The party is over here little dude…(just don’t forget to sit, stay and stare when you get to the party)  Leash (the spotting tool):  pop (NOT Punitive) pulsate pressure 2 inch slack (as you will be ready to spot your puppy)  Other concepts covered  Being confident when training Mimic the trainer, kind of like how an actress \xa0“gets in character.” Time hacks Socialization Natural recall Loose leash walking How to gain momentum when doing coming when called Why a defined sit stay stare at the end of coming when called matters.

How can you install an off switch in advance of that situation? Teaching your puppy to do nothing is vital.\xa0 Picture having a chill kid on a long plane ride. Increase the power of the tone of your voice.\xa0 In the Champion Puppy Training System I teach my clients to be intentional with your verbal communication including praise both when you are formally training your puppy, but even more importantly keeping that same level of intentionality of verbal communication in mundane situations. What’s your end goal? Chart out how you are going to get from where you are at today to where you want to be. Are you seeking out education on your end?\xa0 If you’re not growing yourself, then you can’t grow your puppy. Are you getting creative in mixing up how and where you train your puppy?\xa0 The distractions and results should be getting higher and higher while the rewards and guidance are getting lower and lower. That’s how you know your technique and approach works.\xa0 Training puppies around distractions has a residual payback in that they are that much better in low level distraction environments (i.e. around your home). Starting points…actually getting traction.\xa0 Start small… simply consuming food while sitting. You only need to get to the tipping point once regarding a certain level of responsiveness or conquering your puppy’s focus or ability to let things go around distractions.\xa0 After that it should be so much easier, just routine or just maintenance.\xa0 Either way, it won’t be the calculated, working up toward process that you will have to go through to get to that initial tipping point…that traction point. \xa0 Start at your puppy belly’s, then it’s mind then it’s heart. \xa0\xa0 Motivation makes up for sloppy coaching. Manager can compensate for the coach initially.

Sibling dogs are great because you have a way to tire your puppies out that doesn’t involve you.\xa0 The thing I stress to sibling owners is to “divide and conquer.”\xa0 To me “conquering” is installing an off switch and the ability to naturally, by their own selves not hyper focus and react to distractions. If not, you are going to have the “2 stooges” on your hand feeding off each other’s energy.\xa0 This is especially true during greetings or any time they might be stimulated.\xa0 Sibling puppies need to be able to be separated and be okay with it. Sibling separation anxiety will happen unless you are proactive about it. This just means that you must work a little harder to gain traction earlier on in their ownership journey.\xa0 All puppy owners need “more traction,” I’ll give you examples and ideas in the podcast. Here are some other notes to refer to after checking out the podcast: -Proof your puppy! This means setting your puppy up for possible failure or a possible success.\xa0 This means you practice your training around real high-level distractions.\xa0 This is an area where many owners begin to see their approach crumble.\xa0 Practice on Saturday morning in your pajamas with some coffee, so you don’t look like a schmuck when you need your puppy to shine! -Learn from your puppy’s play techniques and apply the same energy and mechanics to your food and play sessions. -To pet your puppy without being nipped make it a point to:  Only pet your puppy when tired. After you have earned the right. When it is sitting. After it has earned the right. When you are rewarding it with food.  \xa0-The Look Command is where I charge the puppies ability to respond to you.\xa0 Then we can apply it to stay. -You should expect for your puppy to be nipped when touched.\xa0 You should channel that through play (primarily tug). -As you are increasing your puppies focus on playing on the right toy, with the right person, the right way…be INTENTIONAL!! -You should be introducing your puppy to rules of the game through food -While you are doing the food based training you should be petting your puppy while praising it so you increase the value of your voice while having your touch be more of an affection reward versus a prompt for a 3 stooges scene. -Stop Squandering your voice\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 -You need to own your puppy\xa0 -Reserve your affection -Don’t knowingly have a sloppy ownership approach, cause you are already missing a bunch of low hanging fruit you should already be taking advantage of that isn’t even on your radar (yet???)!!! -Getting in the flow of a daily regimen is crucial -Learn from different avenues of media.\xa0 IF YOU DON’T MAX OUT YOUR 24 HOURS YOU WON’T MAX OUT YOUR PUPPY’S! - Whether you’re doing food-based training, training though play, compliance training, loose leash walking, off-leash simulation you should be incorporating the same body mechanics, timing and energy you observe in your puppy. \xa0\xa0 That is what I did.\xa0 Wake up and stop doing what you want to do.\xa0 Don’t do things your way.\xa0 Do things the puppy’s way and you will end up getting what you want.

September 27, 2019\xa0\xa0Welcome to episode 26 of Endurance Horse Podcast where we will hear from not only the winner of Tevis 2019, though also from volunteers, crew and more riders! \xa0 Did you know that the Tevis Cup, also known as the The Western States Trail Ride, has been held every year since 1955?\xa0 This makes Tevis the most established modern day endurance ride in the world, possibly the universe.\xa0 Tevis has been the inspiration for other such great rides as The Big Horn 100 and The Tom Quilty Gold Cup.\xa0 It is amazing to me how one group of riders, with an idea can establish something so inspirational that has been standing the test of time for several decades, and that has inspired others to build on what was started by Wendell Robie and his friends. \xa0\xa0Only roughly half (54%) of the people who toe the line to begin Tevis will complete it.\xa0 The statistics at teviscup.org show that from 1955 until 2017 roughly 10,365 have started Tevis and only 5,615 had finished. To finish, is truly to win. I am equally inspired by those who did not finish, as I am by those who did, because it takes the same amount of courage to even attempt to finish and ride the Tevis. No one truly knows what may happen during a ride or how their day will go. We are grateful for those of you who send in an audio, whether you found your buckle at the end of the ride or not this time, thank you for including the listeners of Endurance Horse Podcast in your journey.\xa0\xa0Of course, there was one horse rider team that did cross the finish line first and that was the young and talented Miss Sanoma Blakeley of Oregon. \xa0 Sanoma crossed the finish line at 9:27 pm just ahead of a three time winner of the Tevis Cup. \xa0 It is a testament to this young lady that her horse, RA Ares Bay, aka Goober pulsed down quickly and vetted out sound at the end of arguably the world’ toughest one day 100 mile endurance ride in the world.\xa0 Sanoma has a proud heritage of endurance riding.\xa0 Sanoma’s mother has 6 Tevis buckles, Sanoma’s father has 5 Tevis Buckles and Sanoma’s brother won the Haggin Cup in 2014 at the age of 15.\xa0 As if that is not an interesting enough of a tale for you, Sanoma’s 2019 Tevis Cup champion, Goober, was found as a two year old on Craigslist, an add was offering him up as a free horse.\xa0 Goober is her dad’s horse, and apparently earned the name Goober by his silly antics such as leading other horses around.\xa0 Sanoma has said she has the greatest parents in the world, and the greatest horse, and who could argue with that?\xa0 Let’s hear a brief recount of the Tevis 2019 journey from Sanoma herself, without further ado, I bring to you episode 26 of Endurance Horse Podcast, enjoy.The Wendell Robie trophy is awarded to horses who have five Tevis completions.\xa0 If you know of a horse who has met these requirements and not received the award, please follow this link for more information.\xa0 Wendell Robie Award.Sanoma Blakeley Oregon, USABlakeley Endurance StablesBlakeley Endurance Stables on Facebook\xa0\xa0Angie Mickleson North Dakota, USA\xa0Gwen Hall Colorada, USA\xa0Kerrie Tuley California, USA\xa0Jen McCabe Idaho, USA\xa0Dante LaPierre North Dakota, USA\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Christina Hyke Wisconsin, USA\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Creator of Endurance Horse Podcast\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Endurance Horse Podcast\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Join the Group on Facebook\xa0\xa0About the creator of the Endurance Horse Podcast:Christina Hyke lives in southern Wisconsin with her sweet husband, Jim. \xa0Chris is an equine & pet photographer who also happens to love the trails and distance riding.\xa0 It was the love of covering miles through beautiful territory on good horses that inspired her to create a podcast about it to share stories with other riders from around the world.\xa0\xa0www.christinahyke.com\xa0\xa0Cheers & Happy Trails!\xa0www.christinahyke.com | Welcome to\xa0Episode 25 of\xa0Endurance Horse Podcast\xa0THE ALL MUSTANGS EPISODE OF ENDURANCE HORSE PODCASTCreated\xa0 September 6, 2019\xa0Hello and Welcome to Episode 25 of Endurance Horse Podcast!What do you think of when you hear the word MUSTANG?\xa0 The iconic wild west horses running through the landscape?\xa0 The P51 MUSTANG tearing through the skies of WWII? \xa0 Or maybe the sleek design of Ford’s famous muscle car?\xa0 Well this month, the cover of Endurance News is graced with the image of the kind of Mustang that this podcast is about today!As mentioned above, when you get your Endurance News in the mail for September 2019, look closely at that young rider, her smile and the mustang that is carrying her all the way…..\xa0TO ADOPT A MUSTANG:Bureau of Land Management\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0BLACK HILLS WILD HORSE SANCTUARY visit their website:www.wildmustangs.com to support\xa0\xa0Mustang Endurance Horse on Facebook\xa0Melissa Coolich & ZERO SUM Wisconsin, USAWild Horse Wild RideExtreme Mustang MakeoverCoolich Endurance\xa0Coolich Endurance on Facebook\xa0\xa0Amber & Isidro Espinoza Arizona, USAExtreme Mustang Makeover\xa0Isidro Espinoza HorsemanshipIsidro Espinoza Horsemanship YouTube ChannelIsidro Espinoza Horsemanship on Facebook\xa0\xa0Andrea Maitland Arizona, USAWild Horse Wild RideMustang Heritage Foundation\xa0Arizona Endurance Riders Club on FacebookZonies- Arizona Distance, Endurance and Longriders\xa0\xa0Jen McCabe & ODIN Idaho, USA\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Valerie Jaques & HOSS California, USA\xa0\xa0\xa0Carol Crawford \xa0USA\xa0\xa0TJ Clibborn Wisconsin, USAA True PartnershipA True Partnership on Facebook\xa0TJ (Terry) Clibborn is available for horsemanship and colt starting clinics.

I had a vendor booth there for my photography & it gave me a good segue to also share my love of distance riding with other riders. What I learned shocked me a little bit- here I was at an event that is plum full of riders from all over the Midwest- this is a 3 day horse fair in Madison Wisconsin that boasts over 300 educational clinics/seminars in three days, over 500 vendors and typically sees over 61,000 attendees.\xa0At this horse owner filled event - most (as in likely over 70%) of the people I talked with about endurance had no idea what it was. Let that sink in. At a horse fair. Horse people did not know what endurance is.\xa0The second thing I learned was that when I met riders who did know what endurance was- they thought it was a west coast only sport.\xa0Even though there are 56 rides hosted in the Midwest Region.\xa0\xa0The third thing I learned was that the riders who did know what endurance was - did not think they could do it because they did not own an Arabian. Some people also felt they were too old, that the sport is for those under 25.\xa0\xa0This podcast is to encourage those riders who maybe thinking of trying distance riding- that you can do it with any sound horse that you condition up well.\xa0Some breeds of horses, generally,\xa0fair\xa0better in higher temperatures/humidity than others and some horse breeds in general do have naturally lower heart rates- though I would like to tell you that here are some horse owners that are riding a non traditional breed in endurance and they are loving it.\xa0\xa0To confirm that the Arabian & the half Arabian are the go to horse in the sport I reached out to Mike Maul & AERC. Here are the 2018 numbers of breeds entered at AERC rides. Thank you Mike for providing the numbers & thank you AERC office for always being so helpful on the phone or by emails.\xa0\xa0It is easy to see by the statistics Mike Maul so kindly sent to me that Arabian & half Arabian horses are not just seemingly the dominant breed in endurance- they surely out number the rest, easily. However, there are many great qualities to other breeds & this inspiration for episode 24 is to encourage you to try the breed you already have or the one you love.\xa0\xa0I am sharing as the first audio in this episode, the before/during and after of my little 13 year old mare’s first LD with me, just over a week ago on August 10th.\xa0\xa0I followed a conditioning plan, a few hiccups along the way (hoof abscess) Though much training & prayers- we got there. \xa0I’m sharing Grace’s update on this episode because she was basically a love baby. She is by our Trakehner Karino’s Fire & our of our paint mare- Baily 💖 we intended Grace to maybe be shown in dressage- or trail ride. Certainly never pictured her as an endurance prospect. Though here I am, sharing with you the audio of our non traditional horse, a much adored mare, a big puppy dog personality.....without further ado, here is my emotional moment out somewhere between mile 21/22 when I knew that she was going to finish strong. \xa0Thank you Grace for such an enjoyable ride- and all the rides we rode to condition to get to this point. Thanks for being the horse that added to my record & carried that 25 miles closer to my 1,000 mile goal. Here’s Grace…..as a few hours young filly.\xa0 Am sharing this image of Jim walking with her for the first time, as he has been by my side all of the way, and also because this is how I kept seeing her on my ride, that is part of what caused emotion to swell, the other part that got me was the song “Flawless” that kept playing in my mind. It has the verse of “Grace, Grace, God’s Grace….” And I felt that it truly was the prayers that helped her abscess heal in time for the ride. \xa0 So there was that to make me emotional at mile 21, her as a baby and also the fact that the conditioning plan had worked.\xa0 I knew this was the right ride for her to begin.Grace settled into her campsite August 9, 2019. She is amazing.\xa0Love this little mare so much.\xa0Jim with Baily &\xa0Grace\xa0Song: “Flawless”\xa0By: Mercy MeAlbum: Welcome to the New\xa0\xa0Patricia Clark North Carolina, USAOff theTrack StandardbredsEast Meets WestUnited States Trotting Association\xa0Year End Awards & ChampionshipsNew Vocations Racehorse Adoptions ProgramTeam Standardbred Endurance Horses on Facebook\xa0Jo Harder Florida, USAOTTB - Off Track ThoroughbredsT.I.P.

The Big Horn 100 predates the creation of the AERC, American Endurance Ride Conference, that is an impressively long running ride!\xa0 If you have been doing endurance very long, chances are you have heard of the Big Horn 100.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Shell, Wyoming is the base camp of the legendary Big Horn 100 mile, 1 day ride.\xa0 Twice this ride has been host to the Race of Champions, and a champion you must be to ride from the elevation of 4,000 feet rising to the climb of 10,000 feet elevation.\xa0 The Big Horn is a single loop of some of the most challenging, rugged and beautiful trail that America has to offer.\xa0 It has been told to me by more than one rider that the difficulty of this trail rivals that of the Tevis Cup.\xa0 I, personally, cannot say, as I have not ridden either trail, though I feel honored to share the stories from this trail with you, and maybe some of you are hearing about this ride for the first time and will hear the call of the Big Horn Mountains and take up the challenge to ride through climbing mountains, wild flowers and wild weather.\xa0 Can you hear it?\xa0 The Big Horn is calling you.\xa0This year Big Horn 100 was managed by Cindy Collins.\xa0 Cindy loves this ride and from all the good feedback I have seen online and in the files that have been sent to the podcast, the riders truly love Cindy and the Big Horn- the descriptions given have surely made the Big Horn a ride to aspire to and one to never forget.\xa0 I am thankful to each of the riders who took the time to share their audio from Big Horn 2019.\xa0 One of my favorite audios is from a rider traveled all the way from Maryland to see the Big Horn, one of her bucket list rides, get checked off of her list.\xa0 Peggy Thompson has been riding endurance longer than the current AERC website has been keeping records.\xa0 Peggy will share her journey on the 50 mile endurance ride at the Big Horn 2019, though before she does, here is a short history of the Big Horn.\xa0\xa0Greybull, Wyoming, 1970 was the setting for a meeting of the Canyon Cavaliers Saddle Club.\xa0 It was during this meeting that local rider, Dale Perkins mentioned an article he had read about a 100 mile, 1 day ride that traversed over the Sierra Mountains in California.\xa0 The beloved Big Horn mountain was right in the backyard of the Canyon Cavaliers Saddle Club and Dale said that\xa0 there was no reason why there couldn’t be a ride like one that hosted here, over the club’s much loved Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming. \xa0 \xa0\xa0The idea was well received by the club, though they needed help to create such a ride.\xa0 They sought out advice from a Laramie veterinarian who they had heard had actually ridden in the Western States 100 Mile One Day ride, also known as the Tevis Cup. \xa0 The young veterinarian Dr. David Nicholson agreed to travel to Greybull and share his insight into what it would take to manage a 100 mile, 1 day endurance ride in the Big Horn Mountains. \xa0 And, thus, with a good idea, much homework and\xa0 planning, the Big Horn 100 Mile, Inc. was formed, Tom Van Gelder was elected first president and created The Big Horn 100, Inc into a 501 c3 non-profit.\xa0 \xa0 So there you have it, in the fall of 1970\xa0 the concept of the Big Horn 100 began and the organization of the 501 c3 called the Big Horn 100, Inc. was established in 1971.\xa0 The AERC, American Endurance Ride Conference was established in 1972.\xa0Thanks to all the riders who sent in, we have another great collection of ride stories.\xa0 Head on over to our facebook group to connect with more of the story through the images/videos that riders share there. \xa0\xa0Without further ado, I bring to you the Big Horn episode of Endurance Horse Podcast, may you be encouraged, inspired and find a few riders you can relate to or at the very least, laugh with!\xa0 Please let me know how you are enjoying the podcast by sending us an email. \xa0\xa0Check out the

Despite those setbacks, the pair are still smiling through another week\'s worth of adventures on the 40 Acres.\xa0 | No, Cam wasn\'t hitting on the lady behind the checkout counter.

And on the farm, the pair are dealing with a new challenge: after six years of raising chickens, one of the hens has suddenly developed a taste... for eggs.\xa0 | Cam\'s got a new job, Miss E\'s got new tomatoes, and the pair have some homemade hot sauce to give away to 20 lucky listeners!\xa0 Speaking of hot... with the heat index soaring to 115, they\'re looking to hear from you about ways to beat the summer heat.\xa0\xa0 | It\'s amazing the amount of milk you can get from just one tiny dairy goat, and while Cam and Miss E aren\'t quite literally swimming in the stuff, they are getting almost a gallon a day.\xa0 Miss E\'s been trying her hand at making cheeses, while Cam joined in as the pair made goat\'s milk soap for the very first time.\xa0 Plus, a new poll suggests Americans want to live in rural areas over anywhere else... so what\'s getting in our way?\xa0 | There\'s a groundhog invasion (or at least an infilration) on the 40 Acres, but Miss E\'s channeling her inner Annie Oakley and taking aim the rodents before can do much damage.\xa0 Cam takes a look at the rural protests against "cap and trade" gripping Oregon right now, and the pair hear from one listener who\'s been talked into and out of moving to the Farmville area.\xa0\xa0', 'chan_desc': '40 Acres & a Fool is a weekly podcast hosted by Cam Edwards, host of NRA News Cam & Company on SiriusXM/Sportsman Channel/NRANews.com, exploring rural life, food, family, firearms, and freedom with a sense of humor and a natural curiosity.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/f8/eb/0c/f8eb0c54-16f2-cf39-2caa-ce76c066adb0/mza_8538019646549037820.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-02-02'}}

If you haven’t heard the full story of how Julie inspired this show you can hear it in episode 2.Julie’s birthday was in September and in our house, birthdays are celebrated all month long! Julie has unfortunately already crossed the rainbow bridge, but I still wanted to find a special way to honor her birthday month.\xa0So considering how many valuable lessons I learned through Julie’s transition into her golden years I decided that I wanted to do a special senior dog series for the month of September. I mean I am a senior dog super fan after all so this was right up my alley!So here's how it will work: The regularly scheduled episodes of the Mindful Mutt Mama Podcast will continue to air on Thursdays, but for the month of September, I will also be releasing a bonus episode from the Senior Dog Series Every Monday and I enlisted some truly fabulous guests to share their senior dog expertise with us!\xa0And since I’ve never been good at keeping secrets I’m gonna spill the beans and give you a little sneak peek at who you’ll get to hear from.Mentioned In This Episode:Old Dog HavenSplash DogDoctor Sara Hopkins of Compassion 4 PawsResting WatersJessica BowenNeed some dog-obsessed BFFs in your life?

Her music played when we picked Hoss up from the airport after he arrived from the rescue and it’s played in our home as we’ve worked through Birdie’s reactivity.\xa0I’ve introduced her music in every daycare facility that I’ve worked in and to every one of my clients over the years, so when I got the opportunity to share a conversation with Lisa, naturally I was over the moon excited!

Ciara is part of the team at Bruce Fogle’s Vet Practice in Central London, but she also runs Vet In The City. In this episode we go over the care your puppies will need on arrival and over their first year with you. It’s daunting to look after a small defenceless creature, so it’s so useful to be aware well ahead of time of what you and your puppy will need to go through. Ciara gives us some brilliant tips and advice. We talk vaccination, diet, dental care, grooming, the mistakes not to make and the tips to get the best out of your visit at the vet.  | Sarah is especially well known for helping dogs with aggression. We’ll discuss many things during this episode, including how\xa0science and\xa0Love Island can\xa0now help us understand the\xa0best way to approach dog\xa0behaviour and training.\xa0\xa0We’ll discuss why\xa0humans are generally very good a\xa0concentrating on the\xa0negatives. Yet\xa0also brilliant at ignoring all the\xa0good stuff, and how this impacts our views of dog training.\xa0Sarah will also tell us why\xa0our puppies’ behaviour at only\xa015 weeks, could help\xa0forge their entire\xa0character in the future.\xa0\xa0\xa0 | This week’s guest is the inspirational Caroline Yates, CEO of the charity Mayhew. Caroline will tell us how she went from working in the metal trading industry in Russia to becoming the CEO of one of the most innovative animal welfare charities in the world. After a war and years of conflict, Mayhew’s team are helping the government control and vaccinate the dog population in Kabul, Afghanistan. What will be the unexpected side effects of their hard work?  | Veterinary Surgeon, Chiropractor and Acupuncturists are only but a few of the things Dr Marvin J.Firth, BVSc (Hons.), MRCVS does. So I was so happy to catch him between two flights. This week’s guest’s expertise in pain management is second to none. I ask Marvin how we can recognise that our dogs are suffering from physical pain, and he tells us how we should still expect our older dogs to live a full life. He’ll also tell you what dogs, my mum and some old dinosaurs all have in common.  | This week’s guest is the marvellous Beverley Knight, MBE, singer with 8 studio albums under her belt; she also shines brightly in the West-End. She’ll take us through her journey from being scared of dogs, to becoming an accomplished dog owner. Zain, her rescue dog has helped her look at life in a different way and she’ll tell us how her dog makes her feel truly at home, and of course that “wardrobe malfunction” involving Zain himself.

While it was covered briefly in a previous episode (Five Pioneers in Canine Health), this episode will go deeper down the rabbit hole. The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study is tracking the health of over 3,000 Golden Retrievers to determine genetic, environmental, and other risk factors that drive higher rates of cancer in Golden Retrievers.\xa0\xa0 It’s being conducted by the Morris Animal Foundation at Colorado State University. For those not familiar, the Morris Animal Foundation has its roots all the way back to the Great Depression, when a Veterinarian named Dr. Mark Morris noticed a high number of cases of kidney disease in dogs. He discovered that before the Depression, people fed their dogs table scraps - the same food they humans were eating.\xa0\xa0 When the Depression came around, ever bite of food mattered, so people kept the table scraps for themselves, and fed their dogs dry and canned dog food made with low-quality meat byproducts.\xa0\xa0 So Dr. Morris created his own dog food designed to treat kidney disease, and the results were effective.\xa0 Long story short, Dr. Morris expanded his dog food line over the years and used 0.5% royalty to build a foundation dedicated to science and research in support of animal health. The Foundation was founded in 1948 and remains one of the largest and most highly respected animal health organizations in the world.\xa0 It has invested more than $103 million toward 2,500+ studies that have led to significant breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatments, preventions and cures benefitting companion animals, horses, and wildlife worldwide. Now technically, the study falls under the Canine Lifetime Health Project, which is run by the Foundation and matches owners and their dogs with clinical research studies. The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study is the first study actually conducted by the Foundation, through this Project.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Leadership involved with the study  Tiffany Grunert, who is the President & CEO of Morris Animal Foundation.\xa0 She learned about the Foundation when her dog, Chewy, passed away and a friend donated to the Foundation in her honor.\xa0 She joined in a marketing capacity and then climbed the ranks to CEO. Perhaps her biggest contribution to the study has been realigning the inner workings of the Foundation to ensure all departments are supporting it.\xa0 Thank you, Tiffany!  Ryan Welch is the Chief Development Officer, aka the guy responsible for raising money for the Foundation. Ryan joined the Foundation this year in 2019. Even though the study is largely funded, it’s clear he continues to raise not only for the Foundation but for the study itself (Tim himself donated through the website and it was very easy - here’s a link:  donate here).  Janet Patterson Kane is the Chief Scientific Officer at the Foundation, and given her deep expertise in pathology. Janet was the first woman to be Chair of Veterinary Pathology at the University of Glasgow’s Veterinary School. The next two leaders have been talked about on previous episodes of the Pawcast:\xa0  Dr Rodney Page, who is the principal investigator on the study And Missy Simpson, the epidemiologist working on the study design, and doing all the nerdy stuff to crunch the data and make sense of it.\xa0\xa0 Another notable mention is David Haworth, who was CEO of the Foundation from 2011-2015 and led the Foundation to reach its enrollment targets for the 3,000 Goldens. He has a Golden himself, who should be about 6 if my math is correct. There are certainly many other folks supporting the study now and who have contributed to it over the years, and of course some people are being left out. You can read all about them at  Morris Animal Foundation’s GLRS, otherwise this will go on like an Oscar speech and we have 3,000 Goldens to talk about.  \xa0 Sources:   Morris Animal Foundation  The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study: establishing an observational cohort study with translational relevance for human health, The Royal Society  Population characteristics of golden retriever lifetime study enrollees, Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  \xa0 You can also hear directly from Dr. Missy Simpson, the Epidemiologist on the study, on the  Fresh Scoop Podcast, which is a show put on by the Foundation itself.\xa0 Many of these notes here come from that episode.

Before you begin using essential oils for pets,\xa0you need to know the answers to some important questions: Can you use essential oils on dogs, cats, and other pets the same way you use them on yourself? How much should you use? What is the best way to administer oils for topical and internal use? Check out our quick and easy how-to guide for tips and info that will answer your questions about essential oils for dogs, cats, and other animals!* It is important to note that animals cannot tell us if something is working or not, so it is our duty to exercise due caution and approach using oils on animals safely and responsibly. Please note that these are general recommendations for use. If your veterinarian suggests other usage, defer to your veterinarian. If your pet is pregnant, nursing, or has a medical condition, consult a veterinarian prior to use. Basic Guidelines  There are some general tips and suggestions you’ll want to keep in mind as you share essential oils with your furry friends.  Do not use essential oils on and around cats or dogs under 8 weeks old because they are developing at fast rates; it is easy to mess up the proper dilution for each breed. Animals are generally more sensitive to essential oils than humans are. It’s best to heavily dilute essential oils and use them in moderation. Every animal is different, so carefully observe how your animal responds to essential oils. Use common sense and good judgment as you try different methods. Be especially careful to not get essential oils in an animal’s eyes. If diffusing, always allow cats access to areas where they can avoid the diffused oil. With all animals, avoid using high-phenol oils—such as\xa0Oregano,\xa0Wintergreen,\xa0Clove,\xa0Mountain Savory, and\xa0Thyme. This is especially important with cats. Use special caution with cats and essential oils. Avoid applying citrus oils topically, diffusing the scent around cats, and having your cat ingest them.  Essential Oil Acclimation Your pets may need some time to adjust to the new scents and sensations of essential oils. Use these tips to introduce your pets to essential oils in an easy and comfortable way.  Wear essential oils throughout the day, so your pets will be exposed to the aroma as you hold them, play, or cuddle on the couch. Diffuse essential oils in spaces where your pets like to relax. Keep in mind that dogs tend to stay in a room with their owner even if something is bothering them. Closely watch for signs of irritation—such as whining, sniffing, nervousness, and excessive scratching—while diffusing around them. When diffusing essential oils around cats, be sure to only diffuse in areas that allow the cat to leave if it doesn’t want to be there. Apply an essential oil to your hands and let your pets smell them, so they can explore the scent on their own terms. If your pets are jittery or resistant to essential oils, try applying an oil to yourself and staying near the pets for several minutes, so they can get used to the aroma.  Dilution for Topical Application Your animal’s size affects the amount of oil you should use and how much you should dilute for topical application.  For cats, small dogs, and other smaller animals, use a carrier oil—such as\xa0V-6™\xa0Vegetable Oil Complex—to dilute the essential oil before application. We suggest a 9:1 ratio of carrier oil to essential oil. For medium sized dogs dilute 4:1 carrier oil to essential oil. If you’re using essential oils on medium-sized animals—like large dogs—dilute 3:1 carrier oil to essential oil. For very large animals—including horses and cattle—start with a 1:1 dilution on the back and, if desired, move to the directions indicated on the bottle.  Topical Use Once your pets are used to essential oils, they’ll better handle topical application. Keep these tips in mind as you experiment with using essential oils on your pets.  We recommend applying to the back for dogs and cats, being sure to rub your hands together until they are no longer shiny before rubbing the essential oil on the pet. For animals with hooves, apply to the spine and flanks, avoiding the face. Apply oils to places that allow them to evaporate and breathe. Do not apply oils under any tack or saddles. For easy and comfortable application, rub oils between your own hands until they are no longer shiny and then apply by stroking the animal. For easier application in large or hard-to-reach areas, combine essential oils with V-6 or water in a spray bottle. Unless otherwise directed by your veterinarian, avoid daily use of essential oils with cats. Use\xa0Animal Scents®\xa0Ointment\xa0to soothe irritated skin or to help with the occasional scrape or burn.  Internal Use Animals can ingest essential oils, but you need to follow some general rules before you serve up an oil-infused meal for your pets.  We recommend consulting with a veterinarian prior to administering oils internally to your pets.\xa0You should not attempt to mix oils with food unless directed by a veterinarian. If you choose to mix essential oils with your pet’s food, keep in mind that the smell may make the food undesirable to the pet; this is especially true for cats. If you apply oils to places on their body they can lick, they will likely consume some of the essential oil as they groom and play. Make sure you dilute heavily, so the amount your pet licks is minimal. Never force your pets to consume essential oils or food mixed with essential oils.  Supplemental Products Young Living also offers a full line of\xa0animal-specific products, including essential oil blends made just for animals, cat treats, dental pet chews, and\xa0Animal Scents® Shampoo.\xa0Click here\xa0to find something your pets will love!

However, that same inquisitiveness can be dangerous, especially when the target of an animal’s interest is a cleaning product, medication or food known to be poisonous to pets. Because how do animals investigate new objects? They eat them, of course.  In 2017 alone, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) received 199,000 cases concerning possible pet poisonings, a 10% increase from the previous year.  RELATED:  Assessing Cases of Animal Poisoning Top 3 Toxins for Animal Poison Control   To help raise awareness about potential hazards in and\xa0around the average home, ASPCA APCC released a list of the 10 most common pet toxins it received reports about last year. This list serves as a great point of reference for veterinary clients, as well as veterinary team members who may be taking a patient history to understand the cause of illness in a pet.  10. Garden Products Fertilizers and other gardening-related products accounted for 2.6% of poison control calls the center received in 2017.  9. Plants Several indoor and outdoor plants pose a threat to pets, which is why the center received 10,725 reports of possible pet toxicity from plants last year. When selecting plants, choose varieties that are non-toxic to pets, such as African daisies, rosemary, and snapdragons; avoid azaleas, daffodils, lilies, sago palms, and tulips.  8. Rodenticide It’s a no-brainer that rodenticides would be toxic to pets, but more and more companion animals are gaining access to these types of products. Exposure to rodenticides increased from the year prior, which the ASPCA APCC attributes to unpredictable weather patterns causing rodents to seek shelter and food inside homes, in turn, causing an uptick in rodenticide use.  7.\xa0Insecticides Although insecticides are commonly used in homes to kill ants, spiders and the like, their misuse can be harmful for pets. Reports of possible pet poisonings related to insecticides decreased from 2016 to 2017, but still accounted for 6.7% of cases\xa0reported to the ASPCA APCC last year.  6. Household Items The vast category of household items—including glue, cleaning products, laundry detergent, etc.—appears in the middle of the pack, comprising 8.6% of pet toxicity cases in 2017.  5. Chocolate Chocolate is a known danger to dogs, yet the ASPCA APCC received 17,540 pet toxicity cases due to chocolate in 2017, amounting to about 48 cases per day. The high volume of possible poisonings related to chocolate is so high that the center felt it warranted its own category separate from all other food-related toxicities. \xa0 4. Veterinary Products While veterinary products are intended for use by animals, the very flavoring that makes them desirable can also make them dangerously desirable. Animals ingesting amounts of medications exceeding their prescribed doses made up 8.9% of the ASPCA APCC’s cases last year.  3. Human Food Many of the foods that fill up your pantry can make cats and dogs severely ill. Still, accidents happen; pet owners either mistakenly share scraps from a meal or a pet somehow finds its way into the snack drawer. The ASPCA APCC points to the popularity of\xa0xylitol—which is toxic to animals—in sugar-free items like gum and baked goods as the reason why this category consistently appears toward the top of their list.  2. Over-the-Counter Medications For the second year in a row, over-the-counter (OTC) medications claimed the No. 2 spot on this ASPCA APCC list. It’s imperative that clients know to consult with a veterinarian before giving their pets any OTC medication, including\xa0herbal supplements.  1. Prescription Medications Just as with many of the items on this list, exposure to prescription medications is often accidental. Even so, it contributed to 34,888 of pet toxicity cases reported to the ASPCA APCC last year. The center says it most often receives calls about pain medications, antidepressants and heart medications.  \xa0 Cristi Eckert, Owner of Natural Pet Wellness, discusses toxins in your home that can effect your pet.

These tiny bloodsuckers are good at playing hide-and-seek, particularly when their host is covered in thick, dark hair. Ticks can latch on to your furry friend and live in hiding, feasting on blood for several days at a time. Even dogs with flea and tick collars and other forms of protection can be targeted by these parasites. \xa0 Checking your dog carefully for ticks is extremely important since these parasites can make pets and humans seriously ill. Anaplasmosis,\xa0Lyme disease,\xa0Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and\xa0tick paralysis\xa0are just a few of the potential diseases caused by tick bites. \xa0 The\xa0Companion Animal Parasite Council\xa0predicted that 2016 would be a big year for illnesses transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes, noting that the threat of diseases continues to spread into new areas, “creating a year-round menace to both pets and their owners.” \xa0 How Ticks Find Their Victims \xa0 Using heat sensors, ticks find a victim and typically latch onto the warmest places on the dog’s body, says Dr. Ann Hohenhaus, who is board certified in internal medicine and\xa0oncology, and based at\xa0New York City’s Animal Medical Center. \xa0 “The head, neck and ears are prime places, but ticks can occur anywhere,” says Hohenhaus. “Look and look again. You have to look everywhere. You can easily miss ticks.” \xa0 You might be surprised by some of the places ticks have been found on dogs. \xa0 In the Groin Area The\xa0groin\xa0probably isn’t the first place you would look for ticks on your pet. However, they can get attached in and around your dog’s bottom, says Dr. Amy Butler, a veterinarian at the\xa0DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital\xa0in Portland, Oregon. \xa0 “You should check the\xa0perianal\xa0area,” Butler says. “Ticks are drawn to dark, moist areas on the body.” \xa0 Also make sure to check your dog’s tail, says Hohenhaus. \xa0 Between the Toes Ticks have nothing against your dog’s paws. Though it takes extra effort to latch on, a tick can become attached between the toes, Butler says. \xa0  If you find one there, use hemostats or tweezers to remove it, she says. \xa0 “Grasp the tick without crushing it and pull it straight out,” she says. \xa0 In and Around the Ears At DoveLewis, a very sick sheltie named Ollie was at the hospital about to be euthanized. An extern who was working alongside a veterinarian reached out to comfort Ollie and, as she scratched behind his ears, found a tick engorged with blood. The quantity of fecal material suggested the tick had been attached to the dog for some time, the hospital said. \xa0 The tick was removed. Thinking the dog could have tick paralysis, the veterinarian discussed the possibility with Ollie’s owner and sent the dog home. Within hours, Ollie was back on his feet, fully recovered and eager to go outside. \xa0 “I was here the day Ollie came in,” says Butler. Tick paralysis, she says, “is really uncommon. I saw another case of tick paralysis a decade ago.” \xa0 Unlike other tick-transmitted diseases, tick paralysis will go away without lasting health effects once the tick is removed, says Hohenhaus, who treated a Yorkie with paralysis caused by a tick found on the dog’s lip.\xa0 \xa0 She also recommends checking inside your dog’s ears, including the ear canal. “I’ve found ticks on the inside of floppy ears,” Hohenhaus says. \xa0 Under Clothes and Collars If your dog wears a collar 24/7, it’s easy to forget to remove it during the tick inspection. Ticks can hide under your pet’s collar, harness or any article of clothing she’s wearing, Hohenhaus says. \xa0 “If your pet wears a T-shirt or sun protection shirt, those have to come off,” she says. “I don’t think people think about that.” \xa0 The Eyelids Is it a\xa0skin tag\xa0or a tick on your dog’s eyelid? Sometimes, it’s hard to determine, says Hohenhaus. \xa0 Dogs can develop skin tags anywhere on their bodies, but they frequently appear near the eyelids, she says. “You don’t want to rip off a skin tag,” she says. “Make sure that black mass on the eyelid is actually not a tick.” | Bark & Wag CBD is on the market!

Camping with Dogs\xa0is a lifestyle brand built on a community of people who love outdoor adventure shared with their beloved pets. What began as an\xa0Instagram account\xa0featuring photos of dogs exploring the outdoors with their owners has now become so much more. Connecting people around their world through a shared love, who better to gather some of the best expert tips for camping and hiking with dogs? TIPS FOR HIKING AND CAMPING WITH DOGS FROM THE EXPERTS  1. LOOK UP THE REGULATIONS IN THE AREA OF TRAILS OR CAMPGROUNDS BEFOREHAND Some may not allow dogs are have restrictions. Keep your dog close, or on leash because others camping may not want to be bothered with your dog, and leashing up can also protect your dog against any wildlife that may come after your furry friend, or prevent them from wrestling in the bushes that may have poisonous plants. –\xa0@west_coast_heeler_pack  2. PACK PLENTY OF WATER It may seem like a no brainer, but make sure your dog is staying hydrated. It’s super important. Pack enough water for them if there won’t be a source of water they can safely use. Don’t let them drink salt water or from standing water! Same goes for food, make sure they have enough. Collapsible bowls are super handy. –\xa0@mirandashea24  3. KEEP YOUR DOG LEASHED While it’s nice not to have your dog tug on a leash while hiking (unless you’ve trained them not to), there’s a few obvious reasons to have your dog on the leash. For starters, not everyone is as in love with dogs as we are and they could actually be terrified.\xa0 If you have your dog leash-less, it could make other hikers very uncomfortable. Secondly, they could become targets for or infuriate wildlife (i.e., bears). I could go on but if your dog is like either of mine (i.e., likes to stay head 20 feet and greet any human being in site), then keep them leashed. –\xa0@samanthabrookephoto  4. PROTECT THE PAWS Not just from the snow, but from the hot ground as well. We have a pair of “cool” dog booties that we use for the summer when the dirt or cinder that we’re walking on is too hot for Jazz’s paws. In the winter we use Musher’s Secret, a wax product that you can put directly on your dog’s paws to protect their fur from balling up in the snow. We find that a lot of booties fall off of Jazz (because he loves hopping through the fresh powder) so the wax is a great alternative for the winter. –\xa0@jazz.paws  5. BRING A TENT WITH LOTS OF SPACE Get a tent with double entries and vestibules. If you have a smaller tent, you can put your packs and gear under one vestibule, and a little sleeping pad for your dog to sleep in the other one. We have a shorthair dog and prefer to keep him in our tent on cold nights, but in the summer the vestibule lets us enjoy more room. –\xa0@captainshark  6. DON’T LET RAINY DAYS DAMPEN OUTDOOR PLANS A tent can be used to provide a cozy and dry place to hangout outdoors with your pets. Another huge plus of venturing outside in the rain is that, chances are, no one else takes advantage of the day.\xa0 We found an empty beach where we could relax, have lunch, and play cards in our warm little tent – during breaks in the rain, the pups could roam free without us worrying about them bothering other people.\xa0 It was a super lovely day, rain and all. –\xa0@nancythebeat  7. PACK A BRUSH/COMB Here in the desert I always make sure I have my comb and leatherman tool cause more than likely my pup will have an encounter with a colla cactus. Even if he isn’t near one, the spines litter the desert all year long. –\xa0@dustydesertdogs  8. PACK TOYS Bring your dog’s favorite toy with you. It will help ease any anxieties he may have and help him feel more comfortable in his “home away from home.” –\xa0@alexborsuk  9. PET FIRST AID It’s always handy to have pet first aid knowledge. There are courses out there that are great to help build current knowledge or for those who don’t know where to start. Having a basic first aid guide book is also really handy to include in a first aid kit. You can get away with having a regular first aid kit and adding a few things to make it more accommodating to pets, such as, iodine for cleaning wounds, wax paw protector for dry pads, or to be used as a barrier for extreme conditions, and a tick remover. Liquid bandages are helpful for cuts. I also included dog boots and tongue suppressors that can be used as a splint. – @west_coast_heeler_pack \xa0 By KOA |       Actress and animal lover Kate Walsh knows first-hand that dogs can be “off their game” because of allergic itching, which can get in the way of dogs doing what they love. When her dog Rosie was diagnosed with allergies, Kate learned that scratching can be more than just an itch and can lead to more serious problems if not treated by a veterinarian. That’s when she knew it was time for Rosie to get her\xa0A-Gameback.\xa0 \xa0 Many dogs itch, so it’s hard to tell when an itch is more than just an itch, or if it’s caused by an underlying condition, like allergies.\xa0Kate is\xa0encouraging pet owners to be advocates for their dog’s health by paying attention to how skin issues are affecting their pets’ well-being. \xa0 August is Itchy Pet Awareness Month and Kate is sharing\xa0her experience finding her dog’s\xa0A-Game\xa0and why the\xa0K-9 Courage™\xa0Program\xa0is near and dear to her heart. \xa0 By sharing a photo or video of your dog’s\xa0A-Game,\xa0using the\xa0#MyDogsAGame hashtag, it will trigger a donation to the K-9 Courage™\xa0Program, which supports military and police dogs as well as active service dogs that assist veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress. \xa0  \xa0  \xa0   \xa0   \xa0   \xa0   \xa0 \xa0        \xa0      |   I’m Cindy Myers, Animal Listener      \xa0 I would like to share a little about what I do and how I got here working with both animals and two-leggers (humans...you will understand that terminology in a few minutes;) One of the frequently asked questions I get from my clients and workshop attendees is if I have always been able to communicate intuitively with animals and have empathic energy skills. The answer to that question is no, not really. I’ve always loved animals, but I was not aware of having any intuitive senses or that I could do healing energy work until I was an adult. I’ve always been a good listener. But, if twenty years ago, someone told me I’d be living on a farm with about 30 alpacas, 3 dogs, and 2 barn cats working as an intuitive energy healer and animal communicator, I would have laughed and thought that was the craziest thing I ever heard! \xa0     Why I call myself An Animal Listener...   \xa0    Communication entails two elements; talking and listening. It has been my experience that when you ask someone to define what makes a good communicator, they often say, “She has a great style of talking to you,” or “He is really assertive and makes you feel at ease.” Almost everyone describes just the talking piece in good communication. It is pretty rare that\xa0someone describes the listening component of communication. Yet, the best communicators, the healthiest relationships, all have the ability to be effective listeners. Listening isn’t just done with our ears. To listen well, we must use all of our senses including our “sixth” sense. Most have heard of using their “third eye” to indicate their intuition. I also like to use the term, using our “third ear.” It is this “third ear,” that I use in listening to and communicating with animals. To be effective communicators with our animals, we must first be willing to listen to them. The beauty of improving our listening skills with our animal companions is that same skill can make our human relationships richer, deeper and more connected as well. Our animals can teach us much about how to be better listeners.      Here’s what I believe...   \xa0    I believe that all of our life experiences lead us to our true calling in life, however, sometimes we take a roundabout way of getting there. Boy do I get that. It has taken many years, different career paths and life challenges from tending to and being my mom’s caregiver during her final years and then a house fire caused by an arsonist, before discovering and finding the courage to finally embrace and pursue my calling of intuitive energy work for people and their animals and teach others how to open up to their own intuitive listening abilities.      What I used to do that drew me to my calling...   \xa0    It is quite amusing to watch people’s reaction when I tell them my career began working as\xa0an engineer. On the surface, it does seem a far stretch going from engineering to an intuitive healer and animal communicator. I enjoyed my engineering career in the beginning but in the end, it wasn’t quite the right fit. But when you are in your teens and early twenties, deciding on a career, it was a very good choice. I was drawn to engineering because of my interest in Physics. My first job was working on radars and that was no fluke. I was not ready to open up to my intuitive personal radar, but studying and working on equipment that sends out and receives frequency signals and then interprets the data was fascinating to me and I know that was a strong foundation in my eventually opening up to my own intuitive abilities. And it was that work and basic understanding of physics and quantum mechanics that validated in my mind that my intuitive experiences were real. My second career, I found myself drawn to Counseling. Another career that seems on the surface to be polar opposite to engineering yet I was supervising people and trying to be a good leader and you need to have excellent people skills for that so, counseling was a better idea than going and getting an MBA. I pursued and earned my Master’s Degree in Counseling with an emphasis in Depth Psychology. It was during this time that my intuitive abilities began to open up and I had a place and an outlet to begin sharing my experiences with others. I began experiencing people’s pain in my own body! How freaky is that to suddenly have a pain in my side, headache or migraine? It was pretty darn scary at first and I often felt isolated because no way I was going to share those experiences with my engineering colleagues. But, at the same time, I knew I wasn’t crazy and that these experiences were very real. I also thought, it would be pretty cool to learn how to use these experiences for others’ benefit. I began reading a lot of different books. I was drawn to memoirs of intuitive healers. It helped to read about how they got started and how it all worked for them. I found they experienced things similar to what I was going through. That made me feel a little less alone and that it was more real. Then I found a book on Animal Communication and couldn’t wait\xa0to learn more. I practiced on my dog Rusty and we had the neatest experiences! Being able to communicate merely by thinking to him was so amazing and it made our connection and bond all the more special. I was hooked! I wanted to learn more and practice communicating with more animals. Although it was really amazing to communicate with animals, I never thought of it being a profession so I began working to get my Marriage Family Therapy license. I thought going into Counseling was the right fit and that this was my calling. Like many people, life can throw you quite the curve ball. Being the caregiver of my mother her final years was challenging. As her health declined, the responsibilities of her daily care and emotional upheaval of tending to her, working full time as an engineer all while still working on my Marriage Family Therapy license took its toll. I burned out. Both figuratively and literally! Only weeks after my mother passed away, I lost my home to arson fire. It was devastating. I only had the emotional strength to rebuild my own life and home. I couldn’t ethically care for others’ tender psyches. So I took a leave of absence from both counseling and engineering to tend to me and rebuild my life.      My true life passion comes about...   \xa0    It was then that I discovered alpacas and I bought my first two, a mother and newly born\xa0daughter. I boarded them at the time and I learned the ropes of caring for alpacas and while doing that, I honed my intuitive skills. They healed me as much as I learned about doing healing energy work on them and on people. I became a student of Reiki and Healing Touch for Animals. I studied clicker training and adapted all the techniques I learned to work with alpacas. I wore a Phoenix necklace during that time to hold the intention of rebuilding my life up from the ashes. I often tell people that the blessing of that very hard time was that I got my “life do-over.” It was like these personas and reasons why I had to do the things I was doing were all written on a big white board. But when the fire happened, in a flash, that white board was wiped clean. I was no longer a caregiver, I stopped being an engineer and a counselor. I didn’t care about material things any more. Funny how when they are all taken in a second you realize how little importance they really are. The only thing that mattered was my family, friends and my dogs. After having the slate wiped clean, I was then handed a marker and allowed to start putting up on the whiteboard what I wanted to do with my life. That was very empowering and it allowed me to walk away from things that weren’t working for me anymore. I now had the time, space and energy to explore a totally different life. I went from living an “in the box” life to not just being out of the box, but having no box at all! Becoming an alpaca farmer and living with these amazing animals, provided that new life.\xa0They are quite ironic animals. They are prey animals and have no real means of defense so are driven by the flight response. They are incredibly skittish animals and vary wary of humans. Yet, for people that have experienced terrible traumas or live in a high stress environment, being around alpacas is incredibly calming and soothing. They pump out this very calming, zen-like energy. Alpacas are amazing teachers and are incredibly intuitive animals. When I first began using alpaca to teach others how to communicate with animals, I wasn’t sure how that would work having total strangers in the pasture with them, trying to mentally communicate with these skittish animals. I remember holding my breath that it would work the first time students went out into my pasture. But, true to form, they worked beautifully with all the students. Each student walked away having a special connection and knew they had actually communicated intuitively with an animal.      Two leggers (I know you’ve been waiting for this)…   \xa0    In one story I tell in my book, “Alpacas Don’t Do That,” I was intuitively communicating with an alpaca for the first time, and she did a triple take and sniffed my face and I heard in my head, "hmm, I didn\'t know two-leggers could do that." Ever since then, I use the term two-leggers to refer to us humans. (There is your explanation from the first paragraph that I promised you).      Why I love what I do…   \xa0     I know how busy we all are and that in our society and way of life, we have a hard time making time for ourselves. We can spend years trying to understand our dynamics and that is all great to go and do. However, it has been so exciting to find that my energetic techniques I use with both people and animals can facilitate those personal growth issues. These techniques remove those balls of trapped energies that created our old behavioral\xa0dynamics and support our bodies in healing and it can be done relatively quickly and easily. And the beauty of it is that I can be here in Oregon and people or their animals can be anywhere in the world. Not only can I do this work for anyone anywhere, I can do it all through email! You don’t even have to be on the phone with me as I tap into your subconscious. So you don’t even have to change your schedule or stop what you are doing in your busy lives. I take care of it and send an email to you telling you what emotions were trapped and I can also tell you what age they were trapped. Some like knowing that information and it will trigger a memory. Others don’t want to remember it at all and are just happy to have those energies that cause problems out of their body and system. Some people like to have me work on them in person or over the phone and experience the releases as I’m doing it, however, many more people, are very happy that they don’t have to schedule one more appointment into their busy and hectic lives. It is very rewarding releasing these trapped emotions and energies in people and animals,\xa0but even more rewarding is teaching people how to do it for themselves and their animals. It fits with that saying, provide someone a fish and they eat for the day; teach them to fish and they eat for the rest of their lives. This is true for learning to release your trapped emotions. We pretty much get a trapped emotion each day of our lives. Individually, a trapped emotion may not cause harm, but after awhile, it can keep attracting more similar trapped emotions and they tend to accumulate in similar areas of the body. I like to say, “We store our issues in our tissues.” Some very learned individuals such as Louise Hays has written multiple books on the subject. So learning how to remove those emotions that cause those issues is of everyone’s benefit. I like to set people up for success and with these techniques, you will experience for yourself how incredibly rewarding and useful these tools are in our daily lives.  I love sharing my intuitive abilities with both animals and humans. I look forward to getting to know both you and your animals better soon!       \xa0 Certified in: Emotion Code as a Practitioner Level II Reiki Level II Healing Touch for Animals    | Several years ago, local Boston resident Ryan DeRoche was in a mountain bike accident that resulted in a severe spinal cord injury and left him with little to no use of his arms and legs.\xa0His life changed in an instant. But through Massachusetts-based National Education for Assistance Dog Services (NEADS), Ryan was matched with service dog Oliver, who just completed his training at a Boston-based jail. The two have been inseparable ever since. Oliver is specially trained to help Ryan be independent – assisting him with daily tasks like opening and closing doors and getting things in hard-to-reach places. Emotionally, he also has a way of knowing if Ryan is sad, angry or frustrated, and knows exactly how to cheer up his human buddy with attention and kisses. Oliver changed Ryan’s life, and he couldn’t imagine a life without his furry sidekick. \xa0 Ryan and Oliver are working with Merck Animal Health and NEADs to highlight the critical role service dogs play and the importance of keeping them healthy. The campaign – called \xa0BRAVECTO™ Cares – focuses on the health of service dogs, including protecting them from fleas and ticks, and underscores the importance of keeping family pets protected, as well. \xa0 Fleas and ticks can carry illnesses, such as Lyme disease, to our pets and our families, and CDC-reported illnesses in humans have tripled in recent years. If service dogs are not at optimal health, they will not be at ideal performance and can potentially put their handler at risk. \xa0 For more information, you can also visit the website\xa0www.protectfromfleasandticks.com.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | \xa0 From PETA....do not be dumb with your dog Every year, dogs suffer and die when their guardians make the mistake of leaving them in a parked car—even for “just a minute”—while they run an errand. Parked cars are deathtraps for dogs: On a 78-degree day, the temperature inside a parked car can soar to 100 degrees in just minutes, and on a 90-degree day, the interior temperature can reach as high as 109 degrees in less than 10 minutes.    Animals can sustain brain damage or even die from heatstroke in just 15 minutes. Beating the heat is extra tough for dogs because they can only cool themselves by panting. If you see a dog left alone in a hot car, take down the car’s color, model, make, and license plate number. Have the owner paged in the nearest buildings, or call local humane authorities or police. Have someone keep an eye on the dog.\xa0Don’t leave the scene until the situation has been resolved.    If the authorities are unresponsive or too slow and the dog’s life appears to be in imminent danger, find a witness (or several) who will back up your assessment, take steps to remove the suffering animal from the car, and then wait for authorities to arrive. Watch for heatstroke symptoms such as restlessness, excessive thirst, thick saliva, heavy panting, lethargy, lack of appetite, dark tongue, rapid heartbeat, fever, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and lack of coordination. If a dog shows any of these symptoms, get him or her out of the heat, preferably into an air-conditioned vehicle, and then to a veterinarian\xa0immediately. If you are unable to transport the dog yourself, take him or her into an air-conditioned building if possible and call animal control: Tell them it is an emergency.  Provide water to drink, and if possible spray the dog with a garden hose or immerse him or her in a tub of cool (but not iced) water for up to two minutes in order to lower the body temperature gradually. You can also place the dog in front of an electric fan. Applying cool, wet towels to the groin area, stomach, chest, and paws can also help. Be careful not to use ice or cold water, and don’t overcool the animal. When walking your dog, keep in mind that\xa0if it feels hot enough to fry an egg outside, it probably is. When the air temperature is 86 degrees, the asphalt can reach a sizzling 135 degrees — more than hot enough to cook an egg in five minutes. And it can do the same to our canine companions’ sensitive foot pads. On an 87-degree day, asphalt temperatures can reach 140 degrees, hot enough to cause burns, permanent damage and scarring after just one minute of contact. Rapid burns and blistering can occur at 150 degrees. Hot sidewalks, pavement and parking lots can not only burn paws, they also reflect heat onto dogs’ bodies , increasing their risk of deadly heatstroke. If you wouldn’t put your dog in a frying pan, please don’t make him or her walk on hot pavement. Always test the pavement with your hand before setting out (too hot to touch is too hot for Spot), walk early in the morning or late at night when it’s cooler, carry water and take frequent breaks in shady spots and never make dogs wear muzzles that restrict their breathing. PETA offers leaflets that can be placed on vehicles to remind people never to leave unattended animals inside.

Sam is one of the organizers behind the 2019 Advancing Herptelogical Husbandry Conference held in Rodeo, New Mexico on September 27-28th.

Mariah has gone to extraordinary lengths in order to write and publish extremely thoroughly and informative care guides for reptiles commonly kept in the hobby.

When this happens blood supply to vital organs is restricted, blood toxin buildup occurs and your dog’s chance of survival diminishes by the minute. This is a true veterinary emergency requiring immediate veterinary intervention. GDV can occur in any dog, but is more commonly seen in large breed dogs like German Shepherds, Boxers, Great Danes, and Labradors (just to name a few). And while this condition can occur at any time, it is most commonly observed during exercise after a large meal or heavy water intake. If you take your dog with you when you’re hiking, biking and trail running, this is required viewing. There are several things you can do to prevent this from happening and some very important things you need to know to recognize when it may be happening to your dog. Join us for this informative discussion with veterinarian Dr. Kim De La Peza and host Craig Lassen as they breakdown every aspect of this deadly veterinary emergency. | Dr. Kevin Fenton sits down with The Pawd Life host Craig Lassen to discuss the amazing world of integrative veterinary care.
