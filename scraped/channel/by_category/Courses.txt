In this interview, Jessica mentions that her school has no curriculum for her to use.\xa0 Now I’m not a fan of relying solely on a textbook and I’m a big advocate of teaching without a textbook.\xa0 Jessica mentions how the extreme end of the spectrum can also be difficult. When you don’t have a textbook to follow you aren’t sure where to go.\xa0 That’s why I’m a big advocate for learning the learning progressions that kids go through when developing their understanding of mathematics. In this episode she talks about her journey of doing that.\xa0 Get all the info here: buildmathminds.com/30\xa0 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 29.\xa0 Today we are delving into a touchy subject as I ask “Are you Indispensable?” I’m a firm believer that things come into our lives when we need it.\xa0 The day I’m recording this, after I dropped my kids off at school I was looking for a podcast to listen to on my drive.\xa0 A podcast I hadn’t listened to in a long time popped up. The podcast is Entreleadership and the title of the episode was “Are you Indispensable?” Intrigued by the title I played it and was I glad I did. I’ve been doing a series over on my vlog,  The Recovering Traditionalist, about why we need to stop teaching math with a textbook.\xa0 I’ve gotten some people who whole-heartedly agree with me, but I’ve also gotten some people who very much disagree with me.\xa0 This podcast episode that I listened to this morning made me even more affirmed in my stance against textbooks. Normally on this podcast I talk about articles or books I’ve read, but today I want to share with you the podcast episode I listened to.\xa0 The guest on this episode of Entreleadership was Seth Godin who has authored many books but on this episode he was discussing ideas from his book Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?\xa0 Get all the info here: buildmathminds.com/29\xa0 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 28.\xa0 Today we are looking at Teaching Mathematics through Problem Solving.  Unfortunately, what we think of about Problem Solving has greatly been influenced by textbooks (just another reason why I’m not a fan of them).\xa0 If you open up almost any elementary math textbook you will find lessons on Problem Solving. These lessons are well-meaning but they try to teach students steps to follow when solving problems.\xa0 This has always bugged me and I wasn’t quite sure how to express why until I read it in the book Teaching Mathematics through Problem Solving which is a publication of NCTM and was edited by Frank K. Lester Jr. Get all the info here: buildmathminds.com/28 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 27.\xa0 Today we are looking at Using Kids’ Intuitive Mathematical Reasoning If you follow my blog, The Recovering Traditionalist, then you know that I’m doing a series of videos to kick off the school year all about how and why to teach math without a textbook. One of the biggest influences on my belief about teaching math without a textbook is the research of Cognitively Guided Instruction.\xa0  One of the very first episodes of this podcast was about the book Children’s Mathematics: Cognitively Guided Instruction.\xa0 For this episode I want to direct you to a research article by some of the same authors. Plus, I’ve got a special download for you to help you teach elementary math without a textbook.\xa0 Get all the info here: buildmathminds.com/27\xa0 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 26.\xa0 Today we are looking at Adding It Up. It’s the start of the school year here in the U.S and for many educators that means a new math textbook.\xa0 As I was reading back through the book  Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics for  my recent vlog post I was reminded why I really don’t like textbooks. I believe they give everyone, the principal, the teacher, the parents, and so on a false sense of comfort.\xa0 Find out why by listening to the episode at: buildmathminds.com/26 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 25, where we are going to get inspiration and information from Carri Naumann-Monti, an Educational Therapist who works with students who have language-based learning differences.

Ok, so I’m just going to say this upfront that this episode may go a bit longer than my normal book insight episodes and I’m going to try not to cry while doing this.\xa0 I’m going to tell a personal story before I get into the book I want to talk about because I bet you probably have a child like my son in your classroom. Go listen to the show and get the links at buildmathminds.com/24 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 23.\xa0 Today we are looking at creating a Bottoms Up Hundred Chart. \xa0 Today’s insight comes from the article Bottoms Up Hundred Chart? by Jennifer Bay-Williams and Graham Fletcher. \xa0 As you start to prepare for school to start back up, a common thing in elementary classrooms is the Hundred Chart.\xa0 There are things I don’t like about using a hundred chart, but one thing they are great for is investigating patterns.  However, the traditional way that a hundred chart is set up actually causes confusion for students instead of insights. Get all the info here: buildmathminds.com/23 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 22.\xa0 Today we get insight into how Young Children Reinvent Arithmetic. Today’s insight comes from the book Young Children Reinvent Arithmetic: Implications of Piaget’s Theory (second edition) by Constance Kamii. I get asked a lot how to help kids with subtraction and my answer is consistently, work more on addition.\xa0 This may seem harsh that I don’t think we should be teaching kids strategies to solve subtraction, but if they have strategies for addition they will naturally use those when they see subtraction or they will instantly know the answer because they know the addition fact.\xa0 Listen to the full episode at buildmathminds.com/22 | Welcome fellow Recovering Traditionalists to Episode 21 where we are going to get Inspiration & Information from Jennifer Lagrange, a Kinder/1st grade dual language teacher. \xa0 Jennifer shares her journey to becoming a Recovering Traditionalist.\xa0 Get all the details and show notes at buildmathminds.com/21. \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'The Build Math Minds podcast is for my fellow Recovering Traditionalists out there.

So how do you solve for flaws you can’t identify? Tune in to find out! | Episode 28 features a detailed review of the September 2019 LSAT, the first all-digital test ever administered! Jon and Dave discuss the ups and downs of the digital rollout, then cover the test section by section examining the scored content, overall student impressions, and their official curve prediction. They also offer thoughts on what this test means for the rest of 2019 and beyond, so whether you’re curious about the September test you just took, or want a preview of what’s to come, this is for you! | More Flaws! Episode 27 sees Jon and Dave add a third installment to their series on common logical flaws, this time tackling six key errors in total: Composition/Division, Uncertain Use of a Term, False Analogies, False Dilemmas, Relativity/Degree, and Sunk Cost. Make sure you’re familiar with each of these ideas before test day! | In Episode 26, Jon and Dave continue their exploration of common flaws, focusing on Straw Man attacks, Appeal Fallacies, and the ever-present Survey Errors that so often beguile test takers. | As we fast approach the final three LSATs of 2019, Dave and Jon dust off their crystal balls and set about predicting exactly what to expect from each of these upcoming tests! Specifically, they review the Digital LSAT lessons learned in July, exploring some of the most common issues faced and how to address them on test day, then turn to a section-by-section analysis of recent trends to help you anticipate what you’ll see and prioritize your prep accordingly. Anyone with a 2019 test ahead of them needs to give this a listen! | In Episode 24, Dave and Jon begin their multi-part analysis of Flaw in the Reasoning questions, first providing a detailed overview of this tricky question type and then exploring three common but misunderstood flaw categories: Evidence Errors, Source Arguments, and Circular Reasoning. Within each they break down how the error operates and ways to spot it, common scenarios using specific examples, and finally how the test makers represent these flaws in the complex wording of answer choices. | Episode 23 picks up right where 22 left off: with Jon and Dave continuing last week’s discussion of conditional reasoning! Specifically, they ramp up the complexity and outline how to handle unusual language like “unless” statements and “either/or” constructions, make conditional chains and spot the inferences they provide, tackle scenarios with multiple sufficient and necessary elements, and even master the elusive double-arrow. This is conditionality at its highest level. | In the PodCast’s 22nd Episode, Dave and Jon begin what will become a multi-part look at conditional reasoning, one of the test’s most critical concepts. In this first discussion they explore the nature of what makes statements conditional, define the key distinctions between sufficient and necessary conditions, and offer insights on making the right kind of inferences when faced with conditionality (while also avoiding the traps the test makers so frequently employ). | Episode 21 tackles one of the most powerful—but frequently misunderstood—techniques for attacking Logic Games: utilizing Templates to represent limited outcomes and solutions. In this discussion, Dave and Jon outline exactly how and why Templates work, the wide range of clues to help you recognize their presence, and safety measures to prevent you from pursuing them when you shouldn’t. Anyone struggling to reach perfection in games needs to hear this! | The PodCast’s 20th episode is dedicated to the July 2019 LSAT, from its shaky rollout to its section-by-section content to its unique experimental section treatment. Jon and Dave run through a host of stories from the first-ever digital administration—some good, most shockingly bad—then turn their attention to the test itself and offer their take on what it contained and the scale it will likely produce, as well as what they suspect happened with the LR experimentals.', 'chan_desc': 'Logic Games Bible author Dave Killoran (@davekilloran) and PowerScore Test Prep VP Jon Denning (@jonmdenning) are two of the world’s foremost experts on the LSAT and law school admissions, and they’ve created the PowerScore LSAT PodCast to share their knowledge and experience with you!

My guest Glynn does a really great job helping me to bring clarity to this question. In the episode she simply answers that, by a traditional definition, no Waldorf Schools are not religious. However there are aspects of Waldorf education, for instance fostering qualities like compassion, reverence, gratitude, and kindness, that most all major religions also foster.

One of my favorite guests ever is back again on the Your Morning Basket podcast. Last fall when we had Angelina Stanford on the show to talk to us about why fairy tales are important reading for your kids, you let us know how much you loved the episode and Angelina\'s enthusiasm for the topic. \xa0 Today she is no less enthusiastic as we dive into what exactly myth is (surprised me), Justin Martyr and his "seeds of truth," why medieval Christians fought Viking invaders to preserve myths, and what we as modern Christians can learn from these stories. \xa0 It is a fabulous episode of the podcast. We hope you enjoy. | The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis is a series of essays on the state of education and truth in the 21st Century. A slim volume, yet dense with ideas, it is a worthy read for any parent dedicated to the education of their child in Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. Today we have special guest Dr. Jason Jewell with us to help us unpack and understand Lewis\'s work and begin to learn how it applies to the education of our children. | Heather Bunting is passionate about helping families learn to sing -- even if mom doesn\'t think she can carry a tune at all. Through her free YouTube channel, Children of the Open Air, Heather helps make solfege lessons, hymns, and folks songs accessible for homeschool families everywhere. In this episode of the podcast, Heather talks about the skill of learning to sing, how we can incorporate singing lessons into our Morning Time, and what to do about those who feel they lack the talent to succeed. I invite you to listen and be inspired to bring singing to your own Morning Time. | If you ever need to take Morning Time on the road then this episode is for you. Dawn Garrett joins me to chat about why and how we can pack up our Morning Times and take them with us -- getting homeschooling done even when we can\'t be at home. If you are out of the house a day or more each week then this episode is for you. | Have you ever wanted another mom to come along beside you and show you exactly what Morning Time looks like? Maybe, you think, I could just stop by her home and be a fly on the wall and unpack the mysteries of this Morning Time thing? Heather Tully has done just that with other moms in her community and she has been doing it for years. On this episode of the podcast Heather joins me to talk about what this kind of mentoring can look like and how we might reach out and help other moms learn about Morning Time. And since she is a mom of ten doing Morning Time with the toddler to the teenager, Heather also shares a ton of wisdom in this episode about how to make Morning Time work with a large age range. This one is not to be missed! | Andrew Peterson knows a thing or two about a good story and creativity. He is on the show today to talk about sharing both with your kids, his work with the Rabbit Room as a place for children\'s authors to support one another and grow, and a little something he calls the redeemed imagination. It\'s a fascinating conversation with topics as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Harry Potter. Enjoy! | Mom\'s are natural teachers for a language -- after all moms teach their kids language all the time. Foreign language can work the same way as a first language -- simply start with words and phrases you use everyday and build on one or two at a time. Soon you will know more words in a new language than you ever imagined. Adelaide Olguin is on the show today to tell us about how this natural language learning works and how you can begin to implement this in your home to learn new languages with your kids. It\'s a fun and encouraging episode, so don\'t miss it! | Welcome to a brand new season of the Your Morning Basket Podcast. We are kicking off the year with an important but fun conversation with the creator of We Choose Virtues, Heather McMillian. I love Heather\'s enthusiasm for helping teach kids about virtues. Drawing on her years of experience as a teacher and children\'s pastor, Heather has created a system that opens a dialogue in families about good character and helps parents go beyond just securing good behavior and really reach the hearts of their kids. | Becky McIntosh can see the beauty and joy in math. She says it comes from practice -- that she makes a special point to look for the beauty of mathematics everyone. Lucky for us, she is on a mission to help other homeschool moms find the same joy in math as well. She is here today on the podcast with an inspiring look at how we can use literature to connect our kids to cool, interesting mathematical concepts. This one is a lot of fun. | Sarita Holzmann was a reluctant homeschooler but soon came to love it. With a heart for missionaries serving overseas and the people they serve, Sarita has always had an eye towards bringing geography to life using literature. On this episode of the podcast she joins us to discuss why geography is important and why literature is the best way to experience that.

Mystie and Brandy are discussing why starting with heroes in a child\'s education is not white-washing, and why pointing out the darkness too young might backfire. Wendi Capehart from the AmblesideOnline Advisory board is a very busy lady, so we were thrilled when she — rightly dubbed "the smartest woman on the internet" by Cindy Rollins — agreed to a phone call with us this summer. Let us tell you a little about Wendi. Wendi and her husband Bill have been Christians since their teens. They married at 20 and have been married 37 years. They have seven terrific grown children, 4 stalwart sons-in-law, 14 unsurpassingly wonderful grandchildren, and have also helped raise their two perfectly delightful god-sons (as well as occasionally hosting Japanese exchange students and Ukrainian orphans). The Capeharts have lived all over, most recently in the Philippines for two years, where they served as missionaries with a Christian school in Davao City. In January they will be moving to Malaysia to the city of Kota Kinabalu where they will help establish a learning center, among other projects.  Click here to look at their previous newsletters and subscribe to new ones. Wendi blogs at Wendi Wanders. She has published an e-zine called Education for All. The latest issue contains most of the material from her talk on Imagination at AO Camp, including the material and sources that had to be cut.

Jenn and Danielle both hosted large retreats last year and have lots of great tips for you. Jenn Discher and her husband and three kids (ages 9, 7, and 4) live in North Georgia, outside of Atlanta. Jenn was a high school history teacher for six years before her oldest was born and she\'s homeschooled since the beginning. Regarding homeschool philosophy, Jenn relies heavily on Charlotte Mason’s ideas and the classical tradition, slowly growing in her understanding of both! Danielle Cyrus has been married to her husband, Grant, for 17 years. She lives in Willamette Valley, Oregon where she homeschools their three kids, ages 12, 10, and 8. Danielle and her family have always homeschooled, growing their understanding of the Classical tradition and the methods of Charlotte Mason as they go, always working out how they weave together. As you probably noticed, Early Bird Registration is now open for the Laughing Well Scholé Sisters fall online local retreats. Click here to register. Yes, this year’s theme is “laugh.” Please don’t think this means stand up comedy! This is about joy and levity and faith –and the heart of what it means to be at peace while we homeschool. It’s true: you can register and do the retreat all by yourself. A fair amount of people do that. But the retreat was designed to give local groups the opportunity to have a nice local retreat for themselves – a real all-day getaway – without lots of planning and logistics.

Since the nineteenth century, Blight suggests, there have been three predominant strains of Civil War memory, which Blight defines as reconciliationist, white supremacist, and emancipationist. The war has retained a political currency throughout the years, and the ability to control the memory of the Civil War has been, and continues to be, hotly contested. TranscriptLecture Page |  Having dealt with the role of violence and the Supreme Court in bringing about the end of Reconstruction in his last lecture, Professor Blight now turns to the role of national electoral politics, focusing in particular on the off-year Congressional election of 1874 and the Presidential election of 1876. 1874 saw the return of the Democrats to majority status in the Senate and the House of Representatives, as voters sick of corruption and hurt by the Panic of 1873 fled the Republicans in droves. According to many historians, the contested election of 1876, and the "Compromise of 1877," which followed it, marked the official end of Reconstruction. After an election tainted by fraud and violence, Republicans and Democrats brokered a deal by which Republican Rutherford B. Hayes took the White House in exchange for restoration of "home rule" for the South. TranscriptLecture Page |  This lecture focuses on the role of white southern terrorist violence in brining about the end of Reconstruction. Professor Blight begins with an account the Colfax Massacre. Colfax, Louisiana was the sight of the largest mass murder in U.S. history, when a white mob killed dozens of African Americans in the April of 1873. Two Supreme Court decisions would do in the judicial realm what the Colfax Massacre had done in the political. On the same day as the Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court offered a narrow reading of the 14th Amendment in the Slaughterhouse cases, signaling a judicial retreat from the radicalism of the early Reconstruction years. The Cruikshank case, two years later, would overturn the convictions of the only three men sentenced for their involvement in Colfax, and marked another step away from reconstruction. Professor Blight concludes with the Panic of 1873 and the seemingly innumerable political scandals of the Grant Administration, suggesting the manner in which these events encouraged northerners to tire of the Reconstruction experiment by the early 1870s. TranscriptLecture Page |  This lecture opens with a discussion of the myriad moments at which historians have declared an "end" to Reconstruction, before shifting to the myth and reality of "Carpetbag rule" in the Reconstruction South. Popularized by Lost Cause apologists and biased historians, this myth suggests that the southern governments of the Reconstruction era were dominated by unscrupulous and criminal Yankees who relied on the ignorant black vote to rob and despoil the innocent South. The reality, of course, diverges widely from this image. Among other accomplishments, the Radical state governments that came into existence after 1868 made important gains in African-American rights and public education. Professor Blight closes the lecture with the passage of the 15th Amendment, the waning radicalism of the Republican party after 1870, and the rise of white political terrorism across the South.  TranscriptLecture Page |  Professor Blight begins this lecture in Washington, where the passage of the first Reconstruction Act by Congressional Republicans radically altered the direction of Reconstruction. The Act invalidated the reconstituted Southern legislatures, establishing five military districts in the South and insisting upon black suffrage as a condition to readmission. The eventful year 1868 saw the impeachment of one president (Andrew Johnson) and the election of another (Ulysses S. Grant). Meanwhile, southern African Americans struggle to reap the promises of freedom in the face of economic disempowerment and a committed campaign of white supremacist violence. TranscriptLecture Page |  Professor Blight continues his discussion of the political history of Reconstruction. The central figure in the early phase of Reconstruction was President Andrew Johnson. Under Johnson\'s stewardship, southern whites held constitutional conventions throughout 1865, drafting new constitutions that outlawed slavery but changed little else. When the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress reassembled late in 1865, they put a stop to Johnson\'s leniency and inaugurated Radical (or Congressional) Reconstruction, a process that resulted in the immediate passage of the Civil Rights bill and the Fourteenth Amendment, and the eventual passage of four Reconstruction Acts. The Congressional elections in 1866 and Johnson\'s disastrous "Swing Around the Circle" speaking tour strengthened Radical control over Congress. Each step of the way, Johnson did everything he could to obstruct Congressional Reconstruction, setting the stage for his impeachment in 1868. TranscriptLecture Page |  In this lecture, Professor Blight begins his engagement with Reconstruction. Reconstruction, Blight suggests, might best be understood as an extended referendum on the meaning of the Civil War. Even before the war\'s end, various constituencies in the North attempted to control the shape of the post-war Reconstruction of the South. In late 1863, President Abraham Lincoln offered his lenient "Ten Percent Plan." Six months later, Congressional Republicans concerned by Lincoln\'s charity rallied behind the more radical provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill. Despite their struggle for control over Reconstruction, Congressional Radicals and President Lincoln managed to work together on two vital pieces of Reconstruction legislation in the first months of 1865--the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery in the United States, and the Freedmen\'s Bureau bill. TranscriptLecture Page |  This lecture begins with a central, if often overlooked, turning point in the Civil War--the re-election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864. Although the concerted efforts of northern Peace Democrats and a palpable war weariness among the electorate made Lincoln\'s victory uncertain, timely Union victories in Atlanta and Mobile in September of 1864 secured Lincoln\'s re-election in November. This lecture concludes Professor Blight\'s section on the war, following Lee and Grant to Appomattox Courthouse, and describing the surrender of Confederate forces. The nature of Reconstruction and the future of the South, however, remained open questions in April of 1865.  TranscriptLecture Page |  Professor Blight uses Herman Melville\'s poem "On the Slain Collegians" to introduce the horrifying slaughter of 1864. The architect of the strategy that would eventually lead to Union victory, but at a staggering human cost, was Ulysses S. Grant, brought East to assume control of all Union armies in 1864. Professor Blight narrates the campaigns of 1864, including the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, and the siege of Petersburg. While Robert E. Lee battled Grant to a stalemate in Virginia, however, William Tecumseh Sherman\'s Union forces took Atlanta before beginning their March to the Sea, destroying Confederate morale and fighting power from the inside. Professor Blight closes his lecture with a description of the first Memorial Day, celebrated by African Americans in Charleston, SC 1865. TranscriptLecture Page |  This lecture probes the reasons for confederate defeat and union victory. Professor Blight begins with an elucidation of the loss-of-will thesis, which suggests that it was a lack of conviction on the home front that assured confederate defeat, before offering another of other popular explanations for northern victory: industrial capacity, political leadership, military leadership, international diplomacy, a pre-existing political culture, and emancipation. Blight warns, however, that we cannot forget the battlefield, and, to this end, concludes his lecture with a discussion of the decisive Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July of 1863.

I HATE worksheets. I don't just dislike them. I literally hate them.  I didn't always have a choice. I was required to use certain worksheets. And in the past, I would give more worksheets than I should have. I used to print a spiral review worksheet for my kids to work on as morning work every day. But I have learned and grown as an educator. I am going to challenge you to ditch those spiral review worksheets. Why ditch the spiral review worksheets? -They are boring and do not keep our learners engaged. -They almost never match your pacing guide. -They can be a huge time sucker. How should I spiral then? -Build spiral review into your small group time. -Give students review activities that are more engaging than a worksheet. I love to use centers and menus. -Keep the task cards handy. -Look for natural times to review during lessons.

Rounding seems like it would be a simple skill to teach, but those of you who have done it before know that it is anything but simple! In this episode, I am excited to share several strategies and tips that will make your rounding lessons more effective. 1. Ditch the Rhymes 2. Start with Place Value 3. Number Lines 4. Circle and Underline 5. Hundred Chart 6. Real Life Stories Would you like some FREE rounding interactive notebook activities? Click Here->\xa0http://bit.ly/NotSoWimpyRounding | There is no time! There is never any time! Do you ever feel this way when you are looking at you long to do list? You're not alone! Years ago I learned the skill of batching and it completely changed the way that I work on tasks. Batching is when you work on one specific task for a long chunk of time until it is complete rather than doing a little of everything with your time. Batching your lesson plans has many benefits. 1. Reduces your start up time. 2. Simplifies your daily to do list. 3. It improves your focus and flow time. 4. Gives you time to prep your necessary materials that go along with your lesson plans. 5. Gives you time to find activities to fill the holes. I used batching so that I could get four weeks of lesson plans done ahead of time. If you haven't been batching, then the original start up will take some time. But it is SO worth it! Week One: Plan four weeks of math and one week of reading, writing, science and social studies. (This is the toughest week!) Week Two: Plan four weeks of reading and one week of writing, science and social studies. Week Three: Plan four weeks of writing and one week of science and social studies. Week Four: Plan four weeks of science and social studies. Week Five: Plan four weeks of math. Week Six: Plan four weeks of reading. Week Seven: Plan four weeks of writing. Week Eight: Plan four weeks of science and social studies. And just continue this pattern so that you are always four weeks ahead on your planning and never having to plan for all subjects on a Sunday night. | Do you start the year with a unit on how to write a paragraph?

What does this mean? Well, let\'s start by asking the question, how IMPORTANT is it that you reduce your risk of SCC of the skin, and how MUCH does exercise reduce that risk? If the effect of exercise is associated with a relative risk reduction of 1% in your lifetime risk of SCC, is that enough to get you to spend 1 week of your life each year on a treadmill?

The MRI shows acute strokes and multifocal vascular irregularities. Is it reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome or primary angiitis of the central nervous system? Or is it something else entirely? RCVS and PACNS almost always pose a challenge--even to the most astute neurologist. But, because they are treated entirely differently and their clinical trajectories depend on these treatments, it is worth knowing how experts distinguish the two. This week on the BrainWaves podcast, Dr. Jesse Thon joins Jim Siegler in a discussion about the clinical and radiographic features of these two conditions, and shares his experience in managing these patients.

They are the skills that utilize and synthesize knowledge and require us to act in concert with each other, develop relationships, and take ownership. These skills are founded in empowering individuals—requiring voice and ensuring meaning—as they navigate their unique educational paths. On this episode of the Whole Child Podcast, host Sean Slade, director of outreach and whole child at ASCD, and our panelists discuss why empowerment is important in education. | Guests: Nancie Atwell and Michael Soskil - Although much has been written about the achievement gap, less has been said about redirecting our focus to student engagement in learning. And focusing on engagement may be the closest thing we have to ensuring effective learning is taking place. On this episode, host Sean Slade, director of outreach and whole child at ASCD, and the inaugural winner and a 2016 finalist of the Varkey Foundation's Global Teacher Prize discuss how we can make our schools and classrooms all-engaging environments. Why is engagement important? What do we mean by engagement, and what does it look like? | Guests: Christine Brandt, Krystal Keller, Sharice Madison, Ryan Prosser, Danielle Shumate - Jason Lee Middle School, a high-poverty school in Tacoma, Washington, serves 584 students from grades 6 through 8. The success of the school—which was removed from Washington’s low-performing school priority list last year—begins with a clear vision and mission, aligned to the district strategic plan, to help students realize their potential by providing rigorous academics, equitable opportunities, and programs that allow for student creativity in a diverse community where all are accepted, valued, and supported. For its tremendous dedication and many accomplishments, Jason Lee Middle School is the 2016 winner of the Vision in Action: The ASCD Whole Child Award! This episode of the Whole Child Podcast was taped live at ASCDls 71st Annual Conference and Exhibit Show in Atlanta, Georgia. | Guests: Richard Curwin, Brenda Mendoza, Laurie A. Namey - Classrooms today educate increasingly diverse students who live in a globalized and interconnected world. To ensure our children are prepared to thrive in this environment, we must deliver each of them the quality education they deserve―one that focuses on the whole child and ensures access to quality teachers, provides use of quality learning tools and professional development for their educators, and establishes safe and supportive learning environments. On this episode, we ask our panelists how they define an all-inclusive learning environment. | Guests: Emily Davis, Aman Dhanda, Jane Hill, and Adam Holman - Our schools are responsible for meeting the educational needs of an increasingly diverse student population, including those who are learning the English language. These English learners represent nearly 10 percent of the total K–12 student population and are the fastest growing segment in U.S. public schools, yet they are almost twice as likely as their native-English-speaking classmates to drop out of school. On this episode, we explore how educators can create equitable educational settings that utilize the skills and knowledge of English learners as they navigate multiple languages and cultures. | Guests: Fred Ende, Maddie Fennell, and Bryan Goodwin - Teacher leadership is not a new topic in education, but it is one that has continued to grow in importance. When teachers are empowered to lead in their schools, they experience greater job satisfaction and are empowered to make a greater impact—and students benefit by having the best teachers in the classroom. On this episode, you'll hear a range of perspectives on teacher leadership that will address many key concerns, such as how administrators and teachers both benefit from empowered teacher leaders, how they can work together to develop a solid structure, and how such a structure benefits the whole child. | Guests: Peter Anderson, Jeffrey Bradbury, and Gordon Stokes - We may wish for teacher collaboration, by itself, to improve learning, but the reality is more complex. What does team teaching look like in today's schools? Do teachers have the skills and supports they need to make such collaboration work? How are teachers transforming their practice by working together? On this episode we explore the benefits and challenges of educators working together to plan and deliver instruction. | Guests: Marc Brackett, Anthony Cody, and Joshua P. Starr - Data, data, and more data. Educators are asked to gather and interpret student data to guide improvement, measure student learning, and track efforts to engage and support learners. On this episode we explore the data schools and districts collect and how to translate them into meaningful action. | Guests: Jeffrey Benson, Giacomo Bono, Laurie A. Namey - How educators respond to students' emotions and emotional behaviors can have lifelong effects—on students' academic growth, on the way they see themselves as people, and on the well-being of all the other students. In this episode, we explore how we all can help develop kids who are emotionally healthy and resilient.", 'chan_desc': "The Whole Child Podcast: Changing the Conversation About Education seeks to inform and engage educators, parents, community members -- and you -- about what works in today's schools.

Did you know that the Esophgeal Stage of the swallow is the fourth stage of swallowing? Or that numerous issues or etiologies arising in this area, often present in the oral stage of swallowing as “pocketing” or “behavioral aversions”? Also, did you know that best practice for instrumental swallow exams includes scanning the esophagus during a Modified Barium Swallow Study? Stay tuned for an overdue episode on the unfortunately underrated esophagus! | In this episode Michelle is joined by the radiant Registered Dietitian Deborah Malkoff-Cohen, MS, RD, CDN, CDE, who is the founder of City Kids Nutrition and NYCeatwell, nutrition consultation services for children and adults living in and around New York City.  Deborah shares her years of experience about the unique roles and responsibilities of an RD who works in the world of Early Intervention, jumping into Scope of Practice, Roles and Responsibilities, and top etiologies that she engages with on a day-to-day basis.  Don’t worry, this isn’t an overly “granola” episode, but functional Interprofessional education, served with a side of avocados and tomatoes! | In this episode Michelle is joined by powerhouse SLP that is Deborah Ross-Swain, Ed.D., CCC-SLP, who is the clinical director and CEO of The Swain Center for Listening, Communicating and learning.  She is also the immediate past president of the California Speech-Language-Hearing Association (CSHA).

Dr. Deb is here to share how she transformed ideas into action with the aid of a series of ASHA Grants!  She will share advice on the application process, the dynamic outcomes embodied in “200 words by 2” and “2 word combos by 2”, then wrap out this intense hour with functional advice on how to use these tools to educate your local pediatricians on the vital importance of functional language by 2 years of age!

Char is here to help give us functional strategies to establish motivation and “buy-in” from our little’s ones care givers and loved ones…so watch out HEP…we are about to get-it-done! | In this podcourse, the presenters tackle an often taboo topic, Grief. Too often we “feel” when a patient’s family is having an “off day”, but what happens when those “off days” become the norm? Grief, Postpartum Depression and Anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, these are all too commonly overlooked diagnoses that the parents and guardians of the special babies we work with, have to deal with on a daily basis. Are you prepared to recognize these s/s? Have you advocated and conveyed your concerns about the parent/guardians mental and emotional health to their physician? Do you feel confident in sharing these concerns? Are you aware of how these factors can impact the implementation of a home exercise plan for ST? Let real life experiences, tearful and comical, with functional and practical resources, build your confidence so that you can support the loved ones and caregivers of our little ones. | In this episode Michelle is joined by her dear friend Krystal Vermillion, MOT,OTR/L, from The Shriner’s Hospital Greenville, SC.  This episode is near and dear to Michelle’s heart as Krystal’s guidance on utilization of therapeutic cues not only shaped the frequency and types of cues that Michelle has used with her patients, but also with her own personal tiny humans.  In short, sometimes the auditory bombardment and latency period that SLP’s, (and tired Mommas), use in general are too much and too short…but never fear, Krystal is here to offer functional evidenced based tips on how to “read” our pediatric patients and offer just the right amount!

Venita is here to take those frustrations and worries away! Enjoy the nerdy-gal conversation between two podcasters who love their field and particularly AAC! | In this episode Michelle is joined by the one and only Elizabeth “Beth” Halpin, MHS, OTR/L, SCFES, aka Feeding Therapy, OT guru extraordinaire!

The most overlooked aspect of death investigation is the psychological dimension, which can provide unique leads, correct false assumptions, enhance investigative awareness, and solve cases in surprising ways. In an estimated 10–20% of cases, the manner of death cannot be determined, or worse, has been erroneously categorized.   In this episode, I spoke to Dr. Katherin Ramsland about the Psychology of Death Investigations. Both from the investigators perspective as well as the decedent and victim.  | For attorneys and other professionals, Plan B Forensics will provide a comprehensive picture of what happened to the victim. For families,\xa0we are you.\xa0We’ve been where you’ve been. The way we have processed our tragedies is to understand as much as possible what happened to our loved ones. We cannot change the outcome, we cannot undo what was done. But we are a collective voice for the victim and an advocate for the survivors.\xa0In memoriam. For closure, for peace. For all of us. \xa0 We put the whole story together for you to gain an accurate picture of how things went wrong and a life ended. We don’t guess, make assumptions or chase theories. We’re not on anyone’s side but the\xa0victim and truth.\xa0We start with the most important evidence and the best witness, the body. If a scenario does not match the injuries the victim sustained, then it’s wrong, so we start at the source and work our way out in an enlarging spiral. Dr. Entwistle’s extensive background and training in trauma surgery make it likely that she\'s seen these injuries before a fatality occurred and understands the mechanism required both before and after death -- a more comprehensive picture than a pathologist can give you. She was the real deal, “lifey-deathy” surgeon, for military and civilians, and will review medical records with the precision required in the operating room. Her certification as a medicolegal death investigator enables her to evaluate not just postmortem injuries but the process by which the death investigation was done. Ms. Turpen, a DNA Scientist and Evidence Analyst, will look at all the evidence collected and see avenues for further exploration. \xa0 \xa0 |  |  Are you a civilian crime writer who wants to use picture-perfect law enforcement details?

He originally defined burnout as, “the extinction of motivation or incentive, especially where one\'s devotion to a cause or relationship fails to produce the desired results.”   Burnout is a reaction to prolonged or chronic job stress and is characterized by three main dimensions: exhaustion, cynicism (less identification with the job), and feelings of reduced professional ability.   More simply put, if you feel exhausted, start to hate your job, and begin to feel less capable at work, you are showing signs of burnout.   Signs and Symptoms   While burnout isn’t a diagnosable psychological disorder, that doesn\'t mean it shouldn\'t be taken seriously.   Here are some of the most common signs of burnout:    Alienation from work-related activities: Individuals experiencing burnout view their jobs as increasingly stressful and frustrating. They may grow cynical about their working conditions and the people they work with. They may also emotionally distance themselves and begin to feel numb about their work. Physical symptoms: Chronic stress may lead to physical symptoms, like headaches and stomachaches or intestinal issues. Emotional exhaustion: Burnout causes people to feel drained, unable to cope, and tired. They often lack energy to get their work done. Reduced performance: Burnout mainly affects everyday tasks at work—or in the home when someone\'s main job involves caring for family members. Individuals with burnout feel negative about tasks. They have difficulty concentrating and often lack creativity.    It shares some similar symptoms of mental health conditions, such as depression. Individuals with depression experience negative feelings and thoughts about all aspects of life, not just at work. Depression symptoms may also include a loss of interest in things, feelings of hopelessness, cognitive and physical symptoms as well as thoughts of suicide.   Individuals experiencing burnout may be at a higher\xa0risk of developing depression.

Her dream was to be a Medicolegal Death Investigator and like many others could not get her foot in the door.\xa0 Although there is a loose connection between her “day job” and her dream job, she was not a boots on the ground investigators, or really anything to do with the Medicolegal Investigative process.\xa0\xa0 Amanda applied for an internship with her local Medical Examiner and was turned down, she applied for a part-time position and was also turned down. The reason given in each case was she did not have any experience or education in death investigation. Amanda understood the reason but did not expect it as the final decision. Through her persistence and determination, she started doing research on how to get the training and/or experience she would need. She reached out to connections on LinkedIn and started intense Google searches.\xa0 She knew she could not return to college for a degree and was that even necessary?\xa0 Through advice from peers and information found in her searches, she found the Death Investigation Training Academy.\xa0 After deeper research and a few phone calls to clarify some questions, she knew she had found the training she needed and enrolled in the next online Academy session. In this episode of the podcast, I speak to Amanda who tells her story in more detail and breaks down how the Online Academy course and subsequent Certification exam gave her the training and proof of knowledge she needed to land her part-time investigator position with her local Medical Examiner. We will talk about what’s good with the course and what she feels could use some improvement.\xa0 We talk very candidly and unscripted about the course, the process, and the exam.\xa0 \xa0If you are looking to enter the field of death investigation or need to have some good refreshers this course is what you are looking for.\xa0 Learn more at the Academy web site. https://deathinvestigation.com \xa0 \xa0 |  Due to the very nature of sudden and/or violent deaths, many things can and do go wrong in the first few hours of discovery.\xa0 Death scenes have a way of bringing together many individuals with various responsibilities and experience.\xa0 This unique group can consist of uniformed officers, detectives, CSI, and forensic experts, medical examiner and coroner investigators, as well as prosecutors and police administrative staff.\xa0   These scenes may also have fire and ems staff or other agencies trying to do their respective jobs. Not to mention families and onlookers Because of this scene, chaos errors can happen. Let\'s look at the ten most common mistakes of a death investigation.   1. Improper Response and Arrival to the Scene   First, responding officers may not correctly respond to and secure the scene and the immediate surrounding area.\xa0 It\'s not uncommon for the uniformed officers to not stop or detain people leaving or milling around the scene. Further, it\'s common that while waiting for investigation and CSI teams to arrive, first responding officers gather and congregate to close to, or in the scene inadvertently contaminating evidence.   Here are a few other examples of errors from first responding officers. They may fail to notify investigators soon enough, or at all, they may assume the death is a suicide or natural, and there is no need to establish a crime scene; they may fail to detain all persons present at the scene, which might include the suspect; or they may fail to separate possible witnesses and obtain initial statements.\xa0 Also, failing to make an initial determination of the scene boundaries leads to an insufficient area of protection.   2. Failing to protect the Crime Scene   In all death investigations, but even more so in a Homicide investigation, crime scene contamination can be and is a significant problem.\xa0 No other aspect of these investigations is more open to mistakes than the preservation and protection of the scene and subsequent evidence.   Paramount to any investigation is the assurance by the first officers on the scene to isolate and protect the scene as well as maintaining scene integrity as the investigation follows its standard path.\xa0 This includes the monitoring and supervising to paramedics and ems personnel in the scene. These personnel must be identified for a future interview.\xa0 Officers must also watch family members or others in the area to assure they are not contaminating the scene.\xa0 After a perimeter is established, the scene is locked down, and officers should start a log of everyone entering and leaving the scene and the reason why they are there.\xa0 Also, officers should be observing and taking notes of activities occurring in and around the scene.   3. Not Handling Suspicious Deaths and Homicides   All unattended death should be looked at and treated as suspicious, and an experienced officer/investigator should go to the scene.\xa0 These deaths should be treated as a homicide and a crime scene until the facts prove otherwise.\xa0 Too many departments allow untrained patrol officers to conduct basic death investigation with the assumption of suicide or natural death and with the thinking that it is unlikely to be a homicide.\xa0 Without training, officers could likely miss-interpreted a staged or altered scene.   If the scene is not handled correctly from the beginning and is later found to be a homicide, valuable evidence can be lost, and the integrity of the scene is compromised at best and at worst, non-existent.   4. Responding with a Preconceived Notion   It is imperative that investigators not allow themselves to respond to a death scene with any preconceived conclusion about the case. It’s common for investigators to get sent to a scene and given information based on the initial call.\xa0 If the call came in as a suicide and the initial officer who responds arrives with the mindset of suicide, it is common to treat the scene as suicide and thus shortcut any other investigation.\xa0 It looks like a suicide, so it must be a suicide, and no other investigation is conducted.\xa0\xa0   This type of preconceived investigation results in fewer photographs being taken, witness statements not being completed, evidence not being searched for or collected, and the integrity of the scene is destroyed.   It\'s not only suicide this can happen on, but reported natural deaths and accidents can also be shortcutting if responding officers make the conclusion of their investigation based upon the initial reported call.\xa0 If then, in fact, the death becomes suspicious at a later time officer reports and investigation will be lacking valuable information for future investigations.\xa0 The tendency is for the uniformed officer to write the final report and collect the evidence necessary to fit the narrative given to him by the initial call.\xa0   5. Failing to Take Sufficient Photographs   In today\'s world of digital photography, photographs are cheap and easy to obtain. Back when I start in this business, we used Polaroid instant photography and 35mm film cameras.\xa0 These were expensive, and some departments wanted to limit "unnecessary" photographs in an attempt to stretch the budget. That\'s not the case today, hundreds of photographs can be taken and stored nearly free of charge.   Photographs are a way to document the scene and to freeze that scene in time. They are used in court when necessary and will prove or disprove a fact in question.\xa0 Therefore, it is vital that photographs are taken of the entire scene, area, and location where the crime took place, including any sites connected to the original crime. Remember, you only get one chance and your first chance to document a scene.   6. Failing to Manage the Crime Scene Process   The investigator in charge should oversee the investigation and scene documentation. He or she should ensure proper chain of custody and documentation of evidence. They are also in charge of maintaining scene integrity. Never allow officers to use the restroom within the residence, or take food or drink from the kitchen, never allow smoking in the investigative area, never bring food or drink into the scene from an outside source, and always keep non-essential personnel out of the scene area. Designate an area for them to congregate if needed, but it should never be inside your primary scene area.   Lead investigators must also direct crime scene personnel on where and what are to collect. Many CSI staff are well trained and have a good idea of what needs to be done. However, each scene can have unique situations, and the investigator in charge must ensure evidence is adequately searched for and collected.   The victim\'s body should always be inspected and searched for trace evidence prior to being moved or taken from the scene. Not doing so can result in loss of valuable evidence and can leave many unanswered questions.\xa0   Always stop and look around the scene; look up as much as around. See what is missing or what isn\'t.\xa0 What looks right about the scene, and what looks wrong?\xa0 Is what you are seeing matching what you are being told?\xa0\xa0 Never leave a scene until you are confident every answer to any question you may have has been answered or documented. Remember, this is your only chance and a first chance.   7. Failing to Evaluate Victimology   It is imperative that investigators know the victim and completes a victimology study. You cannot properly investigate a death without victimology.\xa0 Failing to have a complete picture of the victim will preclude you from developing motives, suspects, and risk factors unique to the victim. These risk factors are usually regarded as high, moderate, or low and are based on lifestyle, living condition, job skills, neighborhood, or anything specific to the victim.   Victimology is the collection and assessment of any significant information as it connects to the victim and his or her lifestyle, these include areas such as; personality, employment, education, friends, habits, hobbies, marital status, relationships, dating history, sexuality, reputation, criminal record, drug, and alcohol use, physical condition, and neighborhood of residence as well as where they grew up of different than where currently living.   The bottom line is, who was the victim and what was going on at the time they became a victim. The best source of information will be friends, family, employers, and neighbors. You need to know the victim better than they knew themselves.   8. Failing to Conduct and Efficient Area Canvass Properly   I will admit that conducting an area canvass can be tedious and very time-consuming. Sometimes hundreds of contacts are often made without one shred of usable information being unveiled. However, it is that one exhilarating jewel that is occasionally discovered that makes the process so rewarding.\xa0   Most criminal investigation courses and books talk little about an area canvass, other than to suggest doing one. There are right and wrong ways to conduct an area canvass that will yield better results for the efforts put out.   Ideally, patrol personnel and plainclothes detectives should perform separate canvasses. \xa0Some individuals respond more readily to an authority figure in a uniform, while others prefer the anonymity of the detective’s plain clothes.\xa0\xa0Since it is impossible to know who will respond more willingly to either approach, both should be employed.\xa0\xa0This technique will give the investigator the greatest chance of getting vital information.\xa0   First, understand the terms “area canvass” and “neighborhood canvass” may be used interchangeably.\xa0\xa0They are interviews conducted in the field, as opposed to statements taken on the scene or in the station. The canvass may be conducted in an area near the crime scene or, conceivably, hundreds of miles away from it.\xa0\xa0In the aftermath of a bank robbery, for example, the getaway vehicle may be located several counties, or even states, away.\xa0\xa0Two canvasses should, therefore, be undertaken: one at the original crime scene (the bank) and one at the secondary scene (the vehicle). \xa0If a suspect is developed, it may be advisable to perform an additional area canvass in the neighborhood where that person resides to learn about his/her reputation and habits.\xa0\xa0A complex case may require that a number of area canvasses are completed at various locations.   \xa0The primary goal of a neighborhood canvass is, of course, to locate a witness to the crime. It is this promise of the elusive witness that motivates the investigator. However, it is not only the “eye” witness you seek.\xa0\xa0On occasion, it may be just as significant to discover an “ear witness." \xa0Someone who may have heard a threatening remark heard gunshots or even heard how and in which direction the perpetrator fled.   This information can point the case in the right direction.\xa0\xa0A witness who hears a homicide subject flee in a vehicle with a loud muffler, for example, could be furnishing a valuable lead.\xa0\xa0Likewise, intimidating or threatening statements the witness may have overheard could refute a subsequent claim of self-defense.\xa0 In an officer-involved shooting incident, a witness who hears the officer yell "stop police" or "drop the gun" is invaluable to the investigation.\xa0\xa0 Just as crucial as the eye-witness or the ear-witness is the "witness-who-knows-a-witness."\xa0 Even though this person may not have first-hand knowledge of the crime, he or she can direct investigators to a person who does and is, therefore, of great value.   Hearsay   Rumors, innuendo, and gossip may not have a place in the courtroom, but they are certainly welcome tidbits that help navigate any investigation.\xa0\xa0 The type of approach the investigator uses to cultivate this information can often determine how successful he will be.\xa0 In certain situations, it may be necessary to coax and cajole the witness. In others, it may be beneficial to appear to confide in the witness and reveal some "inside scoop" about the investigation. This works particularly well with the neighborhood "busy body" who will derive motivation from being "included" in the case.\xa0 Also, remember that in certain situations, an area canvass may more resemble an interrogation than a simple interview.\xa0 Eliciting information from a witness, who is not predisposed to furnish it, is the essence of any area canvass.   \xa0In high crime, drug infested neighborhoods retaliation for "snitching" to the police is a real-life possibility that must be appreciated.\xa0 Witnesses who refuse or are reluctant to cooperate with authorities may have ample reason for their trepidation.\xa0\xa0That is why each person approached should be provided with a contact number and assurances that they may remain anonymous.   9. Failing to Work Together as a Team   As with any crime scene, cooperation is critical among differing agencies. But with a death scene, this cooperation is ever more important and ever more strained.\xa0 Due to the increased severity of the scene, the spotlight, and egos, these scenes can become a disaster quickly. Therefore teamwork is vital, and it is the lead investigators role to set a tone of cooperation and teamwork.\xa0   One of the most significant issues in a major case is the failure to communicate information to those working the case. Agencies seem to want to keep what they know to themselves. This occurs from egos and turf wars, which will compromise an effective outcome.\xa0 Everyone involved in the investigation is after the same conclusion. Each member has a job to do and has information gathered from that job; this information is combined and evaluated to set the direction and ultimate conclusion of the investigation.   A baseball game is won when everyone playing does his or her job and supports every other player in getting their job done.   10. Command and Administrative Staff Interfering   One of the most frustrating mistakes at a death scene investigation is when command staff shows up on the scene with their own agendas which have nothing to do with the actual investigation. Sometimes it\'s for political appearance or simple curiosity. But unless they are an actual part of the investigative team, they should not insert themselves into the investigation.   In many instances, because they’re at the scene, command ranking personnel feel the need to direct the investigation. Consequently, they will have investigators running in different directions which have nothing to do with the primary investigation. The result is the loss of cohesive and central command and major miscommunication. Many times, in these situations no one is willing to step up and make decision and take control for fear of making the boss mad, so the chaos continues and the investigation is compromised, and when the outcome is delayed or not favorable, the command personnel directly the chaos will not see that they caused the confusion but rather the blame may fall on the lead investigator.   Conclusion   Death investigations are not always simple step by step cutouts. They require real attention and specific actions to protect the investigation integrity. Many of the mistakes mention here are from shortcutting and not taking seriously the gravity of the scene you are working.\xa0 Our job as death investigators, regardless of what function that is, is to get the truth for the victim and bring to justice to anyone responsible for their death, if in fact, anyone is responsible.\xa0 Developing and following strict procedures at every death scene will ensure that investigations are worked properly, and evidence is not missed.\xa0   Reference: Vernon J.

Are there Earth-like planetsaround other stars?  Do any of those harbor life?  Intelligent life?We\'d like to know the answers to all of these questions, and in recentyears we\'ve made great progress towards at least answering the first.  To date, more than 200 planets have been found around other stars, most in theinterstellar neighborhood of the Sun, but a few at great distance.  Thislecture reviews the search for ExoPlanets, discussing the successfulDoppler Wobble, Transit, and Microlensing techniques.  What we havefound so far are very suprising systems, especially Jupiter-size orbigger planets orbiting very close (few hundredths of an AU) from theirparent stars.  The existance of a significant population of so-called"Hot Jupiters" may be telling us that planetary migration can be muchmore extreme that we saw in our own Solar System, or that theseplanetary system formed in a very different way than ours.  It seemsappropriate to end this class with more questions than answers, butthat\'s where the science becomes most exciting.  Recorded 2006 Dec 1 in100 Stillman Hall on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | What is a planet?  Is Pluto a planet?  This lecture traces the debate onthe nature of what it means to be a planet by taking an historical approach, looking at how the question has arisen with the discovery of the asteroids andlater Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.  Many of the issued raised at the 2006IAU General Assembly meeting were raised two centuries before after thediscovery of Ceres and Pallas.  We will end with the new definition of aplanet, and why Pluto is better understood as a Dwarf Planet, among thetwo largest objects of the class of small icy bodies of the outer solarsystem, than as the smallest of the planets.  Recorded 2006 Nov 30 in100 Stillman Hall on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | Comets are occasional visitors from the icy reaches of the outer SolarSystem.  This lecture discusses the orbits, structure, and properties ofcomets, and introduces the "dirty snowball" model of a comet nucleus.The end of class was a demo where I created a model of a comet nucleusfrom common household and office materials.  Imagine a twistedcombination of Alton Brown and Emeril Lagasse with a PhD in Astrophysicsand you get the idea.  We were not able to arrange for a videographer tocome, but we did get some stills before the batteries died on thedigital camera.  The pictures are on the lecture webpage.  The lectureis slightly abbreviated because we did the student evaluation ofinstruction surveys before class started.  Recorded 2006 Nov 29 in 100Stillman Hall on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | Beyond the orbit of Neptune is the realm of the icy worlds, ranging insize from Triton, the giant moon of Neptune, and the dwarf planets Plutoand Eris, all the way down to the nuclei of comets.  This lecturediscussed the icy bodies of the Trans-Neptunian regions of the SolarSystem, discussing the basic properties of Triton (the best studied suchobject), Pluto, Eris, and the Kuiper Belt, introducing the dynamicalfamilies of Trans-Neptunian Objects that record in their orbits the slowmigration of Neptune outwards during the early history of the SolarSystem.  The Kuiper Belt is the icy analog of the main Asteroid Belt ofthe inner Solar System: both are shaped by their gravitationalinteraction with giant gas planets (Jupiter for the asteroids, Neptunefor the KBOs), and are composed of leftover raw materials from theformation of their respective regions of the Solar System.  Recorded2006 Nov 28 in 100 Stillman Hall on the Columbus campus of The OhioState University. | Asteroids are the leftover rocky materials from the formation of theSolar System that reside mainly in a broad belt between the orbits ofMars and Jupiter.  Meteoroids are fragments of asteroids or bits ofdebris from passing comets that occasionally pass through our atmosphereas meteors, and even more rarely survive the fiery passage to reach theground as a meteorite.  This lecture reviews the physical and dynamical(orbital) properties of Asteroids and Meteoroids, and discusses the roleof Jupiter and orbital resonances in dynamically sculpting the MainBelt.  Recorded 2006 Nov 27 in 100 Stillman Hall on the Columbus campusof The Ohio State University. | All Jovian planets have rings.  We are most familiar with the bright,spectacular rings of Saturn, but the other Jovian planets have ringssystems around them.  This lecture describes the different ring systemsand their properties, and discusses their origin, formation, and thephysics - resonances and shepherd moons - that govern their evolution.Recorded 2006 Nov 22 in 100 Stillman Hall on the Columbus campus of TheOhio State University. | Saturn is attended by a system of 56 known moons and bright, beautifulrings.  The Moon system is the focus of our attention today.  Saturn hasone giant moon, Titan, which is the 2nd largest moon in the SolarSystem, and the only one with a heavy atmosphere.  On Titan, theatmosphere is mostly nitrogen and methane, but the temperature andpressure are such that methane plays the same role that water plays onthe Earth: it can be either a solid, gas, or liquid.  I will reviewtantalizing evidence from the Cassini and Huygens probes that there is,in fact, liquid methane and maybe even liquid methane lakes on Titan.Most of the other moons are ancient, icy, and heavily cratered -geologically dead worlds - but one, Enceladus, is a big surprise.  Theshiniest object in the Solar System, Enceladus has spectacular fountains- cryovolcanos - that spew water vapor from reservoirs created in itstidally-heated interior.  This ice repaves much of the surface ofEnceladus, giving it a young, shiny surface, and builds the E ring ofSaturn.  Recorded 2006 Nov 21 in 100 Stillman Hall on the Columbuscampus of The Ohio State University. | Jupiter is surrounded by a solar system in miniature of 63 known moons.Most (59) are tiny, irregular bodies that are a combination of capturedasteroids and comets.  The 4 largest are the giant Galilean Moons: Io,Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  Each is a fascinating world of its own,with a unique history and properties: volcanically active Io, icy Europawhich may hide an ocean of liquid water beneath the surface, the groovedterrain of Ganymede, and frozen dirty Callisto with the most ancientsurface of the four.  Recorded 2006 Nov 20 in 100 Stillman Hall on theColumbus campus of The Ohio State University. | Uranus and Neptune are the smallest and outermost of the 4 Jovianplanets.  While superficially similar to Jupiter and Saturn, there aresubstantial differences.  Uranus and Neptune have smaller rocky coressurrounded by deep, slushy ice mantles and relatively thinner hydrogenatmospheres, quite different from the massive cores and deep metallichydrogen mantles of Jupiter and Saturn.  We will also ask why theyappear blue, look at their internal energy and weather, and then reviewthe properties of the Jovian planets as a group.

She wrote to us and asked: “By focusing so heavily on evidence-based strategies, do we risk neglecting important aspects of the whole learning process for which evidence is harder to gather?” She goes on to say that she’s a “maths teacher, and the beneficial effects on learning of differently designed tasks is MUCH harder to gather evidence for than, say, spaced practice, but can have big effects on student concept development and motivation.”Those of us at Learning Scientists agree, Lesley’s not wrong! We talk about why we focus on evidence-based strategies and how we want the research to move forward.Listening on the web? You can subscribe to our podcast to get new episodes as they come out!

Generally, they found students tend to forget after a delay, but retrieval practice improves memory after a delay. It is better not to be distracted (divided attention) when rereading. However, the students’ learning was not as affected by divided attention when they practiced retrieval. Retrieval practice seems to be a particularly resilient strategy!Re-created figure from Mullican & Picklesimer (2016) study 2.References: Mulligan, N. W., & Picklesimer, M. (2016).

The Project is huge, but asks an important question: how can we teach students to utilize strategies that we know are effective on their own to improve learning and academic success. We know these strategies work, we just don’t know a whole lot about the best way to help students learn about them and then transfer the use of the strategies to their own studying. In a huge pseudo-randomized control trial at Washburn University, we taught half of the WU 101 students (a first-year seminar course) about effective learning strategies. In our first wave of data collection during the 2017-2018 school year, we found that first-generation college students actually had a lower GPA in the intervention group compared to the control, while non-first-generation college students had a higher GPA in the intervention group compared to the control. NOTE: we have to say this with extreme caution! We need to replicate this finding before we decide to run with it. If we do replicate this during the 2018-2019 school year, future research will need to examine why this happened.  Note, we’re not saying the strategies don’t improve learning in first-generation students. Instead, it’s possible that this interaction did something that led the students to perform slightly worse in courses! This could be because the intervention didn’t explain the strategies, or that first-generation students were overwhelmed, perhaps they didn’t know how to use the strategies strategically. There are a lot of potential reasons to investigate. Of course, this result could also be a fluke, and we need to replicate. (And honestly, we hope it is a fluke, but the data are the data!)While this finding is disappointing, and we certainly don’t want to hurt any specific group of students, this highlights the importance of the research and control groups. It is best to test things out before implementing them widely! | This episode was funded by the\xa0Chartered College of Teaching, and listeners like you.\xa0For more details on how to help support our podcast and gain access to exclusive content, please see\xa0our Patreon page.Listening on the web?

If you haven’t listened to previous episodes yet, we recommend going back to the first set of episodes, 1 through 13, to hear more about each strategy in depth. The purpose of the review is to provide a bit of spaced practice!Some tips to keep in mind: Don’t try to implement all of the strategies all at once or all of the time. Don’t try to overhaul your entire course! Start with small changes and see how it goes. You can keep making little changes with each iteration of the course.Remember, each strategy works because it encourages processing that promotes learning. So, implementing these strategies are all about encouraging useful processing. When looking from the outside, two groups of students can look like they’re doing the exact same thing, but in reality one group may be doing something useful and the other not. Using the strategies in the classroom also won’t always look the same. | This episode was funded by the\xa0Chartered College of Teaching, and listeners like you.\xa0For more details on how to help support our podcast and gain access to exclusive content, please see\xa0our Patreon page.Listening on the web?

Here are a few takeaways from this interview: 1) Candous is an effective educator, because she thinks outside of the box. 2) Candous is a graduate of Christian Brothers University (I was just accepted into Christian Brothers’s Educational Leadership program), so we are fellow Buccaneers. 3) Candous, similar to myself, did not begin her teaching career through a traditional TEP. 4) Candous is a reflective educator—a key to instructional effectiveness.I hope you enjoy the show.

Further,this dark matter is only about 30% of the combined matter and energydensity of the Universe, the remaining 70% of which appears to be a formof Dark Energy that fills the vacuum of space and acts in the presentday to accelerate the expansion of the Universe.  This lecture willsummarize the state of our understanding of Dark Matter and Dark Energy,and look at the questions remaining to be answered in this active areaof current research.  Recorded 2006 March 7 in 1008 Evans Laboratory onthe Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | How will the Sun evolve?  The Sun is now a middle-aged, low-mass, MainSequence star in a state of hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium that hasconsumed about half of the Hydrogen available for fusion in its core.What will its subsequent evolution be as its core runs out of Hydrogen?This lecture describes our current state of understanding of theexpected evolution of the Sun, informed by a combination ofstate-of-the-art solar models and stellar evolution codes, and datagathered from observations of nearby stars in our Galaxy.  We will tracethe future history of the Sun from the present until it begins its finalphase as a fading White Dwarf some 8 Billion years in the future.  Alongthe way, we'll also ask what will become of Earth.Recorded 2006 March 6 in 1008 Evans Laboratory on the Columbus campus ofThe Ohio State University. | What is the ultimate fate of the Universe?  The ultimate fate ofthe Big Bang is either expansion to a maximum size followedby re-collapse (the Big Crunch) or eternal expansion into a cold,dark, disordered state (the Big Chill).  Which of these is ourfuture depends on the current density of matter and energy in theUniverse, Omega0.  This lecture examines our current knowledge ofthe matter and energy content of the Universe, which leads to thesurprising discovery that we live in a Universe thatis Flat (Omega0=1), Infinite, and Accelerating!  We will end the lectureby exploring the possible fate of an infinite accelerating Universe.Recorded 2006 March 2 in 1008 Evans Laboratory on the Columbus campusof The Ohio State University. | What was the Universe like from the earliest phases immediately afterthe Big Bang to the present day?

Otherwise known as getting high and horny or party and play – those who take part in chemsex do so to change the sex they are having with a so-called ‘holy trinity’ of drugs.McKellen spoke about when he first tried a joint at the age of 30, with Evan Davis adding that ‘drugs were much weaker back then’.The audience at National Student Pride were enthralled by Ian with his re-tellings of his pursuits to join the theatre as “one of the reasons I became a professional actor is because I learned that I could meet queers in the British theatre” and admitting “I just wish when I was younger I could have been myself”.McKellen got many a laugh with his unrelenting wit, gesticulating at one point about “drawings of genitalia in public bathrooms”.The conversation also looked at various aspects of McKellen's life:- His coming out story- How Margaret Thatcher’s Section 28 Law made him the activist he is today and how the queer scene in the theatre was what first attracted him to the profession- His advice to young LGBT+ students- Holding Elijah Wood’s hand while he got a tattoo during the filming of Lord of the Rings- The #MeToo movementOn Me Too he says:'Well frankly, I’m waiting for someone to accuse me of something, and me wondering whether they’re not telling the truth and me having forgotten (pointing to his head) you know.But with the couple of names you’ve mention, people I’ve worked with, both of them were in the closet. And hence all their problems as people and their relationships with other people, if they had been able to be open about themselves and their desires, they wouldn’t have started abusing people in the way they’ve been accused.Whether they should be forced to stop working. That’s debatable. I rather think that’s up to the public. Do you want to see someone who has been accused of something that you don’t approve of again? If the answer’s no, then you won’t buy a ticket, you won’t turn on the television. But there may be others for who that’s not a consideration.And it’s difficult to be exactly black and white.'He has since released this statement about the comments: https://twitter.com/IanMcKellen/status/1101741037083455488  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | June 1969.

She is co-facilitating Raising Free People Workshop with me this year, and on this episode, we’ll share some details about the space we intend to hold. Raising Free People Workshop is a space for us to apply decolonization and deschooling to the way we raise and relate to children. And into the way we support children in owning themselves.This workshop, and this practice, helps adults focus on transitioning from master to partner; embracing collaboration instead of coercion; being willing to listen; embodying compassion as we raise and support confident, happy, community-minded, fully-equipped, liberated people. Listen in, then come join us (registration closes Oct. 1) if you want to be part of an intergenerational discussion on liberation, learning, and relationships.Support the show | Last week we talked about barriers, and this week we’re talking about stress, which of course, can also be an effective barrier to our raising free people practice. So, what do we do with these potential barriers and existing stressors? We question and practice our way out of as much of it as we can. We seek and find community among whom we can share our pain and our joy. We remember our capacity to get free. We refuse to pretend to be okay when we are not. We see our children, and the children in our communities, as free people, and we do the emotional and spiritual work we need to do in order to not let our pain and stress become weapons against children. In this episode, I’m sharing what some other listeners said about their practices, in hopes that they nudge you toward your own.\xa0Support the show | This week, we’re talking about the things that get in the way of our raising free people practice. There are many, but today, I’m highlighting three primary ones, poor baggage handling, systemic racism, and partner problem. I’m explaining each of these as I understand them, and I’m encouraging you to comment on this show notes page, or on social media using the #raisingfreepeople tag to talk about how you navigate, intercept, or completely shed the effects of any of these three effective barriers. Whether you’re homeschooling, unschooling, or simply shifting your relationship to one that embodies more conscious parenting and living, let’s work through these together!Support the show | This week, I’m sharing some of the insights that have come from my busy month in California. This month, I’ve done trainings, workshops, and gatherings, around this work of raising free people, and deschooling has been a central theme in all those spaces. I can see that we need more discussion about deschooling, here on Fare of the Free Child, and that starts today. There is a myth that it takes about a year of deschooling for every year of school a child attended--let me just label that bullshit right now. There is no time limit on deschooling because it is an ever-evolving process that grows as we grow, shows us more about ourselves and our environments. Let’s talk a bit about deschooling today.

What if my children just can’t, because of ...? Most of us have probably asked ourselves that question once or 50 times, yeh? Well, my answer today is way different that what it would’ve been during our first three or so years of unschooling. My answer is: Give yourself time to deschool so that you can begin to see your children from a more informed, less colonized lens. These feelings are about a scarcity mindset brought on and constantly fed by school, by testing centers, by organizations that thrive off the idea that we humans could never horde enough information. We are never enough, and so our children can only be enough if we over-extend ourselves financially and emotionally, and make sure our children learn whatever the smart people who tell us what our children need, say they need to learn. Force not feelings, coercion not confident self-exploration that leads to clarity and real learning. Let’s talk about the questions behind our most pressing questions this week, shall we?Support the show | We deh pon di replay this week! This is a rebroadcast of episode 45, where I answer a question from someone who attended my unschooling webinar. She asked about the process of the transition from home-schooling to unschooling, and I expound on a response from a long-time unschooler, Itiel McVay, inside the webinar. Plus, I give an overview of unschooling, so don’t miss those details. #BIPOCinSDESupport the show | Join Dr. Sundiata for episode 3 of the Let\'s GROW Podcast series as he explores "Trust Issues" and the patterns of distrust that are so common in our lives.

Mira is a teacher, author, and presenter. She has been teaching for 20+ years in Colorado at the middle and high school level. She started learning German when she was in high school and studied as an exchange student. She began as a German teacher and somehow started teaching Spanish with few credits to her background. She traveled to Mexico and lived with a family during the summer and read chapter books to help herself improve. She took intensive classes and watched telenovelas. This hard work inspired her to push students to read more and more to learn a foreign language. She would read books and if they were too hard she couldn’t finish them. She wanted to use that motivation to help students understand and still be motivated to keep reading without giving up.

Ashley starts the episode with information about a project in her classroom called Teacher for a Day based on ideas she got from Laura Sexton. Laura was a guest back in season 1 on episode 9. Listen to her episode  here. Teacher for a Day Students plan, prepare, and lead an entire class period in Spanish. They pick themes, vocabulary words, and activities. Rule of thumb- stick with general words to cover more content and not super specific things. Students can use props and bring their class to life. They hook the other students, do movement, and do a reading and writing activity. The kids come up with awesome material that the teacher can use and play with other classes later on. The content can be anything so the students are really empowered to do a lot with the language and lead really powerful activities. Students might need more help the first year but they quickly realize how much more language they possess year after year and push themselves to be even more creative in the second or third year of the project. Details and resources can be found at www.deskfree.wordpress.com Interview: Alicia Quintero is a Spanish teacher from Chicago. She teaches levels 1 and 4 in an IB school. Some of her readers are available in French but they are all available in Spanish. Alicia has been writing since about 2015 and has been teaching for 14 years. Her writing came from a lot of storytelling in class and she was using this avenue to try to solve problems happening within the classroom. What does FVR (Free Voluntary Reading) look like your classroom? It depends on the class and the level of engagement with reading. We as teachers need goals for what we want to accomplish during a reading session. We know that reading bolsters second language acquisition but they can also learn more than that, like a life lesson. Big Takeaway! Get your students reading and if you have a story to tell, write it! A.C. Quintero is not the only author writing awesome FVR books for World Language classrooms. Go explore all the authors out there and give your students something to be excited about in class!

You can find more information here on her website, deskfree.org On this episode Ashley chats with the hilarious Sarah Breckley who lives and breathes adding fun and laughter to everyday teaching. Then Ashley herself walks us through a big reset she did with one of her classes that was struggling to not use English in class. Interview: Sarah Breckley teaches Spanish 2 to high schoolers in rural Reedsburg, WI. You may know Sarah as Fiona from Señor Wooly’s video Feo. She travels with her students and does homestays and does a lot of communicative activities in her classroom. She films a lot of her classes to share with other teachers on  Youtube and Vlog. Sarah is a huge advocate for teachers to find the courage to post a video of yourself teaching and sharing videos of the amazing things we’re all doing in our classrooms. She wants us to know that she watched many videos of other educators before making her own so she may be a huge proponent of sharing your awesomeness in the classroom through video but she was not the first one to be so brave. Sarah had A LOT of amazing information to share with us about movement and games. For those detailed notes, visit www.deskfree.wordpress.com Variety: Ashley walks us through a reset with a struggling class this year. Ashley and the class had been struggling along all year and most of her regular techniques to help struggling classes had not been working. They stopped everything they were doing towards language acquisition and got together as a group to problem solve and get back on track. The problem: Students would come in and not quite know what to do. They’re supposed to come in, stand in a circle, and we start chatting and moving into a game. They were not understanding this process and were still using English when they weren’t supposed to. They were not committed to all target language use. They would argue when they didn’t understand or weren’t being understood and wouldn’t take the time to stay in the TL and revert to English.

Ashley has always had a heart and passion for community where her path led her to a career in non-profit. After she finished undergrad at Michigan State University, she jumped right into a Master\'s degree in Educational Psychology to bolster her non-profit career trajectory. In the first few years in the sector, Ashley was searching for opportunities to move up and in her searches she\'d often see librarian openings.After a few years in non-profit without the advancements she desired and deserved, Ashley decided to pivot to library science after seeing so many postings when she was searching for positions in the past. She\'s now earning a second Masters degree, now in Library and Information Science as a pivot to a job that still allows her to serve her purpose in the community.She shares her story to and through the grad school journey on this week\'s episode. | This week\'s episode is a throwback!

If you\'re a scholar, rooting is the planning and blossoming is the goal achieved. That goal could be a paper, a research project, building your network, etc. Setting a goal in our heads may be as easy as writing that goal down however the process of actualizing the goal can be frustrating and confusing without some careful considerations taken into account.

From her first visit at Purdue, Elissia immediately knew she wanted to be in a space where she was truly comfortable.\xa0 She didn’t want to be the first black woman in her PhD program and she was hesitant to introduce herself to professors because she didn’t feel like she wouldn’t measure up. That didn’t stop her and when Elissia discovered a professor’s research that she found herself connected to everything started to click.“The only way to get past my insecurities is to talk about them freely.”Coming from the Southside of Chicago Elissia quickly realized there are different ways to approach a conversation and while in undergrad.\xa0 That was a tough lesson.  By navigating her new found tone, Elissia learned the conversation finesse while still commanding respect.  In finding her voice, she also learned how to find a structure within her PhD program that would sustain her success throughout her grad school experience. “You take your education in your own hands.”\xa0Check out Elissia’s Podcast: The Research HerFollow her on IG @theresearchherIG Link:\xa0https://www.instagram.com/theresearchher/ | This episode is all about creating a space you enjoy away from campus.

Understanding exactly who he was and staying grounded with what brings him happiness, Demar overcame the largest hurdle people experience when looking to pursue grad school.\xa0 He tapped into the resources around him to learn from his rejections and realized he held power in the things he could control while crafting his narrative. “Sometimes we don’t get the validation from the spaces we are in and when you’re trying to communicate a world and what you’re saying doesn’t make sense to people there is value in finding people you are meant to be in these conversations with.”Find your purpose, passion and place of peace and own it outright.\xa0 “This is a space where you have a right to be;” it helps you get from start to finish because it alone belongs to you. “The process is more important than the milestone.”... a word...WHEW!\xa0Get ready to be inspired ya’ll because CLASS IS IN SESSION.Follow DemarTwitter:https://twitter.com/demarlewisivInstagram: instagram.com/thegreater5ool', 'chan_desc': 'Blk + In Grad School is an audioblog created to encourage and inspire women + people of color to and through the grad school struggle.

Iconoclasm is an enduring American value. In 1776, a mob destroyed a statue of King George III in Bowling Green, New York, establishing the new American Republic as a nation built on image destruction. More recent acts of visual violence have targeted Confederate monuments, transforming them both physically and digitally. Images of vandalism that circulate online are powerful enough to re-cast bronze and shatter stone. | Dr John Blakinger discusses \'Scaffold\', Sam Durant\'s contentious sculpture. Sam Durant\'s controversial sculpture Scaffold, a wooden structure recalling specific gallows from American history, ignited a firestorm at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2017. The work resembled the scaffold used in nearby Mankato, Minnesota, where 38 Dakota men were executed just days after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation - it was the largest mass execution ever held on American soil. This historical reference prompted a backlash from Native communities, who called for the work\'s removal. Can art help us dismantle the past and loosen its shackles? Or are we always forced to remember? | Dr John Blakinger speaks about the controversy surrounding Dana Shutz\'s painting of the body of Emmett Till exhibited at the 2017 Whitney Biennnial. Who has the right to see in an age of image overload? At the 2017 Whitney Biennial, a painting by the artist Dana Schutz depicting the body of Emmett Till, a fifteen-year-old African-American boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, incited outrage. The artists Hannah Black and Parker Bright condemned the work as "black death spectacle." The episode resuscitated debates over the use and abuse of traumatic pictures, and the way visual images propelling the Civil Rights movement also exploited their subjects. | Dr John Blakinger talks about demonstrations against the Whitney Museum of American Art related to its connections with the tear gas manufacturer Safariland. In November 2018, an image of migrants fleeing tear gas at the US-Mexico border ricocheted across the internet, inspiring protests against the Trump administration’s immigration policies but also against a more unlikely target: the Whitney Museum of American Art.  The artist-activist collective Decolonize This Place stormed the museum in demonstration against the Whitney’s connections to Safariland, a manufacturer of tear gas.  Andy Warhol’s silkscreen canvases, then on view for a major retrospective, took on new meanings during these events.  The artist’s “Death in America” paintings depicting turmoil in the 1960s came to life in the gallery. | Professor Miguel de Baca gives his final Terra Foundation Lecture in American Art on Gilbert Stuart’s unfinished painting of George Washington. | Professor Miguel de Baca gives his third Terra Foundation Lecture in American Art on the works of Georgia O’Keeffe and Martha Graham.

Do they churn out a certain number of pages each week? Do they have a day job? A cat? A room of their own? What does the desk look like? After peeking into several artists’ practices, we’ll turn to our own—not just with our writing, but our everyday lives: doing the dishes to walking the dog; vegetable gardening to schlepping kids to hockey; playing drums to serving at the church soup kitchen. We will explore the nature of dailiness and how such activities can shape our art. What does it take to create a whole life, one that will nourish us and allow our writing to flow out of it rather than squeeze into it? Come with questions and a niggling sense of possibility. | Poets and songwriters utilize aspects of language that are essential for prose writers to know. Take the slow, repeated vowels and consonants Joyce uses in “The Dead”: “…his soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe…” or the hasty sibilance alive in Shakespeare’s Hamlet: “Oh wicked speed, to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets!” Sound and rhythm help create sense and emotion, and by paying close and purposeful attention to the words we use—the beginnings of them, the interior sounds of them, the rhythm of them—we can evoke and ignite those senses and those emotions. In this Eleventh Hour you’ll hear (and practice) how techniques used in the sung and the spoken can help us create magic on the page. | The most intimate, powerful, and fraught relationships in our lives are often with the limited inner circle we call family. For that reason, those relationships often feature heavily in our writing. However, to write about family relationships means putting its players on a public stage, and this can bring a whole set of unique issues, both practical and emotional. In this lecture and discussion, specific difficulties a writer faces in writing about family members will be addressed, including concerns about ethical treatment of your subjects, family responses to publication, the writer’s fear of repercussions, discrepancies in memory, and research challenges. | Transforming life into writing is an individual process, as individual as the art we create. Another way to think about this is how do we understand and explain the relationship of the real or actual, what some people might call, what really happened, to the stories, poems or essays we put on the page. Much of what I have to say will be a practical guide for helping writers access stories from their own lives and the lives of people they know, with pointers on bringing that material into full blossom on the page. In addition, drawing on my experience in writing a forthcoming novel/memoir, I’ll address an issue I know many ISWF students struggle with: should this be fiction or memoir. | Chiaroscuro, in art, is a technique that uses bold contrasts of light and dark in painting to create vivid scenes and evoke emotion. It renders images almost three-dimensional. In writing, the bold use of light and dark has a similar effect. The balance of the serious with the humorous allows readers the chance to enter a story more fully, to laugh and cry, and connect with writing in a way that writing straight serious prose or simply humorous doesn't allow. This Eleventh Hour talk will look at examples from writing and art that perfectly balance the dark with the light to create hilarious and heart-rending work on the page. | In creative writing, truth isn’t everything, but emotional truth almost is. Whatever the genre, however familiar or strange the situation or action, readers need to believe that the emotions in a piece of writing are true. And nothing conveys emotional truth more powerfully than mixed feelings. Combining different emotions, including conflicting emotions, can strengthen their intensity as well as deepening our sense of their authenticity. In this talk and conversation we will explore some of the ways in which mixed feelings work, looking at examples from various genres and considering occasions when mixing emotions might fail us. | This lecture will consider memoirs and essays written about events that are still unfolding. How can you tell a story when you don't know how it will end? How can you write about yourself when your relationship to time, memory, language, the body, and the self are changing? We'll discuss memoirs from the middle of things by authors such as Laura Hillenbrand, Caren Beilin, Audre Lorde, Jean-Luc Nancy, Kazim Ali, Lily Hoang, and others. We'll ask how close attention to thresholds, brinks, and passing moments can lead to lasting discoveries. | Death has haunted the work of countless authors. And even if we’re not writing about death directly, it often overshadows our creations, as we deal with the loss of loved ones and the inevitability of our own mortality. These struggles can be paralyzing, or they can usher in new insights. Lori Erickson will talk about how wrestling with questions relating to loss, grieving, and mortality can provide rich inspiration for our writing. | Getting a story onto the page is a necessary first step. Then the heavy lifting, both outer and inner, can begin. While the facts of a real-life or fictional event may remain static from draft to draft, the author's interpretation of those events is likely to change with each iteration. That's where the real magic comes in. The workshop setting with its directed questioning is an ideal site for new insights to emerge. This Eleventh Hour combines literary craft and narrative therapy to explain how re-vision can promote lasting artistic and personal benefits. | We often think about the tool of reflection in writing as a mode of thought or tone of voice we employ when we ruminate, meditate, contemplate, or explain—in short, when we provide what Phillip Gerard calls “finished thought.” But we might also think about reflection as a turning, as a sometimes distorting, but transformational power. In this talk, we’ll look briefly at four qualities of reflection that might encourage artistic transformation in our writing and try some short exercises that will give you some practical tools to “think” about yourself differently on the page.", 'chan_desc': "The Writing University podcast features recordings of illuminative craft talks from the renowned writers, novelists, poets, and essayists who present at\xa0the Eleventh Hour Lecture Series during\xa0the University of Iowa's Iowa Summer Writing Festival.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts/v4/84/6b/17/846b17e9-5c09-de9b-1268-8c6b97cfe428/mza_3044140038948102126.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2007-06-18'}}

Monica Ramirez, a national recognized expert on ending workplace sexual violence and the author of the Dear Sisters letter that helped spark the TIMES UP movement, will discuss the policy measures, as well as the employment and societal norms that must be addressed to meaningfully address this problem.Monica Ramirez, MC/MPA 2015, Co-Founder and President, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas | Join us for an HKS Gender and Security Seminar Series event featuring\xa0Theresia Thylin,\xa0PhD Candidate in the\xa0Essex University (UK) Department of Sociology and a Gender and Humanitarian Specialist at the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) in New York.

In this seminar, Frank Dobbin discusses how programs work better in workplaces with more women managers, who are less likely than men to respond negatively to harassment complaints and training.\xa0Politicians and managers should be using social-scientific evidence to design harassment programs.Frank Dobbin, Harvard University, Department of Sociology | The purpose of diversity initiatives is to help groups that face disadvantage in society (e.g., women, racial/ethnic minorities, etc.) achieve better outcomes in organizations, but they do not necessarily work as intended. In this seminar, Lisa Leslie first presents a typology of four unintended consequence types—backfire, negative spillover, positive spillover, and false progress—as well as theory regarding the underlying mechanisms and processes that produce them. She next provides empirical examples illustrating the different unintended consequence types. She concludes by using the typological theory to derive potential interventions aimed at increasing diversity initiative effectiveness.Lisa Leslie, Associate Professor of Management and Organizations, New York University\xa0 | Only two OECD countries continue to exhibit an M-shaped curve of female labor force participation across the life cycle: Japan and South Korea. In this seminar, Mary Brinton analyzes how labor market structure and workplace norms influence this pattern. Her analysis draws on data from over 160 in-depth interviews with highly-educated Japanese and Korean men and women of childbearing age, and demonstrates how working conditions exert a powerful influence on gendered patterns of behavior at home and in the labor market.Mary Brinton, Reischauer Institute Professor of Sociology, Harvard University | Gender equality is a moral and a business imperative. But unconscious bias holds us back, and de-biasing people’s minds has proven to be difficult and expensive. Diversity training programs have had limited success, and individual effort alone often invites backlash. Behavioral design offers a new solution. By de-biasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big impacts. Presenting research-based solutions, Iris Bohnet hands us the tools we need to move the needle in classrooms and boardrooms, in hiring and promotion, benefiting businesses, governments, and the lives of millions.Iris Bohnet, Albert Pratt Professor of Business and Government; Academic Dean, Harvard Kennedy School; Co-Director, WAPPP\xa0 | Nonbinary gender identities have quickly gone from obscurity to prominence in American public life, with growing acceptance of gender-neutral pronouns, such as “they, them, and theirs,” and recognition of a third-gender category by U.S. states including California, Colorado, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington. People with nonbinary gender identities do not exclusively identify as men or women. The increased visibility of a nonbinary minority creates challenges for other rights movements, while also opening new avenues for feminist and LGBT advocacy. In this seminar, Jessica Clarke asks what law and policy would look like if they took nonbinary gender seriously. She assesses the legal interests in binary gender regulation in areas including law enforcement, employment, education, housing, and health care, and concludes these interests are not reasons to reject the broader project of nonbinary inclusion.Jessica Clarke, Professor of Law, Vanderbilt Law School | This HKS Gender and Security Seminar Series event features Aaron Belkin, Professor of Political Science at San Francisco State University and author of\xa0How We Won: Progressive Lessons from the Repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'\xa0\xa0Juliette Kayyem,\xa0Belfer Lecturer in International Security, HKS, moderates the discussion.\xa0The HKS Gender and Security Seminar Series brings leading experts from academia and the policy world, working at the intersection of gender, human rights, and security, to Harvard Kennedy School.

They have less frequently examined colorism’s worldwide dimensions. Yet, the manufacture of products offering the prospect of lighter, brighter, whiter skin is a multi-billion dollar global industry, with Asia being a key market. Importantly, the salience accorded skin color varies depending upon geographical location and social context. In this seminar, Professor Jones\xa0will discuss: (1) the ways in which skin color operates within different racialized communities, with a specific focus on African Americans, Asians, and Asian Americans; and (2) how skin tone differences influence perceptions of individual and group identity and complicate coalition building within and across racial groups.Trina Jones, Jerome M.

AJ joins us from Truly Oreganic farm in Oregon where they specialize in an ocean grown style, where they harvest all of the rainwater to feed their living soil fed plants. We discuss what it’s like harvesting rainwater so close to the ocean and some precautions that one might need to take if they choose to harvest their own water. The grow that we dive into details about at the 17-minute mark is the grow that AJ currently manages. It’s 3000 square feet of full light dep, with 25-gallon living soil pots right on the ground. AJ says his biggest struggle with being in a fully light dep facility is controlling the humidity levels, and he has plenty of de-hus (dehumidifiers) rocking in the facility. They never put anything synthetic on their plants, and try to take the all-natural bio-control approach with their IPM practices as well. Right at 20 minutes, we discuss AJ’s tip for growing the healthiest plants, which is getting a PH meter and properly adjusting the PH of your water/feed to ensure that it’s within appropriate levels and keeping your soil PH on point as well. AJ goes on to talk about liquid/synthetic nutrients and ensuring that you follow the directions on the bottle, as well as ensuring they do actually “buffer” the PH if that’s a feature that they offer. Always test the mix before putting on your plants. We go into how important it is to grow organically for all phases of health, including my own and my experience with Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome. I reference the article  Radioactive Buds on Big Buds Magazine and AJ shares a story about a fellow gardener using rat poison around his grow and then the poison becoming systemic within the plant and causing it to fail tests in the bud. What should growers do in order to increase yield from a limited plant count? At 29 minutes AJ suggests paying attention to your water practices. Ensure your grow media is drying out properly and allowing the roots to breathe, but not allowing your plant to wilt. He suggests picking up your plant pot every day to learn where the sweet spot is to water your plants each time. Diving into IPM at 35 minutes, AJ strongly suggests getting a small jeweler’s loupe or a handheld microscope to identify pests within your garden. Pay attention to your plants and if you find a problem, you can pull the leaf off, stick it in a Ziploc bag and use the scope to get a good picture of it. Then use the handy dandy Google to start to identify the pest. If IPM is your thing you should listen in at 38 minutes to hear AJ’s specific bugs that he uses in his garden. What are the character traits that AJ thinks make the most successful growers? At 41 minutes, AJ says it’s the ability to ask questions. Asking questions is really the only way to learn what other people think and different ways to do something in the garden. AJ’s last bits of advice for all the homegrowers out there are to have persistence and open-mindedness with this process. Keep going, we’re all learning, and we’ve all had the problems that you’re working through right now. Don’t be afraid to ask questions in order to gain knowledge. Be sure to connect with AJ @ajortenstone on Instagram and follow along in his grower journey.

I had a lot of fun recording this and sharing all of my thoughts as I’ve gone through the last 6 months of recording this podcast. I’ve learned a lot from our guests and changed my opinions on some of our questions as this project has progressed. I’m excited to share my thoughts with you in greater detail. Right at 7:00, I start off sharing more details about my background and history within the cannabis space. I know a lot of people have heard me on episodes of Growcast or have followed my entrepreneurial journey with Atlas Plant Trainer but I’ve never really shared the full details of our grow before. So this is the opportunity to hear in greater detail exactly how the rooms and business were set up. I then move onto discussing what to pay attention to in order to improve overall plant health. While lots of guests have said environment, and I couldn’t agree more, I talk about the time you spend in and attention you pay to your garden and your plants. Check them over regularly, take pictures, make notes and you’ll be quick to notice differences in the plant. Spotting problems before they get out of hand is key in order to prevent them from getting out of hand. Of course, I discuss Low-Stress Training and how critical it is to increasing bigger yields. I try not to go on and on like I can do, when discussing low-stress training. Reach out to me if you’d like to have a more detailed explanation of low-stress training emailed to you. Right around 27 minutes I discuss my IPM protocols from my previous grows and what I’ve changed from learning more about biocontrols and natural, organic gardening practices. I share my experience with Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome and the potential for pesticides and even  heavy nutrient usage being a lead cause of CHS. Neem poisoning has been linked directly to extreme vomiting but doesn’t seem to have the same resolution as CHS. I also suggest using The Amazing Doctor Zymes and Mammoth Bio Control as two products I would trust on the market right now. Persistence and patience are the two character traits that I think every grower needs to possess in order to grow some truly amazing cannabis. We’re all going to make mistakes in the garden as we learn, hell, we’re gonna make mistakes when we’re learning anything. Have patience with yourself and don’t get frustrated or overwhelmed. The last words of advice that I share at 42:30 is to not forget that there are still many people that are still not able to grow cannabis legally and we have to fight for our rights to grow. Even against other people in the legal cannabis industry, as they lobby to reduce or eliminate our rights to grow a plant at home and provide medicine for ourselves. Don’t stop fighting, or supporting those that are fighting for the rights of home growers everywhere.

Hit me up at rob@thehomegrownhelpers.com | Buddy joins me on the phone from Ontario, Canada where he’s recently started Canadian Cannabis Consulting Company in order to spread his extensive cultivation knowledge as well as his passion for activism. Buddy has been a part of the cannabis movement in Canada for many years that has helped push the legalization bill forward in Canada. Right around 8 minutes, we discuss Buddy’s current grow set up. He has 4 outdoor plants in 65-gallon smart pots in his own soil mixture including peat, perlite, limestone, compost, and a couple of other additives. He’s growing some classic strains with GG #4, Sour Diesel, Blueberry and a Cheese variety, which is what he advises his clients to do. Get reliable genetics and keep the process simple, especially when helping a new outdoor grower. What are Buddy’s tips for ensuring the best health of your plant? Right at 13 minutes, he states that improving root growth and paying attention to the health of your roots is his #1 tip. Then, in an indoor grow setting he wants people to also ensure cleanliness and airflow around your room. At 17:00 we start to discuss exactly how to increase yield off a limited plant count. Buddy goes back to using smart pots and a healthy root zone. He had previously used clay or plastic pots and always had unhappy, unhealthy bound-up root zones for his previous grows. Since he’s made the switch, he’s seen much bigger yields due to improved root zone health. At 19:20 we start our discussion on Integrated Pest Management in an indoor garden. His tips include using a predatory bug such as ladybug’s, ensure that temp and humidity are dialed in, and keep your space clean. He likes grow tents because they can be separated from a space and easier to keep them clean opposed to a larger room like the basement. Just before 22 minutes, we discuss the most critical characteristics a grower must possess to be successful. Buddy says it’s as simple as common sense and patience. Pay attention to your plant, watch when it changes, look for bugs and color changes. He also states that it’s a MUST to spend time with your plants in order to see these changes. What are Buddy’s last thoughts (26:30)? Have patience and do your part to bring cannabis responsibly into our society to negate the negative perceptions that still oppose us and our industry.

With cannabis being legalized nationwide in October 2018, you can imagine that there is lots of opportunity for an entrepreneurial grower like David to capitalize on his skills and knowledge while helping growers learn the ropes. I know I relied on my friends in much the same way, thankfully they didn’t charge me. Typically, David can visit his clients one or two times after the initial setup visit, and with the help of technology and a well laid out plan sees many of his customers have a bountiful first harvest. After that, they can renew the contract, purchase the equipment and continue on their own, or pull the equipment out. Currently, David is helping people grow their legal 4 plants in a 4x4 grow tent, with oversized carbon filter and exhaust fan. The lighting varies a bit between a 315w Ceramic metal halide or a full spectrum LED light, they do offer an advanced grow with 2 LED lights within the same tent. They also provide super soil and 2.5-gallon pots for each of the 4 plants. Providing donated seeds to each customer, he helps to get them germinated on the customer’s kitchen counter. Providing a complete tutorial to help them be successful is also a key component to the business’ success. With David’s business, he tries to keep the variables small and the things to pay attention to minimal. He has his new growers watch temperature and humidity to ensure the environment stays dialed in. Beyond that, he asks them for simple observational health of the plant. Color and shade of the leaves, any blemishes or signs of bugs, changes in the top of the dirt and any anomalies from one plant to the next. They also encourage having customers send pictures if they’re concerned about a plant and even have some setups with cameras within their tent. \xa0What’s David’s advice for increasing yield off each plant? He suggests more lighting to his customers and putting those 2 LED lights in each tent to maximize the wattage and spectrum available to the plants. Typically, they don’t encourage plant training to new customers but work with a few experienced customers to teach them the sea of green technique. What’s David tell his customers about Integrated Pest Management? Keep your outdoor pests outdoors, and you’ll prevent them from being in your indoor garden. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in their small setups. If there are signs of problems, he suggests an essential microbe spray, EM-1 from Stepwell Super Soil on the leaves to help with powdery mildew and bug prevention. What types of character traits does David love to set up a new grow for? For them, it’s as simple as following a process. They have simplified the first grow for customers so well that as long as they can follow directions, they see close to 100% success rate. After the first grow, he does help growers experiment a bit but encourages everyone to keep it simple and not to get too far ahead of their abilities. David’s parting words: don’t cheap out when purchasing equipment or accruing knowledge. Quality comes with a cost, but if it’s truly quality it will return dividends time after time. Check out U-bud.ca to connect with David and his team, or find them on any social media platform that you frequent.

He has over 10 years of growing experience to share with you today, from a variety of sizes and styles throughout his past. Currently, Kyle has a few small spaces that he grows in. One has a 3’x3’ indoor grow tent with a bunch of flowering plants for a pheno hunt where he likes to experiment with different setups of soil and nutrients to find what works best. Currently, he’s using a few of our GrowPass partners in Buddha’s Tree and Fish Shit. He prefers to grow under LEDs due to the power output as well as the ability to keep his rooms cool. Along with his outdoor grow in living soil with all-natural inputs, he manages to keep several grows and many plants well kept and producing. What’s a grower supposed to pay attention to when it comes to overall plant health? Starting with the basics, he wants to get a feel for room environment and inputs. He strongly suggests keeping a journal of all of this stuff on a daily basis to track your inputs and results so that you can spot problems before they get out of hand. This is Kyle’s suggested starting point as it will help you learn what your plants are telling you early on. What can a grower do in order to achieve the best yield off a single plant? Kyle suggests ensuring you have a quality light to start with. Kyle talks about photomorphogenesis around 13 minutes, which is how plants grow in response to light. He talks about ensuring that your plants are a proper distance from your lights to ensure that a good amount of nodes are forming, a good distance from each other to maximize the number of bud sites available on the plant. Around 15:30 we get into the importance of low-stress training, be sure to listen in to hear Kyle’s tips. Kyle and I go off the rails a little bit around 18 minutes and talk about plant energy, since you know I’m so passionate about the topic. He shares that sequoia trees actually stop drawing up water and nutrients from the soil after they get to a certain size and then only absorb water from the air. Amazing stuff! What is Kyle’s Integrated Pest Management solution? Right at 22:30 we get into his solutions, and his first tip in mindfulness. He wants you to keep your rooms clean, and be aware of what you are bringing in to your house or grow space. Be mindful of walks outdoors, hanging with your pets, or hitting up the grow store as those are all problem places that can bring a host of issues into your grow room. Further, he is a fan of biocontrols such as ladybugs and praying mantis’. He gives some tips on how to apply biocontrols in your rooms, listen in to learn. What type of person is the most likely to succeed in the grow room? The type of person that can make a plan and stick to it. Don’t change too many variables because you really don’t know which variable is making the desired impact. So decide how you want to grow, but don’t be afraid to pivot if there are problems. Kyle’s last words of advice for the audience is to always keep an open mind. Don’t be afraid to try new things, as the industry and the science is evolving as the industry grows. If something didn’t work for you a few years ago, things may have changed and LED’s (for example) continue to improve.

Cascadia Farms was the second time that she’s ever seen a cannabis plant, but since she joined the company, she’s been a strong cannabis supporter and recognizes the cannabis plant is great medicine. Since joining the company, she and a few other members of Cascadia Farms have started Full Spectrum consulting providing service to everyone from growers to retailers on packaging, retail, cultivation and most anything else that comes up for retail cannabis operations. Erin currently is the head grower for Cascadia and has about 7000 sq. ft. of canopy that she manages which consists of 4 flowering rooms and 1 vegetative room, all in soil with an organic focus on the growing style. She also has her own personal medical grow to combat a chronic migraine disorder. She has 15 plants, and we suggest you tune into the podcast around 8:45 to hear all about how she sets it up. How does Erin think about overall plant health? Listen up around 13:30 to hear about good watering practices. She thinks people overthink additives, sprays, and water timing. Regularly people overwater their plants, and she advises that roots need to breath and allow the soil to dry out in between waterings. Maybe add some extra perlite to ensure the roots have room to breathe and loosen up the soil. Around 18:40 we discuss increasing yields. Her tip is straight-up lollipopping your plant or shaving the legs as Wolfman puts it regularly. Reduce the amount of energy that the plant invests into growing small wispy buds, and have it focus on just the top 4” of growth and ensure that you have a nice full canopy. Right at 20:20 she discusses her feelings on full defoliation, or schwazzing as it’s been referred to in the industry. Around 23 minutes we get into plant energy, schwazzing, tall plants and how the plants reach to such tall, full plants. She doesn’t think that yield will increase with growing such tall plants without proper airflow, light penetration, ability to spray, etc. She does think that growing such tall plants without any actual plant material on them is a waste of plant energy, but she also doesn’t blow any wind on her plants and allows them to strengthen on their own. It’s also a labor nightmare, in her words! A bit after 29 minutes, we discuss IPM in an indoor garden. She tries to mimic the outdoors as much as possible, and she focuses on microbes for all-natural pest management. She relates the plant to a dinner table, listen in right at 30 minutes to hear how she discusses beneficial microbes and filling up the table with them! If necessary, she’ll bring in insects to help control the problems, but she knows how hard it can be to keep them alive and kicking around your grow room. What type of traits does Erin think make the most successful grower? Open minds are the ones that are going to succeed, you simply can’t know it all and think that the way that you’ve done it is the right way because there is always room to improve. Don’t be afraid to be wrong. “Stop buying cartoon labels on products for your cannabis plants” is her last words of advice for all the listeners. She discusses more at 35 minutes, but essentially it boils down to not treating the cannabis plant so differently than other plants that have been grown for production value. While we’re learning to grow a new plant, there is a foundation of research done on all other plants that we can all learn from and then expand upon with cannabis.

As the owner of Today’s Healthcare MA, he has a passion for growing cannabis the way it should be done since 2014. Starting in 2016 he started growing full time and then started helping others how to grow their own after doing a lot of self-education and sharing of knowledge. Derek’s current grow set up is 2 15x10 grow rooms and consists of all Fluence LED lighting, Quest dehumidifiers, 18k BTUs of cooling with his Daiken mini-split and averages 2-3 plants per light. He likes to stick to 2 to 4 strains per room and grows in Tupur Coco as he’s found the most success with that medium. What’s the one thing that Derek would advise in order to attain the healthiest plants? We’ve heard it before, but here’s another grower saying to focus on your ENVIRONMENT! Clean your rooms and being with your plants every day so you can learn how it grows and when things are going well or if they are not. He also suggests keeping notes or a grow journal so that you can ensure you keep good track of your inputs and results, which we’re huge fans of here at The Homegrown Helpers. I ask Derek to describe what a praying plant looks like, and essentially it’s plants that are reaching up towards the light asking for more of it. This happens because your environment is dialed in, and you’re concerned with VPD which is the balance of the humidity and temperature in your environment. What’s Derek’s tips for increasing yield? High-Stress Training. He believes that the plant should just grow through the veg stage, establish good roots and be a healthy, strong plant before manipulating it. Starting with day 1 of flower he starts a strong de-leaf and lollipop of the bottom third of all branches. He also ties all his vertical shoots to bamboo stakes to spread the plant out further and allow for deeper light penetration. This is an unusual approach, but it works well for Derek! Derek shares his unique grow tip of keeping the rooms hotter with higher humidity than most people might expect while still maintaining VPD. He likes to keep it at 80-82 degrees and 65-68% relative humidity. If you reference the VPD chart, this is almost in the perfect zone. His theory for this difference maker is that the root zone is cooler and the plant doesn’t seem to feed as much as necessary. What characteristics are critical for a grower to succeed. Derek thinks it comes down to the passion for the plant and the medicine that it can provide. If you are just growing for the money, then it’s unlikely that you will produce the best cannabis possible. It takes time and dedication to learn how the plant grows and create a routine to take care of your plants the way they need to be taken care of. We then talk about the impacts that not spending the proper amount of time can have on your plants and the overall health of your room. Tune in starting at 22 minutes for the full conversation and how we both think about it. Derek’s parting words of wisdom: Start with 1 strain and learn how it grows before adding in other varietals.

As a passionate home grower of over 15 years of pretty much anything “he can get his hands on”, he started consulting on home grows immediately after federal legalization happened in Canada in October 2018. After years around the cannabis industry, he decided to take the leap, start his own business, and help others learn how to maximize their 4 plant maximum in Canada. Ravi’s current grow set up consists of 2 1000w HPS lights 10x20 room in flower, T5 fluorescent bulbs 3’x10’ for his veg and clone room. Ravi tries to stick to as organic as possible for his Ultra Soil, using bat guano, coco, peat moss, perlite, glacier rock dust, compost, and a few more additives to grow his plants in. What is Ravi’s tip to improve overall plant health? Dial-in your environment and getting it to the exact spot that cannabis thrives in. There are lots of variables to consider, like lighting, airflow, cooling and so many more. How do you maximize your yield off a limited plant count? The right nutrients, whether they are synthetic nutrients or organic soil it’s important to have the right balance. Giving your plants exactly what it needs, when it needs it, is critical to getting the most out of your plants! Also, good genetics are important along with plant training to ensure yields are up to your desires. What’s a unique tip Ravi brings to the show? Dial-in your soil and pay attention to plant pruning. Know where your good bud sites are, light penetration is important and know how to top, FIM and low stress train your girls. Determination, dedication, and passion are the 3 character traits that Ravi thinks make the most successful grower. These three traits are ones that will help you overcome any situation that you may encounter in the garden, and ensure you have a successful grow time after time. Ravi’s parting words? Remain determined and passionate. Good things come to those who wait. Stick to your passion and good things will come of it. You will continue to learn with each and every grow, so stick with it and keep your dream alive. Don’t give up even after failure, and go after what your mind can conceptualize.\xa0 You can find and connect with Ravi on Instagram at @monarchcannabisconsulting.

Russell lives in Humboldt County, CA and has been a Humboldt grower for 13 years and growing his own cannabis for over 20 years. With a background in geology, he’s a natural scientist and loves tracking, testing, and proving out theories within his cannabis gardens. Currently, Russell only grows outdoor, in large raised beds with a mix of native and potting soil with natural inputs that he sources from his land. He likes to grow large plants, as is the customary practice in the cannabis heartland of America. He prefers to grow 6-foot square plants and likes to stay away from the super tall ones that require more effort to grow, support and manage. How do you improve overall plant health? Russell takes a scientific approach and encourages paying attention to the immune health of your plants. He suggests our society attempts to grow plants faster than their immune system can grow and continue to protect the plant. Tune in around 9 minutes to listen to the specifics that Russell references, and why this is important to the health of the plant. He also talks about signs that your plant might be growing too fast – hint…it’s too many nutrients like Nitrogen! How to increase the yield you receive off of each plant? Biostimulants is where Russell would like you to focus (14:00). Amino Acids, folic acids, seaweed extract, chitin to name a few, but any natural input to stimulate yield and terpene production. Having a strong root system and not overwatering are two other points that he brings up, in order for the roots to stretch and establish a good base. Russell gets further into the bio-stimulants around 15 minutes through 20 minutes, on a very scientific level. We encourage you to listen in to get it straight from the source. Russell’s unique grow tips and tricks come in around 24 minutes, and it’s about getting longer flowering varietals to finish faster. He says to let the soil dry out significantly with higher temperatures to encourage that plant to mature faster, but understand that you will see a decrease in yield, but it’s all about timing for this tip. What’s Russell’s thoughts on the character question? Willingness to learn and study the science, be patient with yourself as you continue to learn, Things are always changing with your plants, and yourself, and you need to be willing to change as the industry and access to knowledge is. Russell’s last bit of advice – work towards adding in beneficial insects into your environment. Manage your environment, and the insects will take care of the rest. These insects can help take care of most problems that arise. He talks about the minute pirate bug, and how prevalent it is in his garden because of the banker (companion) plants that he’s worked hard to establish. He and Matthew Gates @syncangel on Instagram and he are working on a banker plant project, including peppers that will attract predator mites into your garden. Understanding companion planting is really beneficial especially to an outdoor gardener, and chascience.com has a membership that details some of this if you are really into this type of thing. He suggests checking out Green Life Productions for commercial cannabis done right.

He hunted rhinos in Africa.But his most dangerous journey came after his failure in 1912 to retake the presidency as a third-party candidate on the Bull Moose ticket. He choose to shake off the blues in an extremely dangerous journey to South America. Roosevelt did not merely want a repeat of his African safari: a well-provisioned hunt to a foreign land that was little more than an exotic form of sight seeing. Roosevelt wanted to join the ranks of explorers who were pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge: the arctic explorers discovering the Northwest passage or the African trekkers locating the source of the Nile River. His guide, the Brazilian explorer Col. Candido Rondon, suggested they survey the River of Doubt, an uncharted capillary of the Amazon that ran through treacherous terrain of the rainforest.Many told him the journey would end in his death. Ignoring the warnings of field naturalists with experience in the Amazon, Roosevelt said, “If it is necessary for me to leave my bones in South America, I am quite ready to do so.”Learn in this episode how he almost did.WANT FREE ACCESS TO AN ONLINE COURSE ABOUT WINSTON CHURCHILL?

The lecture will explore what this might mean for future British interventions. | Professor Alex Bellamy (University of Queensland) discusses new challenges for implementing Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principles in the current age. Bellamy, who is also Director of the Asia Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, outlines his view that R2P has gained normative acceptance throughout the international community at a much higher level that in previous decades. Significant progress has been achieved such as putting North Korean human rights on the table. With the rumbling year of politics in 2016, however, Bellamy finds that R2P protectors must be on alert. As far back as 2012, long before the time of Trump, he suggests that R2P was challenged by an increased prevalence of atrocity crimes, displaced persons and extremist activities concurrent with a decline in international capacity to handle these issues. Countries were failing to practically implement R2P despite their implicit agreement with its promises. The dearth of leadership from the United States under the next administration, he says, will only make things more challenging. Despite these concerns though, Bellamy remains optimistic about the future of R2P and proposes six ideas to protect R2P itself. These range from searching out leadership beyond the West and striving for more complete implementation of existing policies. | Author Angela Cummine gives a brief overview of her book on Sovereign Wealth Funds: what they are, and who actually owns them. Dr Cummine then explains some of the political disagreements that can occur when the state sees itself as the primary owner of sovereign wealth, rather than the agent of the people, who she argues, are the principal-owners of these assets. It is citizens therefore, who must enjoy meaningful control over and benefit from these assets. If sovereign funds are managed and used in a way that respects this vision of them as community funds holding citizens\' wealth, they could be used for a whole range of laudable public policy goals, for example, to plug budget deficits and to tackle economic inequality.  You can learn more about the book by clicking here: http://citizenswealth.net | Geir Lundestad, a Norwegian historian, who until 2014 served as the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, delivered the 2016 Cyril Foster Lecture, \'Twenty-five Years in the Search for Peace: Reflections on the Nobel Peace Prize\', on 3rd March 2016.  The Cyril Foster Lecture is the University\'s principal annual guest lecture in the field of International Relations. It has attracted a most distinguished group of lecturers. The Cyril Foster bequest specifies that the lectures are to deal with the ‘elimination of war and the better understanding of the nations of the world.’Geir Lundestad was the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute and the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize, from 1990 to 2014. In 2015 Geir published a frank account of his 25 Nobel years. The lecture is based on Geir\'s book, and in particular, discusses what the Nobel Peace Prize can realistically achieve. | Professor Emerita J. Ann Tickner (University of Southern California) delivers a lecture on the role of feminist theory in the field of international relations. Tickner\'s talk covers the genesis of the feminist approach to IR, which she herself pioneered some 25 years ago. She details how the feminist approach is methodologically distinct as most of IR relies on state-centric approaches while feminist theory is inherently sociological. One of Tickner\'s examples is the investigation of how gendered reponses to 9/11 caused a return to hypermasculinity in policy. Finally, Tickner makes a case for the continued development of the field as a way to continue legitimizing the explanations of world politics that scholars produce.The lecture follows from the 2014 publication of Tickner\'s book, A Feminist Voyage through International Relations, by the Oxford University Press as part of their series Oxford Studies in Gender and International Relations.

Mearsheimer (University of Chicago) presents the conclusions of his latest article published in \'Foreign Affairs\' on offshore balancing. Mearsheimer sets out his case against the practice of liberal hegemony by the US, making the bold statement that Presidents Bush and Obama have acted very similarly when it comes to intervention abroad. He examines the track record of US involvement in places like Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria before moving on to explain why \'offshore balancing\' would be a superior strategy for the US government to adopt. Mearsheimer argues that by managing conflict from afar, the US can halt the buck passing that is so common in international relations today, free up resources to be spent domestically and curb the spread of terrorism. His argument is tempered by a caveat for conflict with potential world hegemons: while he believes that the US can retreat from Europe and the Gulf, onshore involvement will be increasingly required in China as it poses a strategic threat to the US that will not be tempered independently by Russia.Discussant and DPhil student Ulrike Franke (DPIR) whose research examines drone warfare questions Mearsheimer on his conceptualization of liberal hegemony, the role of NATO and the Obama administration\'s legacy. She also raises the relevance of public opinion for his theory\'s implications.\'The Case for Offshore Balancing\' is coauthored with Stephen M. Walt (Harvard Kennedy School) and may be found here: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/case-offshore-balancing. | St Antony\'s College hosts the 2015 Nobel Prize winner in Literature, Svetlana Alexievich, for a discussion of her the Soviet soul and her current and former projects. Conducted in Russian and translated by Oxford DPhil student Margarita Vaysman, the discussion captures key insights into Alexievich\'s writing process, often described as a new genre between journalism and literature for her extensive usage of interviews to craft a global voice. Alexievich explains the pique of her interest for storytelling from a conversation with her grandmother and the methods she uses to approach her subjects as neighbors who form part of the same history of the Soviet experience. Her profound musings on truth, suffering and evil versus good provide a broader context for her works Second-Hand Time (newly translated to English this year) and Chernobyl Prayer as well as many others. | Professor Timothy Garton Ash discusses the premise of his new book titled \'Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World.\' Introduced by Warden Margaret MacMillan of St. Antony\'s, Professor Timothy Garton Ash presents his newest book, \'Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World.\' The work is based on the premises that the conditions of free speech are changing given movements of mass migration and the wide dissemination of the Internet, both of which make us all neighbors, both literally and figuratively. Professor Garton Ash organizes his book around what he argues are the ten main dimensions of free speech: lifeblood, violence, knowledge, journalism, diversity, religion, privacy, secrecy, icebergs and courage.

I’m your host, Corrina Allen - a mom of two tweens, a 5th grade teacher, and just back from an awe-inspiring visit with my family to Niagara Falls. If you have ever have the opportunity to go, there is nothing quite like standing on a rocking boat within the mist of the roaring horseshoe falls and gazing up 170 feet at over 3,000 tons of water thundering over those cliffs every second. Do go you if\xa0 you can - it’s impressive, we learned a TON, and it’s one of those things that should be experienced at least once in your life. A quick reminder to help out your future self and set yourself a reminder for Monday nights at 9pm EST so you can catch the #MGBookChat Twitter chat - we have scheduled some great topics and hosts later on this summer and fall. So I will see you there.\xa0 This is episode #75 and today’s show starts with a discussion about the benefits of rereading and then I bring you a conversation with Scholastic librarian Deimosa Webber-Bey.\xa0 \xa0 Main Topic - The Benefits of Rereading Our main topic today is a discussion around rereading books. Over the years, my own thinking in this area has evolved a lot. As a young teacher who wanted to make the most out of absolutely every precious second of classroom time, I had a rather negative view of students reading a book for pleasure that they had already read before. If a kid was picking a novel for a book club or a book report, I wouldn’t let them select a book they had previously read. Thinking back, that really did seem to be the norm among my colleagues. Like them, I viewed it as cheating a little bit!\xa0 As if they wouldn’t be as engaged in the text a second time around or they weren’t challenging themselves enough. Basically - I considered rereading a book in school as a waste of a learning opportunity. \xa0 It wasn’t until about 5 years ago that a friend had a conversation with me that changed my mind. We weren’t even debating the merits of allowing kids to reread books, we were just chatting. She asked me, “Corrina, what’s your favorite movie?”\xa0 And I said, “Oh!  The Princess Bride! I’ve watched it like 50 times…..”\xa0 Oh. Ohhhhh……. \xa0 And that’s when it hit me. It was that one friendly person inadvertently holding up a mirror to myself that made me reconsider the misconceptions I held and start to realize there are huge benefits to experiencing a text, a film, multiple times.\xa0 \xa0 I mean - if you think about it - watching a movie or tv series over and over again - is a commonly shared and even celebrated social phenomenon.\xa0 I hear lots of people talking about how many times they’ve watched  The Office or  Black Panther or  Star Wars. In my house, it’s a running joke how many times my husband’s Facebook status is “watching  Casino Royale” \xa0 So today, I’d like to explore with you some reasons why rereading is so satisfying, some academic benefits, and a few ways to enhance the rereading experience for the kids you work with. \xa0 Why Rereading is so Satisfying Let’s start with why rereading is so satisfying.\xa0  First - it’s fun! If you love a book, you get to spend more time with favorite characters and relive those climactic moments in the story. It’s like going on your favorite roller-coaster again. Yeah, you already know when the twists are turns are, but also - here come those twists and turns and I can’t wait for them! Another way that rereading can be satisfying is that there’s less pressure to finish the book. Maybe you just want to skim it or reread your favorite scenes. It’s a lower commitment situation than starting a new book. Having books around that you enjoy rereading or reading parts of, can enhance your overall reading life. Because dipping in to a favorite book when you are in between other reads or you don’t have have a big chunk of time to start something new is a good way to keep reading momentum going through those tricky times in your life. Or when kids are struggling to find that next book they really want to read.\xa0 Often, my students will pull out those tried and true favorites like  Sunny Side Up or  Guiness Book of World Records or the  Minecraft Handbooks when nothing else had really hooked them yet. Another excellent reason to reread a book is to prepare for the next book coming out in the series. A parallel to that is the binge-watching that happens when a new season of a favorite TV show starts. When season three of Stranger Things dropped on July 4th, my family spent a few weeks prior rewatching the previous seasons to catch us up to speed on the plot. And also because being familiar with the back stories of the characters made watching season three so much better.\xa0 And finally, when I consider why a child may be rereading a book again - or maybe over and over again - I have to think that there may be something comforting in that text. It might be providing a sense of stability and order and a sense of knowing what’s coming next during a time in their life when they need that.  \xa0 Academic Benefits Aside from simply making you happy, rereading texts multiple times does have academic benefits that can boost reading skills. For example -\xa0  Reading a text a second or third or fourth time can really increase one’s fluency. Even if that rereading is just in your head and not out loud, you’ll start to have a smoother experience without halting on tricky vocabulary or getting lost in complex sentence structures. You might start to mentally add more expression and read with tone in mind now that you aren’t spending mental energy figuring out who the characters are and what’s happening. Last year, I read Clive Barker’s  The Thief of Always out loud to my class, which was about the fourth read for me - and it had taken me that long to start to pick apart the different speech patterns and personalities and emotions of the characters in order to even start to read that out loud well. Another huge benefit to children when they reread is that they will notice far more on the second or third time through the text.\xa0 I’ve already mentioned picking up more vocabulary, but catching on to the author’s foreshadowing or their use of symbolism or how they are developing a theme across chapters is one of the joys of rereading.\xa0 And it’s also fun to pick up those little clues along the way of character development. To use a common example, when you reread  Harry Potter a second time, you realize - Oh! Harry could talk to and understand the snake in the zoo - that comes up later when they realize he’s a parseltongue. And knowing the motivations and backstory of Snape makes for such a rich reread of those earlier books. Aspects of the story that you are never going to appreciate or even understand unless you reread it. To throw in an adult example, I recently rewatched  The Good Place with my husband and whoa - knowing what you know now and going back and watching the interactions between the characters and picking up on all the references and appreciating that Yogurt word play is just… perfection.\xa0 The other noticing that can happen on a reread - is that you start to pick out problematic aspects of a book that might not have been in your realm of awareness the first time you read it. For example, when I reread Harry Potter with my class last year, I noticed those early chapters were full of offensive references to character’s weight. In a way where fatness was used to elicit disgust with certain characters.\xa0 Lately, in order to get a better grasp on the society we live in and the challenges we’re facing, I’ve been reading some adult nonfiction books that have impacted the lens with which I view all stories and well, life!\xa0 Just to name two - first,  Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny by Kate Manne, and I just finished Robin DiAngelo’s  White Fragility (which is amazing and please, please go read that book next if you have not.)\xa0 What I’m getting at is that your perspective and what you notice in rereading a text is influenced by the learning you’re doing in other areas of your life.\xa0\xa0 Another way that rereading can have the power to improve a child’s reading is that those skills and observations they are honing during their 3rd read of  New Kid or  Front Desk transfer to other new books. Once they’ve started to notice what foreshadowing looks like or how the author uses language to set up a certain mood, or the way infographics in that shark book give you more information, they’ll catch on to those maneuvers as they work toward comprehending more unfamiliar or complicated books. And\xa0 - of course - reread can boost their own writing. When they start to notice and identify more of those author’s techniques through multiple rereading of a text, students can try out those writerly maneuvers in their own writing. This reminds me of when Kate DiCamillo was on the show last year and she mentioned (as she has elsewhere) that she rereads  Charlotte’s Web every year. Both as a fan and also to orient herself to how that story is constructed.\xa0\xa0  \xa0 How to Enhance Rereading for Children Clearly, there are some huge benefits when children reread, and I think with the right approach we can enhance that experience for them.\xa0\xa0  One way to do that is to simply ask them about that book they are reading over and over again! Acknowledge it, let them know you get it, and let them talk about why they love it so much.\xa0 Honestly, most of the time, people love to be asked about the TV shows and films and books and fandoms they are into. Right now, I am slightly obsessed with  Good Omens and I would love for someone to say, “Corrina, why are you so into that show?” and have an excuse to talk about Aziraphale and Crowley and how their relationship evolved over 6,000 years.\xa0 So - just start by asking them about it. And then… go a little further and angle some questions toward those deeper elements. Some of the questions I like to ask when a child is reading a book for the second time are: What are you noticing that someone reading this book for the first time might not catch? What characters have you changed your mind about?\xa0 When you reread that first chapter again, what do you notice the author doing that sets up something later on in the book?\xa0 Another thing that I like to do when I notice a student reading a book over again is to introduce them to other similar media.\xa0 For example, if they like  Wings of Fire, I’ll share with them  the graphic novels based on that series or we might explore an author’s website, or I’ll share some fan art with them or some fan fiction pieces. (Although a quick caveat there - I would not let a child loose on a fan fiction site because things can take some unexpected turns.) However, if possible - connect them to other fans either in person or online and encourage them to create some fan art or fan fiction. And if you are looking for a safe place to publish that, MGBookVillage does have a Kids’ Corner where we share book reviews and fan art and fan fiction created by children.\xa0  \xa0 As I wrap up my summer and think ahead to how I want to support readers this school year, embracing rereading and helping students harness the power of experiencing a text more than one time is going to be a larger part of that. \xa0 I’ll end this section with some wise words from  Dav Pilkey, author of  Captain Underpants and  Dog Man who has said, “Nobody complains when musicians play the same songs over and over or when basketball players run the same plays over and over. So why do we complain when children read the same books multiple times?” \xa0 Well said. \xa0 Deimosa Webber-Bey\xa0 - Interview Outline \xa0 Our special guest this week is Scholastic Librarian Deimosa Webber-Bey! We chat about encouraging kids to read more over the summer, what books she’s been loving lately, and what Scholastic is doing through their Summer Read-a-Palooza challenge to get more books in more kids’ hands. And there is absolutely still time for you and the kids in your life to help out with that. I will drop a link to the 2019 Scholastic Summer Read-a-Palooza in our show notes and right on the MGBookVillage website so you can check that out. Also - a big part of the conversation that I have with Deimosa is around the results of the latest Scholastic Kids & Family Reading Report and the link to that is right there as well and definitely worth your time to explore.\xa0 \xa0 Take a listen. \xa0 Q: How did you come to work for Scholastic? \xa0 Q: Something that has been on my mind lately as I’ve wrapped up the school year with my students is the knowledge that if they don’t read over the summer, they are going to lose so much of the progress they’ve gained this past year.\xa0 And what has helped me articulate that “Summer Slide” research to our parents is the Scholastic Kids & Family Reading Report. Could you tell us a little bit about that report and share some of the findings that really stood out to you? \xa0 Q: Scholastic has done so much research in this area!\xa0 From your point of view, what do you see as the main things that educators and families can do to keep kids reading over the summer? \xa0 Q: I love that Scholastic always has a fresh reading campaign for kids every summer - and I love that this year the campaign is supporting a great cause. Can you tell us about the Scholastic Summer Read-a-Palooza? \xa0 Q: What are you reading right now? And what are some titles that are on your TBR list for the summer? \xa0 Thank you! \xa0 Links: \xa0 Deimosa’s website - http://runawayquiltproject.org Deimosa on Twitter - @dataquilter Deimosa on Scholastic -  http://oomscholasticblog.com/post/summer-reading-imperative-commentary-deimosa-webber-bey \xa0 Books we chatted about:  Five Nights At Freddy’s: The Silver Eyes (Scott Cawthorn)  Transformed (Megan Morrison)  Internment (Samira Ahmed)  Puerto Rico Strong: A Comics Anthology Supporting Puerto Rico Disaster  Child of the Dream: A Memoir of 1963 (Sharon Robinson)  Miles Morales (Jason Reynolds) \xa0 Closing \xa0 Alright - that’s it for our show this week.

I’m your host, Corrina Allen - a mom of two tween girls, a 5th grade teacher, and finally beginning my summer vacation!! Before we begin, I have a few quick announcements! First - a reminder that Monday nights are the #MGBookChat Twitter chats with some really amazing topics coming up this summer like STEM in Middle Grade, Inspiring Kids to Write, Grief in Middle Grade, and several Open Chats where you can bring your own topic to discuss. So if you are like me and have a tendency to forget those sort of things, set a reminder on your phone for Mondays at 9pm EST and check out #MGBookChat on Twitter. Second - I will be at NerdCampMI this July 8th & 9th - so if you are headed that way this summer, please please do say hi. And finally - I am really excited to tell you that I will be rejoining the All the Wonders team as their Podcast Network Developer to produce a new array of shows cultivating a wider variety of perspectives and stories in the world of children’s literature. First up is All the Wonders This Week -\xa0 a brief, topical show released every Tuesday where a guest and I will chat about all things wondrous and new in the world of children’s literature. So stay tuned for that this summer! But - no worries - Books Between isn’t going anywhere! This is episode #74 and today’s show features the Top 20 books that my students loved this year, a reflection on what went right and what went wrong for me this last school year, and a conversation with Rajani LaRocca - author of  Midsummer’s Mayhem. \xa0 Top 20 Student Favorites Let’s start with the top 20 books that my 5th grade students loved and recommended this school year. Because it’s one thing for an adult to enjoy a book, but for it to really make an impact, it has to connect with its intended audience. There have been plenty of books that I loved, but for some reason didn’t seem to resonate with middle grade readers.\xa0 Honestly, I think THIS list is way more valuable than ANY list that any adult puts out. \xa0 I couple notes before we begin. My students have pretty much free choice to read what they want in class and for homework at night, but we did have two book clubs this year - one in the fall featuring immigrant and refugee experiences and then we just wrapped up our fantasy book clubs. So that context likely influenced what books they had most exposure to. Also - our four main read alouds this year were Home of the Brave, a non-fiction title called When Lunch Fights Back, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone, and The Thief of Always.\xa0 Only two of those made it into this Top 20. \xa0 And there are only six graphic novels on this list, which might surprise some adults who like to complain to me that “all kids read these days are those graphic novels”. (Can you hear my eyes rolling?) \xa0 I also want to be transparent about how I calculated this “Top 20”. So, at the end of the year, we did various wrap-up and reflection activities. In mid-June, I send out a quick survey one morning asking them for their top reads of the year. They also worked on an end-of-the-year reflection celebration slideshow and one slide was devoted to sharing their favorite books. Also, each student worked on a “Top 10 List” (or” Top 5 List” or whatever - an idea I got from Colby Sharp) listing their most highly recommended books of the year - recommended for their current class and to be shared with the incoming 5th graders. So… I tallied up each time a title was mentioned in any of those places. And here are the top 20 titles my 5th graders loved and recommended. \xa0   Amulet by Kazu Kibuishi  This graphic novel is still a strong favorite with my fifth graders. Maybe slightly less so this year, but I think that’s because a LOT of them already read it in 4th grade.\xa0 \xa0   Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney  Still going strong! Admittedly, not every mention was book one, but the series is a perennial favorite among my students and one that they love to reread in between other books.\xa0 \xa0   Ghost by Jason Reynolds  The Track Series has gained a lot of momentum this year - and mainly through word of mouth. It was one of our school’s ProjectLIT selections so there was some buzz around that, but only one of my students was able to make it to those meetings so the popularity of this title is due strictly to kids recommending it to other kids.\xa0 \xa0   Escape from Aleppo by N. H. Senzai  This title was one of the immigrant /refugee themed book club selections from the fall and even though just four kids read it in that club, it was quickly passed around after that. If you know children who enjoyed books like  Refugee or  Amal Unbound, Escape from Aleppo is a great next book to introduce them to next. \xa0   Ghost Boys by Jewell Parker Rhodes  Every child that picked this book up and read it, ended up calling it a favorite.\xa0 \xa0   The Books of Elsewhere by Jacqueline West  This title was one of our Fantasy Book Club options and it really lends itself to fabulous discussions if you’re looking to round out that genre. \xa0   Orphan Island by Laurel Snyder  I will admit - I was totally surprised this made the top 20. Not because I don’t like it - I LOVE this book, but I didn’t really witness it being read or talked about a lot past September or October. But clearly it made a lasting impact on those that did read it. \xa0   Dog Man by Dav Pilkey  In the same vein as Diary of a Wimpy Kid, this series of books are the go-to rereads when a student isn’t sure what they want to read next. It’s one of those comfort reads that always winds up back in their book boxes. \xa0   Be Prepared by Vera Brosgol  This graphic novel was passed from kid to kid this year with so many of them reading it multiple times. \xa0   Rain Reign by Ann M. Martin  Which was a second shocker to me because this novel is a class read-aloud in 3rd grade. So all the love for this one came from students who remembered it fondly and reread it. Maybe because I happened to have a few copies in our room? Which reminds me to make sure to have those previous year’s titles available in our classroom library. \xa0   Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins  Another one of our hot fantasy book club picks - this series is a winner. Year and after kids fall in love with the characters! And it will make you fall in love with a cockroach. That’s some powerful writing! \xa0   Smile by Raina Telgemeier  Still…. after all these years. This book has that special spark. \xa0   Crush by Svetlana Chmakova\xa0  When this graphic novel came out in this past October, I bought one copy and immediately the kids grabbed a pen and paper and started their own waiting list.\xa0 \xa0   The Strangers by Margaret Peterson Haddix\xa0  The credit for this book’s popularity falls squarely to a book trailer that our school librarian showed our class. It got us all sooo hooked that I splurged a bit and bought three copies for our classroom. And it just took off from there. In fact, I haven’t even read the darn thing yet because I could never get my hands on a copy. And actually, I think it’s the only title on this list that I haven’t read.\xa0 \xa0   Roller Girl by Victoria Jamieson  Because…. of course!\xa0 And actually, our classroom copy of this book didn’t even make it past March. The spine cracked and then the pages started falling apart, so I’ve got to get another copy for the fall. It was clearly well-loved.\xa0 \xa0   Blended by Sharon Draper  Whoa did this novel take my class by storm!\xa0 And it wasn’t part of a book club, it wasn’t a read aloud, it didn’t have a snazzy book trailer - it just really resonated with kids. And they just kept recommending it to each other. \xa0   Front Desk by Kelly Yang  This was THE hot title this fall!\xa0 It was one of the choices for our immigrant/refugee book clubs but unlike some of the other titles, this one had a huge resurgence after the clubs ended with kids rereading and passing it along to their friends all through the year. It was constantly in someone’s book box.\xa0 \xa0   The Unicorn Rescue Society by Adam Gidwitz & Hatem Aly  This was another fantasy book club option. And I think, the popularity of this book is really due to the fact that it had a phenomenal book trailer that hooked kids with it’s humor. It was also a shorter book with lots of great illustrations so kids quickly finished it, passed it along and were on to the next in the series.\xa0 \xa0 Okay - we are down to the top two. And not surprisingly, they are both class read alouds. It makes sense that the books every child read or listened to would be high on a list of class favorites. But as I said before, two of our read alouds didn’t make the cut so these two truly did connect with the class. \xa0   The Thief of Always by Clive Barker  Oh my word is this book amazing!\xa0 And for many students - it’s their first foray into horror. The chapter illustrations are gruesome and disturbing and wonderful…. If you know kids that like scary books with that paranormal twist… who like something a little weird - this book is perfect!\xa0 And it makes a really great read aloud. \xa0   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone by J.K. Rowling  I added this one as a read aloud this year since it was the 20th anniversary, and I honestly wasn’t sure if the kids were going to like it.\xa0 That first book does have a slow start, but it was by far their top rated read aloud and the title most frequently found on their favorites lists and their recommended lists.\xa0 Harry’s still got the magic. \xa0 Reflection \xa0 One of the most important aspects of our last few weeks together at school is time for student reflection and feedback for me and my own reflection on what went well this past year and… what did not.\xa0 \xa0 First, let me share with you 5 things that stood out in my students’ final feedback survey. And yes, this is information from a particular class, but I think you’ll find something useful to take away from their responses as well.  When asked what they liked most about class, the top responses were Flash-light Fridays (where we turned off all the lights and they got to read with flashlights anywhere in the room), the read alouds, all the Harry Potter activities (house sorting, trying Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, I sent them acceptance letters to Hogawarts, etc.), and doing the one-pagers. When asked what changes I should make for next year, they suggested more book clubs, students getting to vote on our read alouds, and… many of them said they don’t like sitting in groups. That they wanted to be spread out more and have their own space. (Which is interesting - because a couple years ago I came REALLY close to doing away with individual desks and switching to tables and mainly flexible seating options that have been very popular and whenever I have brought that up, my students have consistently told me - they like their own desk and their own space.) When asked “Did you read more or less than last year?”, 33% said a little more and 50% said a lot more. And only one child said that they read less this year.\xa0 When asked how I could be a better teacher, the most common responses were to give more reading time, read more books aloud, and a suggestion to ask kids to read even more each night. When asked what books we should have more of in our classroom library, they wanted more scary books, more books with magic, more books in a series, more poetry, and of course, more graphic novels.  \xa0 So those were some big takeaways from the feedback from my students. And of course, as I reflect and revise and look for professional development opportunities over the summer, I pair their feedback with the things I saw going well and also things that did not. Here are some “wins” and some “fails” from this past year.  A win - the book clubs centered around immigrant and refugee stories. Students learned a lot, had a new perspective on events they may see in the news, and bottom line - just really enjoyed those books.\xa0 Since many students requested more book clubs, I am considering adding another round or two - perhaps centered around neurodiversity and understanding ourselves and others.\xa0 A fail - not reading nearly enough poetry and nonfiction. So if I think about expanding book clubs, perhaps shifting a little to a poetry reading club or clubs that want to explore a particular nonfiction topic might be a way to go.\xa0 A win - read alouds kicked butt this year.\xa0 After three times reading aloud Thief of Always, I had the voices down, and I finally felt like I knew that story inside and out and could take them places this year that I never would have even realized the first time we read it together. That just reinforces to me how much can be gained be rereading a text multiple times.\xa0\xa0\xa0 A fail - not reading enough shorter texts - picture books and short stories. And also, every single one of our read alouds this year featured a male protagonist. And I am NOT letting that happen again next year. Or ANY year! Nooo way! A win - when a student told me she wanted to read books with gay, trans, and queer characters, within 3 minutes I was able to gather a huge stack from our classroom library to plop on her desk so she could find something that might appeal to her.\xa0 A fail - she didn’t know we had that many titles! I had book-talked many of them, but next year - maybe I’ll have a “Read with Pride” bin to rotate some of those titles in and out.\xa0 I want to be careful to not “other” those stories and separate all of them, but I do want students to be able to find them easily.\xa0 A win - students read far more diversely this year than any prior year. And I had many, many boys who without much reservation read Baby Sitter’s Club books, and books about girls getting their periods, and other novels with female protagonists that in year’s past might be met with push-back and laughter.\xa0 I am maybe seeing a possible cultural shift there. Maybe. I’m hoping.\xa0 A fail - not taking enough time to explicitly explore bias and structural racism, the impact of social norms and honestly - all the things that are tricky to talk about but that NEED to be talked about.\xa0 And that was better this year, but still not enough.  \xa0 And I know this is not the work of a summer but the work of a whole career, a whole lifetime.\xa0 \xa0 And as always, we are learning together so I’d really love to hear from you about any feedback you received from the children you work with, what your successes and misses were this past year, and what books your kids loved. You can connect with me on Twitter or Instagram - our handle is @books_between or email me at booksbetween@gmail.com and I’d love to share your ideas.   Rajani LaRocca - Interview Outline \xa0 Joining me this week is debut author Rajani LaRocca! We chat about baking, Shakespeare, the novels that influenced her as a child, writing ideas for kids, her unparalleled skill at finding the perfect GIF, and\xa0 of course - her debut novel  Midsummer’s Mayhem! \xa0 Take a listen. \xa0 Midsummer’s Mayhem \xa0 For our listeners who have not yet read Midsummer’s Mayhem - what is this story about? \xa0 You novel has so many elements that I love - a bit of mystery, a dash of earthy magic,\xa0 - it’s like The Great British Baking Show meets Shakespeare! And the recipes are so mouth-watering, so unique! Did you actually make all of the recipes in the book?   Can we talk about Vik?!\xa0 I had no idea until the very end which way he was going to go. I love how you created this mystery surrounding him that was multi-sensory - not just visual, but musical, and the earthy scents of the forest…. \xa0 Mimi is very inspired by Puffy Fay - her celebrity chef idol.

I’m your host, Corrina Allen - 5th grade teacher, a mom of two girls (10 and 12), and muddling through some allergies. So if you are wondering why I sound “off” - we can blame all those plants trying to have babies! \xa0A quick reminder before we get started that you can find transcripts and interview outlines of every episode - along with lots of other great middle great content over at MGBookVillage.org. This is episode #73 and today’s show starts off with a discussion about strong endings to the school year and then I share with you a conversation with Tina Athaide- author of  Orange for the Sunsets. Main Topic - Finishing the Year Strong Our main topic today is ending the school year with your students with strength and purpose. And wrapping up those final weeks together in a way that allows for both reflection on their reading lives and a way to step forward into a summer that builds on the successes of the previous year. It’s like the school year is the runway and the summer is the solo flight after take-off! If you haven’t been building those reading habits all year long, then… well that lift off is going to fall flat. \xa0But - there are some things that we can do to plan for a strong transition from that supportive classroom reading community to a strong independent reading life. For me, my school year up here in New York doesn’t end for another five weeks but lots of my friends are already wrapping up their school year so I thought it would be a good time to discuss this topic. And whether you are a parent, or a librarian, or a teacher there will be something in today’s show that you will find useful. First, we’ll talk building in time for reflection and what that can look like. Then, I’ll discuss some ways for students to celebrate and share the reading they’ve enjoyed during the past school year. And finally, I’ll chat about how to usher them into summer with a solid reading plan and hopefully some books in their hands. Reflection One of the most effective ways to cap off your school year is with some time for reflection and feedback. And there are a few options for you to consider.  A student survey for YOU to grow as a teacher. So this would involve asking your students questions to help get feedback to help you improve. These \xa0questions might be - What was your favorite read aloud this year? \xa0What strategies helped you grow the most as a reader? Did you prefer partner reading or book clubs and why? What types of reading responses helped you get the most of your reading? \xa0Should we read more nonfiction? What books should we get for our classroom library?  Pernille Ripp uses these types of surveys exceptionally well, and I’ll link to her website to get some ideas for you to try and to tweak. It’s also really important that students get the opportunity to write about and discuss their own reading habits and growth - for their own self-reflection. In that case, since the purposes are very different, the questions you ask your students will be different. And if you’ve helped them build that habit of keeping good track of their reading, this will be a thousand times easier. These questions might be along the lines of - How many books did you read this year? How does that compare to last year? \xa0Of the books you’ve read, how many were non-fiction? How many were graphic novels? Written by a person of color? Written by a man? Were historical fiction? What was your favorite book you’ve read? How many books did you abandon and why? Those questions that dig a bit deeper are so powerful - especially when given the opportunity to share those thoughts with others. Another way that you can have your students doing some powerful thinking and reflection about the books they are offered is by guiding them through a diversity audit of your classroom collection or library. If you want details about this, I’ve  discussed it in more depth in episode 28 (which I will link to in the show notes), but I highly recommend you try this at least one time with your class. And it doesn’t have to be an analysis of all the books in your library. Maybe it’s just a 15 minute check of the biographies together with two or three guiding questions. \xa0At the end of the year -it’s all about using the time you have flexibly and well. A great self-reflection method I just bumped into again recently was Pernille Ripp’s post (called “On Reading Rewards”) about having students create an award for themselves to celebrate their own achievement - whether that’s reading 35 books, or discovering a new genre, or just finding one book they really liked. I’ll link to her post with the full description and to  the site where you can get those free Reading Certificate templates for students. \xa0  Celebration & Sharing Along with opportunities for self-reflection and thinking about their own reading accomplishments during the previous year, I think it’s also so important to give students a chance to show off those accomplishments!  One educator that I follow on Twitter (Cassie Thomas - @mrs_cmt1489), had her students gather a stack of every book they’ve read during the year and took a picture of them with that book stack! What \xa0powerful way to see how what a year’s worth of reading looks like! Another popular (and powerful) way to have students both reflect on their reading and share it, is to have them create a top ten (or so) list. I’ve absolutely modified that to a Top 5 or Top 3 list for those kiddos who were rather daunted by coming up with ten titles. \xa0It could be something as simple as the Top 10 Books I’ve Read This Year. Or maybe Top 5 Sports Books, 7 Books To Make You Laugh, Top 8 Books That Made Me Cry, Top 10 Books If You Like History - really the options are endless! And lend themselves well to having those quick finishers make a couple of them. In a recent video by Colby Sharp, he mentioned that he has his class share the lists with him in a Google doc where he complies them, prints out all the lists, and then sends the lists home with the kids for the summer! \xa0So if they are ever looking for a book suggestion, they have a ton of options from their classmates right on hand. I’m definitely doing that this year! (I’ll link to Colby’s video so you can check out his other ideas.) A third way to celebrate and share their reading? One-pagers! If you have not tried these yet - the end of the year is the perfect time! \xa0Essentially, students go into greater depth with one of their favorite books by creating a one-page presentation. Typically they are very colorful and include strong visual elements to illuminate aspects of the book like drawings of symbols, characters, or representations of the book cover. \xa0And the sections depend on your goals - often things like a character analysis, favorite quote, rating, or summary. My students really loved doing these and even had the idea of hanging some in our local public library. And I recently came across a great episode of The Cult of Pedagogy Podcast with guest Betsy Potash that offers some great tips and templates to use. I’ll also include  a link directly to Betsy’s site if you want to see those great examples and snag those templates. One other idea to help students celebrate and share their reading is to harness the technology skills they’ve already practiced during the year for that purpose. For example, if your students are already using Flipgrid, have them use that tool to do a book talk for a favorite book, share their top ten list, or discuss patterns they noticed about their reading during the past year. If the kids are more comfortable with SeeSaw, they could do similar things with the video tool or do some annotating of their favorite books and make booksnaps about favorite books or characters. \xa0Powerpoint or Google Slides has some cool features - especially to make charts and graphs. One piece of advice here - use technology that they are already familiar with and can work independently on. That way, while they are working, you can take care of those important, time-consuming end-of-the-year tasks like conducting final running records on each student or wrapping up some final scoring on assignments. \xa0  A Plan & Books in Their Hands The final - and maybe most important thing that you can do to better your odds at a successful launch from the supported reading life you’ve provided to your students to \xa0taking their reading life into their own hands is to actually have them leave you with something in their hands. Namely - a plan and at least one book. A summer reading plan: Let’s talk about the plan first. This could be a formal, written plan - but honestly, at the end of the year that might be just a little too structured for summer. Instead, I like to share various ideas and options for kids to boost their reading life over the summer. And then have us all share with each other how to overcome some common obstacles. So here’s what that will look like for our class over the next couple of weeks before school ends:  Creating their summer TBR list. Maybe this is based on the Top 10 Lists your class presented or maybe they build a TBR list during a trip to the library, but having that piece of paper is really helpful. Invite our wonderful children’s librarian from our local public library to come in and share with our class the awesome summer programs they have planned. \xa0If the timing doesn’t work out for them to travel, a virtual Google Hangout visit or Skype could work, too. Our local library also used to allow for off-site library card sign-ups so check into that as well. Give the kids a list of any summer reading programs or activities you can find in your community. \xa0Does your local bookstore have any cool book signings or summer events planned? Is there a Children’s Book Festival happening? \xa0Does your community have a traveling library? Is there a summer book club offered at your school? Where are the locations of the Little Free Libraries in your \xa0area? Will the local library have a booth at the Pride Festival this June? (Mine will!!!!) Introduce them to some virtual spaces where they can get reading ideas and share their reading life. \xa0If they are old enough for social media (13 years old) - perhaps share some accounts to follow. Or encourage them to sign up for a Goodreads account. But honestly - they are most likely going to be on YouTube. So a list of great YouTubers to follow would probably be the most appreciated and actually used by your students. And if you think your students would use it, you could set up a summer reading Fligrid or SeeSaw or other digical space to them to share. I tried this last year and it was a bit of a bust, but maybe I’ll give it another go.  \xa0 Alright, so…. Ideally, I’ll have those resources and ideas compiled into one document for students to take home at the end of the year. And then we’ll have a quick discussion together about which ones they want to participate in, and what are going to be obstacles. \xa0\xa0Perhaps they can share a brief and flexible plan in their reading journal or on SeeSaw or Flipgrid. Getting books in their hands: And finally - the all important getting books in their hands before they leave for the summer! There are a few ways to do this.  Have your end-of-the-year gift be a book. Right now I am in a self-contained class and have 21 students. So I can swing this by saving up Scholastic points and entering a lot of giveaways on Twitter and Goodreads. \xa0Next year I’ll be teaching all the 5th graders, so this option might be less doable. One idea I’ve considered instead of selecting a new book for each child based on what I know of their reading life, is to let them pick out one book from our classroom library to take home to keep. Another option is to suggest your PTO/PTA give the graduating class a book as they leave the school. My PTO has done this for the last few years. And it sends a powerful message about what is important and what is valued in our school. Last year is was  365 Days of Wonder and this year will either be  New Kid or a picture book like  Rock What Ya Got. Another idea that I have seen be very successful is to have a book swap by encouraging families to bring in gently used books for kids to exchange. Our middle school kept them all in a brightly colored kiddie pool with a beach chair next to it. More and more libraries are doing summer check out - which I LOVE!! \xa0So if your school is not yet one of those, maybe arm yourself with some great research and start putting a bug in the ear of the powers-that-be to make that change. Allow kids to check out books from your classroom library is another way to get books in their hands for the summer. My 5th graders are leaving to a new school. So instead, at the end of the year we had an opportunity to meet our incoming 4th grade class. And after some quick introductions, I let each child pick 2-3 books they wanted to take home and read over the summer. \xa0Before they left, I just took a quick picture of them with their stack so I knew which books were out. But other than that, there was no check-out procedure. I like this for a few reasons. One, it shows them right away that our classroom library is the heart of our class and that I want to get to know them as people and as readers. And that whatever book they picked was fine by me. It’s all reading. Also - we’re starting from a place of trust. I trust them to take those books home and return them. \xa0And sure, some didn’t come back. But as Donalyn Miller has so often said, “I’d rather lose a book than lose a reader.”  I hope that no matter if you are a teacher, a librarian, or parent that you have found something useful in today’s discussion that will help you foster more independent readers. And no matter what time of year you may stumble across this episode, building in time for reflection, celebrating and sharing our reading lives, and making plans to read more on our own is always a great idea. \xa0 And as always, we are learning together so please share with us your ideas and successes for ending the year strong. You can connect with me on Twitter or Instagram - our handle is @books_between or email me at booksbetween@gmail.com and I’d love to share your ideas.   Tina Athaide - Interview Outline This week I am thrilled to bring you an interview with debut author Tina Athaide! We chat about her research process, the novels that influenced her as a child, writing tips to pass along to the young authors in your life, and of course - her debut historical novel set in 1970s Uganda - \xa0Orange for the Sunsets. Take a listen. Orange for the Sunsets Welcome! I’d like to start by giving you an opportunity to introduce yourself to our listeners… \xa0 I’m an educator by day and writer by night. When I started teaching in Southern CA, I was amazed how little information my students had about other cultures and ethnic groups and always thought they could learn so much from books. Thankfully these days we are seeing an increase in books written about marginalized groups by marginalized writers. \xa0 What is Orange for the Sunsets about? It set in 1972 and tells the story of Asha-an Asian Indian girl and her best friend Yesofu a Ugandan boy and how their lives are turned upside down when President Idi Amin announces that Indians have ninety days to leave the country. \xa0Asha comes from a life of privilege, but even then it isn’t as privileged as the Europeans. Yesofu’s family works for Asha’s parents. They are servants in their own country. Idi’ Amin’s expulsion means different things for these two characters, which creates a conflict that threatens to tear apart their friendship. \xa0This was a period in history that very few people knew about, especially here in North America and I felt it was important to share this story. \xa0 What was your research process like to make sure you were getting not only the history correct, but the 1970’s details accurate? \xa0 Without dating myself, I have to confess that I have personal connections to this story. I was born in Entebbe, but my family left just before the expulsion.. Growing up I heard many stories about life in Uganda and subsequently the horrors of the expulsion. Early drafts were solely from Asha’s point of view. Yesofu had a role in the book, but I never delved into what the expulsion meant for him. An editor that was interested in the story actually recommended that I write the book from both Asha and Yesofu’s POV. \xa0 BACK TO THE DRAWING board and revisions. Actually...rewriting the entire book! \xa0 I was Asian, writing about the Asian Indian experience. I had some knowledge about the Uganda experiences, but not enough to really give Yesofu an authentic and honesty voice. That involved research. \xa0 I spoke to Indians and Ugandans about their experiences during that period of history, beyond just family and friends. I wanted to know their opinions about Idi Amin’s expulsion, how their lives were affected. \xa0I travelled to Kenya and spoke to Kenyan and Ugandan Africans about this time period. \xa0 What was also very helpful wasI read articles written during those ninety days from newspapers around the world. When Idi Amin originally expelled Asians, he kicked out those Indians holding British passports and citizenship. \xa0But when he ordered all Asian Indians out of the country, the UN asked countries to open their borders and accept refugees....That included the United States.   Although your story is set over 40 years ago and in a country across the globe, it has so many parallels to what’s happening in America now with the rise of populist anti-immigrant sentiment that veers in violence. Did you intentionally want to capture some of those similar sentiments? \xa0 It saddens me that in this day and age there are such close parallels between the story in Orange For the Sunset and the strong rise of anti-immigrant sentiment across the globe. \xa0It wasn’t intentional on my part to capture those similarities, but that period of history with Idi Amin and the brutality toward Indians unfortunately mirrors current sentiments.   **BONUS SPOILER SECTION: We discuss the ending of the novel, and if you’d like to hear that conversation, I moved that part of the recording to after the end credits of today’s episode at the 38:12 mark. \xa0 How has this book changed from your earlier drafts to this final version? \xa0 Were there parts that you loved but you had to edit out?   Your Writing Life \xa0 What are you working on now? I have a picture book coming out in 2020 about a young child, Sita and her grandfather, Gandhi. She is spirited and full of vigor and he teaches her to give how slowing down opens you up to see and appreciate so much more in life. \xa0 I am working on a MG fantasy book about a young boy who is destined to be keeper of the Pancha Maha-Bhoota–the five great elements of nature. It weaves in elements of Hindu mythology with flying garuda and naga cobras. What is most exciting is the character travels through time to real places in India so readers will get to visit these spectacular sites. \xa0 My students and kids are always eager to hear writing advice from authors. \xa0What’s a tip or trick that you’ve picked along the way that has helped your writing? When I finish writing the rough draft, I go through the manuscript and use different colors to highlight emotional points, plot points, dialogue. \xa0Then I will read through the story focusing on each color and it give me a narrow and wide lens as I revise. \xa0 Your Reading Life \xa0 What are some books or authors that influenced you as a child? Growing up, there were no books in the local library or school library with people of color, so l went on adventures with  Trixie Belden,  Anne of Green Gables, and  Anastacia Krupnik. Each in their own way those writers influenced me, even if it was to show me how books took you places different from your own world. \xa0I loved the  Narnia series by CS Lewis and  Harriet the Spy and the  Outsiders. \xa0 What are some books that you’ve read lately that you’d recommend to our listeners?  Book Uncle and Me by Uma Krisnaswami  The Bridge Home by PadmaVenkatraman  The Night Diary by Veera Hiranandani  Drama by Raina Telgemeier \xa0 Thank you! \xa0 Links: \xa0 Tina on Twitter - @tathaide Mae on Instagram - @tinaathaide   Closing \xa0 Alright - that’s it for our show this week.

I’m your host, Corrina Allen - 5th grade teacher currently enjoying Spring Break, a mom of two tween daughters, and part of the MGBookVillage team. \xa0And MGBookVillage.org where you can find transcripts and interview outlines of all of our episodes and links to every book and topic we mention today. This is episode #72 and oday’s show features three novels that will get your students talking, and a conversation with Mae Respicio - author of  The House That Lou Built. Book Talk In this segment, I share with you three books and discuss three things to love about each. All three books today have a couple things in common - questions of identity and an element of mystery. \xa0Two involve recovered memories, two of them have a bit of magic, and two of them include rather helpful birds. The three books featured this week are  Restart by Gordan Korman,  The Lost Girl by Anne Ursu, and  The Boy, the Boat, and the Beast by Samantha Clark.  Restart Let’s start with Restart. \xa0This novel, by Gordon Korman, was one that people kept pushing me to read. Teachers, students, librarians - everyone kept saying, “But have you read Restart yet??” \xa0So how can you say no to that kind of pressure? And - they were right! First of all the premise is incredible - the school bully (Chase Ambrose) falls off his roof, gets amnesia, and forgets everything about his previous life. And doesn’t get why certain kids are terrified of him, why others treat him like some big hero, and others, well… do things like dump a cup of frozen yogurt over his head. Plus, it’s not just told from Chase’s point of view - we get to hear from lots of the other kids as Chase’s past (and present) are slowly revealed. Restart is incredibly crafted. Aside from how well this novel is paced and pieced together, here are three other things I really loved about Restart: \xa0  Brendan Espinoza’s videos! Like lots of kids we know, he loves YouTube! Brendan is one of the first kids in the school to - if not accept the “new Chase” - at least offer him a little empathy. And that’s a powerful thing to do considering that Brendan was one of Chase’s biggest targets. He’s one of the video club kids and desperately wants one of his YouTube videos to go viral. So of course, he stages these increasingly over-the-top stunts to film. \xa0It’s hard to describe a funny video in a way that also makes you, the reader, laugh and cringe - but Gordon Korman pulls it off! And I’ll never go through a car-wash again without thinking of Brendan…. Mr. Solway! He’s this crotchety, hilarious, Medal-of-Honor-winning veteran living at the nursing home where Chase and his crew are serving out their community service. \xa0And somehow he is the spark, the center, the fulcrum of the story. That it works really powerfully as a read-aloud with tons of big ideas to discuss. Restart was our most recent bedtime book for my family, and whoa did we have a ton of deep conversations. Like…. When should you forgive someone? \xa0Is it possible to make amends for your past bad actions? And the whole situation with Joel and the video club and Shoshanna and Chase’s dad and football!  \xa0 If you are looking for a great book club novel, one that will offer a lot of fodder for discussion, then Restart is a fantastic option. It’s both hilarious and deep. Which to me, is that hard-to-achieve but perfect when it happens combination. \xa0 \xa0 The Lost Girl Next up is  The Lost Girl by Anne Ursu. A story about inseparable twins Iris and Lark. Well, inseparable until 5th grade when they are each placed into different classes with teachers who might not be the best fit for their distinctive personalities. Iris is analytical, outspoken, conscientious - a girl who always knows when her library books are due. \xa0Lark is sensitive, brilliantly creative, dreamy - a girl who always knows what library books she wants to check out next. If Iris is Hermione then Lark is more Luna. But the winds of change are in the air - new school arrangements, new after-school clubs, and a new shop opening up that might not be what it seems. Here are three reasons to love The Lost Girl: \xa0  The Treasure Hunters antique shop that suddenly opens up in their Minneapolis neighborhood with the slogan We Can Find Anything. Run by mysterious mashed-potato faced man, the shop is soon frequented by one of the twins. For what purpose and why I will leave you to discover. \xa0But the shop reminded me a bit of the Stephen King novel  Needful Needs. I just couldn’t get enough of the fairy tale motif of this story - from the first pages when Lark is described as knowing all the consequences for stealing in various fairy tales, to the recurring comparisons of threats as monsters and ogres, to one of my favorite scenes. It’s when Iris is attending Camp Awesome - one those Girl Power-type camps and the counselor, Abigail, has asked them all which fairy-tale character they identify with. \xa0And it goes on, and other positive points are made about women in fairy tales, but I loved that conversation so so much. I love how for most of the book I thought I knew which girl the title was referring to. But now I am not so sure…. and I think that would make a really fabulous conversation.  \xa0 Anne Ursu’s The Lost Girl is an incredible novel that is utterly deserving of all the hype that it’s received. \xa0If you have a kid who enjoys realistic fiction with a bit of magical adventure than slide this book their way. \xa0 The Boy, the Boat, and the Beast And the third book on my mind this week is \xa0The Boy, the Boat, and the Beast by debut author Samantha Clark. \xa0This novel starts with a mysterious boy washed up on a beach. Where he is, why he’s on this beach, and even who he is are all questions the boy can’t answer. And so he sets off to find to find answers and discover who he is. \xa0My husband, who is a book critic, like to say that every book is really a “journey of self-discovery” but this novel is exactly that. And brilliantly done. As the boy ventures beyond the beach, snippets of his memories return and slowly weave together a picture of what happened. It’s fantastic - and here are three reasons why:  Breath-taking to read. Samantha Clark is the Picasso of personification. I got chills reading this novel! \xa0Let me read you a few lines:   The leaves in the trees purred in the slight breeze. Greedy waves tugged at his ankles. The sun squatted in the sky.     The second thing that this book does so well is to capture that inner, critical, self-bullying voice that well have to overcome. \xa0Throughout the the story, the boy is confronted by this voice that is less-than-encouraging. He can run away from some threats, but he can’t run away from this, so how he confronts it is a powerful moment in the book. The third aspect of this reading experience that made it so good was that your understanding of the three words in the title (boy, beast, boat) change over the course of the novel. And I won’t say more but…..ahhh!!  \xa0 This novel reminded me of  Orphan Island, and one other book that I love. But - if I tell you what book that is - it’s going to give away a big plot twist. But if you’d read this book, message me! \xa0 Mae Respicio - Interview Outline This week’s interview is featuring debut author Mae Respicio! Julie Artz and I hopped on Skype to chat with her about tiny houses, her writing life and of course - her debut novel  The House That Lou Built. Take a listen. The House That Lou Built For our listeners who haven’t yet read The House That Lou Built, what is this story about? \xa0 What inspired you to write about a tool-toting middle schooler? \xa0 What sort of research did you do to write this book? \xa0Did you visit Tiny Houses? \xa0 Your Writing Life What was Hedgebrook like? \xa0 What are you working on now? \xa0 Your Reading Life One of the goals of this podcast is to help educators and librarians inspire kids to read more and connect them with amazing books. \xa0Did you have a special teacher or librarian in your life who helped you grow into a reader? \xa0 What are you reading now? **BONUS SPOILER SECTION: We discuss the ending of the novel, and if you’d like to hear that conversation, I moved that part of the recording to after the end credits of today’s episode at the 35:04 mark. Thank You! \xa0 Links: Mae’s website - https://www.maerespicio.com Mae on Twitter - @maerespicio Mae on Instagram - @maerespiciobooks Hedgebrook \xa0 Books & Authors We Chatted About:  Harry Potter series  Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (Robert C.

I’m your host, Corrina Allen - an elementary school teacher in Central New York and mom of two daughters - a 9 year old and a just turned 12 year old. Yesteday we celebrated her birthday with the most amazing cake - white with whipped cream frosting and layers of cannoli filling and raspberry filling inside. And just in case you are wondering - no, I did not make it. \xa0But if you live near a Wegmans, you can order one! This is episode #71 and oday and I’m sharing with you a conversation with Alyson Gerber - author of  Braced and the recently released  Focused. Her latest novel is about a gutsy, chess-loving, 7th grader named Clea who is learning to cope with her ADHD. So....do you know that slightly disorienting feeling you have when you are looking out a window & suddenly the lights shifts, your perspective shifts, and you realize you are seeing your OWN reflection? That is the experience I had when reading Focused. \xa0Like so many other people,  Dr. Rudine Bishop’s analogy of books as mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors has always resonated with me. \xa0And I picked up Focused anticipating that I would get a window into the experiences of a young girl with ADHD - that it would help me become a better, more empathetic teacher. And while Focused absolutely did that - it also helped dispel a lot of the misconceptions I had about ADHD, particularly how it tends to manifest in girls and women. \xa0And launched me on a path to discovering that I have ADHD. I opened Focused thinking I was reading a window book - and it turned into a mirror book for me. I know that books can change minds and can change lives. But rarely has a novel changed my life for the better so completely and so soon. And by extension - the lives of my family and students. And when that happens - you just have to let the author know! And so, I emailed Alyson and thanked her and asked her to come on the show to talk about Focused, chess, her experiences with ADHD, her writing process, and so so much more. Take a listen. Alyson Gerber - Interview Outline Focused \xa0 For our listeners who have not yet read the Focused, can you tell us a bit about it? \xa0 In what ways is Clea’s situation and experiences similar to your own and in what ways did you angle her story so that it was different from your own? \xa0 Another thing that I think you do masterfully in Focused is how you show Clea’s relationship with her therapist evolving over time from her denial and distrust to an eventual positive relationship. I think so many kids can benefit from that peek inside a therapist’s office... \xa0 Is the testing you describe Clea doing things you’ve experienced or did you do some research to get those aspects of the story right? \xa0 One of the other parts of the story that really rang true were the conversations around medication... \xa0 One of the things that made me fall so hard for this book was the CHESS! My husband and daughters are all big chess players though not competitively. \xa0Do you play? \xa0 So.... there is some romance in this story!! \xa0 Your Writing Life \xa0 What are you working on now? \xa0 My students and kids are always eager to hear writing advice from authors. \xa0What’s a tip or trick that you’ve picked along the way that has helped your writing? \xa0 Is there a piece of feedback that you got that changed Focused? \xa0 Your Reading Life \xa0 One of the goals of this podcast is to help educators and parents inspire kids to read more and connect them with amazing books. \xa0Did you have a special person who helped launch your reading life as a child? And if so, what did they do that made such a difference? \xa0 What have you been reading lately that you’ve liked? \xa0 What do you hope that readers take away from reading Focused? Thank You!

For more great content visit edupodcastnetwork.com Talk with you soon! \xa0Bye! \xa0 | Intro Hi everyone and welcome to Books Between - a podcast for teachers, parents, librarians, and anyone who wants to connect the tweens in your life to books they’ll love. \xa0I’m your host, Corrina Allen - 5th grade teacher, a mom of an 11 and 9 year old, and desperate to be DONE with winter, please!! Yesterday we saw robins all over the yard and today… it’s covered with snow again. I believe that the right book can change the trajectory of a child’s life and can help them recognize the world for what it is and what it can be. \xa0And I want to help you connect kids with those wonderful, life-shaping books and bring you inspiring conversations with the authors and educators who make that magic happen. This is episode #70 and today I’m discussing three new graphic novels that would be great additions to your collection, and I’m also sharing with you a conversation I had with one of their creators. Book Talk - Three New Graphic Novels In this segment, I share with you a selection of books centered around a theme and discuss three things to love about each book. This week I am featuring three new graphic novels released in the last few months that should absolutely be on your radar -  Click,  New Kid, and  Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy. \xa0 Click Let’s start with Click by Kayla Miller. \xa0This full-color graphic novel is about 5th grader Olive who is feeling left out and left behind when all of her friends have matched up with each other for the school variety show. They’ve all formed acts together and Olive is feeling like she just doesn’t “click” with anyone or anything. Here are three things I really enjoyed about Click:  Olive’s Aunt Molly! She’s the kind of aunt we all wish we could have - the one whose house you can stay at when things are tricky at home. The cool aunt with ripped jeans, green streaks in her hair, and a “Kiss the Librarian” coffee mug. (I mean - well, *I* think that’s cool!) \xa0It’s Aunt Molly that gets Olive these DVDs of old-timey variety shows that leads to her “a-ha” moment. The friendship dynamics in the book! I know a lot of kids can feel like they don’t belong. Don’t feel popular, don’t have a best friend. And as someone who always seemed to be friends with girls who were best friends with each other - I could really relate to Olive. The third thing that I ended up liking about this book is that it’s slower paced, has essentially one main conflict, and it can be read in one sitting.  Click is a great option for kids in grades 3-6 who liked Sunny Side Up or Raina Telgemeier’s graphic novel. \xa0And - Kayla Miller has a sequel coming out on April 23rd called  Camp - so if they enjoy Click, they’ll have another one on the way. Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy Next up is  Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth by Rey Terciero and Bre Indigo which is, as you might have guessed from the title - a modern retelling of  Little Women. A full-color, 256 page graphic novel reboot of the March sisters’ story. In this retelling, the March family lives in a brownstone in New York City and their father is deployed overseas in the Middle East. So the setting is different, but the girls’ personalities are pretty much the same, but with a modern twist. Meg is the responsible one and works as a nanny. Jo is an ambitious writer, Beth is shy and loves writing music but plays a guitar and not the piano, and Amy is still her obnoxious self - just in a slightly different way. \xa0My eleven-year-old and I devoured this book - oh it’s so good! And here are three reasons why:  That the March family is reimagined as a modern blended biracial family. Mr. March is black and was a widower with one daughter, Meg. And he marries Mrs. March, who is white and also had one daughter, Jo. And they go on to have Beth and Amy together. \xa0And that mix of closeness and conflict that can happen between sisters had my daughter nodding her head and laughing in recognition. We also loved that this modern retelling including gay characters and just an overall more diverse slice of society. Noticing what’s changed from the original. I’d read the Little Women many years ago but my daughter hadn’t and I doubt many middle grade readers will have. But we had both seen the movie recently and it’s cool to see how those classic characters are updated. Amy is into gaming - and boy is she competetive about it! And she wants to sell Aunt Catherine’s ring to either go to art school or launch a career as a video game reviewer on YouTube. The book includes most of the iconic Little Women scenes - Jo cutting her hair, Amy wrecking some of Jo’s writing, Jo not saving Amy from an accident that could have been tragic, Meg hanging out with a crowd of a different class, the whole Laurie situation. But each are shifted and told in a totally new way that makes sense for the now. The ending is the same yet totally different. I want to be careful with what I say so I don’t ruin anything if you haven’t read Little Women. First, the story ends when the girls are younger. Jo is still in high school and Meg is in college so there might be an opportunity for a sequel? Also - just like the original, you will need tissues but maybe not an entire box.  \xa0  Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth is a must-purchase graphic novel for I would say about grades 5 and up. And just like other graphic novels versions of classics like Anne of Green Gables and the Iliad, it’s a way for young readers to access those stories in a format they love. And adult fans of Little Women will love it, too. New Kid The third graphic novel that I want to recommend to you this week is  New Kid by Jerry Craft. I’m fairly confident that you have already heard about this book since it seems like everyone is raving about it. But let me add my voice to those to say - yes, it’s THAT good. And I am really excited to have Jerry Craft on the show today to talk about how the book connects to his own experiences attending a private school, micro-aggressions, his favorite Chinese food, his inspirations, what’s he’s been reading - and so so much more. Take a listen: \xa0 Jerry Craft - Interview Outline New Kid has been getting so much love and support from readers online - \xa0\xa0you have knocked it out of the park! For our listeners who have not yet read the novel, can you tell us a bit about it? I’ve heard you say that Jordan’s story is somewhat based on your experiences. What are those those similiarites and also - where does the novel diverge from your experiences? In a previous interview you were asked what message you hoped people would take away from reading New Kid. And one of the things you mentioned was addressed to teachers and librarians “when you see kids of color, make sure you see them as kids first. Because they are! They like to laugh, and play, and use their imaginations, but to me they are constantly bombarded with so many things that force them to grow up at a much faster rate than other kids. Their books. Their movies. Their music. Everything is such a heavy reminder of how terrible their lives are going to be.” \xa0 And that scene at the book fair is such an illustration of that….  So I have to talk to you about the audiobook of New Kid! \xa0What was the process like and what did you think of the final audiobook? So - what’s YOUR favorite Chinese food? A question from Jarrett Lerner.. “I\'d love to hear about your favorite comics, comic book artists, graphic novelists. You do such inventive, clever things with your paneling and your visual language. Who are your influences and favorites? So, everyone wants to know - will there be a sequel?! What have you been reading lately that you’ve liked?  Thank You! \xa0 Links: Jerry’s website - http://www.jerrycraft.net Jerry on Twitter - @JerryCraft \xa0 Jerry on Instagram - @jerrycraft Jerry on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/jerry.craft.162 New Kid  audiobook \xa0 Jerry’s influences:  John Buscema  Jim Steranko Gil Kane Jack Kirby Will Eisner Barbara Slate \xa0 Books & Authors We Chatted About: \xa0 Nimona  audiobook  Angel Love (Barbara Slate)  Sweet Sixteen (Barbara Slate)  You Can Do a Graphic Novel (Barbara Slate) Class Act (Jerry Craft)  Piecing Me Together (Renée Watson)  Queen Raina Telgemeier  Nic Stone  Ibi Zoboi  Jason Reynolds  Kwame Alexander  American Born Chinese (Gene Luen Yang)  Anika Denise  Pura Belpré  Schomburg: The Man Who Built a Library (Carole Boston Weatherford) \xa0 Closing Thank you so much for joining me this week. \xa0You can find an outline of interviews and a full transcript of all the other parts of our show at MGBookVillage.org. \xa0\xa0And, if you have an extra minute this week, reviews on  iTunes or Stitcher are much appreciated.

For more great content visit edupodcastnetwork.com \xa0 Talk with you soon! \xa0Bye! | Intro Hi everyone and welcome to Books Between - a podcast for teachers, parents, librarians, and anyone who wants to connect kids between 8-12 to books they’ll love. \xa0I’m your host, Corrina Allen - a teacher of 21, a mom of two, and enjoying the last few hours of our Winter Break here in Central New York. We’ve had ice storms then sun and lots of time to read. This is episode #69 and Today I’m discussing four excellent middle grade novels that deal with grief and loss. And I’m also sharing with you a conversation I had with Laura Shovan about her latest book Takedown. Book Talk - Four Novels About Loss and Hope In this segment, I share with you a selection of books centered around a theme and discuss three things to love about each book. I happened to read these four books back-to-back without realizing how profoundly connected they were. They have completely different plots and one is even sci/fi / speculative fiction - but each novel features a main character who is dealing with loss in one form or another. In two of the novels, that loss is the death of a parent. And in two of the novels, that loss includes a parent dealing with mental illness and trauma themselves. A loss of another - a loss of what was once considered normal life. \xa0The books this week are:  The Science of Breakable Things,  The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole,  The Simple Art of Flying, and  The Remarkable Journey of Coyote Sunrise. \xa0 The Science of Breakable Things \xa0 The first book I want to share with you and one that I hope makes its way into your collection is Tae Keller’s debut novel  The Science of Breakable Things. The lead in this story is 7th grader Natalie who’s life has been turned upside down as she and her father are learning how to navigate her mother’s depression - the “situation” as her dad calls it that has her mom holed up in her bedroom and not able to cook, work, or keep up any of the routines and traditions that had kept their family together. At the beginning of the school year, Natalie’s science teacher has challenged them all to use the power of the scientific method to explore a question that intrigues you and study it with all your heart. Well - the question that tugs at Natalie’s heart? \xa0How can I inspire my mother to break out of her depression? And along the way Natalie teams up with Twig (her exuberant best friend) and Dari (their new serious lab partner) to enter an egg-drop contest hoping to use the prize money for a scheme to jumpstart her mother out of her depression. Here are three things to love about Tae Keller’s The Science of Breakable Things: \xa0  How the story is laid out with the steps of the Scientific Method! Step One: Observe, Step Two: Question, Step Three: Investigative Research and so on. \xa0It’s a clever way to structure the story and have you predicting what those Results will be! The illustrations and footnotes! Oh am I such a sucker for a good footnote - especially funny ones and this novel has over fifty of these little gems! Natalie’s visits with her therapist, Dr. Doris - and Natalie’s resistance to falling for her “Therapist Tricks” and Natalie’s eventual shift to being more open with her. I think a lot of kids will be able relate to those begrudging trips to a counselor, and I hope some other children might see a glimpse into the help a therapist can offer.  \xa0 There is so much more to this book than just those things - like Natalie’s relationship with her Korean grandmother and her growning interest in their shared culture and the break-down of her relationship with her friend Mikayala. Here is one of my favorite quotes - one that captures the blend of science and hope in this book. This is from a section right after Natalie, Twig, and Dari have been experimenting with magnets. “It’s funny how the cold magnets actually worked best. It’s like how perennial plants seem to die in the winter but really, they’re just waiting till everything is all right again. Maybe it’s not such a surprise that there’s strength in the cold. Maybe sometimes the strongest thing of all is knowing that one day you’ll be alright again, and waiting and waiting until you can come out into the sun.” \xa0 For kids who are waiting for those in their lives to come out into the sun, The Science of Breakable Things is a fabulous book to offer. \xa0 The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole \xa0 Our next book today is  The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole by Michelle Cuevas - author of several picture books and the middle grade  Confessions of an Imaginary Friend which I now must pick up immediately! The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole is one of those books that I kept bumping into. I’d see it on display at the library, friends kept raving about it, it popped up on my “Related to Items You Viewed” on Amazon. It’s like it was stalking me. Like, in a nice, bookish way. The way where all the the forces of the universe seem to nudge you to read something. And well - the forces of the universe were right about this quirky, moving, wonderfully weird little book. It’s about eleven-year-old Stella Diaz whose father has recently died. Together they shared a love of science - and silly jokes. But remembering him after his death has become painful. In the first pages of the book, she decides to give NASA the only recording of her father’s laugh - to put on the Golden Record headed out on the Voyager spacecraft. Instead, a black hole follows her home and it becomes Stella’s pet - consuming everything it touches. And at first, Stella is happy to toss in those things that cause her annoyance (Brussel Sprouts) or cause her painful memories (like the recording of her father). \xa0And then the black hole devours her 5-year-old brother, Cosmo, and Stella has to venture inside that darkness to save him and confront all the other things she’d tossed inside. I loved this book - and here are three (of many!) reasons why: \xa0  It’s hilarious! Like - Stella names the black hole “Larry” - short for “Singularity” and the scenes with the smelly classroom hamster Stinky Stu. And the Dog With No Name. And all the things that Larry gets up to when he gets loose in the neighborhood! Yes - this novel is about loss and grief and there are times when you’re probably going to cry. But to me, that edge between laughing and tears is a powerful place. And this book does it so well. The clever use of black and white pages - and Stella’s Captain Log documenting her journey in the black hole. Lines like this one: “It\'s like the stars in our constellations that we made," you said. "Even if one star dies far, far away, its light is still visible, and the constellation it helped to make remains. A thing can be gone and still be your guide."  \xa0 The Care and Feeding of a Pet Black Hole is charming, gorgeously written - and funnier than you’d ever think. If you have kids who like science, who like funny books, who are up for something unique - then this is a novel they’ll love. And if you have a child learning how to grapple with their black hole - this might be the book they need. \xa0 The Simple Art of Flying \xa0 Another fantastic book that was just released this past week is  The Simple Art of Flying by debut author Cory Leonardo. It’s about a young cherry-loving African Grey parrot, Alastair, who was born in the back room of a pet shop - along with his sister, Aggie. Alastair is...grumpy, suspicious, stubborn, and intensly loyal to his sister - and set on finding a way for them both to escape together to a land of blue skies and palm trees. \xa0But that dream gets a lot harder to pull off when each of them are adopted by two different people. Alastair ends up with an elderly but very active widow named Albertina Plopky who organizes “Polka with Pets” events and writes letters to her deceased husband. And Aggie is bought by 12-year-old-Fritz, an attentive, sweet, and serious boy who is dealing with his own loses. So here are three things to love about Cory Leonardo’s The Simple Art of Flying: \xa0  How this story is told from three different points of view and in three different formats which helps us triangulate what’s happening. Alastair’s sections are in prose and in poetry. He likes to chew on books with poetry being his favorite so has taken to creating his own versions of famous poems he’s read. Bertie’s sections are letters to her husband, Everett. And Fritz’s parts are a medical log. Alastair’s poetry!!! And… the chapter with the goldfish was unexpected and...brilliant! Bertie’s letter to Fritz at the end of the book - all about cherries and life and what to do on those days when it feels like everything is the pits.  \xa0 The Simple Art of Flying is a gorgeously sweet book that’s a little bit like  The One and Only Ivan with a touch of  Because of Winn-Dixie. \xa0 The Remarkable Journey of Coyote Sunrise \xa0 Our final book this week is the latest from Dan Gemeinhart - who you may know from  The Honest Truth,  Good Dog, or  Scar Island. His novels are perennial favorites in our class and guaranteed heart-tuggers - and  The Remarkble Journey of Coyote Sunrise is, I think, my favorite of all. And that’s saying something - every one of his books are incredible! \xa0This story starts at a hot gas station where our main girl, called Coyote, walks in alone - and leaves with a watermelon slushie and a white and gray striped fluff of a kitten. A kitten she has to hide from her father - the man she only refers to as Rodeo. Five years ago Coyote’s mother and sisters were killed in an accident and since then she and her father have left behind their home, their memories (or any talk of them) and have been living in an old converted school bus traveling the country. And never ever looking back. But during Coyote’s weekly phone call to her grandmother back in Washington State, Coyote learns something that launches her on a secret mission to get the bus headed back home (without Rodeo realizing it!) so she can keep a promise. On her journey there are mishaps and new travelers joining them and more secrets revealed. There are so many reasons to love this book there’s no way to list them all, but here are three:  Coyote. This girl has so much charm and love and generosity wrapped around a core of pain and hurt. She’s gentle with her father - even when he doesn’t deserve it. She names her cat Ivan from The One and Only Ivan. \xa0She reminds me a bit of Anne Shirley from the Anne of Green Gables books. You just want to ber her friend. Coyote’s friendship with Salvador - a boy who ends up on the bus with them with his mother. I love how they gently push each other in a better direction. And Coyote does something for Salvador that is one of the kindest, sweetest, gestures. Rodeo. Here’s how Coyote describes him. “That man is hopeless. He is wild and broken and beautiful and hanging on by a thread, but it’s a heckuva thread and he’s holding it tight with both hands and his heart.”  \xa0 The Remarkable Journey of Coyote Sunrise was a book that shredded my heart and then somehow stitched it back together stonger than before. I think it’s Gemeinhart’s best yet. \xa0 Laura Shovan - Interview Outline \xa0 Our special guest this week is Laura Shovan - author of the novel in verse  The Last Fifth Grade of Emerson Elementary and her most recent middle grade book -  Takedown. This conversation actually took place last summer but due to some techinical difficulties on my end, it took me until now to bring it to you. \xa0But, it was worth the wait. Laura and I chat about the inspiration behind her novel, the world of girls’ wrestling, donuts, bullet journaling, among lots of other things. And don’t forget that when you are done reading the book and you want to hear Laura and I discuss the ending of Takedown, just wait until the end of the show after the credits and that bonus section will be waiting for you. \xa0 Take a listen… \xa0 Takedown \xa0 Your new middle grade novel, Takedown, was just released this past June - can you tell us a bit about it? I love books that immerse me in a subculture! \xa0Like  Roller Girl, and the Irish dancing in Kate Messner’s  The Seventh Wish - I was so fascinated to learn about wrestling moves and the tournament process. I’ve heard you mention that your son wrestled and that close knowledge of the sport clearly comes through. \xa0When did you know you wanted to bring wrestling into a story and did you do any extra research to bring this story to life? \xa0 There were so many small moments in the book that highlight what a “boys’ club” the wrestling world is - all the trophies have boys at the top of them, all the refs at all the tournaments (including the girls wrestling tournament) are men - and even Mickey’s supportive coach uses gendered languages and calls the team “guys” and “boys.” \xa0At some point it occured to me… yes, this book is about wrestling, but maybe it might help kids see how male-focused other aspects of the world are? \xa0 One of the aspects that I really connect to was the Delgado family dynamics of Mickey and her older brothers Cody and Evan. And how their relationship with each other changed when the oldest, Evan, wasn’t around. \xa0 I’m coming to realize that dual perspective novels are some of my favorites. And you were masterful at those subtle time shifts to build that suspense! \xa0What was your process like to make Mickey’s voice distinct from Lev’s? \xa0 You deserve a donut for this amazing book! \xa0What’s your favorite? \xa0 So, as a fellow bullet journaler, did I see that you offer bullet journaling CLASSES?   Your Writing Life \xa0 How was writing Takedown different than writing The Last Fifth Grade of Emerson Elementary?   Your Reading Life \xa0 One of the goals of this podcast is to help educators and librarians and parents inspire kids to read more and connect them with amazing books. \xa0Did you have a special teacher or librarian who helped foster your reading life as a child? \xa0 What were some of your most influential reads as a child? \xa0 What have you been reading lately that you’ve liked? \xa0 Before you go - you posted a video of you calling your reps last year. I just want to say thank you for inspiring me to make those phone calls and to keep calling….   Thank You! \xa0 **BONUS SPOILER SECTION: Laura and I discuss the ending of the novel, and if you’d like to hear that conversation, I moved that part of the recording to after the end credits of today’s episode at the 52:38 mark. \xa0 Links: \xa0 Laura’s website - https://laurashovan.com Laura on Twitter Wrestle Like A Girl Dough Donuts  Laura Shovan on Bullet Journaling \xa0 Books & Authors We Chatted About: \xa0  A Child’s Garden of Verses (Robert Louis Stevensen)  The Chronicles of Narnia (C.S.

So if I sound a little...off - that is why! This is episode #68 and Today I’m answering some questions about trends in middle grade and sharing with you some fabulous 2019 titles to look forward to this year! Q&A - Trends in Middle Grade Fiction Last month, my husband asked me some questions about trends in middle grade fiction. He teaches a class at Seton Hall all about trends in genre fiction and wanted some input on middle grade. So I thought I would share my responses with you. And I would be very curious about what YOU would answer.  What genres or subgenres do you believe are the hottest right now?  Well, it’s a format and not a genre but graphic novel memoirs like  Hey Kiddo,  Real Friends, and  Be Prepared are still really popular. And also graphic novel adaptations of classics (like Anne of Green Gables) and popular novels (like Wings of Fire or Percy Jackson). \xa0And again, not genre, but I see more books that are based on the core experiences of the writer. Those novels that draw on the real-life backgrounds of the authors like Kelly Yang’s  Front Desk, Tami Charles’  Like Vanessa, and  Supriya Kellar’s Ahimsa. \xa0They’re not memoirs but they are books rooted in a very personal experience. To authors, I’d say - take those things that make you unique, that make you a bit quirky, that set you apart from most other people - and write THAT story. Like Kelly Yang taking the experiences of her family coming from China and running motels to write Front Desk. Jarrett Krosoczka writing the critically acclaimed graphic novel memoir Hey Kiddo about his life living with his grandparents after his mom lost custody of him due to drug addiction. Crack that door open and invite us inside.  What genres or subgenres do you believe are passé or overexposed?  I don’t know…. I do wonder how long the unicorn and narwhal craze will last but that seems to live more in picture books than middle grade. Magical realism - or rather realistic fiction with a magical twist - doesn’t seem to be slowing down. You know - anything can be new and fresh with the right spin. \xa0And also, authors from marginalized backgrounds are still underrepresented in just about every genre so those are stories that will likely have new points of view. I thought I was totally over zombie stories but  Dread Nation popped up and whoa!! \xa0I’ve never read a zombie story like THAT before! \xa0  If you had to predict, what genre or subgenre do you think is primed to be the next Big Thing in the next year or so?  I would say stories about immigrants, refugees, and the unique experiences of marginalized groups (especially by #ownvoices authors) will continue to be popular. Over the last couple of years we’ve seen an explosion of critically acclaimed middle grade stories like Alan Gratz’s  Refugee, Jacqueline Woodson’s  Harbor Me, and  Escape from Aleppo by N.H. Senzai among many more. We also have more and more books coming out that tell stories of police violence in developmentally appropriate ways like  Ghost Boys by Jewell Parker Rhodes and  Blended by Sharon Draper. \xa0I’m also really excited about a new crop of middle grade #MeToo stories on the horizon like  So Done by Paula Chase and the upcoming Barbara Dee novel  Maybe He Just Likes You. \xa0  Any comments about where you see genre fiction heading?  In middle grade, like everywhere else, \xa0#ownvoices books are still underrepresented \xa0- everyone has a unique story to tell or a unique POV to offer. \xa0EVERYONE. So my advice to authors, take the spark of your unique life experiences and let that burn throughout your story. \xa0My advice to educators - scour those shelves to find a wider variety of books. Also - if you write for a YA/MG audience, librarians and educators are more and more eager to the ditch the old canon and form partnerships with authors. Look for opportunities like #KidsNeedMentors or reach out to your local schools and libraries. \xa0 Book Talk - Most Anticipated Middle Grade Books of 2019 \xa0 The last couple of episodes were all about looking back on some of the best that middle grade had to offer in 2018. (If you missed those, go check out episodes #66 and #67.) \xa0But today is all about looking forward into the new year. Last year, when I did our Most Anticipated MG of 2018, I went chronologically by month. But this year I’m going about it a little differently and discussing the new releases by category. \xa0 \xa0 First, we’ll chat about the new graphic novels coming up in 2019. And then we’ll talk about new releases from authors who debuted in 2018 and 2017 and see what they’re up to now. After that, I’ll give you a peek at some of the 2019 debut middle grade authors. \xa0Then we’ll see what new books are coming out in favorite series and what sequels we have to look forward to. And finally, we’ll finish up with the 2019 releases from more established authors. \xa0 So, buckle up and get ready to add to your wish list. And remember - no need to go hunting for a pen and paper. You can find every book mentioned AND a picture of the available covers AND a link to pre-order them right on the Books Between post for this episode, #69, at MGBookVillage.com. \xa0I’ve got your back, I know you’re busy, so it’s all right there for you. And as I’ve said before, I’ve come to really love pre-ordering - it helps out favorite authors and it’s like a little surprise to your future self. \xa0 Before we jump in, just remember that this is just a sampling of all the incredible books coming out this year. I’ll add some links to some other great resources in the show notes and on the website where you can find more complete listings of titles to browse through and the MGBookVillage website has a great release calendar so that’s one to bookmark for sure. \xa0  https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/111975.Middle_Grade_Novels_of_2019 http://novelnineteens.com/books/middle-grade-books https://mgbookvillage.org/2018releasedates/  http://www.teenlibrariantoolbox.com/2018/12/19-2019-middle-grade-books-to-have-on-your-radar/  https://www.readbrightly.com/middle-grade-books-2019/  https://www.bookish.com/articles/must-read-childrens-books-winter-2019/  http://www.popgoesthereader.com/target-audience-middle-grade/70-middle-grade-novels-i-cant-wait-to-read-in-2019/ \xa0 Also - publication dates do occasionally change, so just be aware of that. \xa0 Alright, get your Goodreads tab open, or your library website pulled up, or your Amazon/Indiebound shopping cart ready, or ….. print out the show notes and bring it to your favorite local bookstore! \xa0 Alright - let’s get to it!   The 2019 Graphic Novels  This January, Lincoln Peirce, the author of Big Nate, has a new graphic/illustrated novel series set in the middle ages called  Max and the Midknights that looks really, really cute. Also out on January 8th is  Click by Kayla Miller - the story of 5th grader Olive who is having some trouble finding where she “clicks” in middle school. The sequel, called  Camp, is being released this April so fans won’t have to wait long for the next one. A fantasy graphic novel that Mel Schuit recommended that I check out is  The Chancellor and the Citadel by Maria Capelle Frantz so that’s on my radar now - and yours! Thank you, Mel! On January 29th another Hilo is coming our way!  Hilo 5: Then Everything Went Wrong. And on that same day the 5th Bird & Squirrel is coming out called  All Tangled Up. One graphic novel adaptation that has really piqued my interest is  Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy: A Modern Retelling of Little Women by Rey Tercerio and illustrator Bre Indigo. The classic is reimagined as a blended family living in modern-day New York City. I don’t think I’ve ever hit “pre-order” faster and will be eagerly stalking my delivery person on February 5th for that one! My mailbox is going to be brimming on February 5th because I also HAD to preorder  New Kid by Jerry Craft! \xa0It’s about seventh grader Jordan Banks who loves drawing cartoons and dreams of going to art school. But his parents enroll him in a prestigious private school instead, where Jordan is one of the few kids of color in his entire grade. Looks amazing!! \xa090-Second Newbery was singing its praises on Twitter last night and said this about it: “The amazing graphic novel New Kid by @JerryCraft should definitely be on everyone\'s tbr list and it has a full-cast (and all-star cast) audiobook released at the same time….perfect for rich, nuanced convos abt race, class, identity, school systems, how we share books, code switching, starting new school, just so much!” \xa0\xa0So, yeah… I’ll just wait here for a bit while you hit pause and go order that! We also get \xa0the  second Wings of Fire graphic novel, The Lost Heir, on February 26th AND the second Mr. Wolf’s Class book called  Mystery Club. And a heads up that the graphic novel of  The Hidden Kingdom (Wings of Fire Book 3) is out in October 2019. For those Minecraft fans in your life, this March we get another Diary of an 8-Bit Warrior graphic novel -  Forging Destiny. And for older middle grade kids - maybe 11 or 12 and up - \xa0look for the new graphic novel adaptations of  The Iliad and The Odyssey this March as well. And fans of Terri Libenson’s  Invisible Emmie and  Positively Izzie will want to get their hands on  Just Jaime - coming out May7th. There were lots of smiles among my students today when I told them that news! Bad Guys #9 -  The Bad Guys in the Big Bad Wolf is out June 25th. \xa0Perfect launch for a fun summer read. This August brings us  Best Friends, the sequel to Shannon Hale and LeUyen Pham’s  Real Friends - \xa0out on August 27th. And have you seen the cover? It’s Shannon at the top of a rollercoaster with this vibrant purple background. Love it, love it, love it! And Dog Man fans (like my daughter) will be psyched this August because we are getting  Dog Man #7: For Whom the Ball Rolls! The seventh graphic novel adaptation of the Baby-sitters Club,  Boy Crazy Stacey, illustrated by Gale Carrigan, will be out September 3rd. That’s one of those no-brainer preorders for my classroom library. Also - I was interested to hear that R.J. Palacio is publishing her first graphic novel Wonder story this fall called  White Bird. This one is Julian’s grandmother’s story about her life as a young Jewish girl hidden away by a family in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. So be on the lookout for that one September 3rd as well. You want another don’t-even-have-to-think-about-it-just-preorder-it graphic novel?  Guts - the long-awaited new Raina Telgemeier graphic memoir is out September 17th!! September also brings the latest from Tillie Walden -  Are You Listening. \xa0The peeks I’ve seen of that online look incredible, so that one is definitely on my radar this fall. And then….….. Drumroll please……  Mighty Jack and Zita the Spacegirl!! Ahhhh!! \xa0I knew it! That last page in  Mighty Jack and the Goblin King was just too good not to be followed up with a joint adventure. Yay! Jen Wang - \xa0author of last year’s hit,  The Prince & the Dressmaker, has a new graphic novel coming out in September called \xa0Stargazing. This one draws on her personal experiences and is the story of two friends - Moon and Christine. And this November we’ll get  The Midwinter Witch - the third and final book in the trilogy that includes  The Witch Boy and  The Hidden Witch. And - wow, I’m just going to start saving up now for September because the graphic novel adaptation of Kwame Alexander’s  The Crossover is also coming out on September 24th! \xa0It’s going to be a pancakes and ramen noodles for dinner kind of a month if I want to keep up with all these awesome books coming out! \xa0(And I haven’t even gotten past the graphic novels!) And…. I think, maybe, possibly.. that Amulet #9 (the final one of the series) will be released late this year. But I can’t find much info on it. No title, no date, no synopsis - nada! So, I’m cautiously optimistic that it will arrive in 2019. Finally - another graphic novel to be on the lookout for later in 2019 is  Twins by author Varian Johnson who you may know from  The Parker Inheritance and illustrator Shannon Wright. The publication date isn’t yet announced, but apparently it’s about twin sisters struggling to figure out individual identities in middle school and it’s based on Johnson’s own childhood experiences as a twin.    New Releases from 2017 / 2018 Debut Authors \xa0  Early February brings us the second in Anna Meriano’s Love, Sugar, Magic series called  A Sprinkle of Spirits and oh is that cover gorgeous! And definitely snag a copy of the sequel to Jarrett Lerner’s  EngiNerds -  Revenge of the EngiNerds out on February 19th. It is EVEN FUNNIER than the first one. And that’s saying something! Another book I’m looking forward to is Jen Petro-Roy’s  Good Enough - about a young girl with an eating disorder.  Game of Stars by Sayantani DasGupta - the follow up to  The Serpent’s Secret is out on February 26th. And the end of February also brings us  Bone Hollow \xa0by  Skeleton Tree author Kim Ventrella. Also be on the lookout for  The Hunt for the Mad Wolf’s Daughter by Diane Magras on March 5th. That sequel is getting rave reviews so it’s definitely one to add to your library. Alyson Gerber, author of  Braced, will have a new novel out called  Focused. It’s about a middle school girl who loves chess and has been recently diagnosed with ADHD. Definitely a book a lot of my students will be able to connect with! In the last week of April we get the sequel to Roshani Chokshi’s  Aru Shah and the End of Time called  Aru Shah and Song of Death This April brings us the second novel from Rebecca Donnelly called  The Friendship Lie. One book I’m excited to dip into this spring is  Up for Air by Laurie Morrison. You might know her from last year’s  Every Shiny Thing. From the author of 2017’s  The Epic Fail of Arturo Zamora and 2018’s  Marcus Vega Doesn’t Speak Spanish comes  Each Tiny Spark. This is Pablo Cartaya’s third MG novel and this one features a young girl, a father recently returned from deployment, and… welding. So look for that one in August. And  The Cryptid Keeper, the sequel to Lija Fisher’s 2018  The Cryptid Catcher is out this August as is Melissa Sarno’s  A Swirl of Ocean. In September comes the sequel to  Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus by Dusti Bowling. It’s called  Momentous Events in the Life of a Cactus and follows Aven’s adventures as she heads into high school. At first I thought that might put it in the YA category, but from what I can tell, it’s still middle grade. This fall we’ll also be treated to Abby Cooper’s third novel -  Friend or Fiction. Just like  Sticks and Stones and  Bubbles, this one is also magical realism. It’s about a girl named Jade. In the pages of her notebook, she writes all about Zoe--the most amazing best friend anyone could dream of. But when pretend Zoe appears in real life thanks to a magical experiment gone right, Jade isn\'t so sure if she likes sharing her imaginary friend with the real world. \xa0 Another treat in store for you this fall is the third novel by Elly Swartz -  Give and Take. This book is about 12 year-old Maggie whose grandmother’s recent death has triggered her to start hoarding things under her bed.    2019 Debut Authors \xa0 So - I’ll just say right now that I could have had an ENTIRE show just dedicated to the amazing middle grade debuts coming our way this year but at some point, I had to cut myself off. \xa0So - I’ll include a link to the Novel19s website where you find many more middle grade debuts and discover some of your new favorite authors. \xa0   The Whisperers is Greg Howard’s middle grade debut and one that has really caught my eye. Just listen to this description: “Eleven-year-old Riley believes in the whispers, magical fairies that will grant you wishes if you leave them tributes. Riley has a lot of wishes. He wishes bullies at school would stop picking on him. He wishes Dylan, his 8th grade crush, liked him, and Riley wishes he would stop wetting the bed. But most of all, Riley wishes for his mom to come back home.” Oooo…. This one is out January 15th. If you are looking for a new book for younger middle grade readers - something along the lines of Ramona Quimby or Stella Diaz - check out  Meena Meets Her Match by Karla Manternatch. One book that keeps popping up into my radar is the middle grade debut of Padma Venkatraman called  The Bridge Home about four children who discover strength and grit and family while dealing with homelessness. That one comes out Feb 5th so be on the lookout for that one. Another debut that I have been dying to read is  The Simple Art of Flying by Cory Leonardo! \xa0Let me just read you the teaser: “Born in a dismal room in a pet store, Alastair the African grey parrot dreams of escape to bluer skies. He’d like nothing more than to fly away to a palm tree with his beloved sister, Aggie. But when Aggie is purchased by twelve-year-old Fritz, and Alastair is adopted by elderly dance-enthusiast and pie-baker Albertina Plopky, the future looks ready to crash-land.” \xa0My step-mother had parrots when I was growing up, so this one in particular I really am interested in reading! So I’ll be checking my mailbox for that one on February 12th. Another debut I am excited to read this year is Joshua Levy’s  Seventh Grade vs. the Galaxy! Since one of my goals this year is to introduce my students to more science fiction, a story about a school on a spaceship orbiting Jupiter would be perfect! On March 12 we get Lisa Moore Ramée’s debut  A Good Kind of Trouble about a girl who just wants to follow the rules. And sometime this spring we get rather the opposite in  Bernice Buttman, Model Citizen by Niki Lenz. This one is about a “bully” who ends up living with her aunt who is a nun and tries to turn over a new leaf. This March is the debut of Julia Nobel with  The Mystery of Black Hollow Lane about a girl who gets shipped off to a British boarding school and finds a box of medallions that might just be connected to the disappearance of her father. A graphic novel debut coming in March that looks fabulous is  Red Panda & Moon Bear by Jarod Roselló. It’s about two Latinx kids who defend their neighborhood from threats both natural and supernatural. And in late April is the first book in a new MG detective series called  Kazu Jones and the Denver Dognappers by Shauna Holyoak and a time-traveling action adventure that will transport readers to ancient Egypt called  Jagger Jones & the Mummy’s Ankh by Malayna Evans.  Hurricane Season by debut author Nicole Melleby comes out May 7th and oh how do I want to read this novel! \xa0On a recent #MGLitChat focused on the 2019 debut authors, the moderator asked, “What do you hope young readers take away from your book?” \xa0And Nicole Melleby said the following, “ I want them to take away that they’re not alone, that they’re seen, that mental illness is hard but manageable, and that love may have its limits, but help comes in all shapes and sizes. Also that Van Gogh was a brilliant man.” \xa0After reading  Vincent & Theo last summer - uhhh…. gimme that book!! Another great middle grade debut to look for on May 7th is Just South of Home by Karen Stong which is described as Blackish meets Goosebumps. The story follows a rule-abiding girl who must team up with her trouble making cousin, goofy younger brother, and his best friend to unravel a mysterious haunting in their tiny Southern town. Also coming this spring is a book that I immediately knew I wanted to read. It’s called  Planet Earth is Blue by Nicole Panteleakos. (So, I was pretty much ALREADY sold by the Bowie reference.) The book follows Nova, an autistic, nonverbal, space-obsessed 12-year-old who is awaiting the Challenger shuttle launch and the return of her big sister, Bridget, as she struggles to be understood by her new foster family. \xa0I was a 4th grader when The Challenger Disaster happened and vividly remember watching it happen live on tv, so I am really interested to see how that plays out in this book. Another debut to look for early this summer is  All of Me by Chris Baron - a novel in verse about a 13 year old boy who is dealing with a big move, struggles in his parents’ marriage, and his own body image issues. So… if you are a close listener, you have probably figured out that I’m a sucker for books involving baking or cooking. \xa0Maybe that’s why  Midsummer’s Mayhem by Rajani LaRocca just leapt out at me when I stumbled across it last month. This is a contemporary-fantasy retelling of A Midsummer Night’s Dream about an 11 year old Indian American girl whose father is a food writer and whose mother is a successful businesswoman. But when she adds some rather…. unusual (and maybe magical?) ingredients to her baking, things get out of hand. So look for that one on June 4th. And if your kids are looking for a fun spooky read this summer,  Ollie Oxley and the Ghost comes out on June 18th and looks really cute. It’s about a boy who moves to California and ends up becoming friends with a ghost from the Gold Rush era.  Ghost Squad by Claribel Ortega is another paranormal middle grade coming this September and it’s described as Coco meets Stranger Things. So, uh… yeah...gimme that for sure! Also coming out this September is  The Light in the Lake by Sarah Baughman - a book about a young girl who finds herself caught between her love of science and her late twin brother\'s belief in magic.    Sequels and Favorite Series  This January 29th we’re getting two awesome books: a 4th in the Crime Biters series -  Fangs for Everything AND  I Survived the Battle of D-Day, 1944 by Lauren Tarshis. \xa0And watching out for another I Survived book in September called  I Survived the Great Molasses Flood, 1919. Also in 2019 we are getting not one but TWO new Babysitting Nightmares books!  The Phantom Hour this January 29th and  The Twilight Curse on August 20th. February 5th brings another Stick Dog book -  Stick Dog Gets the Tacos AND the third Frazzled book by Booki Vivat! This one is called  Minor Incidents and Absolute Uncertainties. I just love her titles! In late February kids will be getting book 4 in the DC Comics Secret Hero Society -  Science Fair Crisis!  Lion Down by Stuart Gibb is out on February 26th. The second in his FunJungle series and the follow up to  Panda-monium.) In March comes book five in The School for Good & Evil series:  A Crystal of Time , a new Emily Windsnap novel called  Emily Windsnap and The Pirate Prince, and another in the Fairy Tale Reform School series called  Wished. In March we also get a seventh Jedi Academy Book called  Revenge of the Sis. This one starts a new storyline and is written by Amy Ignatow with Jarret Krosoczka illustrating. And an as yet untitled  8th Jedi Academy novel is scheduled for September 2019. AND I’m really excited for the third BAT book:  Bat and the End of Everything by Elana K. Arnold. \xa0My daughter’s 4th grade class read the first book and they - of course! - fell hard for this series! Jeff Kinney fans will be excited about  Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid - a book told from Rowley’s point of view that is out this April. And that month also brings us another Unicorn Rescue Society novel -  The Chupacabras of the Rio Grande. And my 9 year old is going to be thrilled when I tell her that Katherine Applegate’s sequel to  The Endling is coming out May 7th. It’s called  Endling: The First and is already in my cart. The second book in Laura Ruby’s York series -  The Clockwork Ghost is also headed our way this May and so is Another Fenway & Hattie book -  In the Wild! Natalie Lloyd’s sequel to The Problim Children -  Carnival Catastrophe is due to be out June 25th. And not quite a sequel but more of a spin-off, is  Dough Boys by Paula Chase - author of 2018’s  So Done. Characters Simp and Rollie are the leads in this novel told in two voices. Also - Karina Yan Glaser’s third Vanderbeekers novel is coming this September -  The Vanderbeekers to the Rescue! And finally - just announced this morning - is Kate DiCamillo’s new novel coming September 24th -  Beverly, Right Here. And if you guessed that this is the Beverly from Raymie Nightingale - then you are correct! \xa0So now each of the three girls will have their own novel. By the way - if you haven’t seen it yet, the cover by Amy June Bates is stunning!!  \xa0 \xa0 2019 New Releases from Established Authors \xa0  First up here is the book I am devouring right now -  The Remarkable Journey of Coyote Sunrise by Dan Gemeinhart which just came out on January 8th. And oh…. does this book live up to its hype! Brace yourself to hear lots more about this one later! Also out this January is a book my friend Sandy has been raving about -  The Unsung Hero of Birdsong, U.S.A by Coretta Scott King honor nominee Brenda Woods. So I definitely need to add that one to my TBR list. This January readers will get a new Gordon Korman novel -  Unteachables AND a new Andrew Clements novel -  The Friendship War. January also brings us the first book in the really incredible Rick Riordan Presents Imprint -  Dragon Pearl by Yoon Ha Lee. This is a space opera about thirteen-year-old Min, who comes from a long line of fox spirits. (By the way - if you have kids who love Rick Riordan’s novels or who love adventure books with a dash of humor and myth - then check out his Imprint site. I’ll include a link in the show notes so you can check them all out. From those lucky enough to read advanced copies, I haven’t heard anything but praise.)  Pink Hair and Other Terrible Ideas by Andrea Pyros is one to watch out for this February. And another upper middle grade February release that caught my attention is a joint novel told in letters by  Counting by 7s author Holly Goldberg Sloan and  The Interestings author Meg Wolitzer. It’s called  To Night Owl from Dogfish and it’s about two very different 12 year-old girls named Averie and Bett who are sent off to the same sleepaway camp in order to bond after their single dads fall in love with each other. February also bring us another novel by Anne Urso (author of the critically acclaimed  The Real Boy) This novel,  The Lost Girl, is about identical twins Lark and Iris. \xa0 On March 5th we get another Lisa Graff novel called  Far Away about a girl, CJ, whose aunt is a psychic medium who claims that she carries messages from the dead. And I’m really psyched for  We’re Not From Here by  Tapper Twins author Geoff Rodkey. This novel is also out March 5th and is about refugees from planet Earth who need to find a new home on a faraway planet. I had the opportunity to read an ARC of this one and it’s quirky and hilarious… and timely. Definitely add this one to your pre orders. March also brings us another Rick Riordan Present’s book called  Sal and Gabi Break the Universe by Carlos Hernandez. I’ve been hearing lots of great buzz about this one, so I’ll definitely need to pre-order a copy. On March 19th we get a new Kevin Henkes novel called  Sweeping Up the Heart and this one is the story of the spring break that changes seventh-grader Amelia Albright’s life forever. In late March Natalie Lloyd fans will be treated to  Over the Moon - a story about twelve-year-old Mallie who lives in a mining town where boys leave school at 12 to work in the mines, and girls leave to work as servants for the wealthy. But of course with that quintessentially Lloyd magic interwoven. And another Cynthia Lord book is coming out this March! She is the author of  Rules and  A Handful of Stars. This one is titled  Because of the Rabbit and is about a young girl who starts public school for the first time after being homeschooled.  Where the Heart Is by Jo Knowles is coming out April 2nd and a really interesting looking book called  Summer of a Thousand Pies by Margaret Dilloway will be released April 16th. It’s about a girl who has to save her aunt’s pie shop. I think this one would be \xa0a winner for kids who enjoy shows like The Great British Baking Show. In early May, we get to read Lynda Mullaly Hunt’s next novel,  Shouting at the Rain about a girl named Delsie who lives with her grandmother, loves tracking weather, and who starts to wish for a more “regular” family and life. You can’t go wrong with the author of  Fish in a Tree and  One for the Murphys so… just pop this one in your cart now! And another novel that is getting all kinds of early buzz is the latest from K.A. Reynolds called  Spinner of Dreams. It’s being called “inventive, empathetic, and strange in all the best ways.” \xa0Plus - it has a really otherworldly cover that I just want to stare at... And finally - I know you all have heard me rave about this one before - but Barbara Dee’s  Maybe He Just Likes You is going to be AMAZING! \xa0My students and I got the chance to read the first chapter and we were all already hooked. But let me give you a little taste from the teaser: “For seventh grader Mila, it starts with an unwanted hug on the school blacktop. The next day, it’s another hug. A smirk. Comments. It all feels…weird. According to her friend Zara, Mila is being immature, overreacting. Doesn’t she know what flirting looks like? They don’t understand why Mila is making such a big deal about the boys’ attention. When Mila is finally pushed too far, she realizes she can’t battle this on her own–and finds help in some unexpected places.” I can’t WAIT!!  \xa0 Phew!! \xa0Alright - I am both energized and - I gotta be honest - a little daunted! But - I am reminding myself and I hope you’ll remember too that it’s not about a mad dash to read all of these books. But to give you a taste of what’s to come so you can match readers with books they might like and get them excited about new releases. \xa0 I hope you have a wonderful year reading and I would love to know - what are the books that you and your students are most looking forward to in 2019? \xa0 You can email me at booksbetween@gmail.com or jump into the conversation on Twitter/Instagram at the handle @Books_Between. \xa0\xa0 \xa0 Closing \xa0 Thank you so much for joining me this week. \xa0You can find an outline of interviews and a full transcript of all the other parts of our show at MGBookVillage.org. \xa0\xa0And, if you have an extra minute this week, reviews on  iTunes or Stitcher are much appreciated. \xa0 Books Between is a proud member of the Lady Pod Squad and the Education Podcast Network.

It’s the lockscreen on my phone, my girls and I have the soundtrack set to shuffle in the car….and I already have plans to go see it a second time. \xa0Into the Spiderverse is the most innovative and fresh and exciting movie I’ve seen in years. It’s some next-level stuff. Just - go see it!! And see it on the BIG screen! This is episode #67 and today we are celebrating some of the best middle grade graphic novels published in 2018. On our last episode, I listed my top 25 middle grade novels of the year and  I’ll include a link to that if you missed that episode. I think it’s important at the outset when making a list of this kind to explain what “best” means to you. What are your criteria? Is that popularity? The Goodreads best of lists tend to veer in that direction. Is it literary appeal? That is more along the lines of say, the Newbery Awards. For me, an outstanding book has to fit three criteria:  I couldn’t put it down. Meaning - it was immersive, it has flow, it kept me turning the pages. I can’t forget it. Meaning - it had some extra special sparkle. An unforgettable character, an intriguing setting, a ground-breaking format, or a powerfully poignant message. I think kids would like it. There are books out there marketed to middle grade readers (sometimes those big award winners) that adults love but kids don’t seem to latch onto as much. So I also try to be mindful that kids books are for kids. Not for me. I am just the conduit to getting books into their hands and helping them discover what they like.  Okay - let’s jump in! Main Topic - The Top 9 MG Graphic Novels of 2018 9. Making Friends by Kristen Gudsnuk This full-color graphic novel is about a 7th grade girl named Dany. She has just started middle school and is pretty lonely. Her friends are in different classes now and have new in-jokes and stories that she doesn’t get anymore. So she’s feeling socially vulnerable when her eccentric (and loaded) great-aunt passes away and she ends up with the woman’s sketchbook. A magical sketchbook that will turn your drawing into real-life. So when Dany draws the head of her favorite anime character (uh yeah… JUST the head) and a super popular girl to be her friend, there are (as you can imagine!) some unintended consequences. This book is FUNNY but you won’t catch half the stuff unless you read the background texts - like the store names: \xa0“Hot Topic” is “Cool Subject” and the indredients list on the food have some interesting things listed on them. This book is like a mix of Shannon Hale’s  Real Friends with a touch of  Suee and the Shadow with a little sprinkle of  Amulet. If you have readers about ages 10 and up who like graphic novels about friendships and would be up for something with a supernatural twist, then this would be a great recommendation. And… I see Gudsnuk has a sequel in store as well! \xa0   Mr. Wolf’s Class \xa0by Aron Nels Steinke  This graphic novel started as a webcomic and is a great option if you are looking for something for younger middle grade readers who’d enjoy a sweet, gentle story. And it looks like lots of sequels are on their way! Mr. Wolf’s Class is about the first day of 4th grade - for brand new teacher Mr. Wolf and his students. By the way, Mr. Wolf is a wolf and the students are… rabbits and frogs and pigs and… well, just suspend your disbelief over the whole predator/prey thing! The book includes a cool preview of each student the night before school starts \xa0and then the day unfolds with short slice-of-life stories as we get to know each of the students and their teacher. A strength of this book is that the author clearly KNOWS what an actual classroom community is all about - the interactions of personalities. It feels really authentic in that way. \xa0And uh… I can definitely relate to being late to pick my kids because I was distracted by a donut in the break room! \xa0   Sheets by Brenna Thummler  You might be familiar with Thummler’s brilliant artwork from last year’s graphic novel adaptation of  Anne of Green Gables. And if you haven’t yet gotten to that gem, bump it up on your TBR pile! This is her first solo graphic novel and I have a feeling we have a lot more in store from her! It’s the story of 13 year-old Marjorie who has been thrust into the responsibilities of running her family’s laundromat and taking care of her younger brother after her mother dies and her father has fallen into a deep depression. She is just barely hanging on and resisting the awful Mr. Saubertuck who wants to run them out of business and turn their building into a spa. But then… enter Wendell. He’s a young ghost \xa0- young meaning new and young meaning died when he was young who winds up being pulled out of the afterlife world and into Marjorie’s life. He’s looking for.. meaning. And after a rocky start with Marjorie, does end up finding it. For me, the strength and charm of this book is really about the outstanding illustrations - the gorgeous pastel palette and the nuances of the wordless panels. And based on how this book is flying through my classroom, it clearly also has that all-important kid-appeal. \xa0   The Night Door (Edison Beaker Creature Seeker) by Frank Cammuso  The author of  The Knights of the Lunch Table series and the  Misadventures of Salem Hyde has really taken things to the next level with this incredible and hilarious new world he’s created. \xa0This book is about a young boy named Edison who is afraid of the dark. When his mom has to go out of town, Edison and his little sister, Tesla, go to stay with their Uncle Earl. Uncle Earl is an exterminator and he reluctantly takes the kids (and their hamster!) on a late-night “emergency” job where the two kids (and the hamster!) wind up going through a portal into a shadowy other-worldly place where Edison has to confront his fears and lots of weird and cool creatures! This is one of those few books that has kids laughing out loud while they read it. \xa0It’s sort of like a mix between  HiLo and  Amulet. So if you have kids who love those two series, and want something similar, introduce them to Edison Beaker Creature Seeker. \xa0   All Summer Long by Hope Larson  I loved this graphic novel for a lot of reasons but one of them was that it features a friendship between a girl and boy that doesn’t ever fall into that trope of “well, maybe things are changing because you two really just have crush on each other!” Nope! It’s real, platonic - and has rocky parts - but it’s not a stepping stone to a love interest. And - thank you Hope Larson! \xa0What it IS about is that one defining summer is a young teen’s life when you start to realize that your childhood is something behind you that you’re looking back on and you are entering a new era with new interests. Where music - and finding people that like the same music as you do - takes on heightened importance in your life. At least, for me it was like that. Maybe for other kids it’s sports or art or theatre. \xa0But you start to find your people. And not just be freinds with the people who are in your class or happen to live next door. This graphic novel is about 13 year-old Bina whose best-friend and neighbor, Austin, is off to soccer camp this summer. So she ends up.. Binge-watching Netflix until her mom cuts her off. (Relateable!) Also - it’s a little thing but I like the pale orangey-peach tones of the book, which one reviewer described as orange creamsicle. \xa0   Crush by Svetlana Chmakova  I really, really loved her \xa0two earlier Berrybrook Middle School stories -  Awkward and  Brave, but this one just might be my favorite. This one takes a step away from the intrigues of the art club and the school newspaper and focused on Jorge Ruiz, a big kid, a pretty-popular jock who nobody really messes with, who seems to have it all together. Until he realizes that he’s got a massive crush on Jazmine and his world is suddenly tilted. \xa0This graphic novel really captures those quick relationship changes in middle school and that dynamic between texts and social media and how that influences and complicates face-to-face interactions. Sometimes novels totally leave out modern technology. I mean, half the time the problem in the book could be solved with a quick Google search or you know - maybe talking with the person that you’re having an issue with! \xa0But Chmakova knows that technology might solve some problems but ushers in a whole host of other ones. Crush is another one of those graphic novels that is getting passed from kid to kid to kid in my classroom with a big enough waiting list I ordered a second copy. And - a bonus - kids don’t have to read the three books in the series in order. They each definitely can stand alone. \xa0   Be Prepared by Vera Brosgol  This graphic novel is loosely based on the author’s real-life experiences and her Russian-American background and that makes for a unique twist on a familiar setting for some kids - summer camp! 9-year old Vera is a Russian immigrant and we learn at the beginning of the novel, she doesn’t doesn’t exactly fit in with the popular crowd. Or really any crowd at all. \xa0Her family is poor and their traditions and food are just enough “culturally off” to make her feel awkward among the girls she invites to a birthday sleepover that goes bad…. And oh man… how I felt for poor Vera that night! That’s some real-life cringe-worthy stuff though. \xa0Vera desperately wants to fit in and finally convinces her mother to send her and her brother to a Russian summer camp sponsored by their Orthodox church where they will learn the Russian language and religion along with the typical summer camp things - like learning why you shouldn’t feed the wildlife and finding a comfortable place to poop! Brosgol’s illustrations are outstanding with a foresty green color palette. \xa0And this book about the poor choices one can make in the quest for friendship along with that added layer of feeling like you don’t really belong enough in any culture makes this graphic novel feel like a blend of Shannon Hale’s  Real Friends and Kelly Yang’s  Front Desk. This would be a great recommendation for kids in about grades 4 or 5 and up. \xa0   The Prince & the Dressmaker by Jen Wang  Oh how this book made me smile!! \xa0It’s set in a 19th century-ish Paris where 16 year-old Prince Sebastian has a huge secret he is keeping from his parents - from everyone except for his trusted butler. He loves getting dressed up in fancy gowns and makeup and wigs. \xa0Eventually he discovers a lowly dressmaker, Frances, who has shown she is willing to break societal norms - and secretly hires her to help him transform into a different, more glamorous person. But things go awry when Sebastian’s parents try to arrange his marriage and his alter-ego (and her designer) become the talk of the town. It’s like Project Runway meets Versailles with a twist of Cinderella. And I really, really want Disney to make this into a movie! \xa0We need more books that go beyond the traditional gender norms so kids can both see themselves and also so that kids can see others not like them at the center of important and positive and fun stories. \xa0   The Cardboard Kingdom by Chad Sell (and others)  \xa0 I was reading the last third of The Cardboard Kingdom after dinner one night. I may have mentioned before that we have a post-dinner reading routine of 20-30 minutes. All of us. And since the girls had taken over my prefered reading spot on the couch, I was off in the easy chair in the corner. Chuckling and smiling and just… reacting as I read it. And suddenly, Helena, my 9 year old, is reading over my shoulder, looming over me. \xa0Then she’s sitting on the arm on the chair, her head pressed against mine to see every angle of the illustrations. Then she’s in my lap with her hands on the book slowing down my turns of the pages so she could absorb each panel. Until finally, I relinquished it to her and just said, “Start from the beginning babe. It’s all yours.” \xa0 I just happened to pick up this graphic novel right after I finished The Prince & the Dressmaker, and I loved the parallels between it’s main character, Sebastian, and the first character we meet here - The Sorceress! \xa0The first section is told completely through wordless panels as we witness two siblings playing with a kiddie pool, a chair, and a bunch of cardboard boxes and how their imagination has transformed that into magic and adventure. \xa0A girl peeking over the fence at them starts laughing and at first it breaks the spell and ends the game. But then she gets drawn into their world in her own unique way. And the story takes off from there - with each neighborhood kid bringing in their own personalities and quirks and their own imaginative spin on adventure. \xa0There are knights and robots and banshees and beasts. And entreupreneurs. There are conflicts and battles. And quieter moments of understanding. The stories stack and intertwine and build and build to create an amazing collection of backyard adventures! And just as the kid’s adventures are collaborative - so is this book! Chad Sell is the illustrator but each section was crafted along with a different writer - Jay Fuller, David Demeo, Katie Schenkel, Manuel Betancourt, Molly Muldoon, Vid Alliger, Cloud Jacobs, Michael Cole, and Barbara Perez Marquez. \xa0And somehow, those diverse authors and illustrators have captured that magical feeling of childhood where there’s boundless inspiration and freedom and when it’s good - acceptance and transformation of flaws into strengths and positive energy. It’s hard to describe the special magic of this book. But it gave me the same feeling as watching the new Spiderman movie I mentioned at the top of the show. A feeling of witnessing some of the best that collaboration has to offer - it’s some next-level stuff. \xa0 Well - you’ve heard from me and now I want to hear from you! \xa0What graphic novels from the past year did you and the kids in your life love? \xa0Which ones are really making an impact among your students? \xa0 And which ones are you all looking forward to in 2019? \xa0\xa0 \xa0 You can email me at booksbetween@gmail.com or jump into the conversation on Twitter/Instagram at the handle @Books_Between. \xa0\xa0 \xa0 We’ll be back to our every-other Monday schedule starting January 14th and make sure you check out the next episode which will be all about the most anticipated middle grade books of the upcoming year. \xa0 Closing \xa0 Thank you so much for joining me this week. \xa0You can find an outline of interviews and a full transcript of all the other parts of our show at MGBookVillage.org. \xa0\xa0And, if you have an extra minute this week, reviews on  iTunes or Stitcher are much appreciated. \xa0 Books Between is a proud member of the Lady Pod Squad and the Education Podcast Network.

This is Books Between - a podcast for teachers, parents, librarians, and anyone who wants to connect kids between 8-12 to books they’ll love. \xa0I’m your host, Corrina Allen - a 5th grade teacher, a mom of two girls, and enjoying my extra reading time over the holiday break and the chance to relax. This is episode #66 and today we are celebrating some of the best middle grade books published in 2018. Main Topic - The Top 20 Middle Grade Books of 2018 I’m a bit of a data nerd, and I have always been into tracking my reading - from my color-coded index card system in high school to my alphabatized Excel Spreadsheet in the early 2000s to now where I do a mix of Goodreads and a bullet journal. So looking back over the last couple of years since I started doing this show, in 2016 I read 60 middle grade books with 31 of those published in 2016. And my top three books of that year were  Booked,  Ms. Bixby’s Last Day, and  The Wild Robot. (You can find that list here.) Last year, I read 79 middle grade with 55 of those published in 2017. A jump I will totally attribute to the intensity of being on the CYBILS committee. And my top three books of 2017 were  Posted,  Refugee, and  Orphan Island and my top three graphic novels last year were  Real Friends,  Pashmina, and  All’s Faire in Middle School. \xa0(You can find the full list here.) This year, I read 59 middle grade books with 41 of those released in 2018. Before I start - a quick caveat. Selecting ONLY 25 titles was almost impossible. \xa0I enjoyed just about every book I read this year, and I know each one will find it’s reader. \xa0So how to choose the top twenty-five? I have two criteria - the writing is immersive (a book I couldn’t put down) and the story has that something special - unique character, an intriguing plot twist, or a thought-provoking theme (a book I can’t forget). \xa0 And again this year, I decided to separate out the graphic novels so be on the lookout for another best of podcast soon featuring just the middle grade graphic novels. \xa0\xa0 Okay, let’s get to it! \xa0Here are my Top 25 middle grade novels of 2018:   Granted by John David Anderson  From the author of the soon-to-be movie,  Ms. Bixby’s Last Day and last year’s amazing  Posted is this story about Ophelia Delphinium Fidgets - one of the few remaining fairies entrusted with the job of Granter - a fairy who ventures into the dangerous human world to grant a wish. Ophelia’s increasingly difficult quest to grant a little girl her wish of a purple bike will keep you turning the pages. And her reluctant friendship with the slobbery dog Sam - along with some other hilarious touches like Ophelia’s special song - will make this novel one you won’t forget. \xa0   Where the Watermelons Grow by debut author Cindy Baldwin  This book - better than any I’ve read - captures the heat and the swelter of a scorching-hot drought-ridden summer. Our protagonist, Della, is feeling the weight of that and also the burdon of her mother’s re-emerging schizophrenia. But this novel is also laced with the sweetness of friendship and watermelon and hope and a touch of maybe magical honey. \xa0 \xa0   Every Shiny Thing by Cordelia Jensen & Laurie Morrison  This dual narrative novel is about Lauren and Sierra. \xa0The two girls end up living next to each other and becoming friends when Lauren’s neighbors become Sierra’s foster parents. \xa0As Lauren starts to become more aware of her priviledge, she comes up with a - shall we say “ill-advised” Robin Hood scheme that quickly starts to spiral out of control. \xa0Watching Lauren and Sierra get deeper and deeper and deeper into that pit and wondering how on earth they were going to dig themselves out is what kept me turning those pages. And what makes this book unique and fresh was the strength of the two perspectives - Lauren’s chapters in prose and Sierra’s in verse. \xa0   The Three Rules of Everyday Magic by Amanda Rawson Hill  Believe. Give. Trust. With those three magical rules passed on to her from her grandmother, Kate tries to grapple with the changes in her life. Divorce, faltering friendship, and her grandmother’s worsening dementia. Along with the typical difficulties of a 12 year old! I loved this book for its blend of beautiful prose and realism. \xa0   Marcus Vega Doesn’t Speak Spanish by Pablo Cartaya  This middle grade coming of age novel tells the story of 8th grader Marcus Vega who ends up traveling to Puerto Rico with his mom and younger brother in search of the father who seemed to abandon them years ago. And yes, his journey is about discovering family, but it’s also about discovering his culture. This book is a beautiful homage to Puerto Rico and a story that captures the experiences of many kids with family connections that represent multiple languages and backgrounds. \xa0It reminds me a bit of the graphic novel  Crush with a twist of Torrey Maldonado’s  Tight. \xa0   The Frame Up by Wendy McLeod MacKnight  This novel was not only unforgettable but it utterly changed the way I experience walking into a musuem forever. And to me - that is the mark of an excellent book. It makes you see the extraordinary in the ordinary. Frame-up is set in a real-life place - the Beaverbrook Gallery in New Brunswick, Canada. And the art director’s son soon discovers that the paintings are…. alive. And they can travel into other paintings - which is completely fascinating when you consider that this museum includes art from different eras. And multiple paintings of the same person. \xa0What the author does in this world is spell-binding. But things start to get dicey when suddenly the art director’s son and Mona, a young girl in one of the museum’s prized paintings, find themselves desperately trying to stop both an art heist and a plot to destroy their community forever. \xa0   Everything I Know About You by Barbara Dee  This book was a fun mix of humor and history intermixed with realistic depictions of issues that young people are coping with - like body shaming and eating disorders and figuring out that whole friendship thing while staying true to yourself and your values. \xa0What made this book stay with me long after that last page was read was the main character, Tally, whose self-confidence and style and body positivity are inspiring. \xa0   So Done by Paula Chase  This upper middle grade coming of age story centers around friends Mila and Tai. \xa0The girls have spent the summer apart and as fall starts, it has become more and more clear that their friendship is sputtering out. And yes, part of that is typical things like finding new interests and more focus on boys, but there is this one massive secret hanging over both girls’ heads that threatens to not only destroy that friendship, but could destroy families, too.The slow, shocking reveal of what that secret really IS kept me turning the pages and what made this book stick with me so long afterward are the voices of the characters that are so fresh and unique and real! \xa0During the first chapter, I had a huge smile on my face because I was so happy to be reading a book that sounds like some of my students when they are talking to each other - and don’t think any adult is within earshot. Chase has this incredible knack for voice, and I cannot wait to see what other middle grade books she has coming our way! \xa0   The Parker Inheritance by Varian Johnson  Johnson has expertly woven together multiple storylines across two different eras that are beautifully fused together in the final chapters. \xa0The main character, modern-day Candice, discovers a decades old mystery that takes her and the quiet bookworm boy across the street on a quest for a long-lost treasure. But to figure out the clues, they have to delve into some long buried town history that some folks would rather keep hidden. This book is rich with details and touches on topics that are not common in middle grade - like the end of segregation and its impact on black schools and the concept of passing. It’s beautifully written and if you have older middle grade kids who loved  The Westing Game and who love mysteries, this is a great book to put in their hands. \xa0   You Don’t Know Everything, Jilly P! by Alex Gino  Alex Gino’s second novel for middle grade readers is a sweet story about Jilly, White and hearing, who befriends a Deaf Black ASL user on a fandom website where they connect over their mutual love of a fantasy series. When Jilly’s new baby sister is born Deaf, \xa0she and her parents struggle with which expert advice to follow and everyone makes some missteps along the way. Based on reviews from those in the Deaf community, Gino does seem to get that representation right. To me this book is one to have in your classroom or library because it shows one character’s pathway through learning about incredibly important but tricky topics like white priviledge, racism, micro-agressions, and abelism. And done in a way with warmth and heart. \xa0   Stella Diaz Has Something to Say by Angela Dominguez  I’ll admit - this one almost got past me! \xa0I was at school and had forgotten my book at home. And so on a whim, I picked up this book from my classroom library and promptly forgot that any other book existed and promptly fell for Stella’s sweetness and charm. Stella is a third grader, born in Mexico, but now living in Chicago with her mom and older brother. She’s struggling with being in a different class than her best friend, Jenny, \xa0and dealing with the accompanying worries that Jenny might be forming a closer relationship with another girl. Stella is also figuring out where she fits in with her outgoing family since she is more quiet and is working through some speech difficulties. Three things stand out to me about this book - its utter realness, the excellent illustrations sprinkled throughout, and also the fact that this novel intersperses Spanish in the most organic and well-executed way that I’ve ever encountered before. They pop up frequently and naturally, and yet I feel confident that most non-Spanish speaking readers can fairly easily figure out what those words mean from the context. \xa0   Takedown by Laura Shovan  I LOVE books that immerse me in a subculture - like Victoria Jamieson’s  Roller Girl, and the Irish dancing in Kate Messner’s  The Seventh Wish. I was fascinated to learn about wrestling moves and the tournament process in this novel. And of course it doesn’t hurt that the two main characters - Mikayla (known as Mickey) and Lev are written so vividly and honestly. Told in alternating point of view chapters, Mickey and Lev are each dealing with their own middle school difficulties of faltering friendships and dicey family dynamics. When they both wind up wrestling for the same elite traveling team, Lev needs to cope with having a new wreslting partner (a girl), and Mickey has to deal with a wrestling culture that isn’t exactly keen to accept her. How these two characters grow and how their stories intertwine have stayed on my mind - months later. \xa0   Good Dog by Dan Gemeinhart  Another incredible story from a favorite author of so many of my students. Good Dog is told from the point of view of Brodie - a dog who we meet just after he’s entered the great beyond after his death. And as our sweet, noble Brodie figures out the rules of this new place, and makes some friends, he remembers more of his past life on Earth. And remembers the danger that his boy, Aidan, is still in. And Brodie has to decide whether to move on to that ultimate Forever or if saving his boy from that threat is worth the awful price he’ll have to pay to even attempt helping him. \xa0I love this book for so many reasons - but mostly for how it quietly but powerfully connects with Gemeinhardt’s previous novel,  The Honest Truth. \xa0I don’t want to say more, but…. if you have a kid who has read and loved that book - give them Good Dog right after. \xa0   Escape from Aleppo by N. H. Senzai  This is another novel that snuck up on me and then wouldn’t let go of my heart. For the last couple of years, my 5th graders and I have read  Home of the Brave together as the first read aloud. This year I decided to have their book clubs centered around refugee and immigrant stories - with a focus on #ownvoices novels. And Escape from Aleppo was the only book club choice I hadn’t yet read - and so I read along with the kids in that club and followed their reading schedule and joined their discussions. And I completely agree with their assessment - this book is fabulous. It’s about 14-year-old Nadia, who we meet as her family is evacuating their home in Syria in an attempt to flee to Turkey. But in the carnage, Nadia ends up separated from her family and has to make her way through the city of Aleppo in a dangerous effort to reunite with them and to figure out who in the war-torn city she should trust to help her. What stands out to me most is the searing depiction of modern-day war and how much my students saw themselves in Nadia’s flashbacks to pre-Arab Spring Aleppo. Scenes were everything seems stable and Nadia is all about the latest episode of her favorite reality TV singing show and what color she should paint her nails. If you are looking for a companion book to Alan Gratz’s  Refugee, this is an excellent choice. And one that will stay with you for a long, long time. \xa0   Rebound by Kwame Alexander  This is the much-awaited prequel to the much-loved and much-awarded, novel-in-verse  The Crossover. This book is all about Josh & Jordan’s father - Chuck “Da Man” Bell. But - this is an origin story. So when we first meet him, he is just Charlie - an 80’s kid reeling from a family tragedy and trying to find his way forward and trying to find his smile again. When home becomes tense, he is involuntarily shipped off to his grandparent’s house for the summer where he starts to find that path forward. I loved this book for it’s awesome illustratations and all those great 80s references. \xa0   Harbor Me by Jacqueline Woodson  Esteban, Tiago, Holly, Amari, Ashton, Haley - these six kids are brought to an abandoned art room each Friday, left on their own, and allowed to simply talk. And eventually - their stories unfold. Stories of deportation, of harassment, of parent death and incarceration. Of hope and of despair. \xa0And by the end of that year, they have formed a bond and a vow to harbor each other. It’s Jacqueline Woodson so you know it’s gorgeously written, but it also speaks to a great need for empathy in our country right now. And I can attest that it’s not just one of those “important” books that kids don’t really like. It was one of the top requested book club selections and currently has a huge waiting list in my room, so I can vouch for it’s kid appeal. \xa0   Small Spaces by Katherine Arden  Okay - this book creeped me the heck out! And it was glorious! This paranormal horror story is about a young girl named Ollie whose mom tragically died last year, and understandably - Ollie is withdrawn and rather raw. \xa0One fall day, Ollie disovers this strange book that tells the legend of two local brothers who come under the influence of The Smiling Man - with horrific results. When Ollie takes a field trip to a nearby farm, she and her friends Coco and Brian end up in an other-wordly battle to survive the lure of those mysterious forces. This book is so immersive and atmospheric and has one brilliant twist at the end that has me shuddering just thinking about it! Oh - and if you’re the type of person that isn’t at all freaked out by scarecrows - read this book and that will change. \xa0   Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed  There has been sooo much love for this book this year - and if you haven’t yet read it, I will add my voice to all the others telling you…. it’s incredible. \xa0This novel is about a young Pakistani girl whose dream is to finish her education and to become a teacher. But when her mother is struggling with depression after having her fifth baby - another girl - Amal ends up staying home to take of the household. And then, to make matters far worse, she ends up insulting a poweful man in her village and be forced into indentured servitude to work off her family’s debt to him. It was this section of the book and Amal’s complicated relationship with man’s family and other servants that was the most compelling to me. \xa0Amal Unbound was the \xa0middle grade pick for the 2018 Global Read Aloud and is worthy of a spot in any middle grade collection. \xa0   Blended by Sharon Draper  As 2018 came to a close, I started scouring the social media feeds of readers whose taste I rely on to see what books from the previous year I may have missed. And by far the one that I kept bumping into… was Blended. And oh were they right to push me to read it! And...confession time - this is the first Sharon Draper book I have read! You may already know her work from  Out of My Mind or  Copper Sun. \xa0This novel is about an 11-year-old girl - Izzy to her mom but Isabella to her Dad. \xa0Her parents are divorced and every week Isabella has to switch - switch households, switch bedrooms, switch backpacks, switch expectations…. and sometimes feels like she has to switch identities. Her father is black and and lives a far more swanky lifestyle now and Isabella’s mother is white and their home definitely has a more casual vibe. I loved this book because I know how many students can relate to Izzy’s frustrations with parental tug-of-war and that awkwardness with people coming into their lives. But this book had so many more themes that will definitely strike a chord with kids today - racial profiling, school threats, micro-agressions, police shootings, and the myriad other things that make up children’s day-to-day experiences.     The Benefits of Being an Octopus by Ann Braden  Ahhh - this book! \xa0I just…. Okay - plot first. This is the story of Zoey - a seventh-grader whose primary goals in life are to keep her two young siblings quiet and out of the way of her mom’s boyfriend and his father, to scrounge up enough for them to eat, and to stay completely invisible at school. But all of those things become tricky when her teacher pushes her to join the Debate Club after school. This book is about rural poverty, the nuances of the gun debate, domestic vioience… but the way those threads play out are not at all what I had expected - and so much better. This is the novel I wish I had read as a young middle school teacher when I thought that giving an hour’s worth of homework that required colored pencils, a ruler, and internet access was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. \xa0 \xa0   Front Desk by Kelly Yang Another stand-out debut! And every time I see another starred review or another reader gush about this book, it just makes me heart a little more happy. Front Desk is about Mia Tang whose family - recent immigrants from China - wind up running a motel under less than ideal circumstances. Mia’s expectations of life in America - juicy burgers, a pet dog, a yard, and big pool - differ A LOT from her true life, which she keeps hidden from her classmates. Her life is tough. But once she starts to harness the power of her writing, Mia starts to realize that even the big injustices in life can start to change. Front Desk was another fall favorite of my students and a perfect book club book. \xa0And the last time I checked, it was offered through Scholastic for a great price.    The Wild Robot Escapes by Peter Brown  When a sequel comes out to a book that you adored - characters who have found a home in your heart - it’s with trepidation that you crack open that cover and start a new journey with them. Oh but thank you Peter Brown because you did not disappoint and in fact…. I may love this story even more than the first. It’s hard to say anything without giving away the first book if you haven’t read it yet. (And if that’s the case - get on that!) But I will say that this sequel has more action, more human interactions, and therefore - more personal connections that kids can latch onto. And it deals with some big moral and ethical questions! \xa0It’a a brilliant story with a touch of the Iron Giant, a sprinkle of The Odyssey, and a little dash of The Good Place. \xa0 \xa0   Ghost Boys by Jewell Parker Rhodes  This is the story of Jermone - a young black boy playing outside his home with a small toy gun. A black boy who gets shot and killed by a police officer in the first pages and whose presence haunts the rest of the pages - and whose story - along with the other boys - haunts me still. \xa0And I can see in my classroom the impact it makes on the young kids who read it. There are instantly caught by that first title page - “Dead” - and those first words - “How small I look. Laid out flat, my stomach touching the ground. My right knee bent and my brand-new Nikes stained with blood.” \xa0Jerome is the first ghost boy we meet, but later there will be Emmett Till and others who get to tell parts of their stories. This book was both completely immersive and has that quality of staying with you long after you’ve read it. And it’s a rare book that deals honestly with racism and police violence in a way that is age appropriate and clear. \xa0And so many people have said, “This is an important book.” It IS - but don’t get it just because of that - get it and read it with kids because it’s an excellent book.    Louisiana’s Way Home by Kate DiCamillo  This is, I believe, the first sequel that Kate DiCamillo has ever written. And if this is the quality of a DiCamillo sequel then I hope she writes a TON more - because this book ripped me apart and put me back together again. And I mean that in the best possible way! This book is the follow-up to Raymie Nightingale and focuses on Raymie’s quirky friend - Louisiana Elefante. Lousiana’s grandmother wakes her up in the middle of the night, piles her into the car, and is off to face her reckoning with the curse that has hung over their family’s head. Well, they end up in a Georgia Motel run by a cranky lady - where Louisiana has to take on more than anyone her age should have to. \xa0But also learns a lot about grace and the goodness of humankind as well. Raymie Nightingale was a book I liked pretty well, but nothing compared to this. It’s like this story sat in a rock tumbler until all the extra grit fell away and this sparkling gem emerged at the end. \xa0   Tight by Torrey Maldonado  This book was fast-paced, fresh, and had such a…. bite to it! \xa0It’s the story of 6th grader, Bryan, who loves comics, who loves drawing superheroes, and who loves his mother and a life of no drama. His dad brings enough of that into their life. Money in their family is… tight. So he worries about that and worries about being perceived as “soft” - not tough enough. But then his parents, sort of... set him up with a friend - this neighborhood kid named Mike. And at first, Bryan resists. He gets \xa0weird vibe from this kid. But then the boys bond over comics and Netflix shows and spend more and more time together. They’re tight. But that friendship turns toxic when Mike starts luring Bryan into skipping school, hopping the turnstiles in the subway...and worse. Tight is an exceptional books - raw and real. If you have kids who like Jason Reynold’s  Ghost and who liked the  Miles Morales Spiderman - this is the book for them! \xa0 Alright - those are my top 25 middle grades books of 2018. Now - I want to hear from YOU! What were your favorite reads of the last year and which ones should I make sure to read in the year ahead? Closing Alright, that wraps up our show this week!

The College was founded by a group of Congregationalist ministers, in large part to train future ministers. Drake discusses how Congregationalism impacted the development of the College\'s values and priorities. Although Grinnell is no longer affiliated with any religious institution, the legacy of its religious past endures, manifested in its tolerant environment and commitment to critical thought.\xa0 | All Things Grinnell is back for season 2 starting September 19. This season, we\'ll turn the lens inward to examine the people, places, and history that\xa0make up Grinnell- the town and the College. Highlights include George Drake \'56, former professor and president of the College, and Edith Renfrow Smith \'37, the first African-American woman to graduate from the College. Episodes will be released every other Thursday. | On this episode, the season finale, we say goodbye to Mike Latham, outgoing vice president of academic affairs and dean of the College, and talk about his time here in Grinnell and the importance of global education, before he becomes the president of Punahou High School in Hawai’i. Then we get global ourselves and talk to the language assistants from this past year, Mélanie Izrael, Maria Kustova, and Carla Wagner from Argentina, Russia, and Germany. We’ll also hear from Ania Chamberlin ‘19, who put on quite the art exhibit in Smith Gallery before graduating this spring. To round out the show we recap this year’s Summerfest event at the College. | Amy Tan, bestselling author of The Joy Luck Club and many other novels, aspiring nature journalist, and musical dominatrix for the literary band The Rock Bottom Remainders, gave the 2019 Commencement address. She sat down to talk about the values she shares with Grinnell and how she found her own path to a meaningful career after a traumatic childhood. She discusses how writing has influenced her life and helped her to understand who she is and connect with her family, as well as millions of readers around the world. | What happens after death? On this episode, we wrestle with that age-old question alongside Shakespeare and our very own John Garrison, associate professor of English. His recently published book, Shakespeare and the Afterlife, reckons with how the Bard grappled with some of the biggest questions of life and death during his time. Then, we turn to a seemingly more uplifting topic, reconciliation, with Jan Frans Van Dijkhuizen, associate professor of English literature at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Dijkhuizen, paints a bleak picture of the literary history of reconciliation, but his conclusions bear strongly on our present moment, especially the polarized political landscape that surrounds us. We also hear from our music correspondent, Gabriel Shubert ’20, who spoke with the drummer from Camp Cope, an Australian independent alternative punk band that performed in Grinnell on April 19. | On this podcast extra, we talk with Gina Caison,\xa0assistant professor of English at Georgia State University, about the famous podcast, S-Town, from the producers of Serial and This American Life. We discuss the tropes of southern literature present in S-Town, the relative shitty-ness of Woodstock, Alabama, and the complexity of characters in the show. Is S-Town just a recycled Faulknerian tragedy, or something deeper and more revealing? | We talk with scholars of Native studies about important issues facing Indigenous people throughout the United States, from the effect of oil booms on people and land to misrepresentation in literature. Sebastian Braun, director of the American Indian studies program at Iowa State University, discusses the Bakken oil boom and the impact it’s had on Native and non-Native people and the environment based on his time at the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. Gina Caison, assistant professor of English at Georgia State University, talks with Ben about the often overlooked role of indigenous people in the South and how focusing on that history impacts contemporary Native peoples. There’s also a short story on Noura Mint Seymali,\xa0the Mauritanian musical emissary who performed in Grinnell\'s Herrick Chapel on April 3. | We talk with Ella Williams ’18, who graduated from Grinnell in December with big plans for her music career. Since graduating, she went on tour in Europe with Adrianne Lenker, playing to sold out crowds all over the place as her musical persona, Squirrel Flower. By the time she got to Grinnell, Ella had already released her first album, but she chose not to study music academically at Grinnell. Williams continued to play music, though, and her songs show the influence of her time in Grinnell. On the show, Williams reflects on her music and time in Grinnell, which was coming to an end when we talked back in the fall. We also have a preview of Will Bennett and the Tells\' new album, "All Your Favorite Songs." Bennett \'13 grew up in Grinnell and his music focuses heavily on his rural Iowa roots and navigating life since Grinnell. | The history of racial violence in this country is long and ugly, and the trauma is ever-present for many people. But can art help us reckon with that history? On this episode, we talk to the people behind the current exhibitions on display at the College’s Faulconer Gallery.\xa0First, we discuss Reckoning with the Incident: John Wilson’s Studies for a Lynching Mural, which brings together the preparatory studies and sketches of John Wilson’s 1952 mural, The Incident, which depicts the scene of a racial terror lynching at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan while a young African-American family looks on. Then we take a look at Dread and Delight: Fairy Tales in an Anxious World, curated by Emily Stamey ‘01, who brought together the work of 19 artists whose work grapples with and reinvigorates early-modern European fairy tales. If you think you know fairy tales, think again. Finally, we end with a story about the alumni care packages sent to students before spring break.

These interactions are described by quantum field theory, a beautiful mathematical framework that combines quantum mechanics with Einstein’s theory of special relativity. In recent years, our understanding of quantum field theory has progressed significantly, allowing us to develop a new generation of accurate theoretical predictions for key LHC reactions. In this talk, I will highlight some of the ideas behind this progress, and illustrate how they are being applied to investigate the Higgs sector at the LHC. | We learn about the Higgs Boson and its interactions at the LHC by examining the debris produced by colliding protons head-on at unprecedented high energies.  However, we know from our theory of strong interactions - quantum chromodynamics (QCD) - that protons themselves are highly complex bound states of more fundamental 'quarks', held together by the force carriers of QCD, the 'gluons'. The question is then: how do we go from the collision of these complicated protons to a theoretical prediction that we can use to test the properties of the Higgs boson itself? In this talk, I will discuss what we know about the proton, and how we apply this to LHC collisions and our understanding of the Higgs sector. | Over the past two years, CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has started to directly probe a qualitatively new class of interactions, associated with the Higgs boson.  These interactions, called Yukawa interactions, are unlike any other interaction that we have probed at the quantum level before. In particular, unlike the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces, they have an interaction strength that does not come in multiples of some underlying unit charge. Yukawa interactions are believed to be of fundamental importance to the world as we know it, hypothesised, for example, to be responsible for the stability of the proton, and so the universe and life as we know it. | The coding theorem from algorithmic information theory (AIT) - which should be much more widely taught in Physics! - suggests that many processes in nature may be highly biased towards simple outputs. Here simple means highly compressible, or more formally, outputs with relatively lower Kolmogorov complexity. I will explore applications to biological evolution, where the coding theorem implies an exponential bias towards outcomes with higher symmetry, and to deep learning neural networks, where the coding theorem predicts an Occam's razor like bias that may explain why these highly overparamterised systems work so well. | Active systems, from cells and bacteria to flocks of birds, harvest chemical energy which they use to move and to control the complex processes needed for life. A goal of biophysicists is to construct new physical theories to understand these living systems, which operate far from equilibrium. Topological defects are key to the behaviour of certain dense active systems and, surprisingly, there is increasing evidence that they may play a role in the biological functioning of bacterial and epithelial cells. | Ian Shipsey delivers the welcome speech for the Saturday Mornings of Theoretical Physics. | Siddharth Parameswaran, Associate Professor, Physics Department. The usual picture of entropy in statistical mechanics is that it quantifies our degree of ignorance about a system. Recent advances in cooling and trapping atoms allow the preparation of quantum systems with many interacting particles isolated from any external environment. Textbook discussions of entropy — that invoke the presence of a “large” environment that brings the system to thermal equilibrium at a fixed temperature --- cannot apply to such systems. Sid Parameswaran will explain how “entropy” of subsystems of such isolated quantum systems arises from quantum entanglement between different parts of the system, and how their approach to thermal equilibrium is best described as the `scrambling’ of quantum information as it is transferred to non-local degrees of freedom. | John Chalker, Head of Theoretical Physics, gives a talk on entropy. Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics give us two alternative ways of thinking about entropy: in terms of heat flow, or in terms of the number of micro-states available to a system. John Chalker will describe a physical setting to illustrate each of these. By applying thermodynamics in a realm far beyond its origins, we can use the notion of an ideal heat engine to find the temperature of a black hole. And by applying combinatorial mathematics to hydrogen bonding, we can find the entropy of ice. | Alexander Schekochihin, Professor of Theoretical Physics, gives a talk on entropy. When dealing with physical systems that contain many degrees of freedom, a researcher's most consequential realisation is of the enormous amount of detailed information about them that she does not have, and has no hope of obtaining. It turns out that this vast ignorance is not a curse but a blessing: by admitting ignorance and constructing a systematic way of making fair predictions about the system that rely only on the information that one has and on nothing else, one can get surprisingly far in describing the natural world. In an approach anticipated by Boltzmann and Gibbs and given mathematical foundation by Shannon, entropy emerges as a mathematical measure of our uncertainty about large systems and, paradoxically, a way to describe their likely behaviour—and even, some argue, the ultimate fate of the Universe. Alex Schekochihin will admit ignorance and attempt to impart some knowledge. | This talk reviews the developments in quantum information processing.", 'chan_desc': 'Members of the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics host a morning of Theoretical Physics roughly three times a year on a Saturday morning.

But, avoiding or defending yourself against objections will actually make things worse and bring your new initiative to a halt. So how do you deal with objections and keep them from killing your new initiative before it even has a chance to start? On today\'s episode, find out the three critical steps you need to take to protect your new initiative from the naysayers and actually flip every objection on its head. By the time you\'re finished listening, you\'ll know exactly how to handle any objection #LikeABuilder. | Have you ever introduced a new initiative to your staff only to have it fall flat? Or worse, have you ever tried to get your teachers excited about a new program and met push-back and resistance before you could even get the project started? Getting people truly excited and invested in a new initiative is not as simply as making a rousing speech and hosting splashy big launch with banners, balloons, and a band. There are actually 3 specific things you must do if you want to get teachers genuinely excited and invested in any new initiative. On today\'s episode, learn what those three things are, and how you can use them to get real buy in from your teachers and\xa0 get everyone excited to get started! | Initiative fatigue is real and it’s wearing out your staff. It starts when we feel pain, and we look for a solution -- ANY solution -- to alleviate our pain. Only, when it doesn’t work, we grab another one, and another one, and another one. The problem isn’t that we need a better solution, the problem is that we need a better understanding of the problem. So, on today’s show, we’re going to talk about how Builders avoid initiative fatigue and stay focused on what matters most. Plus, we’ll discover how to “micro-slice” your school so that you can quickly get to the root cause of whatever challenge you’re facing and come up with a simple, elegant solution to solve it once and for all. #LikeABuilder. | Sometimes when you are working to help teachers improve, it can feel like for every step you take forward, you take two steps back. You try to give teachers good feedback, you provide great professional development and coaching, but sometimes, teachers still don’t improve. When teachers aren’t performing, leaders resort to writing the teacher up, putting the teacher on a performance plan, or proving an avalanche of feedback and support. However, Builder’s know that those tools don’t work. In fact, Builders know that there are only four things you can do to actually impact teacher behavior and performance. I call these four things, the Four Disciplines of Buildership. Chances are, you’re probably already practicing some or all of these four disciplines already, but on today’s episode, you’ll discover a simple tweak you can make that will exponentially magnify your effectiveness. Tune in to this episode find out how to multiply your effectiveness with teachers #LikeABuilder. |   Most schools already have core values, but there’s a really good reason why those core values aren’t alive and driving your school culture -- Nobody truly owns them. If you really want your core values to be non-negotiable in your school and if you really want teachers to fully embrace them, there’s one thing you need to do: You’re going to have to give up some control.\xa0  Today, find out how to develop school core values that your teachers can truly own (without drama or chaos). You’ll also discover how to handle the inevitable push-back you’ll face and how to neutralize it so that by the time you’re done, EVERY teacher in your building will support your school core values and live by them.

Most school mission statements are pretty useless. Sure, we write them, post them on our website, and put them in our strategic planning binders, but in reality, they read more like a game of “School Jargon Bingo,” than a compelling reason for our work each day. And that’s a shame really, because your mission statement, when built the right way, will not only inspire and unite your staff, but it will help everyone be more accountable and make better decisions (even when you’re not checking on them). So, on today’s episode, you’re going to discover how to use a counter-intuitive process that cuts through the nonsense and gets to the truth about your school. That way you can build a mission statement WITH your staff that gets them excited, focused, and committed to your vision. Listen in to find out how you build a mission statement #LikeABuilder. | Why are we so afraid to set an ambitious vision for our schools? Whenever I am working with school administrators about setting ambitious visions for their schools-- the kind of vision that includes 100% of their students -- I always meet resistance. Usually, that resistance takes 3 forms: Some say, "I can\'t say all my students because there\'s no way every student can reach that goal." Others say, "What if I don\'t reach the goal?" And still others worry that they won\'t be able to reach that goal with the teachers and resources (or district) they currently have. Today, we\'re going to settle those fears once and for all #LikeABuilder.\xa0 | Welcome to season 4 of the School Leadership Reimagined Podcast. This season, we’re going back to the basics and exploring some of the fundamental tenets of Buildership. On today’s episode, you’ll discover the #1 mistake all leaders make. If you’ve ever felt like a teacher just wasn’t getting it no matter how hard you tried to help him or her, you’ve made this mistake. Or, if you’ve ever felt frustrated because not matter how much you tried to motivate a teacher, that teacher still wouldn’t move, then you’ve made this mistake. In fact, this mistake is really the source of a MOST of frustration that leaders feel, especially when you are trying to move your school forward. To tune in today to discover what this mistake is, and the simple step you can take to save yourself a LOT of frustration by avoiding it entirely this school year. #LikeABuilder. | When you hear that your vision should include 100% of your students, do you cringe a little inside? I mean, sure, we all know that our work should benefit ALL children, but reality says that not EVERY child will be successful. So, should you cast a vision that says 100% of our students will...? A year ago, Kurt was asking himself the very same question. But, he took the leap and cast a 100% vision _for his ENTIRE school district_! In this bonus episode, find out how Kurt got his entire school district to embrace a bold, 100% vision for their students. Plus, hear some of the challenges he faced and how they were able to overcome them to transform the culture of their school district. | It’s here! Our annual summer reading list.

Robert was set on becoming a watchmaker. He had a job as a clerk in a law office for a short time where he spent most of his time tinkering with mechanical objects in the office than writing and copying. He was sent back to his father where he became an apprentice watchmaker. He never stopped making clocks and is credited with the invention of The Mystery Clock.In the 1820’s he saved his money to purchase a 2 column set of books, Treatise on Clockmaking, written by\xa0Ferdinand Berthoud. In a twist of fate upon returning home he discovered\xa0Not the books he had saved for but a 2 volume set on magic called\xa0Scientific Amusements.The books had a fault. They explained the principle behind the trick but not how to perform the trick. Without the benefit of our modern magic, the internet. Robert went to take lessons from a local fair and party magician named, Maous from Blois (side note Maous from Blois was a foot doctor when not performing at parties).\xa0Jean learned sleight of hand and dexterity but the most important lesson he learned was repetition and discipline. I have researched many magicians and a constant theme is they are never without their trade. If they are a card magician you will never see them without a deck that they are working with.\xa0Jean also learned that it is crucial to still make money even while pursuing one’s passions. He opened a watchmakers shop and performed in his spare time.Jean met and married Josephe Cicle Houdin. He took her last name and hyphenated his Robert- Houdin in 1830. They moved to Paris where Jean worked in his father in laws watchmaking shop and he found a group of magicians at the shop Rue Richelieu.He married his love of mechanisms with an interest in automatons creating a singing bird, a dancer on a tightrope, and an automaton that wrote and drew. This was later sold to P.T. Barnum.Using his knowledge of engineering he created amazing props and made stories out of magic creating character plot tension and resolution in his acts.His props were nothing short of engineering marvels creating illusions that were not only beautiful but told stories from the growing an orange tree in a pot to the levitation of his son.His acts and his ability to create a narrative play from magic changed the way magic was performed to this day. Magic had become high entertainment and not a way for a magician to claim special powers. Magic was to awe and delight. It was an age of Darwin and reason and Houdin’s magic played into science and engineering of the age, not the superstition.\xa0To further prove this point he did not dress as magicians had before. No long robes embroidered with strange symbols. He dressed as the members of his audience would have done. Coattails, top hat, and gloves\xa0His first show was in his estimation a disaster. On July 3, 1845 he performed the “Soirees Fantastiques.”On the verge of a nervous breakdown he told a friend of his failure. His friend agreed with him. It was silly and ridiculous. This harshness gave Jean the kick up the backside he needed to try again.Jean had tremendous success both as an inventor of new and amazing illusions and by selling his magic tricks to other magicians. His style of having tricks build upon tricks to create a story is still used to this day. His influence on other magicians of his time and directly after can not be overstated. The most famous being Houdini who in 1891 took on the last name.In an interesting side not after he retired at 48 he was called upon by Napoleon the third to use his magic to pacify a tribe in Algeria.If you have ever seen a movie called Hugo you might have heard a few things that make you think of the movie. Here is why. In 1888 after his death, his widow sold his theatre to Georges Melies. A magician himself, though history mostly remembers him for his contributions to movie making and pioneering stop motion effects.Resourceshttps://esoterx.com/2014/09/16/the-algerian-war-of-the-wizards-jean-eugene-robert-houdin-vs-the-marabouts/https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1926-03132-001http://www.ptbarnum.org/humbugs.htmlMagic Is Dead Ian FrischHiding the Elephant | visit www.owlandtwine.com to sign up for our newsletter and see the images discussed in the podcast.A for kids history podcast in 10 minutes. This week the emperor of America, Edward Norton. Hailed by the San Francisco Chronicle to the New York Times. Edward Norton was a visionary of the gold rush who made decrees from equal rights to building the Bay Bridge. Lauded as the only emperor to shed no blood.Emperor Norton the King of AmericaDid you know America had a king? This is one of my favorite stories in history and it happened in San Francisco California in the late 1880’s. The reason this is one of my favorite tales from history is that usually when someone decides they are going to grab for power they are usually doing it for POWER. There is a fight of varying degrees of awful for everyone involved. This is not that story. Emperor Norton was a visionary and you will see his vision for this country and the state of California was ahead of its’ time. This is a story of a fortune lost, some very good ideas, a two VERY good dogs, and a dear friend named Mark TwainJoshua Norton was born in 1818 or 1819 in Britain migrating to San Francisco for the gold rush in 1849. He invested heavily in real estate growing a $40,000 investment into a quarter of a million dollars. Due to a bad deal in rice he became bankrupted and disappeared for a small while.When he came back he came bak in a big way. On September 17, 1859, a most unusual decree appeared in the San Francisco Bulletin newspaper. In grandiloquent fashion, the message stated, “At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens…I, Joshua Norton…declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these United States.” It went on to command representatives from all the states to convene in the Bay Area, “to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring.” The edict was signed, “NORTON I, Emperor of the United States.”Mr. Norton was usually dressed in an epaulette-adorned Navy coat, an ostrich feather-plumed hat and occasionally carrying a military saber, the delightfully eccentric “Emperor Norton I”He lived by the kindest of restaurants that would take the currency he made. Many of the citizens would bow and tourists would collect his currency as a keepsake.\xa0There were Emperor Norton dolls. Theatre owners would save him a seat for opening nights. San Francisco’s directory listed his occupation as Emperor.The San Francisco newspapers knew they had found gold and would print each of the emperor’s proclamations with great fanfare. . When an overzealous police officer once dared to arrest the Emperor on charges of vagrancy, the city’s newspapers responded with outrage. One writer defended him as a local institution, arguing, “since he has worn the Imperial purple [he] has shed no blood, robbed nobody, and despoiled the country of no one, which is more than can be said for his fellows in that line.” The Emperor was quickly released, and from then on, the city’s lawmen saluted whenever they encountered him on the street.In October 1859, declared, “fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice…in consequence of which, we do hereby abolish Congress.”"He\'s talking about how African-Americans should have the right to attend public schools, ride public streetcars. How the Chinese should be able to have their testimony heard in court," Lumea says. Norton also argued for the rights of Native Americans and against political corruption. (KQED)In the 1870’s he asked for funds to build a bridge between San Francisco and Oakland. The Bay Bridge was built in 1936.During Edward Norton’s reign Mark Twain worked as a journalist for the San Francisco papers. Mr. Twain was inspired by the emperor modeling the “king” in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn after him.The emperor was said to spend his days in the library, playing chess, at religious services , or going for walks with the cities most famous dogs: Bummer and Lazarus. If you hav not yet heard I Can’t Believe That Happened episode on Bummer and Lazarus go to our show notes and click on the link.When Emperor Norton dies in 1880 he was hailed as far as The New York Times as The great emperor of America for more then 20 years. The headline of his obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle read, "Le roi est mort." More than 10,000 people attended his funeral.Resourceshttps://www.history.com/news/the-strange-case-of-emperor-norton-i-of-the-united-statesEmperor Norton’s

you coming back to the podcast it was a very long and unexpected but I try to have some exciting news I took the time because I was reading a book and I could really use your help on this it\'s at I will and Twine.com that\'s the website and I cannot live in some of the book it\'s also a game and I need as many people as possible to take a look at play the game and tell me what you like and don\'t like this is completely free if you go to the website www.owltwine.com it\'s right at the front if he just signed up with your email completely free I really just need to help with a lot of people try this out OK so on to the podcast I i am really excited I get to introduce you to one of my favorite magicians and women in history Adelaide Herman so Adelaide was born in london 1853 to call a fairly eccentric family she grew pretty much in the family museum which I i think if you kind of a cool thing ever I would love to live in our group and the museum she really had aspirations of becoming a dancer and she went about it and some of the stuff meeting with them ever heard usually you think oh I won\'t be a dancer I\'m just gonna have to dance classes treats and aerialist that\'s like those amazing people in circuses that are up at the big tough and doing also it\'s a crazy things and that the five things in the air and then she rode in and going to miss pronounce this so please forgive me of the loss of goodness we\'re going to just Collett a bicycle if you look this up online you\'ll see that in the late 1800s there were these things are very close so we can make bicycles but they\'re a little bit more of a steam punk he does I need a very interesting look and I highly recommend going to Google taking a look so she can just write this shit kind of are used it as a way to do tricks is just incredible with how she just always had to perform she is amazing the skills become very important because she becomes a very important magician and before she becomes very important addition please forgive the snorting and snoring in the background of my pug decided she needed to be with me all day today so I\'m never gonna be able to edit out that sound and I\'m just picture a very cute little pug and the snoring starting sounds much cuter so all of his physicality is really important because she uses as the magicians assistant and then as one of the most important magicians in her own acts herself Adelaide finally got her dream to be a dancer and she moved to New York to be a part of a dance trip this is where is she needs Alexander Herman now he is considered a pretty important and fairly famous magician along with his brother and they had to separate thanks for going on when the United States and when you\'re off and switch he Alexander fell head over heels for Adelaide and it\'s really not hard to imagine why if you see her I\'ll have some pictures up on the show now so if you head over to to the website and take a look I\'ll have some pictures up of her she was it\'s not that she was beautiful if I think she\'s beautiful but there\'s just things so alive about her and she was so creative and so she\'s just so smart and yeah anyway sorry I digress but it\'s she\'s just incredibly lively DM they together created but we think of as the magician luck so if you\'re going to kind i like close your eyes and get a stock image of a magician in your head you kind of think the tall thin text Sido very serious long top man and that is what Alexander Herman like play now this is where I get a little squishy and details and I\'m sorry it\'s it\'s really hard to explain because when you think of the Magicians Assistant you can think of the person is like oh look I\'m pretty over here so you don\'t see the transitions over there and that was what she\'s doing and she\'s incredibly skilled she was coming up with a lot of the ask yourself that her husband performed and yes I\'m sorry to skip a big part that they got married congratulations to them both in 1875 and it was such a big wedding that even the mayor of New York came I brought a lot of incredible artistic set ideas costuming and a sense of allusion to their act which is very different than the actress already performing they became incredibly famous and wealthy is an a lot of money KMan the problem is a lot of money went out more money would help them be amazing about summer coming in and it became a big grandpa when Alexander died unexpectedly she was left with tremendous stats and a show and as a woman in the routine 1800s I\'m if you can\'t be? If she could continue to show on her own and Alexander\'s nephew stepped in and he said that you do the show with her they tried to but it did not go well just spoiler if it did not go well at all and they separated and seem like there\'s a lot of blood and that person leave at 11 stops not important except to say that she thought she needed to try will more time with another person to make this famous she took some time off and in 1899 she\'s has a solo and it is incredibly successful it is John dropping the amazing and she becomes be "on "queen of magic and the first really successful female magician so if the switch is at 46 and she comes on a world tour and she\'s not just famous for her magic and she\'s also famous as a fashion icon and I\'m going to just drop in pictures of her costume design I i am a sucker for custom design and what she wore it really start him since a lot of it was going on at the time they said the word select famous female magician and Adelaide Herman would be really mad at me about that she was very clear that I am she said over and never again I should not be content until I\'m recognized by the public as a leader in my profession and entirely irrespective of the question of sex so for the breakdown of that sentence if you are misunderstanding face of the words there is that she saying I just want to be none of the fast I do not want to be known as the best woman I don\'t even want my gender to be a part of the discussion I just wanna be known as the best illusionist magician ever Natalie played with a lot of our types like types of women and stories in her box and one for most famous ask was the Phantom bride and It! have these themes of loss and marriage and you could probably imagine that this is fairly personal to her after having lost her husband she would couldn\'t get hypnotized the bride the assistant and the body of the bride would raise up and ship has a Hulu can you be kind of thing over at the body to so there is no alarm wires or anything and she did that act if you times in a few different ways and she did the which illusion where she stumbled on the stage just as an old woman and I am should try to reach fire burning in the darkness it was your ride to the fire should diving to the freight flames and see it returned as a mean go sleep at all of this sounds like kind of like hokey but if you think about it during this time of those late 1800s early 1900s before television this to be a shocking and really needing to see the she performed all of these acts which was incredibly physical and she went on these massive world tours of shit who have until her 70s and 1926 there\'s a huge warehouse fire and that just destroyed everything she had all the props and when you are a magician your props are everything they are the illusions that they are creating are created by the props and these are incredibly expensive things to buy or have felt and everything was gone so you might notice that a lot of the times and I\'m talking about a specific person in this podcast I usually choose them because they read they they don\'t let anything stop them and I admire that quality tremendously she\'s in her 70s she loses everything again for the second time in her life and she rebounds she she starts a new show and it\'s called magic Grace and music and it it it pretty well of me you could say the national of other artists your book shows her in final performing years she was she was really an amazing woman and she did pass away in February 1932 and still you know if you can if your imaginary Jill hear about her but it\'s important to remember I miss people know who Houdini is and was and they had very similar interests in and how they perform their magic of them and they were just as famous as each other so I just wanted to bring Adelaide Herman back out from the shadow so you were and please take a look at the senates I\'ll try to link as much as I can see you can see certain what I\'m talking about and thank you so much for being so patient with me while I was writing and not posting these weekly I will try so hard to be better at posting these I\'ll try harder not to see him so much so the kind of thing y\'all can do is side from going on signing up for reading Blackwater or Manor and Playing Blackwater Manor is to head over to Apple podcast leave us some stars and some reviews this is oh kind of a project of fun for me I\'m just really excited history and I hope you guys enjoy this as well thank you so much I hope you will tune in next week and I can you know we don\'t every case at all for this podcast this is just something I do because I love history and resend it I love you for listening now and all I can think is that must be because you guys are getting some value from it and you\'re enjoying it and you\'re sharing it so if you could keep doing that that is just that means so much to me that do you enjoy this enough to share with friends and family are next month is going to be the Halloween month a.k.a. my favorite holiday ever so I can recovery so.

This was where he learned the skills he would later use to make his daring escape and when he met his wife Hannah Smalls. At this time Union ships blockaded the South\'s harbors and Robert Smalls began to plan his and his young family’s escape.May 13, 1862 Robert Smalls and a group of fellow slaves made their way to the harbor at dawn,\xa0and stole an ammunitions ship that Smalls had been conscripted to work on by the Confederacy called the Planter and picked up their family members at predetermined ports. Smalls took on the role of Captain responding with proper signals at 4 Confederate check points including Fort Sumpter. Once they were in Union waters Smalls hoisted the white flag and surrendered to the Union Fleet. Keep in mind Smalls did this at the middle of the civil war. A slave who stole a ship in heavily armed confederate waters and delivered 9 men , 5 women , and 3 children to freedom.\xa0Congress gave Smalls $1,500 and he went on a speaking tour to recount his story and recruit freed blacks to serve in the Union army.\xa0For the rest of the war Smalls sailed the Planter which the Union refurbished into troop transport. Smalls sailed for the Union where his knowledge of the South Carolina Seas Islands was invaluable for 17 of his military engagements.\xa0Robert Smalls was a large factor in encouraging Lincoln to allow free black men to serve in the Union.\xa0During the war Smalls turned his attention to politics. In 1864 he joined the free black delegates. In the same year Smalls was thrown off a street car in Philadelphia. Due to his Celebrity Smalls was able to lead a successful boycott of thePhiladelphia public transportation system. thanks to Smalls the city started integration in 1867-At the end of the war Smalls had become successful as a Brigadier General. Smalls bought his former owner\'s home in South Carolina giving the impoverished family a generous price for the home. Smalls spent his time after the war improving on his education and opening a store and a school for black children.Smalls ever started a newspaper called the Beaufort Southern Standard.In 1868 Smalls ran for and won his term in the house of representatives. From 1870-1874 Robert Smalls served as a US. Senator.In 1874 Mr. Smalls won a seat in Congress. His political career was not easy. In 1877 he was arrested and charged with taking a bribe. He only spent 3 days in jail but the experience defocused him from his political goals, especially with the political rise of thered shirts. In 1879 Smalls was officially pardoned by the governor.Sources: Word of advice: This is to the best of my abilities and has been reviewed for information meaning read first before letting children read links.\xa0\xa0\xa0Which Slave Sailed Himself to Freedom PBS By Henry Louis Gates Jrhttps://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/which-slave-sailed-himself-to-freedom/https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/21764 https://www.biography.com/people/robert-smalls-9486288“ | This week we are are going back to the 1860’s to learn all about two dogs who ruled the city: Bummer and Lazarus. They were friends with the King of America (Emperor Norton) and with Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain). The city fell head over tails for these pups and they could do no wrong in the populations of San Francisco’s eyes.One day outside of Martin’s Saloon a giant black and white Newfoundland appeared and quickly made himself very useful by tackling the saloons rat problem. The patrons gave this giant the name “Bummer” for his very dog like trait of bumming snacks off of anyone with food on their plate. They called him a “professional lunch eater”. A job both of my dogs aspire to.Bummer was his own dog and patrolled San Francisco. One day while out on his usual wandering he came across two dogs in a fight. Bummer saved the day chasing away the dog who started the fight and tended to the other who was badly hurt. Bummer did not leave his new friend keeping him warm at night and bringing him scraps of food. Soon the dog made a full recovery earning his new name, “Lazarus’.The dogs became a statewide sensation with everyone fascinated by their daily tales. This was right in the middle of the civil war and people were happy to have a few moments of happy with all of the frightening news. A reporter was a regular at Martin’s Saloon and began to publish Bummer and Lazarus’ antics. The best dog friends were happy to oblige their fans with their antics in many of the California newspapers. The papers portrayed the dogs as people with Bummer portrayed in the articles as a gentleman who was down on his luck. Lazarus however was cast as a sly yet not bright\xa0pup. Adding to their fame the cartoonist Edward Jump would draw the dogs in the company of Emperor Norton, the king of the United States (yes, we are VERY much going to do an episode on Emperor Norton).The two friends even helped the SF police department with their jobs by helping capture a man the police were chasing, tripping the man enabling the police officer to make an arrest. They were even credited with stopping a runaway horse.In 1862 San Francisco paid $2,000 for a fountain in Portsmouth Square ($49,749.11 in todays money according to the CPI inflation calculator). Though the puppy partners were not the only ones causing problems for this expensive and lovely fountain they were the only ones who insisted on using it as a bathtub everyday.In 1862 trouble came and Lazarus was picked up by a new dog catcher who was not familiar with the celebrity of the friends. A mob of San Franciscans took to the street demanding the release of Lazarus. Within a day the city decided that Lazarus and Bummer should never be so inconvenienced again. A special rule was passed making Bummer and Lazarus officially San Francisco so they would never be picked up by the dog catcher again.Sources *these sources are how I do my research.

Barnum bought Scudder\'s American Museum which began in 1781 and held general curiosities like: stuffed snakes, bison, and a forest scenes. If you listened to my episode on PT. Barnum you know he saw this as a jumping off point. He was also a bit sneak about how he went about getting the museum. Barnum arranged to become the manager of a competing museum called Peale’s Museum under the condition that Peale’s buys Scudder’s. He then went to Scudder’s on his own and negotiated if the deal with Peale’s museum fell through that Scudder’s would sell the museum to Barnum directly. Nice, no. But history does not exist to make us comfortable but to learn from.\xa0The first thing he did to the 5 story building was to change The exterior into a lime lit advertisement (a 5 Story tall advertisement).\xa0*Exhibits at Barnum’s American Museum*The museum opened on January 1, 1842 as a combination zoo, museum, lecture hall, wax museum, theatre, and freak show. If you want to get a small idea of what this was think The World’s Fair in one five story building. Thanks to existing playbills and advertisements here is an incomplete list of the attractions of Barnum’s American Museum\xa0•\xa0then were scientific instruments\xa0\xa0•\xa0Exotic Fossils\xa0•\xa0Relics of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812\xa0•\xa0Precious stones and coins\xa0•\xa0Modern appliances\xa0\xa0•\xa0Flea circus\xa0\xa0•\xa0Loom powered by dogs\xa0\xa0•\xa0Watch glass blowers\xa0\xa0•\xa0Fortune Tellers\xa0•\xa0Rifle range\xa0\xa0*Pretty baby contests\xa0\xa0•\xa0Ned the Learned Seal\xa0•\xa0Feejee Mermaid\xa0video tried to be a little scary if you click the link but it is a really good history. (This was a plan. If Barnum put the implausible in his museum it lead people to question if any of his exhibits were real leading to more people coming to the museum to check it out and decide for themselves. P.T. Barnum uses this tactic MANY times in his various careers from museum to politician to the circus.)\xa0*Cheng and Eng the Siamese Twins\xa0•\xa0A live Beluga whale in an Aquarium\xa0\xa0•\xa0Giants\xa0•\xa0Native Americans who performer tradition songs and dances\xa0\xa0•\xa0Grizzly Adams trained bears.\xa0•\xa0The bearded Lady,Josephine Clofullia, whose bears grew in when she was 8 years old\xa0•\xa0Adaptations of the bible and Uncle Tom’s Cabin\xa0\xa0•\xa0General Tom Thumb\xa0The Natural History part of the museum housed:\xa0•\xa0taxidermy\xa0•\xa0historical paintings•\xa0taxidermy (stuffing dead exotic animals, keep in mind zoos were not in every city this might be the only way to see a lion or elephant)•\xa0wax figures\xa0•\xa0and in the theatre Shakespeare and lectures.One of my favorite stories of the museum was that when Barnum realized people lingered too long at exhibits (making it hard to keep new people coming through) he put up signs saying “This Way To The Egress”. People thinking “egress” was a new and exciting exhibit quickly followed the signs only to find out “egress” was another word for exit.\xa0\xa0At the height of its popularity Barnum\'s American Museum had 15,000 visitors a day paying 25 cents a ticket. That is 15,000 people a day when the population of the United States was under 32 million. Even the Prince of Wales took time from his schedule to visit.*What Happened to Barnum’s American Museum*If you have been looking at the dates you might just notice in the dates that all of this takes place during a very tumultuous time in the United States, The Civil War. In November 1844 The war came to Barnum, who was a public abolitionist, when the Confederate Army of Manhattan tried but failed to burn down the museum. As a fan of history and museums I wish I could say much was learned about fire safety in the year but unfortunately The museum burned down in July 13,1865. Barnum tried again opening Barnum\'s New Museum September 6, 1865 but that also burned March 3, 1868.Never to be deterred Barnum used the last tragedy to step into politics and the circus industry.I say a million times history does not exist to make us comfortable. There is a lot about P.T.Barnum and his life that is not comfortable and does not sounds good when we look at it from our time in history. So why would I talk about him? I just had a conversation with my son about this. There are people in history who have imaginations so big they reshape our reality and what is possible. PT. Barnum is on of those people.Who from history can you think of who’s ideas reshaped our world?What GIANT idea do you have that you think could make a big change in the world as we know it?Comment below and I will read my favorites in the next episode.Thank you so much to listening to I Can’t Believe That Happened a history podcast for kids.

We look back over where we\'ve been the lasteleven weeks, and bring together all of the main themes of this courseon Life in the Universe.  Recorded live on 2009 Dec 4 in Room 1005 SmithLaboratory on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | How will life, the Universe, and everything end?  This lecture looks atthe evolution of our expanding Universe to project the prospects forlife into the distant cosmological future.  Recent observations showthat we live in an infinite, accelerating universe.  I will trace theevolution of the universe from the current age of stars into the future.The final state of the Universe will be cold, dark, and disordered, andultimately inhospitable to life as we understand it or perhaps canimagine it.  Recorded live on 2009 Dec 3 in Room 1005 Smith Laboratoryon the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | What is the future of life on Earth and in our Solar System?  The Sun isthe source of energy for life on the Earth, but it will not shineforever.  This lecture looks at the impact of the various stages of theevolution of the Sun on the habitability of the Solar System, withparticular emphasis on the continued habitability of the Earth.  I willrefer to state-of-the-art computer models of the Sun to get isproperties at various stages in its past and future life.  NOTE: Due toa recorder malfunction this lecture was re-recorded later in the day on2009 Dec 2, rather than being live from the class room in SmithLaboratory.  As such, it is about 10 minutes longer than usual (mypacing is off when not in front of class). | What does extraterrestrial life look like?  This lecture explorescurrent thinking about what extraterrestrial life might be like not byguessing their appearances, but instead applying lessons learned fromour growing understanding of how evolution and biochemistry work onEarth.  I will discuss Universal versus Parochial characteristics,Convergent Evolution, Radical Diversity, and other ideas fromevolutionary biology that might inform how life might emerge on otherworlds.  We will then look at alternatives to carbon biochemistry,specifically the possibility of silicon-based life, and alternatives toliquid water as a solvent medium for biochemistry, specifically thepossible role of Ammonia.  Finally I will give one example of a highlyspeculative idea about life without chemistry.  In the end, the outcomeof such studies may not be to tell us much about extraterrestrials as tohelp focus questions on how we ourselves arose.  Recorded live on 2009Dec 1 in Room 1005 Smith Laboratory on the Columbus campus of The OhioState University. | So, Where is Everybody?  Interstellar colonization, in principle, is anexponential growth process that would fill the galaxy in a few millionyears even with a very modest star flight capability.  This is a smallfraction of the lifetime of the Milky Way Galaxy, so the Galaxy shouldbe teaming with life.  But, we so far have no compelling evidence ofextraterrestrial visitations, alien artifacts, or any other evidencesthat the Galaxy is populated.  Physicist and Nobel Laureate EnricoFermi\'s apparent paradox and some of the proposed resolutions are thetopic of this lecture.  I will review the Fermi Paradox and describe themost common possible resolutions.  The Fermi Paradox is useful inhelping to frame the question of extraterrestrial life, even if we sofar have no answers.  At the end I only touch on the Rare EarthHypothesis, but this is a very nuanced question which requires a wholeother lecture to explore that I have not had time to fully prepare forduring this busy quarter.  Recorded live on 2009 Nov 30 in Room 1005Smith Laboratory on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | If we ever detect life elsewhere, how will we go visit?  This lectureconsiders the challenges of interstellar travel and colonization.  Theproblem is one of basic physics (the enormous energy requirements ofstar flight) coupled with the vast, irreducible distances between thestars.  I will describe various starship concepts that use reasonableextrapolations of current technologies (nuclear propulsion and solarsails), ignoring for our discussions science-fiction exotica likefaster-than-light drives and wormholes.  My interest is in thescientific aspects of the problem, not an exploration of speculativefiction. I then turn to interstellar colonization, and how evena relatively modest star-flight capability might allow a determinedcivilization to colonize the entire galaxy very rapidly.  This hasimplications for how we might interpret the results of Drake Equationtype arguments about the frequency of intelligent life in the Galaxy,and leads to the Fermi Paradox that will be the topic of the nextlecture.  Recorded live on 2009 Nov 25 in Room 1005 Smith Laboratory onthe Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | Is anybody out there?  This lecture reviews the ideas behind SETI, theSearch for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, an effort to find otherintelligent communicating civilizations by tuning in on their radio orother electromagnetic communications.  I will discuss the basicapproaches being taken by various SETI efforts, and what we expect tofind.  In addition to listening, we have also been broadcasting,intentionally or otherwise, messages into space, and we have sentphysical artifacts with descriptions of our home on robotic spacecraftheaded out of our solar system into interstellar space.  Recorded liveon 2009 Nov 24 in Room 1005 Smith Laboratory on the Columbus campus ofThe Ohio State University. | How many intelligent, communicating civilizations live in our Galaxy?We have no idea.  One way to approach the question and come up withquasi-quantitative estimates is the Drake Equation, first introduced byradio astronomy Frank Drake in the 1960s.  I will use the Drake equationas an illustration of the issues related to the question ofextraterrestrial intelligence, and to set the stage for future lectureson the likelihood of finding other intelligences in our Universe.Recorded live on 2009 Nov 23 in Room 1005 Smith Laboratory on theColumbus campus of The Ohio State University. | Are there other Earths out there?  Do they have life on them?  Thislecture looks at the search for ExoEarths - Earth-sized planets in thehabitable zones of their parent stars, and what we might learn frommeasuring them.  The ultimate goal of all planet searches is to findother Earth\'s, what the late Carl Sagan so poetically calledthe "pale blue dot" as seen from the depths of space.  This lecture discusses what we might learn about such planets from studies of our own Earth, spectroscopic biomarkers that might reveal life, and variability studies that might give us insight into surface features (continents and oceans) and weather (clouds and even climate).  Recorded live on 2009 Nov 19 in Room 1005 Smith Laboratory on the Columbus campus of The Ohio State University. | What are the properties of the 400+ exoplanets we have discovered sofar?  This lecture reviews the properties of exoplanets, and finds acouple of surprises: Jupiter-mass planets orbiting close to their parentstars, and Jupiter-mass planets in very elliptical orbits.  Both seem torequire some mechanism for migration: strong gravitational interactionswith either the protoplanetary disk or other giant planets to cause theplanets to move inward from their birth places beyond the "Ice Line".We will then briefly discuss why we are seeing systems very differentfrom our own, mostly we think a selection effect due to our searchmethods to date.  Microlensing, however, is more sensitive to systemslike ours, and is starting to find them.  Earths, however, remainelusive so far, but the hunt is on.

Many of our listeners may know him from his articles in the Chronicle of Higher Ed or his popular Twitter feed where he writes about teaching, dogs, race, politics, and seemingly whatever else is on his mind. In this episode we dig deep on Kevin’s personal teaching journey and learn how he came to be the teacher he is today and what kind of teacher he aspires to be in the future. | The evidence is clear that when students work actively in the classroom, they learn more. It's also true that most of the classrooms we teach in were designed for a professor to lecture to a group of students that sit passively and take notes. What do classrooms designed for active learning look like? Do students learn more when we teach in active learning classrooms? And what other impacts might teaching in active learning classrooms have on students and instructors? Robert Talbert, a math professor and education researcher at Grand Valley State University, recently took a deep dive into the literature on these questions, and in this episode he shares what he's learned. | Our guest today, Doug Robertson, is one of the best teachers on the planet. He teaches 4th grade at Powell Valley Elementary School outside Portland, Oregon, and you might know him from his multiple interviews and podcasts, his books, his YouTube channel, or maybe his incredibly entertaining Twitter stream. While we usually focus on higher ed on the show, we had a great conversation with Doug about how we apply the fundamental principles of teaching in our respective classrooms. | This fall Doug and Edward both taught classes of their own. In their latest episode, they reflect on their challenges, what they tried, and what they learned. | Jose Vasquez has been teaching economics at the University of Illinois for 14 years. He teaches one of the largest introductory microeconomics classes in the world every semester with more than 900 students. He also teaches one of the biggest intro micro MOOC’s in the world: His Coursera course has had more than 100,000 students register in the last five years.  He thinks deeply about how best to use his class time and what he wants students to do outside class.Our conversation covers a wide range as Jose explains what still excites him about teaching and how he got to where he is. Among other things, we talk about the joys of active learning, the importance of motivating our students, and the benefits (and costs) of peer assessment. | Justin Cerenzia teaches history at St George’s School in Middletown, Rhode Island. We don’t usually have guests from high schools on the show, but Justin is no ordinary high school teacher. He’s also the director of the school’s teaching center and someone who pays keen attention to research on pedagogy across the board. In this episode we talk to Justin about how teaching methods and ideas being popularized in STEM fields can translate to the humanities. | Outside observers can give instructors valuable formative feedback, and with the right observers and the right instruments, classroom observation can also be a useful (if incomplete) measure of teaching quality. Our guest, Marilyne Stains, teaches in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln where she specializes in chemical and science education.  She has used a range of measures of instructor and student behavior in her research and recently co-authored the largest-ever study of STEM teaching practices that analyzed classroom observation data for more than 2,000 classes. In this episode, we discuss the pros and cons of a variety of classroom observation techniques from reliable objective measures like COPUS to completely unstructured note-taking. | Monroe Weber-Shirk has taught engineering at Cornell for 24 years, and in 2005 he started the AguaClara Cornell  program where he works closely with local partners, graduate students, and up to 80 undergraduates at a time. Together they develop, implement, and maintain sustainable water treatment facilities in multiple developing countries. It's an incredible model of deeply engaged learning at scale, and in this episode Monroe tells us how it works and how he got here. | Mac Stetzer from the University of Maine Physics Department is an active physics education researcher with lots of experience teaching teachers how to teach physics better. In this episode he shares his lessons learned working with undergraduate learning assistants, graduate student teaching assistants, and teachers at the K-12 level. | Everyone has an opinion about course evaluations, but most of these opinions are based on personal anecdotes and armchair speculation. Our guest in this episode is Betsy Barre, author of several articles reviewing the literature on what's right and what's wrong with course evaluations. Betsy is currently an Associate Director at Rice University's Center for Teaching Excellence, and in May 2018 she will move on to become the Executive Director of the Teaching and Learning Collaborative at Wake Forest University.
