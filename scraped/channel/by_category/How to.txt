That’s right, you can literally pack up all of your paper into boxes, travel to Cincinnati, and organize your paper during a productive weekend retreat with key members of the Organize 365 Team – how awesome is that? I’m so excited! I’ve wanted to start these Paper Organizing Retreats for years. When I began Organize 365 in 2012, I knew I needed to launch a unique organizing retreat where people could bring their paper and organize all of it (while listening to some great music and snacking on delicious food as we go) – it was the PERFECT plan. But it took six years to turn that vision into a reality, and in many ways, I’m glad it took so long because now I’m 100% sure that I’ve come up with the best products, best structure, and the best team possible. After six years of long hours and lots of hard work, we have finally done it! Organizing Paper Is Hard Organizing paper isn’t the most exciting thing in the world, especially if you aren’t a passionate organizer. At home, it’s easy to get distracted and procrastinate, which is why it’s such a good idea to join one of my Paper Organizing Retreats where you can focus and actually get work done. But one of the main reasons to attend a retreat like this is so you can have the opportunity to ask questions to professional organizers. You’ll know exactly what you’re doing, and you’ll be able to avoid shredding a file that you really shouldn’t have because, unfortunately, there are no time machines when it comes to organizing paperwork! The REAL Reason For My Paper Organizing Retreats Yes, I like to help people organize their paper, and I love the community of organizers we have here at Organize 365 and the Sunday Basket®. BUT there is a deeper, more personal reason why I decided to launch these retreats. When my kids were young, they got a lot of different diagnoses including things like autism, ADHD, bipolar, food sensitives, and so on. And you know what? It was so overwhelming! I soon transformed into a protective mama bear. I was determined to know as much as possible about their conditions and I’m sure a lot of mothers who find themselves in similar situations do the same thing. Who can blame us? Whenever we receive unexpected news like a medical diagnosis or a sudden death in the family, it’s like your entire world comes crashing down. One minute, you’re sailing through life, the birds are singing, and your only concern is what you’re going to cook for dinner. And then BANG, you hear some terrible news. Then you’re devastated and left with all this paperwork you didn’t even know existed. I know that feeling all too well, which is why I wanted to create the Paper Organizing Retreats to help reduce stress at a time in your life when you feel like everything is just falling apart. Getting Organized On The Retreat On a more light-hearted note, when you attend the retreat, you’re guaranteed to leave a lot more organized than you were when you arrived! If you’ve got your hands on one of the new Friday Workboxes\xa0that have just been released for your home-based business, you can take it with you to the retreat and get stuff into it. The Friday Workboxes can really help you to get an effective system in place so you have more structure and direction to take your business that extra step further. The retreat begins at 9 am on Saturday morning. When you arrive, you’ll have your own organizing table which includes a shredding bag and a recycling bag. You’ll spend a lot of time during the first half of Saturday going through your paper and organizing them into three piles: shredding, deleting, and the keep pile. Everything you want to shred can go into the shredding bag, the paper you want to recycle can go into the recycling bag, and the rest of the paper is what you’ll need to focus most of your time and energy into organizing. You can then begin to organize your paper into the Organize 365 binders, slash pockets, or the Sunday Basket®. You can either bring your own items with you, buy them from the Organize 365 Store, or pre-order your products in advance and have them available at your seat when you arrive at the retreat. The Paper Organizing Retreat Team I’m excited to introduce you to three of the key members of this retreat team! First up, we have Janet Davis. You may have heard me mention her in previous podcasts because she’s just amazing and she’s going to be helping me run the Paper Organizing Retreats. She is our lead Paper Organizing Retreat Planner, and we’ve known each other for over 17 years. The second team member I want to mention is my sister, Emily Kelly. Emily is the Marketing Director of Organize 365, so she’ll be at the retreats helping you to organize your paperwork into the binders. Last, but not least, we have the Organize 365 Sunday Basket Club Queen, Monique Horb. Monique is a huge fan of the binders, and she’s also a Sunday Basket®\xa0Certified Organizer. She knows absolutely EVERYTHING about the binders and will be more than happy to help you organize your paper during the retreat. Each member of the team is HIPPA certified, so you don’t need to worry about that side of things when you’re organizing private papers and documents at the retreat. I’m so excited about the Paper Organizing Retreats! It’s going to be a fantastic opportunity to meet more of you AND it gives you the chance to really dive into your paper organizing like never before!

Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | It’s finally time to talk about the NEW Friday Workboxes! I’ve worked on the Friday Workboxes for a very long time (and by that, I mean three years), so I feel like they’re more than ready to go out into the world and start changing people’s lives! If you want to take a trip down memory lane with me and travel back to around two years and four months ago, that was when I first introduced the idea of a Friday Workbox with you. Time flies, huh? It may have taken a few years to get here, but it took that long to make sure the Friday Workboxes would be as awesome as possible. And as the saying goes, it’s “better late than never,” right? Friday Workboxes\xa0Are For Home-Based\xa0Businesses Are you an entrepreneur or the owner of a home-based business? If you are, the Friday Workboxes are PERFECT for you! There are four Friday boxes available, including a box for:  Direct Sales Home Schooling Entrepreneurs Teachers (this one will be available July 1st)  If you’re familiar with the Sunday Basket®\xa0system, navigating your way around the Friday Workbox will be a piece of cake. They share some similarities such as the use of the 1.0 and 2.0 Slash Pockets, but they also differ regarding their use and purpose. The Friday Workbox is a complete system and costs $150. You can’t buy each part of the box individually, but you can make your own workbox with materials from the Organize 365 Store, if you prefer. But I would advise that you save yourself the hassle and go for the complete Friday Workbox to get the most out of your investment. Friday Workboxes Vs. Sunday Baskets®\xa0: What’s The Difference? You’re probably wondering how the Friday Workbox differs from the Sunday Basket®. When you think of the Sunday Basket®, what pops into your head? Bills, letters, medical information, finances, and everything in between, right? The Sunday Basket®\xa0is built for organizing the home, and everything that’s connected to that is kept in your Sunday Basket®. The Friday Workbox, on the other hand, is all about organizing your home-based business or “passion project.” The NEW Golden Hour – (Friday at 2pm) I’ve designed the Friday Box to be done on a Friday at 2pm. That’s very specific, I know. Of course, you can do the Friday Workbox at any time of the day. But if you’re anything like me, you want to be done with work by 2pm on a Friday! You’ll need at least one hour to work on your Friday Workbox. As you’ve probably heard me say before, for every minute you spend planning, you GAIN five in execution. So, if you spend just an hour planning, you’ll save yourself five hours next week – how awesome is that? Reviewing The Week & Planning Ahead Some of you may still be thinking, “But why choose a Friday?” and I have two reasons:  When I do the box on a Friday, I can review the week and plan for what needs to be done the following week. It gives me a clear perspective and saves me a lot of time when Monday morning rolls around again. I don’t like to work over the weekend. I’d rather respond to emails and get in touch with people on a Friday rather than wait for the beginning of the next week. This way, I can enjoy my weekend and not have to think about work again until Monday morning.  Inside Your Friday Workbox The Friday Workbox comes with a Sunday Basket®\xa0in the color of your choosing, one set of the 2.0 Slash Pockets, and two sets of the rainbow 1.0 Slash Pockets. One set of the 1.0 Slash Pockets are set up in a similar way to the Sunday Basket®\xa0while the second set includes labels for each day of the week. You’ll also receive a guide for your workbox about how you can sort out your slash pockets. Each one is focused on the traditional sales cycle and color coded as follows:  Pink Slash Pockets – Leads Purple Slash Pockets – Customers Green Slash Pockets – Finances Blue Slash Pockets – Marketing & Personal Development  Once you get the hang of the Friday Workbox, it will start to create a fluent sales cycle for you. As you go through the program, your sales will increase and your business will become more organized. Friday Workbox Workshops On June 18th, I’ll be hosting a live workshop. And if you’ve bought a workbox, you’ll receive a quick invite to come and join me on the live call. During the Workbox 1.0 Workshop, we’ll go through everything you need to know about the Friday Workboxes and how you can organize yours to be the most effective and impactful for YOU. So, if you buy a Friday Workbox, you can check out the original live workshop, and you’ll also get a link to another video showing you how to organize the workbox you purchased. The direct sales, entrepreneur, home-school, and teacher workboxes will each have their own coaching video so you’ll get a real fine-tuned and in depth workshop related to the workbox you purchased. In your Friday Workbox System, you’ll receive:  A Sunday Basket® One set of the 2.0 Slash Pockets Two sets of the 1.0 Slash Pockets A printed workbook to talk you through how to assemble the workbox A recording of the live video class and the coaching video for your specific workbox  Imagine having the ability to organize your work in one box, going through it on a Friday afternoon and keeping your work organized throughout the week. Sounds great, doesn’t it? In the next podcast episode, I’m going to tell you how to get these Friday Workboxes organized most efficiently and effectively as possible – stay tuned for that one! | Sunday Basket®\xa02.0? Congratulations! If you have been following along with my podcast episodes, you have gotten your Sunday Basket®\xa0all set up and are on week two of using it. But I bet you are still feeling a little overwhelmed. The number one thing that makes you feel overwhelmed when starting to use the Sunday Basket®\xa0is that not everything fits into the first 5 pockets. I mean, where do you put your recipes, your business or small project paperwork? The first 5 pockets that you set up are called Sunday Basket®\xa01.0 and these are for tasks you do every single week like paying your bills, updating your calendar, placing orders online, and so on. These 5 pockets will save you time and will save your sanity, but the beauty of the Sunday Basket®\xa0is when you take it to Sunday Basket®\xa02.0 level. What is Sunday Basket®\xa02.0? I thought about how I use my Sunday Basket®\xa0and what works best for me, but it took me a while to figure out how to teach you to do the same thing. And the products I wanted to do this with didn\'t exist. I had custom slash pockets created that are different than all others available on the market and different from those in Sunday Basket®\xa01.0. I even had the colors specifically designed for me… maybe you should be a little worried about me! Try to visualize this... in Sunday Basket®\xa01.0, the 5 slash pocket colors cascade down the outside (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). But in Sunday Basket®\xa02.0, they are packs of each colored slash pocket. So the first 5 are all blue, then the next 5 are green, then pink, and then purple so you have 5 of each of the 4 colors. Once I had these slash pockets to teach the Sunday Basket®\xa02.0 how I wanted to teach it, I realized that I not only manage my paperwork, but also prioritize and do my goal setting all in my Sunday Basket®. I never realized this until I really started thinking about it, breaking it down, and working out how I wanted to teach it to you. Now, you don\'t have to use my slash pockets. You can buy regular ones and it will still work. But I will tell you that it is easier if you do use my slash pockets. The Sunday Basket®\xa01.0 process corals all of your paperwork in one place and helps you to go through it on a regular basis and not miss bill payments and important paperwork. The Sunday Basket®\xa02.0 and beyond corals all your papers... and all your hopes and dreams... into different slash pockets and then allows you to prioritize them. What Do the Colors Mean For You? The start of the Sunday Basket®\xa02.0 Workshop is getting you to think about what you want the colors to represent, what do you need them to be. You don\'t need to use all 20 pockets. And sometimes, you will naturally fill more of the pockets than at other times, depending on what is going on in your life. We talk about what to put in each of the pockets. For me, I use blue for my family as it is a color representative of loyalty, green for money (it\'s the color of money, right?), purple for household stuff, and, saving the best for last, the pink one for you. And this is where I focused for this week’s podcast episode, on the pink slash pocket. Because once you have a slash pocket just for you, you really start to think about yourself. We all have goals for ourselves, but let\'s be honest, if your husband, kids or work call, those personal goals don\'t take priority. Having this slash pocket has changed how I look at things. This is how my five pink pockets are labeled: Clothing One of the things I\'ve noticed as a woman is I buy my kids new clothes each season as they grow or they wear them out. It’s kind of fun and it\'s what my Mom did for me. But as soon as we get older, we stop buying clothes for ourselves. We only buy what we desperately need and cannot do without. So I decided it was time to start buying clothes for me again. And I have a new style that I like so I actually have a slash pocket for my clothing. It\'s where I store my coupons, ideas of things I\'ve seen, frilly shirts I want to buy, and the most recent edition of catalogs I like. Recipes My husband has done all the cooking for the last 3 to 4 years, but I\'m making a weekly recipe for a friend so it is a personal goal of mine to make a fun new recipe every week for my friend and my husband. So this is also one of my pink pockets. Home Improvements We have lived in our house now for 20 years. It\'s gorgeous and I love it. But I decorated it 20 years ago and it needs a little improving and updating. And since we are having a graduation party this year, what better excuse do I need to update things! This is more about me expressing myself in my home rather than mechanically fixing things in our home (that I would put in the purple pocket). Travel This is the slash pocket that Greg would like to hide from me, but it\'s happening... I\'m traveling. In this pocket, I put things like my passport renewal, TSA (Transport Security Administration) pre-check approval, which I\'ve done, and yesterday I applied for a new credit card. I also put in there my plans to go to a conference in March, the Organize 365 National Convention I\'m organizing in Dallas in June, and a trip to Orlando with the team to plan this convention (a convention to plan a convention – I actually think this is a brilliant idea!). I am also going to pick out a new suitcase and look at how to really pack that case so I am only taking a carry-on with me, something I will be sure to share with you on the Organize 365 podcast. Fitness I\'m no good at programs and diets. I just know I need to eat less and more often to maintain my weight so my goal is to walk 5,000 steps 2 to 3 days a week. I know this doesn\'t sound much like a "fitness" goal and more like a "not being a sloth goal," but it is all about you, what you want to do to move your life forward. You can\'t do all of these things at once. They are not weekly tasks, but they are actionable in 2018 and provide good reminders of your goals. Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | Step 5 - Can It Wait Until NEXT Sunday? If you’ve been listening to my podcasts in real time (on the day that they were released), then you’ll know that this podcast episode was released on the first Sunday of 2018. I am so excited about this. If you’ve listened to episodes 1-7, then today is the end of my daily episodes of the Sunday Basket®\xa0Podcast (they\'ll be released weekly from now on). If you have been following along and taking action with each episode, then you’re almost done with your Sunday Basket®. I’m picturing all of the Sunday Baskets that have been created all over the world. I’m picturing all the women that are taking control of their to-do lists that have been sucking away their time, energy, and causing stress. Every podcast episode, from episode 1 through to this episode, is actionable. They all have an action for you to complete. We have emptied our Sunday Basket®\xa0completely. We\'ve gotten rid of all items that needed shredding or recycling. We have opened all of our mail. We\'ve divided our actionable items into three piles – mail and money, computer and calendar, and errands and things to do outside of the house. And we took action with our mail and money and our computer and calendar items. Can it wait until NEXT Sunday? We must always make this assessment with all items – can this wait until next Sunday? With money and mail items, if it can wait until next week, then we put it into a green slash pocket (if you have been to one of my workshops, you’ll have one of these) or you can clip it together. Then it goes back into your Sunday Basket®. Similarly, with your computer and calendar pile, anything that can wait gets put into an orange slash pocket or clipped together. Then it goes back into your Sunday Basket®. In the errand pile, you have selected what can be completed this week. You\'ve created your "car closet" – putting items in the trunk of your car on a Sunday that you’ll need through the week. You have also made your to-do list based on what can be completed this week. Any errands that won’t be completed this week should go into a yellow slash pocket (if you have one) or clipped together – then back into your Sunday Basket®. Sunday Basket®\xa02.0 Any other items that you have left in front of you are the topic of next week’s podcast episode – I call this Sunday Basket®\xa02.0. They are usually items that are unique to you – recipes, memorabilia, work-related, etc. For now, just group the items together as best you can. With each item ask yourself, can it wait until next Sunday? Of course, if it can\'t, take action. Then put your Sunday Basket®\xa0back on the kitchen counter. Next Sunday, I’ll teach you what to do with all of those items that didn’t fit into the red, green, and orange slash pockets. Don’t worry, there is a system. They have not been neglected! Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | Step 4 - Plan Your Week In this podcast episode and blog post, I’m so excited to share with you my free weekly planning printables. Head to the homepage\xa0and you’ll see that when you sign up for my newsletter, you get a copy of my planning printables, too. The planning printables are something that I created years ago.\xa0 I’ve realized that, although I’ve moved to a Google Calendar as my planner for the day-to-day, sometimes I just need paper, too! On a Sunday night, when I’m doing my Sunday Basket®, I flesh out a plan for my week ahead (using my planning printables). I love writing my plan out. I find that physically writing something down on a piece of paper creates a different connection within your brain in relation to that task, as opposed to making a digital record. I recognize that planning your week ahead is an extra task on a Sunday for you to complete, but I promise that in doing so, you’ll see that your week flows so much easier and in a far more organized way. You’ll also be able to add new and exciting things into your week that you previously didn’t have time to do before! If you’ve been following along with the previous podcast episodes, then you should currently have an empty Sunday Basket®. Let’s recap! You’ve shredded and recycled paper that you don’t need. You’ve placed your actionable items into three piles – money and mail, computer and calendar, and errands and tasks outside of the house. You worked through the money and mail pile, and the computer and calendar pile, and you took action with every item in there – apart from those that can wait until next week (the focus of my next podcast episode)! This week, I’m looking at the errands and things to do outside of the house pile. You can’t complete these on a Sunday (most likely), but what you can do is plan out your week so that they do get completed. To help you do this, go ahead and\xa0download my planning printables. How to use the printables There are two printable PDF documents. The first printable has three columns.  Things to do every week – turn phone off and on again, fully charge electronic items, etc. Home to-do list – your to-do list related to your household and family. Work to-do list – work is whatever you spend the majority of your time doing. Work is not necessarily paid; it could be volunteering or home schooling.  The second printable is used to plan your week ahead. You add the top 3 things that you are going to complete each day. The top of the planner says ‘Top 3 Work’ and ‘Top 3 Home’ – but to be clear, you don’t set three of each, just three tasks overall. Why set three things to complete every day? I truly believe that setting 3 tasks to complete every day is the key to having a really productive day and week. We all naturally try and do too much. You most likely think "three things, I have twenty things to do every day!" – but that is the problem. We try to do too much and it all becomes disorganized and often overwhelming. The key thing is to batch together your work and the tasks that you need to do. If you batch together work, you save on all of the transition time. For example, one of my three tasks today is recording my podcast episodes. I’m recording 11 podcasts today! I consider this one task because the task is to go to my office and record the podcasts – but in reality, you could call it 11 tasks because it’s 11 podcast episodes. But, it’s so much easier and far more productive for me to set all of my podcasting equipment up today to record a batch of episodes than it is to record all 11 podcast episodes over the course of the next 11 days recording 1 per day. It would take time every day to set everything up, put equipment away, etc. Pick a day for your errands I really recommend selecting a day of the week to complete the majority of your errands. Pick the day of the week that typically goes awry. For me, that’s Tuesday or Wednesday. I LOVE Monday, I get so much done on a Monday. Thursday is an excellent day as well. I get lots of content created on a Thursday. Friday is the day where I finish early as I’m pooped! Tuesday and Wednesday are the days when I meet my team, I do guest interviews on other podcasts, and they are also the days that I tend to schedule doctor’s appointments, school appointments, hair appointments – naturally, they became my errand days. Can you think of a day or days that you tend to do this? If you work full-time, perhaps this is Saturday? Most of us have a day that errands are more easily completed. My action for you is to pick a day that is going to be your errand day. Make a to-do list. Pick your top 3 things to complete for each day. Try to get all of your errands completed on that day. Don’t forget to download my free planning printables\xa0to help you. Happy Planning! Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | Step 3 - Take Action! I hope you’re enjoying The Sunday Basket®\xa0Podcast so far. If you’ve been following along with the podcast episodes, then you should have three piles of your actionable items from your Sunday Basket®. Your three actionable piles are:  Mail & Money: Bills and things to be mailed Errands & Outside The House: Errands and items that you need to buy or do outside of the home Computer & Calendar: Items that need to be put on your computer, on your calendar, or you need to order them on your computer  The next part takes up the bulk of your Sunday Basket®\xa0time. It can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to work on these piles. Before we get going, I want to let you know that the Sunday Basket®\xa0is all about you. While I may talk about your kids, your spouse, and your extended family, the Sunday Basket®\xa0is about YOU. It’s about your time, your to-do\'s, and your calendar. It applies to any woman, of any generation, anywhere in the world. Your first action now is to sit down with your mail and money pile and work through it. Pay your bills. Reconcile your bank checks (I can’t be the only person who still does this!). Check your investments. Mail out whatever needs to be mailed on a Monday morning. This usually takes me about 30 minutes. Next up is your computer and calendar pile. I have two high school-age teenage kids who are getting ready for college, learning to drive… they are as busy as ever. I manage a calendar for each family member. I spend a lot of time calculating things like who is driving who, where, and when. I note everything on calendars. I need to spend at least 30 minutes each Sunday doing work on our calendars. Next, I work on computer-related tasks. For example, I do my grocery shopping online, I order A LOT on Amazon (daily). I check my email. This is another good 30 minutes to an hour. My Sunday Basket®\xa0takes me at least 90 minutes every week. The great thing is that on Sunday night, I feel very organized. I can focus on my business Monday to Friday and on my family Saturday and Sunday. Finally, we\'re to errands and outside the home tasks. They are often the tasks that we don’t equate time to.\xa0 But, they can take up so much more time than you realize. For example, I worked out that I drove 25 hours a week last year just driving my kids to school and back. That is a lot of time. I have an organizer friend who spends 3 hours a day commuting. All of this time in the car can be lost time. Your errand pile isn’t going to be completed on Sunday, but you’re going to plan for it. For example, what can you put into the trunk of your car now that you’ll need later in the week? All of these actions help you to have a more organized and productive week. When I go to bed on Sunday night, my goal is that all the bills are paid, the mail is ready to go out the following morning, I’ve updated my calendar for the week, everyone in my family knows where they are going and when, I have bought anything that I possibly can for the week coming up, and the errands for the week are pre-planned. Now it’s your turn! Take action on your money and mail, your calendar and computer, and plan your errands. In the next episode, I’m going to talk about how to plan your week. Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | Step 2 - Your Top 3 Sunday Basket®\xa0Piles If you listened to the last podcast episode and followed along taking action, then currently you have a completely empty Sunday Basket®. You also have a big pile of paper that requires action.\xa0 You\'ve gotten rid of anything that can be shredded or recycled. You\'ve opened up all of your mail and only kept the parts that you need to take action on. Phew! Now everything in front of you needs to be acted upon. There are three things that are in every person’s Sunday Basket®.  Mail & Money: Bills and things to be mailed Errands & Outside The House: Errands and items that you need to buy or do outside of the home Computer & Calendar: Items that need to be put on your computer, on your calendar, or you need to order something on your computer  Almost all actionable items in your Sunday Basket®\xa0each week fall into one of those three categories. I want you to make three piles according to the three categories above. In the next podcast episode, I’m going to discuss what to do with your three piles! Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | Step 1 - Shred, Recycle, Open & Sort The next five podcasts go through exactly what to do with the items that you have in your Sunday Basket®. When you sit down to do your Sunday Basket®, follow the actions that I talk about in this podcast episode and the following four podcasts, too. There are two key actions that lead to the success of the Sunday Basket®... first, to completely empty it every time, and second, you must go through it every single week! Before you get started, make sure you find a place that you’re comfortable sitting while you complete a project. For me, it’s sitting on my bed or the floor. I make too many piles to do it at the table! Also, have your trash bin next to you and a space for a recycling pile. Step 1: Empty your Sunday Basket® By empty, I mean completely empty. Take everything out of your basket. Move your empty basket to the side. The only things going back into your empty basket are the things that can wait until next Sunday. Step 2: Decide what can be recycled or trashed Spend 5-10 minutes deciding what can be recycled (or shredded) or trashed. Quickly filter out those items that you can decide on right away, like flyers and magazines. Step 3: Pick up each item and open all your mail If your mail needs to be recycled or trashed, put it in that pile right away. Then, open up the bills. Keep the important section of the bill (the part that you need to pay the bill) and put it into a pile for taking action. Shred or recycle the rest. You’ve now filtered out of your basket all items that require recycling or trashing, and you’re left with a pile of paper where everything requires action. Now may be a good time for a little break from the sorting. I suggest you take action on the household to-do items.\xa0 For example, if you need to order batteries for that kitchen appliance or sew that button on a blouse, take a bit of a break from the paper sorting and take action. There you have it, step 1 of The Sunday Basket®\xa0– shred, recycle, open and sort. Step 2 is covered in my next podcast episode number 5. Happy Sorting! Get your\xa0Complete Sunday Basket with On Demand Workshop here! | Fill Your Sunday Basket®\xa0 It’s time to fill your Sunday Basket®! If you’ve been listening along to my previous podcast episodes, then you have:  Got your basket (or box or bag) Decided on the day of the week that you’ll go through it  Plus, you may have signed up for a\xa0Sunday Basket®\xa0 Workshop. Now it’s time to take some more action and fill your basket. There are four items that I want you to put into your Sunday Basket®. From now until the day that you are going to sort your basket, I want you to be filling your basket with these four items.  Mail  Put all of your mail into the basket. It does not need to be open and you don’t need to sort through it – just put your mail into the basket. Defer your brain power until Sunday when it comes to sorting mail.  Coupons  Put coupons unclipped into your Sunday Basket®.  Actionable to-do\'s  Put all actionable to-do\'s in your basket. For example, when someone asks you to fill out paperwork, or arrange a lunch, etc. Always ask yourself the question, “can this wait until Sunday?” If the answer is yes, put it in your Sunday Basket®. The number one thing that causes worry, stress, and exhaustion is thinking about these things. We’re clearing up your mental exhaustion so that you can clearly think about these things on Sunday.  Notes to yourself  I recommend you go to a store and get index cards and post-it notes and get into the habit of writing notes to yourself. When you think of something that you need or want to do, write it down on a piece of paper and put that paper into your Sunday Basket®\xa0if it can wait until Sunday. If you don’t have time to write a note, put something in your basket that will serve as a reminder. For example, if you need a new food item, put the empty box in your basket to remind you to order another. Your Sunday Basket®\xa0Must Go On Your Kitchen Counter This is why you should get something that looks pretty! My own Sunday Basket®\xa0that will be available to purchase in February is pretty and functional (to me functional is the most important, but it is pretty, too!). If your Sunday Basket®\xa0is anywhere else, like in your home office, you just won’t use it. Your Sunday Basket®\xa0is your inbox for the whole family so it needs to be prominent to you and all family members. The key thing is to defer everything that you possibly can until Sunday. This will enable you to defer your brain when it comes to thinking about these things until Sunday, reducing your worry and stress through the week. It may seem like you are going to spend far too long going through the Sunday Basket®,\xa0but I promise you that I will walk you through it, step-by-step, week-by-week. By around Week 6, you will not believe you ever got by without a Sunday Basket®! You will learn how to become ultra-productive which will improve your life in more ways than you can imagine. Action For Today: Go fill your basket! View the complete post here:\xa0https://thesundaybasket.com/fill-your-sunday-basket/ | The Sunday Basket®\xa0Workshop In my next couple of podcast episodes, I’m going to tell you exactly how to set up a Sunday Basket®. The idea is that you can follow along and set-up your own basket as you listen. However, I know that we all like to learn in different ways. There are some people who learn just fine on their own, and there are other people who like to learn with others face-to-face or virtually. If you fall into the latter category, then you are going to be really pleased to learn that I offer two different types of Sunday Basket®\xa0Workshops – they are either delivered by me or by one of my wonderful Certified Sunday Basket®\xa0Workshop Organizers.

The complete Sunday Basket®\xa0System includes all workshop materials, the physical Sunday Basket®\xa0and digital recording of a Sunday Basket Workshop for you to watch on demand – multiple times. Where do I START organizing? That’s the number one question I get asked as a professional organizer. And while that is a loaded question with multiple “right” answers, I have decided to start all of my clients with a simple system I call\xa0The Sunday Basket®. You see, organization is a way of living, and “being organized” is a way of thinking. The Sunday Basket®\xa0is a system for processing mail, kitchen counter “to do” papers, and ongoing household projects. The weekly routine of collecting, processing, and maintaining household to do’s and papers is the perfect training ground for all your future home organization skills. And, like it or not, the mail just keeps on coming… giving us plenty of practice to hone and refine our organizing skills. The Sunday Basket®\xa0can be as simple as the place you drop your unopened mail to complex enough to run every aspect of your household. Over the last 16 years, I have tweaked and honed my Sunday Basket®into a productivity machine. I rarely misplace any to-do and my family knows to drop all receipts, notes, and mail right in my Sunday Basket®. The key to my productivity is a set of color-coordinated slash pockets that keep my ongoing ideas and tasks in order and insight without getting in my way. The Complete Sunday Basket® System includes:\xa0Sunday Basket 1.0 + Sunday Basket 2.0 + the physical Sunday Basket. \xa0 The\xa0Sunday\xa0Basket® 1.0 Workshop will go through the basics of a Sunday\xa0Basket® and create the first 5 slash pockets that ALL baskets have in common. \xa0 The Sunday Basket® 2.0 Workshop will teach you how to organize, prioritize, and complete the projects you always want to “get to someday.” This second part of the system adds\xa020 slash pockets in 4 colors: pink, purple, blue and green. {An additional set of 20 slash pockets may be added to your order after you register.} The basket is 13″ wide x 9″ high x 9″ deep. The velcro attachment inside gives you a bit of flexibility depending on how you attach it. It creates a section that is 2.75 to 3.5 inches.

Aside of college educations, new homes and new cars, your wedding likely has one of the biggest price tags you’ve ever paid.\xa0 You’re spending tens of thousands of dollars - of course you’re trying to save money!\xa0 You’re not out there researching the most expensive venue in your area, or ways to spend more money on your invitations.\xa0 When a potential photographer or caterer gives you a quote for services, you probably don’t say “well that sounds OK, but do you have anything that costs more?” If you\'ve been listening for a while, I hope you know me well enough now to know that I’m NOT the wedding professional who’s going to tell you NEVER to try to cut this corner, or don’t DARE hire a friend to do x, y, z.\xa0 I see this type of messaging a lot.\xa0 If you do your own wedding day hair and makeup it will totally fail, and you should hire a professional to do it for you.\xa0 If you skimp on a photographer, you will regret it for the rest of your life.\xa0 If you have your cousin make your cake, it will probably be a complete disaster, you should really hire a professional for that.\xa0 If you take your dress to a neighborhood tailor instead of the big box bridal store where you bought it, it’s going to end up in shreds and you’ll have no dress to wear. The trouble is, professional service providers in pretty much any industry have an agenda - to sell their product or service. And whether you hear from a wedding professional on a podcast, read their articles on a blog, or see their posts on Instagram, their position is probably that hiring a professional is THE BEST way to go.\xa0 "After all", they say, "this is your wedding - you can’t afford to cut corners on the best day of your life." Well, for lots of this, I call BS.\xa0 Sure, if you have a wedding budget in the 6-figures, then “hire a professional” is a great option for everything I just listed.\xa0 But most of us DON’T have $100,000 to spend on our wedding, so making swaps and saves here and there is a necessary part of planning so that we don’t go thousands of dollars into debt - NEVER a good idea. Here’s a doozy for you - we hired our wedding photographer off craigslist for $500.\xa0 True story.\xa0 And I’m NOT here to tell you that it was a horrible idea that backfired and you should never trust any wedding photographer who hasn’t shot 500 weddings and costs less than $5000.\xa0 That’s not me, not my style. BUT - and this is a big but - I’m also not here to tell you that YOU should definitely hire a photographer off craigslist, and it will work out perfectly and there’s no risk involved and you can live happy ever after and sleep soundly knowing that you saved a couple thousand dollars! To be clear - there’s no right or wrong, one-size-fits all solution to the myriad of wedding decisions you have to make over the next few months.\xa0 I’ll always encourage you to use your intuition, and use our weekly time together to review all the options you have available, and select what feels best for you and your unique situation.\xa0 That was a long intro, because I really feel strongly about what we’re talking about today, and I really want to set things up right. The truth is, sometimes no matter how much research you do, or how many great reviews someone has, or how confident you feel that you’re making the right decision, things can just go wrong.\xa0 You’ll probably have a wedding backfire, or two, or three over the course of getting everything lined up. This is part of life, and definitely a part of wedding planning.\xa0 I wish I could wave a magical wand that would shield you against anything bad happening, but of course - that’s not realistic.\xa0 Sooooo, the next best thing to that … Let’s explore some common areas of wedding planning where couples to try to cut a corner, save some money, leave something out, and then sadly have it backfire in terms of lost money, lost time, lost sanity - and sometimes all three. If you find yourselves at a cost-saving opportunity crossroads and you don’t know which way to turn, I have some smart questions to ask yourselves, and potential vendors, that I hope will guide you towards making the best decisions for you and your wedding day.\xa0 So when you find yourself wondering, hmmmmm ...\xa0should we cut that corner?\xa0 What are the potential outcomes or pitfalls that might come of it?\xa0 Hopefully after today’s show, you’ll have some solid answers to some of the most common situations, so that you can make the best decision for you. For one wedding, that might mean hiring a photographer off craigslist for $500.\xa0 For another couple, that will NEVER be an option that’s on the table.\xa0 And you know what?\xa0 Both sides are totally fine ;) Full blog post available at www.weddingplanningpodcast.co/wedding-pitfall Please enjoy these special gifts from today\'s show sponsors!

Our goal is to get really clear on the difference between a wedding planner and a day-of coordinator, and to determine whether or not you really need to hire a professional to help you with your wedding plans. When I got married, I thought you had to have a wedding planner.\xa0 I laugh looking back, because in my mind it was wedding law that to plan anything, you HAD to have a wedding planner.\xa0 Like, I couldn’t even pick up the phone and call caterers for information and quotes, because you had to have your wedding planner do that.\xa0 So silly.\xa0 Things have come a long way, LOL!\xa0 And not only silly, but a professional planner was completely out of our budget, and, as it turns out, totally unnecessary.\xa0 I wasted a lot of time researching and interviewing planners before I realized that A.) I didn’t HAVE to hire anyone, and B.) John and I had all the tools we needed to plan OUR perfect wedding day. And side note, shocker - obviously, none of the wedding planners I interviewed ever mentioned to me, hey by the way, did you know that you could actually just do this on your own?\xa0 Thankfully I came around to that, but it took lots of wasted effort and stress to get there. So I will tell you - hey by the way, did you know that you could actually just do this on your own? Flash forward to today - I literally created the Wedding Planning Podcast so that any engaged couple could tune in and use the episodes and the tools we review in the weekly shows to plan their own wedding - no professional or pricey wedding planner required.\xa0 So spoiler alert before we even dive in - I definitely DO NOT think you have to spend thousands of dollars to hire a professional wedding planner!\xa0 I also know that there are countless wonderful wedding planning professionals out there, and for some couples it’s a really smart investment … we’ll get into that much more in today’s show.

This means that the typical model of teachers setting the rules and students complying becomes more complicated as teenagers begin to question and challenge their teachers. What can new teachers do to ensure that they\'re respecting the needs of teenagers while still maintaining a positive learning environment? What should they do when their students begin to push back or become defiant? In today\'s episode, Andy Earle from Talking to Teens and I dive into the core motivations of teenage students so that teachers can frame their thinking and policies in a way that doesn\'t create more frustration and overwhelm for everyone.

Not only is there a billion other things to do as a teacher, but there\'s the tiny detail of knowing how and what to plan. Yes, you definitely learned about it and even did some practice lesson plans. But now that you\'re faced with your own students (and possibly teaching a grade that you weren\'t prepared for), it\'s a whole new ballgame. In this episode, I don\'t tell you how to plan - I explain the mindset and big-picture view of planning an entire year, then down to quarters, units, and daily lessons.

They don’t like the potential for chaos and bad behaviors, so for the most part, they avoid it. However, it’s impossible to keep students on-task and in silence for an entire class period. Those students may seem like they\'re paying attention but are in fact playing the role of a student who’s working. They’re tuning out from the lack of opportunity to talk to their peers. This is where group work also helps! In this episode, I’ll discuss the pros and cons of cooperative learning, as well as my tips for how to make it not only just WORK in your classroom but increases student achievement.

They can rescue you when you need help creating materials for your class, volunteer to help chaperone events, and run fundraisers for your classroom. They can also question your teaching practices, make excuses when their child misbehaves, and go over your head and complain to your administrator. Either way, it\'s important that you build strong relationships with your students\' parents right from the start. But how do you do that? What if you\'re uncomfortable with or intimidated by them? How should you handle conflicts with them? In this episode, I go over everything I’ve learned about creating positive parent relationships as well as how to deal with issues when parent-teacher conflicts arise.

They may have had success when they were borrowing someone else\'s class during student teaching, but when faced with their own, it can be daunting. Despite the tips and tricks taught in pre-service preparation programs, most new teachers still feel woefully unprepared for dealing with student behaviors.

They take the plunge for many reasons and find themselves in a tough but completely fulfilling job. Some question whether or not it\'s a good idea or if they have anything to offer in education, and others are worried about the age gap between them and teachers coming straight from college. On today\'s episode, I discuss not only why many teachers make the switch, but I also showcase the advantages that second-career teachers have, as well as how they can be successful in education.\xa0  Sign up for Tailor-Ed and receive 3 months FREE!

While this is a sad end to the summer, many new teachers are still interviewing for their first job or eagerly getting ready for their very first classroom. There\'s so much unknown in terms of what supplies you\'ll need, how to plan curriculum, learning about your school, etc. that it can be overwhelming, especially for elementary school teachers. So I called in an expert, Gretchen Bridgers from Always a Lesson, to offer some reassuring advice for incoming elementary school teachers so that they don\'t feel pressured to go into debt from buying supplies and feel confident that first day of school.

He has worked for BBC, The Guardian, and The Financial Times in the UK. He has also worked in the US for SalesForce and currently works for Shopify on their Polaris design system. Shopify has multiple design systems, and Polaris is open source. Today the panel is talking about design systems and developer tooling around design systems.\xa0To begin, Kaelig explains what a design system is. A design system is all of the cultural practices around design and shipping a product. It includes things like the words, colors, spacing grid system, and typography, plus guidance on how to achieve that in code. The panelists discuss what has made design systems so popular. Design systems have been around for a while, but became popular due to the shift to components, which has been accelerated by the popularity of React. The term design system is also misused by a lot of people, for it is much more than having a Sketch file.\xa0Next, they talk about whether design systems fall under the jurisdiction of a frontend developer or web designers. Kaelig has found that a successful design system involves a little bit of everyone and shouldn’t be isolated to one team. They talk about what the developer workflow looks like in a design system. It begins with thinking of a few common rules, a language, and putting it into code. As you scale, design systems can become quite large and it’s impossible for one person to know everything. You either give into the chaos, or you start a devops practice where people start to think about how we build, release, and the path from designer’s brain to production.The panelists then talk about how to introduce a design system into a company where there are cultural conflicts. Kaelig shares his experience working with SalesForce and introducing a design system there. They discuss what aspects of a design system that would make people want to use it over what the team is currently doing. Usually teams are thankful for the design system. It’s important to build a system that’s complete, flexible, and extensible so that you can adapt it to your team. A good design system incorporates ‘subatomic’ parts like the grid system, color palette, and typography, referred to as design tokens. Design systems enable people to take just the bits of the design system that are interesting to them and build the components that are missing more easily.\xa0The conversation turns to the installation and upgrade process of a design system. Upgrading is left up to the customer to do on their own time in most cases, unless it’s one of the big customers. They talk about the role of components in upgrading a design system. Kaelig talks about the possibility of Shopify transitioning to web components. Kaelig shares some of his favorite tools for making a design system and how to get started making one. A lot of design teams start by taking a ton of screen shots and looking at all the inconsistencies.Giving them that visibility is a good thing because it helps get everyone get on the same page. The panelists talk about the role of upper management in developing components and how to prioritize feature development. Kaelig talks about what drives the decision to take a feature out. The two main reasons a feature would be removed is because the company wants to change the way things are done and there’s a different need that has arisen. The show concludes by discussing the possibility of a design system getting bloated over time. Kaelig says that Design systems takes some of the burden off your team, help prevent things from getting bloated, allow you to ship less code.\xa0PanelistsChris FerdinandiAimee KnightSteve EmmerichWith special guest: Kaelig Deloumeau-PrigentSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in BlockchainLinksShopify PolarisBootstrapReactSketch.uiFigma.ui\xa0CSSStoryBookESLintJestEnsignWebpackerFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksSteve Emmerich:CedarWorks play beds\xa0Azure’s container instancesAimee Knight:Awesome Actions for GithubChris Ferdinandi:Free Meek docuseriesSimplicity: Part 2 by Bastian AllgeierKaelig Deloumeau-Prigent:DependabotInk by Vadim DemedezFollow Kaelig on Twitter @kaelig | Jonathan Lee Martin is an instructor and developer. He got his start in teaching at Big Nerd Ranch doing 1-2 week trainings for mid to senior developers, and then transitioned to 16 week courses for career switchers. He also worked for Digital Crafts for a year, and then wanted to focus on building out his own personal teaching brand. One of his first steps toward building his own brand was to publish his book, Functional Design Patterns for Express.js.The inspiration for Jonathan’s book came from his experience teaching career switchers. He wanted to experiment in the classroom with teaching functional programming in a way that would be very approachable and applicable and dispel some of the magic around backend programming, and that became the template for the book.\xa0Jonathan loves the minimalist nature of Express.js and talks about its many uses. He believes that it knowing design patterns can take you pretty far in programming, and this view is related to his background in Rails. When he was working in Rails taming huge middleware stacks, he discovered that applying design patterns made builds take less time. He talks about other situations where knowing design patterns has helped. Express.js leans towards object oriented style over functional programming, and so it takes to these patterns well. Express.js has its shortcomings, and that’s where Jonathan’s favorite library Koa comes into play.\xa0The conversation switches back to Jonathan’s book, which is a good way to start learning these higher level concepts. He purposely made it appealing to mid and senior level programmers, but at the same time it does not require a lot of background knowledge. Jonathan talks about his teaching methods that give people a proper appreciation for the tool. Jonathan talks more about why he likes to use Express.js and chose to use it for his book. He cautions that his book is not a book of monads, but rather about being influenced by the idea of composition over inheritance. He talks about the role of middleware in programming.\xa0The panel asks about Jonathan’s toolchain and approach to writing books, and he explains how his books are set up to show code. They discuss the different forms required when publishing a book such as epub, MOBI, and PDF. Jonathan found it difficult to distribute his book through Amazon, so he talks about how he built his own server. Charles notes that your method of distributing your book will depend on your goal. If you want to make the most money possible, make your own site. If you want to get it into as many hands as possible, get it on Amazon.Many of the JavaScript Jabber panelists have had experience publishing books, and Jonathan shares that you can reach out to a publisher after you’ve self-published a book and they can get it distributed. Jonathan believes that If he had gone straight to a publisher, he would have gotten overwhelmed and given up on the book, but the step by step process of self-publishing kept things manageable. The panelists discuss difficulties encountered when publishing and editing books, especially with Markdown. Jonathan compares the perks of self-editing to traditional editing. Though he does not plan to opensource his entire editing pipeline, he may make some parts available. The show concludes with the panelists discussing the clout that comes with being a published author.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodChristopher Buecheler\xa0J.C.

Today the panel is talking about the upcoming Ember update, which Mike calls a total reinvention of the way you build with Ember. Finally, they are letting go of the cruft and stuff they had to hold on to in order to support IE8 and using modern interfaceThe panel talks about some of the issues with IE8, and agree that the reason Ember felt its age because it was built for IE8. Ember 314 is moving from the past into the present, a sleek modern way to build apps. Mike talks about how easy the new Ember is to use.\xa0Mike talks about the excitement in the Ember community because the new build is focused on stability and seamlessness. Charles talks about his less seamless experience with the Angular community. For context, Mike North’s first frontend masters course was recorded in 2014, and he’s only had to change two lines of code. Ember is the only framework that has managed to go all the way from IE7/IE8 to today without a major gap,breaks, or rewrites.They transition to talking about what keeps Ember going. There is an effort to make sure things are decentralized and not tied to any specific company, although Apple, Netflix, Nasa, and PlaysStation all use it. LinkedIn has also been hiring Ember core member to continue working on it, and sponsoring open source work.\xa0Next, they talk about how Ember works with TypeScript. You can install an Ember add on with one terminal command that will enable TypeScript in an Ember app.There are some issues that could cause misalignment with JavaScript and TypeScript, but Ember has designed things around it. MIke talks about the major change in the learning curve with using Ember and how far Vanilla JS will take you. Overall, it is a lot more approachable than it used to be.\xa0They move on to talk about the availability of third party solutions with Ember. Mike assures them that Ember has add-ons, and parts of the framework are opening up to allow experimentation with components. There are lots of ways to make Ember your own without running the risk of diverging, giving more flexibility than ever while maintaining the happy path. Testing within Ember is also a priority, and they want the code to be as readable as possible.The last topic discussed in this show is the importance of developer education. LinkedIn looks at employment numbers and the rate at which new jobs open, and software engineering is growing like crazy and will likely continue to grow.The rate at which new people are graduating with computer science and programming degrees, as well as those from unconventional backgrounds, is not keeping up with the number of jobs. This means that there will be fewer senior people spread across bigger groups of developers with less experience. The panel agrees that it is the responsibility of people who have been around or learned something period to pass on the knowledge because the more knowledge is passed on, the more stable things will remain as seniors become more scarce. It is also important for companies to level up junior developers. They conclude by talking about tools available for people who want to learn more about Ember Octane, and Mike makes an open request to the JS community.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodSteve EmmerichChris FerdinandiAimee KnightAJ O’NealChristopher BuechelerWith special guest: Mike NorthSponsorsReact Native RadioSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planDev Ed PodcastLinksEmberFrontend MastersIE8Ember OctaneSprout CoreTypeScriptES6Lodash\xa0MochaBackstop.js\xa0Semverhttps://twitter.com/thefalken/status/1177483501777473537Follow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksChris Ferdinandi:Vanilla JS Academy, get 30% off with code ‘jsjabber’leanweb.devSteve Emmerich:123 MagicRGDKAimee Knight:Recursion blog postWholesome Provisions Protein CerealAJ O’Neal:Carby V2 by Insurrection IndustriesGameCube ModsCharles Max Wood:Nikon D5600Rode NewsshooterViltrox light panelQuest Nutrition pumpkin barsChristopher Buecheler:Tool’s Fear Inoculum on Apple Music, Spotify, and Google PlayMike North:Github UniverseGithub Tracer BenchFollow Mike @mike-north on Github, @northm on LinkedIn, and @michaellnorth on Twitter | Episode SummaryDominik Kundel works as developer evangelist at Twilio. Dominik talks about the history of Twilio, which actually started with integrating phone calls into apps and then moved to SMS integration.\xa0Today Charles and Dominik are talking about how the SMS message approach can augment your user experience. Since many people are not familiar with implementing SMS, Dominik talks about how Twilio can help. Twilio created was a supernetwork where they work with carriers and gateways around the world to ensure that they provide reliable services. They also focus heavily on making sure that the developer experience is great.Uber and Lyft are two of the companies that use Twilio, and Dominik shares some of the interesting things that they’ve accomplished. He is particularly excited about phone number masking to support privacy. Uber and Lyft use phone number masking so that your driver doesn’t see your real number and you don’t see theirs. Instead, each of you sees a Twilio number. This use case is becoming more common.\xa0Twilio recently introduced Flex, which Dominik explains is their contact center solution. Flex is designed to keep with their philosophy of everything should be programmable and configurable, and take it on to a software shipment. This is their first time shipping software instead of just APIs. Flex is highly customizable and flexible, allows you to build React plugins that let you change anything you want.Charles asks Dominik about some of the gotchas in telephony. One major issues is spam calls, which Twilio is trying to work with some providers on a ‘verified by Twilio’ list. This list lets companies get verified, and they’re working on ways to let you know the reason why they’re calling without having to answer your phone. This can be difficult because each country has different regulations.Dominik talks about what it would take for someone who wanted to build an SMS gateway themselves. They would have to work with carriers and learn SMS protocols. It’s important to note that SMS and phone calls have different protocolsDominik talks about some of the unique use cases they’ve seen their system. Some examples are contextual communications, account verifications, and codex creation. There are other fun examples, such as a drone controlled via text message, a fake boyfriend app, and a dog that was taught to take selfies that are sent to his owner.\xa0Charles asks about ways to get started with Twilio. If you want to explore this and don’t know where to get started, try Twilio Quest, a game to teach you how to use Twilio. There is also documentation, which is good if you know exactly what you want to achieve, or if you just want to explore possibilities then download Twilio Quest.\xa0They delve into a more specific use case for Twilio to send text to subscibers of DevChatTV. Dominik talks about ways of dealing with sending notifications to people outside of the US. You can send with a US number to any country code, or you can personalize it, so that people in the UK receive it from a UK number and so on through automatic geocode matching. They talk about Twilio’s billing.\xa0Finally, they talk about security within telephony in light of recent hacks. They discuss the security of two factor authentication.Two factor authentication and security, especially in light of recent hacks. Dominik talks about the API called Authy, where you can implement different ways of doing two factor authentication, such as push notifications, time based one time password, sms, and phone calls. For most people in the world two factor authentication is very safe, unless you’re a very important person, then you’re more at risk for targeted attacks. They conclude by talking about Twilio’s acquisition of Sendgrid.PanelistsCharles Max WoodWith special guest: Dominik KundelSponsorsiPhreaks ShowSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planRuby RoguesLinksTwilioFlexReactRustTwilio QuestTwilio docsTwilio Completes Acquisition of SendgridAuthyFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Superfans by Pat FlynnNeilpatel.com \xa0Dominik Kundel:Enable a setting called javascript.implicitFollow him @dkundel | Episode SummarySurma is an open web advocate for Google currently working with WebAssembly team. He was invited on the show today to talk about using web workers and how to move work away from the browser’s main thread. His primary platform is bringing multithreading out of the fringes and into the web.\xa0The panel talks about their past experience with web workers, and many of them found them isolated and difficult to use. Surma believes that web workers should pretty much always be sued because the main thread is an inherently bad place to run your code because it has to do so much. Surma details the differences between web workers, service workers, and worklets and explains what the compositer is.\xa0The panel discusses what parts should be moved off the main thread and how to move the logic over. Surma notes that the additional cost of using a worker is basically nonexistent, changes almost nothing in your workflow, and takes up only one kilobyte of memory. Therefore, the cost/benefit ratio of using web workers gets very large. They discuss debugging in a web worker and Surma details how debugging is better in web workers.\xa0Surma wants to see people use workers not because it will make it faster, but because it will make your app more resilient across all devices. Every piece of JavaScript you run could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. There’s so much to do on the main thread for the browser, especially when it has a weaker processor, that the more stuff you can move away, the better.The web is tailored for the most powerful phones, but a large portion of the population does not have the most powerful phone available, and moving things over to a web worker will benefit the average phone. Surma talks about his experience using the Nokia 2, on which simple apps run very slow because they are not being frugal with the user’s resources. Moving things to another thread will help phones like this run faster.\xa0\xa0The panel discusses the benefit of using web workers from a business standpoint. The argument is similar to that for accessibility. Though a user may not need that accessibility all the time, they could become in need of it. Making the app run better on low end devices will also increase the target audience, which is helpful is user acquisition is your principle metric for success.\xa0Surma wants businesses to understand that while this is beneficial for people in countries like India, there is also a very wide spectrum of phone performance in America. He wants to help all of these people and wants companies acknowledge this spectrum and to look at the benefits of using web workers to improve performance.PanelistsCharles Max WoodChristopher BuechelerAimee KnightAJ O’NealWith special guest: SurmaSponsorsAdventures in DevOpsSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in AngularLinksWeb workersService workersWorklets\xa0Ecto modelBabelSwooshComlinkWhatsAppFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:For Love of Mother-NotSurma:Follow Surma @DasSurma on Twitter and at dassur.maWebAssembly SpecAJ O’Neal:The GameCube UltimatePikmin for Wii and GameCubeSuper Monkey BallChristopher BuechelerCinemaSins Sincast podcast | Episode SummaryDouglas is a language architect and helped with the development of JavaScript. He started working with JavaScript in 2000. He talks about his journey with the language, including his initial confusion and struggles, which led him to write his book JavaScript: The Good Parts.Douglas’ take on JavaScript is unique because he not only talks about what he likes, but what he doesn’t like. Charles and Douglas discuss some of the bad parts of JavaScript, many of which were mistakes because the language was designed and released in too little time. Other mistakes were copied intentionally from other languages because people are emotionally attached to the way things “have always been done”, even if there is a better way.Doug takes a minimalist approach to programming. They talk about his opinions on pairing back the standard library and bringing in what’s needed. Douglas believes that using every feature of the language in everything you make is going to get you into trouble. Charles and Douglas talk about how to identify what parts are useful and what parts are not.Douglas delves into some of the issues with the ‘this’ variable. He has experimented with getting rid of ‘this’ and found that it made things easier and programs smaller. More pointers on how to do functional programming can be found in his book How JavaScript Works\xa0Charles and Douglas talk about how he decided which parts were good and bad. Douglas talks about how automatic semicolon insertion and ++ programming are terrible, and his experiments with getting rid of them. He explains the origin of JS Lint. After all, most of our time is not spent coding, it’s spent debugging and maintaining, so there’s no point in optimizing keystrokes.Douglas talks about his experience on the ECMAScript development committee and developing JavaScript. He believes that the most important features in ES6 were modules and proper tail calls. They discuss whether or not progression or digression is occurring within JavaScript. Douglas disagrees with all the ‘clutter’ that is being added and the prevalent logical fallacy that if more complexity is added in the language then the program will be simpler.\xa0Charles asks Douglas about his plans for the future. His current priority is the next language. He talks about the things that JavaScript got right, but does not believe that it should not be the last language. He shares how he thinks that languages should progress. There should be a focus on security, and security should be factored into the language.\xa0Douglas is working on an implementation for a new language he calls Misty. He talks about where he sees Misty being implemented. He talks about his Frontend Masters course on functional programming and other projects he’s working on. The show concludes with Douglas talking about the importance of teaching history in programming.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodWith special guest: Douglas CrockfordSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planViews on VueLinksJavaScript: The Good PartsHow JavaSript Works“This” variableECMAScriptC++JS LintECMA TC39DojoPromiseRxJSDrsesMistyTail callFrontend Masters course JavaScript the Good PartsFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Superfans by Pat FlynnSEO course Agency Unlocked by Neil PatelDouglas Crockford:The Art of Computer Programming by Donald KnuthGame of ThronesFollow Douglas at crockford.com | Episode SummaryTodd Gardner is a software developer, podcaster on the show Script and Style, startup founder,\xa0 and comedy host for Pub Conf, a ‘comedy after party for developers’. Since he was last on the show 6 years ago, he has seen his startup TrackJS become quite successful. TrackJS is a JavaScript error monitoring service which gives you visibility into your client side experience. It’s different from other tools because focused on simplicity, so you’ll never need a guy on your team dedicated solely to TrackJS because everyone can use it.The panel begins by talking about debugging methods and tools. Some rely solely on the debugger built into their platform while others prefer to use a third party service. They discuss the necessity of using a third party debugger and if there are better solutions than just the built in debugger.\xa0They then discuss what to do after you’ve fixed a bug, such as if it is necessary to write a test to make sure it was completely fixed They talk about things to do to make debugging more effective. Todd and Aimee believe that code needs to begin by being designed for debug-ability.\xa0The panel discusses issues with invisible boundaries encountered while debugging, such as running out of memory. They talk about ways to mitigate issues that happen outside of your code base. Todd talks about the dangers of ad-blockers, and the panel agrees that it is important to consider how your website will be crippled by the user’s own technology. The end user in a production environment will have a different experience than you did writing it on a professional computer.\xa0Todd talks about the difference between debugging for the web versus a mobile application. Todd has encountered particular problems with debugging on a remote device, and he talks about how he solved the issue.

Transposit was born from the desire to build a way for developers to work with lots of different APIs, take authentication and pagination off the table, and let developers focus on the problems they’re trying to solve. Transposit is a serverless platform that’s free and gives you a combination of SQL or JavaScript to start playing with your API.Since interacting with API data securely can be difficult, the panel discusses how Transposit might replace the personally built tools and how does it compare to JAMstack. They talk about some common things that people do wrong with security.\xa0Transposit is often used as the full backend, and Adam shares how that works. There is a list of APIs that Transposit can talk to, and you can build your own connector. You can also work with JavaScript and SQL simultaneously.\xa0Chris Ferdinandi asks some more specific questions about how Transposit can work with email lists. Adam clarifies the difference between connectors and apps in Transposit. He delves into more detail on what makes it work under the hood.\xa0There are some 450,000 Stack applications but the majority have one user because they built it to communicate specifically with their API. The panel discusses how Transposit can help with this. Since Transposit is still in startup mode, it is free for now, and can connect to any public facing API. Adam talks about their decision not to make it open source and gives more details on where the authentications occur.

He goes through each of the points in the tweet and talks about each of them in turn. There are only two points he sort of agrees with, and believes the rest to be absolute garbage. One of the issues with this tweet is that it doesn’t define what a 10x engineer is. Defining a 10x engineer is difficult because it is also impossible to measure a truly average engineer because there are many factors that play into measuring productivity. Chuck turns the discussion to what a 10x engineer is to him and how to find one. A 10x engineer is dependent on the organization that they are a part of, because they are not simply found, they are made. When a 10x engineer is added to a team, the productivity of the entire team increases. Employers have to consider firstly what you need in your team and how a person would fit in. You want to avoid changing the entire culture of your organization. Consider also that a 10x engineer may be hired as a 2x engineer, but it is the employer that turns them into a 10x engineer. Overall, Chuck believes these tweets are asinine because it’s impossible to measure what makes a 10x engineer in the first place, and hiring a person that fits the attributes in the list would be toxic to your company.\xa0Links10x engineer twitter threadFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Copyhackers.comGood to Great by Jim CollinsKeto dietPodcast Movement | SponsorsAdventures in BlockchainSentry– use the code “devchat” for $100 credit\xa0My Ruby StoryPanelAimee Knight\xa0Chris BuechelerAJ O’NealWith Special Guest: Brian LonsdorfEpisode SummaryBrian Lonsdorf works for Salesforce, specializes in functional programming, and wrote a book called Professor Frisby’s Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming. Brian talks about when he got into functional programming and when in their career others should be exposed to it. He talks about the fundamental tenets of functional programming (static mathematical functions), how it differs from object oriented programming, and how to manipulate data in a functional environment. The panel wonders if it is possible to use functional and object oriented programming together and discuss the functional core imperative shell. Brian talks about what is ‘super functional’ and why JavaScript isn’t, but includes methods for making it work. He shares some of the trade-offs he’s found while doing functional programming. Brian defines a monad and goes over some of the common questions he gets about functional programming, such as how to model an app using functional programming.

He has worked for BBC, The Guardian, and The Financial Times in the UK. He has also worked in the US for SalesForce and currently works for Shopify on their Polaris design system. Shopify has multiple design systems, and Polaris is open source. Today the panel is talking about design systems and developer tooling around design systems.\xa0To begin, Kaelig explains what a design system is. A design system is all of the cultural practices around design and shipping a product. It includes things like the words, colors, spacing grid system, and typography, plus guidance on how to achieve that in code. The panelists discuss what has made design systems so popular. Design systems have been around for a while, but became popular due to the shift to components, which has been accelerated by the popularity of React. The term design system is also misused by a lot of people, for it is much more than having a Sketch file.\xa0Next, they talk about whether design systems fall under the jurisdiction of a frontend developer or web designers. Kaelig has found that a successful design system involves a little bit of everyone and shouldn’t be isolated to one team. They talk about what the developer workflow looks like in a design system. It begins with thinking of a few common rules, a language, and putting it into code. As you scale, design systems can become quite large and it’s impossible for one person to know everything. You either give into the chaos, or you start a devops practice where people start to think about how we build, release, and the path from designer’s brain to production.The panelists then talk about how to introduce a design system into a company where there are cultural conflicts. Kaelig shares his experience working with SalesForce and introducing a design system there. They discuss what aspects of a design system that would make people want to use it over what the team is currently doing. Usually teams are thankful for the design system. It’s important to build a system that’s complete, flexible, and extensible so that you can adapt it to your team. A good design system incorporates ‘subatomic’ parts like the grid system, color palette, and typography, referred to as design tokens. Design systems enable people to take just the bits of the design system that are interesting to them and build the components that are missing more easily.\xa0The conversation turns to the installation and upgrade process of a design system. Upgrading is left up to the customer to do on their own time in most cases, unless it’s one of the big customers. They talk about the role of components in upgrading a design system. Kaelig talks about the possibility of Shopify transitioning to web components. Kaelig shares some of his favorite tools for making a design system and how to get started making one. A lot of design teams start by taking a ton of screen shots and looking at all the inconsistencies.Giving them that visibility is a good thing because it helps get everyone get on the same page. The panelists talk about the role of upper management in developing components and how to prioritize feature development. Kaelig talks about what drives the decision to take a feature out. The two main reasons a feature would be removed is because the company wants to change the way things are done and there’s a different need that has arisen. The show concludes by discussing the possibility of a design system getting bloated over time. Kaelig says that Design systems takes some of the burden off your team, help prevent things from getting bloated, allow you to ship less code.\xa0PanelistsChris FerdinandiAimee KnightSteve EmmerichWith special guest: Kaelig Deloumeau-PrigentSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in BlockchainLinksShopify PolarisBootstrapReactSketch.uiFigma.ui\xa0CSSStoryBookESLintJestEnsignWebpackerFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksSteve Emmerich:CedarWorks play beds\xa0Azure’s container instancesAimee Knight:Awesome Actions for GithubChris Ferdinandi:Free Meek docuseriesSimplicity: Part 2 by Bastian AllgeierKaelig Deloumeau-Prigent:DependabotInk by Vadim DemedezFollow Kaelig on Twitter @kaelig | In this episode of My JavaScript Story, Charles talks to Dan Pastori, Co-Founder, Software Architect at 521 Dimensions.Charles asks about Dan\'s average day and what his life looks like before diving into his coding journey.

Martin The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science by Cherie Mason and J. Kenji López-AltCharles Max Wood:Headliner App | Jonathan Lee Martin is an instructor and developer. He got his start in teaching at Big Nerd Ranch doing 1-2 week trainings for mid to senior developers, and then transitioned to 16 week courses for career switchers. He also worked for Digital Crafts for a year, and then wanted to focus on building out his own personal teaching brand. One of his first steps toward building his own brand was to publish his book, Functional Design Patterns for Express.js.The inspiration for Jonathan’s book came from his experience teaching career switchers. He wanted to experiment in the classroom with teaching functional programming in a way that would be very approachable and applicable and dispel some of the magic around backend programming, and that became the template for the book.\xa0Jonathan loves the minimalist nature of Express.js and talks about its many uses. He believes that it knowing design patterns can take you pretty far in programming, and this view is related to his background in Rails. When he was working in Rails taming huge middleware stacks, he discovered that applying design patterns made builds take less time. He talks about other situations where knowing design patterns has helped. Express.js leans towards object oriented style over functional programming, and so it takes to these patterns well. Express.js has its shortcomings, and that’s where Jonathan’s favorite library Koa comes into play.\xa0The conversation switches back to Jonathan’s book, which is a good way to start learning these higher level concepts. He purposely made it appealing to mid and senior level programmers, but at the same time it does not require a lot of background knowledge. Jonathan talks about his teaching methods that give people a proper appreciation for the tool. Jonathan talks more about why he likes to use Express.js and chose to use it for his book. He cautions that his book is not a book of monads, but rather about being influenced by the idea of composition over inheritance. He talks about the role of middleware in programming.\xa0The panel asks about Jonathan’s toolchain and approach to writing books, and he explains how his books are set up to show code. They discuss the different forms required when publishing a book such as epub, MOBI, and PDF. Jonathan found it difficult to distribute his book through Amazon, so he talks about how he built his own server. Charles notes that your method of distributing your book will depend on your goal. If you want to make the most money possible, make your own site. If you want to get it into as many hands as possible, get it on Amazon.Many of the JavaScript Jabber panelists have had experience publishing books, and Jonathan shares that you can reach out to a publisher after you’ve self-published a book and they can get it distributed. Jonathan believes that If he had gone straight to a publisher, he would have gotten overwhelmed and given up on the book, but the step by step process of self-publishing kept things manageable. The panelists discuss difficulties encountered when publishing and editing books, especially with Markdown. Jonathan compares the perks of self-editing to traditional editing. Though he does not plan to opensource his entire editing pipeline, he may make some parts available. The show concludes with the panelists discussing the clout that comes with being a published author.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodChristopher Buecheler\xa0J.C.

Today the panel is talking about the upcoming Ember update, which Mike calls a total reinvention of the way you build with Ember. Finally, they are letting go of the cruft and stuff they had to hold on to in order to support IE8 and using modern interfaceThe panel talks about some of the issues with IE8, and agree that the reason Ember felt its age because it was built for IE8. Ember 314 is moving from the past into the present, a sleek modern way to build apps. Mike talks about how easy the new Ember is to use.\xa0Mike talks about the excitement in the Ember community because the new build is focused on stability and seamlessness. Charles talks about his less seamless experience with the Angular community. For context, Mike North’s first frontend masters course was recorded in 2014, and he’s only had to change two lines of code. Ember is the only framework that has managed to go all the way from IE7/IE8 to today without a major gap,breaks, or rewrites.They transition to talking about what keeps Ember going. There is an effort to make sure things are decentralized and not tied to any specific company, although Apple, Netflix, Nasa, and PlaysStation all use it. LinkedIn has also been hiring Ember core member to continue working on it, and sponsoring open source work.\xa0Next, they talk about how Ember works with TypeScript. You can install an Ember add on with one terminal command that will enable TypeScript in an Ember app.There are some issues that could cause misalignment with JavaScript and TypeScript, but Ember has designed things around it. MIke talks about the major change in the learning curve with using Ember and how far Vanilla JS will take you. Overall, it is a lot more approachable than it used to be.\xa0They move on to talk about the availability of third party solutions with Ember. Mike assures them that Ember has add-ons, and parts of the framework are opening up to allow experimentation with components. There are lots of ways to make Ember your own without running the risk of diverging, giving more flexibility than ever while maintaining the happy path. Testing within Ember is also a priority, and they want the code to be as readable as possible.The last topic discussed in this show is the importance of developer education. LinkedIn looks at employment numbers and the rate at which new jobs open, and software engineering is growing like crazy and will likely continue to grow.The rate at which new people are graduating with computer science and programming degrees, as well as those from unconventional backgrounds, is not keeping up with the number of jobs. This means that there will be fewer senior people spread across bigger groups of developers with less experience. The panel agrees that it is the responsibility of people who have been around or learned something period to pass on the knowledge because the more knowledge is passed on, the more stable things will remain as seniors become more scarce. It is also important for companies to level up junior developers. They conclude by talking about tools available for people who want to learn more about Ember Octane, and Mike makes an open request to the JS community.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodSteve EmmerichChris FerdinandiAimee KnightAJ O’NealChristopher BuechelerWith special guest: Mike NorthSponsorsReact Native RadioSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planDev Ed PodcastLinksEmberFrontend MastersIE8Ember OctaneSprout CoreTypeScriptES6Lodash\xa0MochaBackstop.js\xa0Semverhttps://twitter.com/thefalken/status/1177483501777473537Follow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksChris Ferdinandi:Vanilla JS Academy, get 30% off with code ‘jsjabber’leanweb.devSteve Emmerich:123 MagicRGDKAimee Knight:Recursion blog postWholesome Provisions Protein CerealAJ O’Neal:Carby V2 by Insurrection IndustriesGameCube ModsCharles Max Wood:Nikon D5600Rode NewsshooterViltrox light panelQuest Nutrition pumpkin barsChristopher Buecheler:Tool’s Fear Inoculum on Apple Music, Spotify, and Google PlayMike North:Github UniverseGithub Tracer BenchFollow Mike @mike-north on Github, @northm on LinkedIn, and @michaellnorth on Twitter | Episode SummaryDominik Kundel works as developer evangelist at Twilio. Dominik talks about the history of Twilio, which actually started with integrating phone calls into apps and then moved to SMS integration.\xa0Today Charles and Dominik are talking about how the SMS message approach can augment your user experience. Since many people are not familiar with implementing SMS, Dominik talks about how Twilio can help. Twilio created was a supernetwork where they work with carriers and gateways around the world to ensure that they provide reliable services. They also focus heavily on making sure that the developer experience is great.Uber and Lyft are two of the companies that use Twilio, and Dominik shares some of the interesting things that they’ve accomplished. He is particularly excited about phone number masking to support privacy. Uber and Lyft use phone number masking so that your driver doesn’t see your real number and you don’t see theirs. Instead, each of you sees a Twilio number. This use case is becoming more common.\xa0Twilio recently introduced Flex, which Dominik explains is their contact center solution. Flex is designed to keep with their philosophy of everything should be programmable and configurable, and take it on to a software shipment. This is their first time shipping software instead of just APIs. Flex is highly customizable and flexible, allows you to build React plugins that let you change anything you want.Charles asks Dominik about some of the gotchas in telephony. One major issues is spam calls, which Twilio is trying to work with some providers on a ‘verified by Twilio’ list. This list lets companies get verified, and they’re working on ways to let you know the reason why they’re calling without having to answer your phone. This can be difficult because each country has different regulations.Dominik talks about what it would take for someone who wanted to build an SMS gateway themselves. They would have to work with carriers and learn SMS protocols. It’s important to note that SMS and phone calls have different protocolsDominik talks about some of the unique use cases they’ve seen their system. Some examples are contextual communications, account verifications, and codex creation. There are other fun examples, such as a drone controlled via text message, a fake boyfriend app, and a dog that was taught to take selfies that are sent to his owner.\xa0Charles asks about ways to get started with Twilio. If you want to explore this and don’t know where to get started, try Twilio Quest, a game to teach you how to use Twilio. There is also documentation, which is good if you know exactly what you want to achieve, or if you just want to explore possibilities then download Twilio Quest.\xa0They delve into a more specific use case for Twilio to send text to subscibers of DevChatTV. Dominik talks about ways of dealing with sending notifications to people outside of the US. You can send with a US number to any country code, or you can personalize it, so that people in the UK receive it from a UK number and so on through automatic geocode matching. They talk about Twilio’s billing.\xa0Finally, they talk about security within telephony in light of recent hacks. They discuss the security of two factor authentication.Two factor authentication and security, especially in light of recent hacks. Dominik talks about the API called Authy, where you can implement different ways of doing two factor authentication, such as push notifications, time based one time password, sms, and phone calls. For most people in the world two factor authentication is very safe, unless you’re a very important person, then you’re more at risk for targeted attacks. They conclude by talking about Twilio’s acquisition of Sendgrid.PanelistsCharles Max WoodWith special guest: Dominik KundelSponsorsiPhreaks ShowSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planRuby RoguesLinksTwilioFlexReactRustTwilio QuestTwilio docsTwilio Completes Acquisition of SendgridAuthyFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Superfans by Pat FlynnNeilpatel.com \xa0Dominik Kundel:Enable a setting called javascript.implicitFollow him @dkundel | This episode of My JavaScript Story is coming to you live from OSCON. Joining Charles Max Wood is Daniel Gruesso from GitLab to talk about developing in the Open Source and the Developer Report.GitLab works with an open core model, Daniel talks about the trade - offs of having code open to public, the first of which is having everything up-to-date so any contributions made will work with the latest version. Daniel calls this the "bus-factor" where if one of the team members gets hit by a bus, the rest of the team will have everything to work with.They then talk about the GitLab 2019 Global Developer Report results. One of the most interesting results of this survey with over 4,000 respondents, was that remote teams outperformed on site teams. This ties into the current Twitter discussion about "10x Performing Engineers". Remote teams are able to work on their own most productive hours and are not disturbed by their teammates when they are doing dedicated work on a deadline. Also remote teams by nature have to be more conscious of security.SponsorsSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry small planAdventures in DevOpsAdventures in BlockchainCacheFlyHost: Charles Max WoodJoined by Special Guest:\xa0Daniel GruessoLinksDaniel\'s LinkedInGitLabOpen Source & Software Development| O\'Reilly OSCONGitLab 2019 Global Developer Report | GitLab10x Engineer Twitter | Episode SummarySurma is an open web advocate for Google currently working with WebAssembly team. He was invited on the show today to talk about using web workers and how to move work away from the browser’s main thread. His primary platform is bringing multithreading out of the fringes and into the web.\xa0The panel talks about their past experience with web workers, and many of them found them isolated and difficult to use. Surma believes that web workers should pretty much always be sued because the main thread is an inherently bad place to run your code because it has to do so much. Surma details the differences between web workers, service workers, and worklets and explains what the compositer is.\xa0The panel discusses what parts should be moved off the main thread and how to move the logic over. Surma notes that the additional cost of using a worker is basically nonexistent, changes almost nothing in your workflow, and takes up only one kilobyte of memory. Therefore, the cost/benefit ratio of using web workers gets very large. They discuss debugging in a web worker and Surma details how debugging is better in web workers.\xa0Surma wants to see people use workers not because it will make it faster, but because it will make your app more resilient across all devices. Every piece of JavaScript you run could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. There’s so much to do on the main thread for the browser, especially when it has a weaker processor, that the more stuff you can move away, the better.The web is tailored for the most powerful phones, but a large portion of the population does not have the most powerful phone available, and moving things over to a web worker will benefit the average phone. Surma talks about his experience using the Nokia 2, on which simple apps run very slow because they are not being frugal with the user’s resources. Moving things to another thread will help phones like this run faster.\xa0\xa0The panel discusses the benefit of using web workers from a business standpoint. The argument is similar to that for accessibility. Though a user may not need that accessibility all the time, they could become in need of it. Making the app run better on low end devices will also increase the target audience, which is helpful is user acquisition is your principle metric for success.\xa0Surma wants businesses to understand that while this is beneficial for people in countries like India, there is also a very wide spectrum of phone performance in America. He wants to help all of these people and wants companies acknowledge this spectrum and to look at the benefits of using web workers to improve performance.PanelistsCharles Max WoodChristopher BuechelerAimee KnightAJ O’NealWith special guest: SurmaSponsorsAdventures in DevOpsSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in AngularLinksWeb workersService workersWorklets\xa0Ecto modelBabelSwooshComlinkWhatsAppFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:For Love of Mother-NotSurma:Follow Surma @DasSurma on Twitter and at dassur.maWebAssembly SpecAJ O’Neal:The GameCube UltimatePikmin for Wii and GameCubeSuper Monkey BallChristopher BuechelerCinemaSins Sincast podcast | Episode SummaryMy JavaScript Story this week meets with Nick Basile, UX instructor at Lambda School from Austin, TX.

He started working with JavaScript in 2000. He talks about his journey with the language, including his initial confusion and struggles, which led him to write his book JavaScript: The Good Parts.Douglas’ take on JavaScript is unique because he not only talks about what he likes, but what he doesn’t like. Charles and Douglas discuss some of the bad parts of JavaScript, many of which were mistakes because the language was designed and released in too little time. Other mistakes were copied intentionally from other languages because people are emotionally attached to the way things “have always been done”, even if there is a better way.Doug takes a minimalist approach to programming. They talk about his opinions on pairing back the standard library and bringing in what’s needed. Douglas believes that using every feature of the language in everything you make is going to get you into trouble. Charles and Douglas talk about how to identify what parts are useful and what parts are not.Douglas delves into some of the issues with the ‘this’ variable. He has experimented with getting rid of ‘this’ and found that it made things easier and programs smaller. More pointers on how to do functional programming can be found in his book How JavaScript Works\xa0Charles and Douglas talk about how he decided which parts were good and bad. Douglas talks about how automatic semicolon insertion and ++ programming are terrible, and his experiments with getting rid of them. He explains the origin of JS Lint. After all, most of our time is not spent coding, it’s spent debugging and maintaining, so there’s no point in optimizing keystrokes.Douglas talks about his experience on the ECMAScript development committee and developing JavaScript. He believes that the most important features in ES6 were modules and proper tail calls. They discuss whether or not progression or digression is occurring within JavaScript. Douglas disagrees with all the ‘clutter’ that is being added and the prevalent logical fallacy that if more complexity is added in the language then the program will be simpler.\xa0Charles asks Douglas about his plans for the future. His current priority is the next language. He talks about the things that JavaScript got right, but does not believe that it should not be the last language. He shares how he thinks that languages should progress. There should be a focus on security, and security should be factored into the language.\xa0Douglas is working on an implementation for a new language he calls Misty. He talks about where he sees Misty being implemented. He talks about his Frontend Masters course on functional programming and other projects he’s working on. The show concludes with Douglas talking about the importance of teaching history in programming.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodWith special guest: Douglas CrockfordSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planViews on VueLinksJavaScript: The Good PartsHow JavaSript Works“This” variableECMAScriptC++JS LintECMA TC39DojoPromiseRxJSDrsesMistyTail callFrontend Masters course JavaScript the Good PartsFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Superfans by Pat FlynnSEO course Agency Unlocked by Neil PatelDouglas Crockford:The Art of Computer Programming by Donald KnuthGame of ThronesFollow Douglas at crockford.com | Episode SummaryTodd Gardner is a software developer, podcaster on the show Script and Style, startup founder,\xa0 and comedy host for Pub Conf, a ‘comedy after party for developers’. Since he was last on the show 6 years ago, he has seen his startup TrackJS become quite successful. TrackJS is a JavaScript error monitoring service which gives you visibility into your client side experience. It’s different from other tools because focused on simplicity, so you’ll never need a guy on your team dedicated solely to TrackJS because everyone can use it.The panel begins by talking about debugging methods and tools. Some rely solely on the debugger built into their platform while others prefer to use a third party service. They discuss the necessity of using a third party debugger and if there are better solutions than just the built in debugger.\xa0They then discuss what to do after you’ve fixed a bug, such as if it is necessary to write a test to make sure it was completely fixed They talk about things to do to make debugging more effective. Todd and Aimee believe that code needs to begin by being designed for debug-ability.\xa0The panel discusses issues with invisible boundaries encountered while debugging, such as running out of memory. They talk about ways to mitigate issues that happen outside of your code base. Todd talks about the dangers of ad-blockers, and the panel agrees that it is important to consider how your website will be crippled by the user’s own technology. The end user in a production environment will have a different experience than you did writing it on a professional computer.\xa0Todd talks about the difference between debugging for the web versus a mobile application. Todd has encountered particular problems with debugging on a remote device, and he talks about how he solved the issue.

About Lindsay and Heather: LINDSAY LONGACRE As a business owner, I dream to cultivate change.\xa0My mom started her own business when I was a kid so that she could be there for me and my brother. I didn't realize back then, but since she has passed, I know that I have the same driving force as she had. I am a country music fan. I love to swear. I am on a mission to find a natural deodorant that actually works. I am a gypsy at heart and believe in the power of sage and palo santo. I love to sing out loud but only do it when I am in the car alone because I am too scared. I would make a terrible employee. I eloped. HEATHER HOESCH Being a wedding planner is not just my job, it is who I am.\xa0I remember that after the first wedding I did, I knew this is what I wanted to do because it was the first time in my life I felt my work could have a purpose. I am obsessed with baby animals. I have over 30 cousins - they are the best. Lists and whiteboards make me super happy. Dancing to EDM in my apartment puts me in a great mood. I would never say no to a spicy margarita.\xa0I have the worst poker face. I para-glided off the top of Aspen Mountain with Lindsay. \xa0 This episode was originally broadcast on September, 19th, 2018. | Check out Wedding CEO School. Enrollment opens today!

You\'re the expert. Your podcast will prove it.\u202f\xa0 \xa0 | In this episode, Jerry Bradshaw, Pat Stuart, Glenn Cooke, Janet Edwards, and Shawn Edwards discuss:  Cannibalism in the industry is about lack of support in the industry for each other. The call-out culture of social media and the effect it has on the dog training industry. Creating community and an international family with dog sports. Training sports as a proofing ground for all types of dog training. How to handle social media, controversy, online trolls, and bad advice.  \u202f Key Takeaways:  There is a power in joining forces and speaking up on issues, not just trying to handle everything individually. Without the ability to communicate with one another, there will be no ability to combat the nonsense of the training industry. Without the sports, you wouldn’t have the canines for military and police work. As a trainer, have a great relationship with your local veterinarians. You have different skills and, together, can best serve the animals. We need to do something now to stop cannibalizing each other.  \u202f "If you stop the tools, then you stop the progress of the dog sports. If you stop the progress of the dog sports, people lose interest in taking their dogs out and being obedient. Then there’s lack of control all over the place and government legislation starts stepping in." — \xa0Glenn Cooke \u202f \u202f Get Jerry\'s book  Controlled Aggression on Amazon.com \xa0 \u202f Contact Pat & Glenn: \xa0 Podcast: The Canine Paradigm \u202f Contact Shawn & Janet: Website: StatelineCanine.com \u202f Contact Jerry: Website: controlledaggressionpodcast.com Tarheel Canine Training: \xa0www.tarheelcanine.com Youtube: \xa0tarheelcanine Twitter: @tarheelcanine Instagram:\u202f@tarheelk9 Facebook: TarheelCanineTraining Protection Sports Website: \xa0psak9.org Patreon: \xa0\xa0patreon.com/controlledaggression \u202f \u202f Train Hard, train smart, be safe. \xa0 \u202f \u202f Show notes by Podcastologist Chelsea Taylor-Sturkie \u202f Audio production by Turnkey Podcast Productions.

The cocktail method of training detection. Psuedo scents and the research behind them. The ever-growing list of questions that comes up as you continue research and the further need for research in canine olfaction. Variations in your training samples.  \u202f Key Takeaways:  We don’t know enough about the threshold of olfaction Train the dog to what you want them to find. Look at actual data. It is easy to see a success story, but the data will tell what’s actually happening. If you don’t set yourself to be wrong, then you’re not doing science.  \u202f "The dog is a dynamic system, they are constantly learning." — \xa0Nathan Hall \u202f Contact Nathan: Bio: https://www.depts.ttu.edu/afs/people/nathan-hall/ LinkedIn: \xa0https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-hall-78306516/ \u202f Get Jerry\'s book  Controlled Aggression on Amazon.com \xa0 \u202f Contact Jerry: Website: controlledaggressionpodcast.com Tarheel Canine Training: \xa0www.tarheelcanine.com Youtube: \xa0tarheelcanine Twitter: @tarheelcanine Instagram:\u202f@tarheelk9 Facebook: TarheelCanineTraining Protection Sports Website: \xa0psak9.org Patreon: \xa0\xa0patreon.com/controlledaggression \u202f \u202f Train Hard, train smart, be safe. \xa0 \u202f \u202f Show notes by Podcastologist Chelsea Taylor-Sturkie \u202f Audio production by Turnkey Podcast Productions.

The evolution of Schutzhund and how it is expressed in IPG. The conception of American Schutzhund and breed testing. The relationship between American Schutzhund and PSA.  \u202f Key Takeaways:  Political pressure has changed the way that dog sports have changed over the years. There will be over 40 exercises for each club to choose from and the results will be recorded for each dog for breed test purposes. There will be updates to American Schutzhund from IPO or original Schutzhund to keep the skills relevant and important. Without good judges you don’t have a sport – not a sport that is equal to all. American Schutzhund is completely inclusive – you can be in other types of clubs and organizations as well as American Schutzhund.  \u202f "We don’t know if we’re going to be successful or not, we may fail. What we do know is this: we’re not sitting around complaining, we’re actually trying to do something. We’re working hard, we’re trying to put an organization together that’s going to make our vision a reality.

It’s a mindset, a family, a ton of free resources, a podcast, great blog posts, relevant topics, and, frankly, a security blanket for busy teachers. Many times it’s pushed our thinking, strengthened our practice, and given us solace. It’s the Cult of Pedagogy, and we had the privilege of speaking to the “Head Teacher Nerd”, Jennifer Gonzalez, about school culture and much much more.Connect with Jennifer GonzalezWebsite: www.cultofpedagogy.com/ | Twitter: @cultofpedagogyConnect with Vrain WavesWebsite: vrainwaves.com | Twitter: @VrainWaves | Becky Twitter: @BeckyEPeters | Ben Twitter: @mrkalbLinks & Show NotesCult of Pedagogy (02:10)Blog, Podcast, YouTube (04:17)Jennifer’s favorite episode: Episode 4 (06:32)Recent Episode with Sal KhanTQE Method postSxSW Keynote - The Aerodynamics of Exceptional Schools (08:19)9 Principles to make change happen: e.g. Validation (blog post on validation)Importance of a strong School Culture & Classroom Culture (11:49)Marigold analogy (14:18)Teachers supporting each other (17:38)Teacher self-care (20:13)Angela WatsonBalancing relationships at work with relationships at home (23:30)Setting boundaries on social media (25:34)List feature | Twitter chatsPromoting positive classroom culture (27:22)Student classroom discussions - blog postIcebreakers360 SpreadsheetsEquity Maps & Chat Stations (29:29)Equity Maps: iPad app to map classroom conversationsChat StationsGrading & Grading Practices (33:50)Blog post: How Accurate are Your Grades?Blog post: 20 Ways to Cut Your Grading Time in HalfStudent Self-Assessment (36:17)Starr SacksteinTodd’s BrainDelaying the Grade postJennifer’s Teachers’ Guide to Tech 2019GeoGuessr gameBecky & Ben’s favorite CoP blog posts (42:49)Pedro Noguera on Cult of Pedagogy5 Second Solution for a Talkative Class YouTube video | ** Cal Newport, Digital Minimalism**Join us to learn from best-selling author & Computer Science professor Cal Newport as we talk to him about exploring the world of digital abundance, using technology with intention, and walking through life with purpose.

Shannon and Kim have really enjoyed this podcast, but we have decided that since we are no longer in the wedding business that it would be best to wrap up From Ring to Veil. The show will still be available and you can listen to all 210 episodes but we will no longer be releasing new episodes. The Facebook group will continue as well as our page. We will still respond to questions asked in the group, so please feel free to reach out there. Life, as it is, is changing a bit for both of us. Not having time to dedicate to this show we would like to leave on a high note and not let the content suffer. We are both moving into different areas that aren’t in the wedding industry and feel that there are other podcasts that will stay relevant.

Join our Facebook Group Timelines and Checklists www.fromringtoveil.com/checklists Traditions can be fun, some useless, some even downright appalling. We thought we’d share a few from around the world with you. Who knows you might want to include one or two in your wedding.  From Brides.com and other sources  Mexico: As a Mexican bride and groom are exchanging their vows, the minister drapes a "lazo," or lasso, made of rosary beads and flowers around their shoulders in the shape of a figure eight. Not only does "el lazo" represent the union of the couple, but its shape also resembles the infinity symbol, signifying how long they\'re hoping the marriage will last. Italy: The night before the wedding, an Italian groom throws a surprise party outside his bride-to-be\'s window. "La serenata" begins with the groom, backed by musicians, serenading his fiancée, then turns into a full-blown bash, complete with a lavish buffet and all the couple\'s friends and family. South Korea: As part of the "Falaka" ceremony in South Korea, the groom\'s friends and family hold him down as they beat the bottoms of his feet with a stick or dried fish. In between beatings, he\'s asked trivia questions, so the custom is said to help strengthen his memory and his feet. Wales: Back in the day, when a Welshman fell in love and was ready to commit, he carved spoons from wood, called "lovespoons," and gave them to his beloved. Decorations included keys, signifying the key to his heart, and beads, symbolizing the number of children he was hoping for. Peru: In Peruvian weddings, the cake is typically assembled with ribbons attached to charms, one of which is a fake wedding ring. During the reception, all the single women in attendance participate in the "cake pull," each grabbing a ribbon. The single lady who pulls out the fake wedding ring, per tradition, will be the next to get married. Germany: After getting married, couples in Germany are presented with a large log and a saw. By sawing the log in half as a team, it is believed they are proving their ability to work together in overcoming obstacles. Ireland: In Ireland, when the bride and groom are dancing, the bride must keep at least one foot on the floor at all times. Irish folklore states that if she doesn\'t, evil fairies will come and sweep her away. This might make dancing slightly difficult... Russia: In a gesture of respect, couples in Moscow often take wedding photos at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin, then lay down flowers afterward. Norway: Norwegian tradition states that the bride will wear an ornate silver and gold crown that has small charms dangling all around it. When she moves, the tinkling sound is supposed to deflect evil spirits. Guatemala: the parents of Guatemalan grooms can do whatever they want, including smashing things. When the newlyweds arrive, it\'s a tradition that the groom\'s mom breaks a white ceramic bell filled with grains like rice and flour to bring prosperity to the couple. French: French brides and grooms traditionally eat chocolate and champagne after the reception. They must consume these treats from a toilet bowl. The point is to give the twosome strength before their wedding night. Egypt: For good luck, Egyptian women pinch the bride on her wedding day. Sweden: A Swedish bride puts a silver coin from her father and a gold coin from her mother in each shoe to ensure that she\'ll never do without. Morocco: Moroccan women take a milk bath to purify themselves before their wedding ceremony. Holland: a pine tree is planted outside the newlyweds\' home as a symbol of fertility and luck. South Africa: The parents of both bride and groom traditionally carried fire from their hearths to light a new fire in the newlyweds\' hearth. Iceland: So significant was the drinking and loss of money that in the late 1700s the Icelandic government put a stop to the alcohol-fueled weddings. Celebrations were patrolled and soon weddings were referred to as “bread parties.” Coffee and pastries were enjoyed and the Kransekaka cake became a favorite wedding tradition. Quite different from Anglo wedding desserts, the cake is made of layered pastry wreaths concealing a bottle of wine or a tower of chocolates and candies inside. Austria: The auction of the bridal shoe is very popular in Austria. It helps to fill the newlyweds’ purse. Like at a real auction all wedding guests bid on the shoe. The custom stipulates, however, that the final bid is made by the father, best man or groom. Only with a purchased shoe can he uphold the honor of his daughter or wife.

I have been binge listening since I got engaged! I love your interviews but also enjoy when just you two chat. I am sorry if this has already been a question, I tried to search it within the group. My mom and I are not close, my fiancé and I have planned and are paying for our wedding. My mom wants to be involved and has even bought shirts for two of the guys in the wedding party without telling us, in a different color than the rest of the wedding party will be wearing. After I found out I called the two guys and told them not to worry the shirts they had already were what we wanted so everyone matches. We planned it so we could have the wedding we want. She is intent on being involved somehow any ideas how to solve this? I have heard suggestions like flowers or something but that is already taken care of and I am anticipating a blowout with us or my sister who lives with her and her refusal to come to the wedding. (this is not uncommon she left my sisters graduation party because my sister invited her half-brother) If she does not come besides the initial awkwardness with my family and my stepdad (who I am close to) there I don\'t think it would bother me. In fact, I hope it happens before the wedding rather than at the wedding. Any advice or possible solutions much appreciated!

Catering-buffet, passed appetizers, single menu options Drinks   Charitable favor/no favors/favors as centerpieces Chairs moved from ceremony to reception Disposable plates for cake Suburb restaurants can be less pricey than inner city Ask about kids pricing for catering or have a separate menu Buy secondhand decor Late night snacks but not for everyone, since not everyone will close out the night  Listener Question: Hello! So my mom and others really want to help me make decisions and do the research involved with hiring our vendors and such. How do I politely tell them when I expect them to do their part? I\'d think that within a couple of days to a week it would be acceptable to check back in for a progress report, but I\'ve been finding that they haven\'t gotten to that task yet.

Thank you for all your advice it’s been really helpful. I was wondering, do you have an episode that talks about having a friend/family member officiate the ceremony?? We want a close friend of ours to officiate our wedding but he has never done one before and I have only been  in one other wedding so I’m not an expert either. We are doing a very casual, non - religious ceremony but I still want to make sure we are legally married by the end of it Any advice or sources you have would be greatly appreciated! !

Your officiant must complete the marriage license Members of the clergy, judges, justices of the peace, and some notary publics are all qualified to perform weddings. Oddly enough, in some states, an officiant isn’t required at all. In Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, a couple can simply marry in front of witnesses and submit the required paperwork to the state, no officiant needed.  ________________ Here\'s how much the average wedding costs in every state:  https://www.thisisinsider.com/average-cost-of-wedding-every-state-2019-2#wyoming-26017-51 Seattle Metro Area Wedding Planning Resource Guide ( http://fromringtoveil.com/rgpaperback ) ( http://fromringtoveil.com/rgkindle ) FRTV Swag www.fromringtoveil.com/tee  Join our Facebook Group Subscribe to the podcast: { Apple Podcasts }{ Spotify }{ Stitcher }{ Youtube } { iHeartradio }{ Alexa }{ CastBox }{ GooglePodcasts } -Until next time, No Stress No Worries Keep Calm and Listen On – \xa0 | The In’s and Out’s of Wedding Registries-Episode # 203 Pause and subscribe! Join our Facebook Group Timelines and Checklists www.fromringtoveil.com/checklists The wedding registry business has changed in the last few years. Most couples are getting married later in life or have lived together for a while and have the household items they need. There are now registries for other things besides housewares and linens. We are going to go over that plus where and how to register. Tips for a good registry  Take stock of items you have and items you need to replace Register at more than one store- we recommend one online, one box store and one specialty store. Try not to overlap registries Keep track of everything, you will need to send Thank you notes out. Always check the return policy Don’t add the registry to your wedding invitation- add it to your website and shower invites  What to register for in a typical registry:  Tableware Formal dinnerware (China) Informal dinnerware Silverware/flatware glasses Linens Sheets, pillowcases Towels Tablecloths Placemats napkins Cook and kitchenware Pot and pans Cooking utensils Small electric appliances  A Bridal Registry is Not Only About the Kitchen - Episode #22 Where to find a typical registry  Department stores  Macy’s Nordstroms JCPenney Tiffany & Co     Big Box Stores  Wal-Mart Target Bed Bath and Beyond     Online  Amazon Zola Wayfair     Specialty Stores  Crate and Barrel Pottery Barn Williams and Sonoma   Honeymoon funds and gift fund sites Gift cards for airlines and hotels Honeymoon excursions Dinner and drink gift cards Add funds for trips and house Large item gift collection  Recap on thank you notes- How to Express your Gratitude, Episode #73  Set aside a part of every day to write thank you notes. Send thank you notes within 3 months of gift receipt but can be done up to a year.  Here is The Emily Post\'s 10 do\'s and don\'ts for Thank You Notes-  Do personalize your notes and make reference to the person as well as the gift. Do remember that a gift should be acknowledged with the same courtesy and generous spirit in which it was given. Do be enthusiastic, but don’t gush. Avoid saying a gift is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen unless you really mean it. Don’t send form letters or cards with printed messages and just your signature; don’t use email or post a generic thank you on your wedding web site in lieu of a personal note. Do promptly acknowledge the receipt of shipped gifts by sending a note right away or calling and following up with a written note in a day or two. Don’t mention that you plan to return a gift or that you are dissatisfied in any way. Don’t tailor your note to the perceived value of the gift; no one should receive a perfunctory note. Do refer to the way you will use a gift of money. Mentioning the amount is optional. Don’t include wedding photos or use photo cards if it will delay sending the note. Don’t use being late as an excuse not to write. Even if you are still sending notes after your first anniversary, keep writing!

People around you feeling comfortable with your photographer feeling comfortable with your partner, or who you’re being photographed with choose a more secluded location if you’re introverted don’t have people watching your photo shoot if you’re not 100% comfortable with that Atmosphere Play music that brings up your mood/helps with movement Have a LITTLE wine Make sure the temp is okay for you/dress for the temp Take a break if you need one Bring a snack/water Prep Eat something! You’ll want energy meditate/visualize yourself having fun do a light workout or yoga if you can avoid the news/anything that stresses you. Instead, listen to music that makes you happy take a moment with your partner before the shoot and just look into his/her eyes for a full three to four minutes (dopamine) Ask your photographer for help for prompts to bring out fun emotions Both you and your partner can come up with fun challenges to help each other to have fun and get great photos *slow run competition *yell the artist/name of each song as it comes on (one point for each) *dance with each other *bear hug, or have him pick you up Avoid planning a shoot that you’ll have to wake up very early for unless you’re used to that. Choose a time of day that you know you’re productive.

THANK YOU SO MUCH for your FABULOUS podcasts, which by the way, have inspired and taught me more than any magazine or book on the shelf EVER could! I may not be a bride...well, I was almost 27 years ago, and my oh my how things have changed; however, I am a Mother of the Bride and not just one bride, but TWO brides. Yes... both of my daughters are getting married one month (technically 5 weeks) apart. The first daughter got married on February 2nd and is currently on her honeymoon, and the second wedding will take place on March 9th. Both daughters have completely different styles, so the second wedding is certainly not going to be a “copy and paste” kind of wedding. Your podcasts have educated me and allowed me to envision a perfect wedding day for both my girls in two totally different spaces! There is absolutely NO WAY I could have planned these weddings without the help of Kim and Shannon! (I actually refer to these two rockstars to my family and friends as my “virtual besties” although I’ve never met them personally!) If you are the bride or the Mother of a Bride, I strongly recommend their podcasts to you! It was a game changer for me, and for that, I will forever be grateful to my two virtual besties! 💕 -Kelly THANK YOU TO OUR SPONSOR:  Seattle Metro Area Wedding Planning Resource Guide ( http://fromringtoveil.com/rgpaperback ) ( http://fromringtoveil.com/rgkindle ) FRTV Swag www.fromringtoveil.com/tee  Join our Facebook Group Subscribe to the podcast: { Apple Podcasts }{ Spotify }{ Stitcher }{ Youtube } { iHeartradio }{ Alexa }{ CastBox }{ GooglePodcasts } -Until next time, No Stress No Worries Keep Calm and Listen On – \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'From Ring to Veil is a wedding planning podcast hosted by Shannon Palmer and Kim Mills.

Since I still haven’t been able to convince my wife to let my buy a used Felder KF700 , what are your thoughts on other sliding table saws. I know you all have conventional cabinet saws. I’m considering getting the Grizzly G0623X as an upgrade to my Ridgid R4512. I’ve also looked at other table saws such as the SawStop and Powermatic PM2000. However with a traditional cabinet saw I’d also be considering getting the Incra Miter 5000. With that the cost ends up being more than the Grizzly. I’d be interested in hearing your guys thoughts on such options. -Ian2)\xa0I’ve recently been looking into moisture meters and found the good ones seem to be $300 and up. I want to ask if you three use a moisture meter? If so, what do you use and recommend? Thanks for the great info on the podcast, it’s been a big help for this new woodworker. Keep up the good work.Matt in Alabama \xa0Sean:1)\xa0Hey guys, really enjoying the podcast. Makes my commutes far more enjoyable! My question for you is regarding resawing. I currently get by with an assortment of hand tools, a Dewalt DWE7491RS table saw with a stand that folds up on end, and a Dewalt thickness planer. While I would love to add a nice 14” bandsaw to the arsenal, I simply do not have the shop space at this moment in time. I am about to start making my wife a jewelry box using walnut for the sides and would like to incorporate a bookmatched maple top. I haven’t worked out the dimensions yet, but I will likely shoot for a panel size in the ballpark of 12”x10”x1/4”. As I see it, my options are to resaw by hand using a 22”-26” panel rip saw (need to purchase, and wouldn’t mind the workout), 10” bandsaw like the Rikon 10-306 (also need to purchase, would not take up too much valuable shop space, and would get me by until my shop space situation improves, which could be a while), or take a 20 minute drive to my buddy’s house to use his bandsaw. The major concern I have about using his bandsaw is running the risk of the resawn boards cupping due to the environmental differences between our shops. The order of my preferences are: using my buddy’s bandsaw first, followed by resawing by hand, and then buying the 10” bandsaw. Your advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks! - John2) How flat is your outfeed/assembly table?I just made a 4’x6’ torsion box top for my outfeed / assembly table to maximize shop space. It didn’t come out as planned is if off as much at 1/64th in some places. Not sure what happened. It Seems to be flat along the length (according to my Veritas straightedge) but for some reason not acrossSeems to be about a 6” strip along one long side that is about 1/64 lower than the rest of the table. -Ray\xa0Huy:1)\xa0My first question is related to the different furniture styles. I hope to one day become a fine furniture maker myself so I am trying to learn more about the various styles (i.e. shaker, green and green, arts and crafts, danish/mid century modern, etc...) I feel that I am starting to get a good idea of what "defines" these styles but if you can provide any additional info on it that would be awesome.Specifically, one thing I struggle with is how wood selection relates to the different styles. I have heard statements before like "I considered making the piece out of Oak but that would take it to a more arts-and-crafts style" and I am a little unclear on how a piece can change styles based on wood selection even though the design is seemingly unchanged. -Bojan2) I have another. Ive been woodworking for two years and i try to tackle a new skill each project. I love learning and love pumping out new pieces. My focus has been on the design and build phase. One area I can’t seem to care about is joinery. Is there anything wrong with dowel construction? I find the DowelMax gives me piston fit joints that are easy, quick and dead square. But sometimes I feel like a hack for not doing more complicated work. The tests I’ve seen show that dowels when used properly are equally as strong as M and T and stronger than dominos. Am I missing out? Can one still build “fine furniture” without M/T’s? Or should I man up and pull out the chisels? -Tanc\xa0Social Media Picks:Guy: @marcadamsschoolofwoodworkingSean: @PedullastudioHuy: @bernchandleyfurniture | Support us on Patreon:\xa0https://www.patreon.com/woodshoplifeQuestionsGuys1)\xa0I would like to have a better understanding of what is safe and what isn’t when cross cutting on the table saw.I have seen lots of videos and read lots of articles that mention how dangerous cross cutting on the table saw can be when the aspect ratio of the work is such that the distance between the blade and the fence exceeds the length of the edge that is against the fence. This makes perfect sense to me as you want to avoid the possibility of the work twisting between the blade and fence and kicking back.However, there are countless videos of supposedly knowledgeable woodworkers breaking down sheet goods and violating this aspect ratio rule. Do these rules not really apply when breaking down sheet goods for some reason?2)\xa0Hello, I just picked up a Incra Ls positioner fence at a yard sale for $20, (they didn\'t know what it was). My question is when do you choose to use the Incra verses using your dovetail jig? I don\'t currently have a dovetail jig, are there some situations where a dovetail jig would be better? Any general discussion on the Incra would be great. Thanks, keep up the good work, the podcast has been excellent! - TravisSeans1)\xa0This is a router operation question. I was recently making a new jig for a project that required that I cut a long slot all the way through a piece that would allow a bolt to slide along that piece. (The piece is 16 by 2 and is about 5/4 thick. I was cutting a 1/4 slot that ran in the middle of the piece for about 15 inches. It would allow bolts to pass through the piece and then it could slide along the bolts so that it\'s position can be adjusted. Hope that makes sense)I was using a 1/4 inch straight cutting bit in a router and making the cut in multiple passes. I had the cutting speed set relatively high (somewhere around 20,000 - 24,000 RPM) and was going about an 1/8 deep per pass. I was using a cheap bit so I was running in shallower passes than I would have thought necessary knowing that the performance of the bit is probably going to be lacking. Despite my best efforts the bit snapped off...Luckily it stayed in the groove I was cutting and did not become a projectile and there was no damage to the tool or the piece.The situation raised a few questions for me: 1. How deep would you plunge that size a bit and expect it to cut without any safety or performance concerns? (my piece was laminated baltic birch ply if the material makes a difference. Bit was a 1/4 inch, 1/4 shank straight cutting bit.)2. Is there something I should be doing in this type of situation to prevent this outcome? I had inserted the bit fully into the collet, I had set it to what I thought was an appropriate speed for it\'s size and I went shallow with my cuts not to stress it too much. Did I do the right things there? Other than getting a better bit, what would you do differently?2)\xa0Hi Guys,My question is about Joiner fences. I picked up an old 6" Delta Shop Master a few years that was in great condition, except that the fence on the outfeed side is welded to the table. I\'ve never had the need to change the fence\'s angle (it\'s welded and calibrated to 90°) but I could see adjusting it\'s depth to reduce wear on my straight blades.Do you guys find your self moving the fence often, or at all and if so, why?Thanks for sharing your expertise and furthering our craft! JustinHuys1)\xa0Ahoy fellas. Absolutely love the podcast, been listening for a long time... BUT first time question for you.Router Slab jigs. I\'m getting ready to do an epoxy table and have seen plenty of "how to" videos on building your own on the Tube of You. But none of them explain how to set them up. What exactly needs to be parallel? Do I need a perfectly flat surface to set my piece on or no? I\'m guessing as long as I shim my workpiece, I\'ll be fine. But then do I also have to make sure the piece is roughly on the same plane as the rails?Overall my main worry is getting finished and I have one side of my table thinner than the other.What am I missing?Appreciate it! Keep up the GREAT work. Paul2)\xa0Gonna keep this one simple. What is your favorite style of furniture to you enjoy building?

After going down the rabbit hole there was a lot of things that actually made sense for using different glues for different applications. I have always just used titebond 3 because it just seems like the most versatile of any other glue out there. It’s water resistant and food safe so why have 15 different glues for 1000 different applications. As I grow more and more into the trade it leads me to wanting to move more toward the more tried and true methods that some of the most reputable woodworkers have proved to be the best practices for certain applications. Leading into the question, (minus brands if you don’t want to go there) What types of glues do you migrate to the most and what is the reason for that? Is it a certain type of glue for a certain application or do you sort of do like me and stick with a particular glue for any project you make? Would you design a project and decide that you’re going to use a certain type of glue for it over another?Thank you for your time and please keep up the absolutely wonderful work y’all are doing on the podcast and your shops!

Keep up the great podcast!Thanks,JamesHuys Questions:1)\xa0My son had a black walnut cut down last October. The arborist also had a portable mill so he milled up a number of slabs for me. I have kept these slabs in my garage since then. They are stickered and I put three ratchet straps around the pile to hopefully keep them flat. When is the right time to move them into the house? Is it ok to keep them in the garage? Have you guys harvested any lumber like this? I know Cremona has a process but I want to know what normal people do! JK! I love CremonaI\'ve really enjoyed the format of the podcast.

The table does have some water marks and other blushing on the finish, it I still don’t know what the finish is. I’d like to stay away from heavier solvents to avoid damaging the wood.Would going straight to an orbital sander or by hand with 120 be my best bet to get through safely? And if I wanted to try and remove a layer with a stripper of sorts, would I just guess between the mineral spirits or alcohols?Would love to hear your thoughts on this!Joey from Winter Wolf Woodworking\xa0Our Social Picks:Huy: @plakotoris_studioGuy: @stenewoodworkSean: @MrCabinetMaker | Support us on Patreon:\xa0https://www.patreon.com/woodshoplifeGuys Questions:1)\xa0Do you believe a grounding wire is required for home/hobby dust collection systems ?

Best, WillSeans Questions:1)\xa0Hello guys, first of all great podcast, the questions are always my favourite part of any podcast so I really love your format. My question is regarding a standard drum sander vs. an orbital drum sander. I have seen a few on Craigslist for sale- the one I\'m considering is a 2010 Jet 22-44max for $400. In doing research I see a lot of the new models are random orbit. Will this make a huge difference? I\'m on a budget so a new machine isn\'t going to happen and I haven\'t seen any used random orbit models for sale. -Travis2)Hey Guys!!!! A big fan of all 3 of you and love the show!!!!Question for all of you...What brand of router bits do you prefer? With there being tons out there, which one is your go-to brand of bits?

I use a Festool dust extractor for small tools. I run a WEN air filter. I have built a DIY cyclone separator out of an older JET 30um bag collector. The one tool that still throws dust all over me and into the air is my Sawtop table saw. I\'m thinking of investing in ovehead dust collection, but I\'m wondering if it is practical, effective, and worth the investment. As I think Sean has the sawstop dust collection guard, I\'m wondering how well it works or if there are better alternatives. What is your experience?John from AZ2)\xa0Are there any pieces of furniture that are in your home that you wish you had not bought/made?

I know that the best way to develop skills is by building furniture and learning from mistakes, but I also hope to participate in a class sometime, if only to find an active woodworking community. - MartinHuys Questions:1) I\'ve recently bought a good planer/jointer combo machine. It uses 3 planer knives in the cutter block. I won\'t be using it enough to consider an upgrade to some sort of helical cutterhead. So I\'ve been thinking about a practical way to sharpen the knives. I\'ve come to a jig, some sort of wooden block with an insert for one knife. The top surface of the block is tilted in such a way that my water stones have support for the correct angle when I use them to sharpen the edge.The jig works, but I wonder if there is a more practical (faster) way to sharpen. I see that Tormek sells a sharpening system that does this, but since it costs more than the helical cutter block, I find that too expensive.My question: do you know of an affordable sharpening system for planer knives (mine are 10" long)? - Bart2)\xa0Looking at finishing the top I was going to use epiphanies spar varnish but was wary of using this finish because of UV resistance. Would this inhibit the natural darkening of Cherry? My other option was General finishes ARM R seal or Waterlox. I don’t have way to spray so conversion varnish is out of the question.My other thought was to dye the slab with Lye and use the Epifanes.Keep up the good work.ThanksJesseBeechland Furniture\xa0Social PicksGuy:\xa0@kingposttimberworksSean:\xa0@hawthorne_fine_boxesHuy:\xa0@affinecreations | \xa0Support us on Patreon:\xa0https://www.patreon.com/woodshoplifeGuys Questions:1)\xa0Hi guys love the show. I have a question about finishes. My generation (millennial) is into natural products. So I would like to have most and if not all my products that I have lined up ready to be finished to be natural. I\'ve thought about shellac but for the projects that will be around alcohol, shellac is basically out of the picture. But I was wondering if I could put wax over it and that would help with the sealing or if I have to try something else? If I have to try something else what would you suggest that\'s a natural sealer? Some of my projects include a tabletop and beer caddy. Have you ever heard of the safe coat as a sealer? -Paige2)\xa0Absolutely love the podcast guys, keeps my long drives to and from work educational and also tolerable.I know finishing has been covered a lot, but I can’t recall if the technique was ever covered. And also technique specific to the type of finish. I would love to spray everything, but as my shop is also my garage that isn’t always an option. What have you found easiest for applying different finishes? Natural bristle brushes, synthetic/polyester bristle brushes, foam brushes, plain old wiping on with an old t-shirt, spit shine, etc....I’ve also noticed I’m finding myself putting 2-3 coats on and then sanding back a coat instead of doing the light sanding with every single coat. Seems to work, but am I just wasting finish due to impatience? And Guy always talks about his famous BLO, poly, naphtha wipe-on varnish. I’d love to try that, how is it mixed and what is the amount of each product in the final mixture?Finishing never ends and I’d love to hear your thoughts.Joey from Winter Wolf WoodworkingSeans Questions:1)\xa0I\'m in the market for my first Jointer. As usual, not a lot of money to spend. I am looking for a used Jointer and would like to know what I should be looking for, what I should avoid, and how to prioritize this list. The price range is up to $400. My project focus is furniture and jewelry box making. I have a small shop, under 200 sqft. Love your podcast and really appreciate all the information and tips you guys share. Thomas2) I know this may be a bit of a loaded question as there are so many variables to consider but with the audience that is to be considered. I know what my particular practices are and they haven’t failed me yet. I believe it may be a good one for some of the “newer” woodworkers out there would really benefit from hearing it from some highly experienced makers as yourselves.Hi fellows... I would normally say guys but well... we all know theirs only one Guy here. I wanted to know about glueing up a panel from several boards. When gluing up a panel at what point would you consider using something such as a dowel or a domino to keep the boards aligned? Is there a certain thickness, length, or even width that you’d feel that there would be a need for adding this type of structural support to the glue-up. I know that they help out a ton with alignment but I’d like to know what your thoughts are on this subject.Thank you for your time and please keep up the absolutely wonderful work y’all are doing on the podcast and your shops! The information y’all share is always spot on!Thanks,Brent JarvisHuys Questions:1) I’m in the process of revamping and improving my shop, and the next step is dust collection. I have a 1.5 hp Shop Fox dust collector moving 1280 cfm of air. My problem is always with the friction loss in the flexible hoses. I plan to install 6” pvc on the wall and snub shorter flexible sections to some of the bigger tools. My question is regarding the split offs. Are the stop gates enough to single out air flow to certain machines? And what is the best way to reduce this down to a hose for handheld power tools?2)\xa0I would like to purchase a new dado stack. I have an old Craftsman set that is steel - not carbide tipped. What do you guys use?

I\'m making my first kitchen table with a 5/4 35” x 8’ oak top. My client didn’t like the look of a breadboard end so I’m a bit concerned about movement down the road. The top won’t overhang the aprons by more than 4” and I’m planning to connect it with those z clips with a couple of cross pieces to keep it rigid. Do you think I run a risk of cupping? I’ve thought about getting some of those c-channel iron to route into the underside but is that overkill?Homarus woodworks2)\xa0Hi guys, love the show. I have a would you rather question on finishing. Would you rather finish a whole large project or try and match a finish for a smaller project. My specific scenario is refinishing my basement bar. I’m going with dark cabinets and I know I’m going to have to make shelves and trim to match. Do I get unfinished cabinets and finish it all myself so they’re the same, or try and match prefinished cabinets? Thanks! MattSeans Questions:1)\xa0Hi, I have a question for the podcast. I am about to start drawers for my dresser build and the sides call for 1/2" material. Would you use 4/4 material making a lot of waste or would you go to a thicker material and resaw for the 1/2" final dimensions hoping to cut down on waste? Would the type of wood you are using sway your decision as wood stability may cause the wood to cup/bow more than others? Thanks, Ryan.2)\xa0Is there a special technique for sanding round overs? I\'ve tried sanding round overs by hand, but end up with scratch marks long the "top" of the piece. When I try sanding with a random orbit sander, I feel like it eats away too much wood and it\'s not a consistent round over anymore. Thoughts? MattHuys Questions:1)\xa0I’m wanting to make a cross-cut sled for trimming the ends on boards that I’ve glued up. I want the cross-cut sled to have the most capacity that it can. So, I’m probably going to end up building something like Huy’s “Aircraft carrier”.Any tips on making that thing as accurate as it can possibly be? Is there anything you’d do differently if you had to remake it?Y’all are great! Keep the podcasts coming!!Cory2) My question for all of you is about ordering lumber and sheet goods online versus buying in person and being able to pick through and select boards.Do you have experience ordering large quantities of sheet goods online? What about hardwoods? What do I need to know before placing an order for things like this?Any tips for ensuring I receive quality plywood for cabinets? I’m relatively new to woodworking so any technical advice or terminology to use would be greatly appreciated. I know higher quality plywood typically has more plies, but I’m not sure how to even specify this or tell how many plies the sheets for sale online have.Could you recommend any sources for ordering online? I’m located in the Tampa, Florida area.I am tired of imposing on friends and family to borrow a pickup truck to pick up all the sheet goods I need and I don’t mind paying for the convenience of truck delivery if it’s an option worth considering. However, I do not want to waste money if I’m going to get all the crappy sheets that they can’t sell in person because they are all busted and warped with gaps in the laminations.Thank you all for putting out such quality and informative podcast. I’ve enjoyed every episode so far.-Hunter\xa0Our Social PicksGuy:\xa0@tomfoolerywoodSean: @mhwoodworkerHuy: @eastoakww | Support us on Patreon:\xa0https://www.patreon.com/woodshoplifeGuys Questions:1) Hey guys keep up the good work on the podcast.

I want one and would like to know what I should be looking for when considering a purchase. -sergeantmakerSeans Questions:1) How much scrap is too much? I like to hold onto smaller pieces I can make into wedges, bow ties, etc....but when is enough truly enough? Are there certain pieces you’ll keep, more rare species of wood? Or is it straight to the kindling pile?\xa0Winter wolf woodworking2)\xa0Good morning Guy, Huy, and Sean. I had a question on tool brands. I get asked all the time from my peers in the community what brand of tool is better than another. My general answer to all of them is usually the same every time. Within the budget you’re looking to spend there are usually a few different brands. Within those price points, all of these tools are going to perform basically at the same level and have the same features. The best thing you can do is go put your hands on it, feel the tool, see how it works and if it’s a good fit for you. My question to you all is when you are looking for a new tool no matter hand tool or power tool is a particular brand one of the first things you look for or do you go after that budget point versus quality and functionality? Thank you for your time and please keep up the absolutely wonderful work y’all are doing on the podcast and your shops!Thanks,Brent JarvisClean Cut WoodworkingHuys Questions:1)\xa0 I have a couple questions about lumber storage. This would be for dried lumber. Do you store it horizontally with stickers, horizontal without stickers, or can you store it vertical? For longer lumber, it may be more efficient to store it vertically. What do you guys do? David2)\xa0I was wondering if any of you use specialty chisels in your work. Fishtail or skew chisels for example. Do you have multiple sets? Mortise, dovetail, paring, etc. Keep up the good work.

I work as a law enforcement officer and listening to your podcasts on my way home from work help me not only unwind but expand my understanding of the craft.I am a hobbyist who is just getting into woodworking and was curious if you guys could point me in the right direction of specific written literature so I can really nail down the basics before moving on to more complex tasks.Thanks again,Luke\xa0Huys Questions:1)Regarding thin kerf blades - seems like you guys didn\'t like them? I bought a "Freud" thin kerf ripping blade for my underpowered Delta from Lowes. That Freud thin kerf completed changed my saw for the better. Huge difference. Anyway were you guys worried about flex or something with the thin kerf? I didn\'t understand. - JJ2)\xa0Years ago, before I really got into woodworking, I painted some cheap 1/4” plywood for a project. I only painted one side and over (very little) time the pieces curled up like taco shells. Since then, I have always finished both sides of the plywood. I am currently making a shelving unit that will be wedged into a corner. I am using 3/4” blondewood ply from the big box stores. The backside of the shelving unit will never be seen. On plywood this thick, do I still need to keep painting both sides? If so, does it need an equal number of coats on both sides? - Hunter RobinsonBooks mentioned:Essential JoineryIllustrated CabinetmakingThe Why and How of WoodworkingThe Anarchist\'s Tool ChestUnderstanding WoodThe Complete Illustrated Guide To JoineryOur Social Media Picks:Guy: @tim_noone_furnituredesignSean: @haltaylor_rocksHuy: @bbumslife | Support us on Patreon:\xa0https://www.patreon.com/woodshoplifeGuys Questions:1)\xa0A follow-up question that may get Guy going:I’m currently upgrading my 3hp sawstop pcs 52 inch because I’m moving states and gifting it to my father.Originally, my thoughts were to go right to the 5HP Sawstop ICS without much consideration for other saws. I do like the safety feature just as an insurance Policy because you never know - we all do stupid things from time to time. Can you speak on times where the sawstop does not operate as intended and fails to save the injury and other saws that may be better but do not include the technology? I am typically pretty careful.-Ray2)\xa0I emailed a little while ago to ask about MFT tops and all I have found premade so far are MDF tops for the MFT. BUT I found these tops and benches by Armor tools. https://armor-tool.com/products/woodworking/workstations/benches/It is a butcher block top and has 3/4 inch holes. I do use Festool sanders, a router, and track saw but is there any reason that using a 3/4 inch dog hole top would be inferior to the 20mm top Festool uses? I know the Festool dog hole devices will not work but there are lots of 3/4 inch accessories. If the dog holes are aligned correctly I can bump the Festool track against the dogs to line up cuts. Am I missing a downside?The armor tool top is $200-250 but seems more sturdy than the MDF.LamarSean\'s Questions:1) Hey guys. Love the podcast as always. Please keep it up! I have a quick question about finishing. I know you covered this topic but I’m curious about protection from water marks.I had a client recently that wanted a long desk for her children out of walnut. I explained that water in wood or wood finish is never a good idea. (Leaving standing water, cups rings, etc) is there a finish out there( besides epoxy) that will withstand this water. I am also wondering about hot items. I’ve noticed some finishes(lacquer) will leave a ring if you put a hot cup on it. Are there finishes that won’t fail with either of these issues? Thanks so much.Ryan Wilging2)\xa0Hey guys,Love the show, definitely one of the best Woodworking podcasts out there.I’m going to build a 2 car garage (approx. 24’x30’) for use as my new shop. I’m a hobbyist woodworker, mostly a couple of hours here and there nights and weekends. If you were building a new shop from the ground up, what features and considerations would you recommend?Thanks, Ron\xa0Huys Questions:1) My question is regarding Baileigh Industrial tools. I currently own an 8" Baileigh jointer (IJ-875) and really like it. I\'ve been contemplating purchasing a free standing router table and possibly a cyclone style dust collector. My current shop is outfitted nicely with good tools i.e. Powermatic planer, drum sander and mortiser, Sawstop TS, Laguna bandsaw, etc but I\'m wondering if any of you have experience with Baileigh and what your opinion is of them. I find their prices are slightly less than say Powermatic and other top brands so it makes sense to consider them only if they\'re a trusted brand. I don\'t see or hear much about them and all I have to go on is the jointer I have. I will say their manuals leave a lot to be desired. Thanks for any input! Michael2)\xa0Huy, how is the baby?

Today's Guest: Lesley Moffat, Author and Coach   Lesley Moffat is the author of I Love My Job But It’s Killing Me: The Teacher’s Guide to Conquering Chronic Stress and Sickness, has taught high school band for over 30 years, and is the founder of Band Director Boot Camp. She has been a presenter at multiple national and state music conferences, served as a board member for the Mt. Pilchuck Music Educators Association, and serves as a guest clinician and adjudicator. Summary  Lesley loves her job. She loved it so much, in fact, that she did whatever it took to build a successful program, at a great cost to her health, both physically and mentally. Over the course of her career, Lesley faced a myriad of health issues. After a major health crisis and many surgeries, she watched her best friend succumb to cancer that was certainly exacerbated by stress from her job as a high school choir teacher. She knew she had to do something, or she'd would be following in her footsteps soon. Once she made the choice to get healthy, Lesley decided to come off the more than a dozen prescriptions she was on for everything from pain and sleep problems, to ADHD and chronic inflammation, and much more. She had to learn how to restructure her work life, eating habits, and a lot of other things. Before she passed, Lesley's friend encouraged her over and over to write a book about her story to help other teachers avoid her fate. The book is a love letter to all the teachers who love their job, but are burning out due to high stress and poor health.\xa0 Lesley hopes that other teachers will read her story, follow her advice, and not only serve, but thrive as teachers for as long as they feel called. For a free copy of Lesley's Book, I Love My Job But It's Killing Me, click here!  | Teachers are natural life-long learners, which is a HUGE benefit when they go to start a business.\xa0 But is all that learning getting in the way of taking action? Back in Season 1, I did a bonus episode on 10 Reasons Teachers Make Amazing Entrepreneurs, and of course, one of them is because we’re natural life-long learners!\xa0 There are lots of skills that translate from the classroom to business, but there’s also a lot to learn, and teachers have the chops to learn it all. But, is there such a thing as too much learning?\xa0 Some may argue with me, but I say, yes, there is. Learning as a form of procrastination Most beginning entrepreneurs, myself included, are guilty of this.\xa0 “I just have to learn X, then I can launch.” “I’m not an expert in Y yet, so I can’t put myself out there.”\xa0 The truth is we’re scared.\xa0 And needing to learn 1 more thing is a great excuse to postpone the scary step of doing. Learning without action is not moving you forward If I wanted to be a great fisherman (woman, whatever), I could go to Amazon and order every book on fishing ever written.\xa0 Then I could spend the next several years reading them, taking notes, internalizing… and after all that time I’d still be a crappy fisherman because I spent all my time learning about fishing and none practicing.\xa0\xa0 On the other hand, I could go to Amazon and find 1 book to read to get started on my fishing journey, read it, and head off to the shore to practice what I’d read.\xa0 If I master what I learned about, I can choose to learn more, or stick with my current level of knowledge and just put my line in the water. I may not become a master fisherman, but I’ll already be light years ahead of the other me, because I took action! There’s always something more to learn Learning is never done.\xa0 In fact, the more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know, and so on… And, as an aside, I totally support the art of learning for learning’s sake.\xa0 I love learning new things, facts, trivia, skills… whatever.\xa0\xa0 BUT. There’s a very big difference between learning new things so you’re prepared if you ever get picked up by the Cash Cab and acquiring knowledge instead of experience. Practice just in time learning Just in time learning is basically exactly how it sounds.\xa0 When you need to know something, learn it, practice it, master it.\xa0 Then move on to the next thing you need to know.\xa0\xa0 For example, when you’re putting together your business website (a big hangup point for us over-learners), you can learn a bit about your hosting options.\xa0 Then you pick one. You can learn about the basic elements of a website, then implement them. Learn about SEO, update that.\xa0\xa0 And so on. Remember that you can always change your mind As one of my favorite people to ever walk the planet earth, Maya Angelou, once said, “Do the best you can until you know better.\xa0 Then when you know better, do better.” | MLMs, otherwise known as direct sales or network marketing, are an attractive option for teachers.\xa0 They're also a great entry point into entrepreneurship and owning your own independent business. Today's Guest: Michelle Paul, Owner, Stay Gold Shell   Michelle Paul is a wife, mom, middle school English teacher and online boutique owner. She manages all these facets of life with a little bit of sarcasm and a lot of queso. Summary  Michelle didn't mean to start a business.\xa0 She just found a product she loved and wanted a discount - a very common reason for joining MLMs - and discovered that her enthusiasm was a natural sales method. Once she started making some money, Michelle decided that if she was going to be part of her company, she was going to go after it with everything she had.\xa0 She studied the methods and techniques of the most successful people in her company, and if something worked for them, she tried it... twice.\xa0 Not everything was a good fit for her, of course, but Michelle followed the tips and techniques that felt right for her personality and found herself with a thriving business. After a couple of years of building her MLM business, Michelle found another project she was passionate about; Helping women buy clothing online that actually fits when it gets delivered.

Today's Guest: Dr. Will Deyamport, Producer, The Edupreneur   Will Deyamport, III, Ed.D. is a District Instructional Technologist for Hattiesburg Public School District, serving grades K-12. He is also a digital transformation strategist, writer, podcaster, and documentary filmmaker. In 2016, Dr. Will was one of three educators selected as a Mississippi Spotlight Speaker at the Mississippi Educator Computing Conference, and served as a Schoology Ambassador from 2015 - 2018. Dr. Will is best known for his work in assisting educators in going digital, and he has written for Schoology Exchange, District Administration, EdSurge, iNACOL, and TechEdge magazine. He holds bachelor’s degrees in Radio, TV, and Film and Child and Family Studies from The University of Southern Mississippi and a Doctorate of Education in Educational Leadership and Management from Capella University. Summary  Dr. Will currently facilitates the 1:1 initiative in his district where he works with over 500 teachers on how to purposefully implement technology in their classrooms.\xa0 He also created a podcast focusing on tech in the classroom and best practices, but soon got bored with talking about the same thing.\xa0 He started to pivot towards talking with educator about books, money, and life outside the classroom.\xa0 And not only did he find new passion, but his audience grew by leaps and bounds! When he was approached to produce a documentary with EduMatch Publishing, he came up with the idea to interview successful edupreneurs and The Edupreneur was born! Dr. Will believes that teachers need to step up to the plate when it comes to using our hard-earned skills to make some money to pay our bills or take our kids to Disney - and I agree!\xa0 Teachers often feel badly about the idea of making money, because we've fallen into the belief that we need to be broke in order to be a real teacher.

Art teachers Janell Scannell & Lisa Walker have been taking the show-on-the-road to public libraries all over Massachusetts for six years. Pop up Art School’s workshops for kids, teens & adults provide hands-on art fun! Libraries can hire us to teach a workshop or librarians can use one of our downloadable lesson packages to provide art experiences for their patrons. Summary  Lisa and Janell met 20 years ago at a local gym, and struck up a friendship based on their mutual love of art.\xa0 They never imagined it would lead them to be business partners.\xa0 When Janell suggested they work with a local cable access station to produce creative programming, they decided to go for it.\xa0 The learning process was fun, and it solidified Lisa and Janell's partnership. Their business has gone through several iterations, each time learning a bit more about who they want to work with, and how they want to do things.\xa0 They discovered that working with public libraries provided a perfect setting for their programs, and are now looking for ways to expand beyond their local area.   Key Takeaways  Sometimes opportunity is scary... but still amazing Learning on the job is a fantastic way to learn new skills and open new doors Working as a team brings with it a whole new world of challenges and opportunities Everyone's entrepreneurial journey is unique, but it often has a lot of unexpected twists and turns   | If you’ve listened to this show before, you know that I truly believe that every teacher can have a successful business and still be a rock star in the classroom. \xa0The trouble is, many of you don’t believe. So let’s talk about some of the BS you’re telling yourself about becoming a side hustler. Still not sure you’ve got what it takes? \xa0Well, let’s talk about some of the crap you’re telling yourself and just how wrong you are. I don’t have time. I thought the same thing. \xa0But, the thing is, I did, and you do, too. \xa0When I added up all the time I was spending on unnecessary things I had lots to spare. So, let’s think about all the ways you may be wasting time that could be used to make you money. \xa0  Facebook Pinterest Netflix Grading  I don’t have the skills I addressed this issue in my intro episode, but it’s worth talking about again. \xa0Teachers have MAD SKILLS. Not only are we organized, dedicated, methodical, and passionate. \xa0We have people skills, we know how to explain things to anyone, we inspire, we give people hope. \xa0 AND, as if all that isn’t enough, we’re life-long learners. \xa0So, whatever we don’t know, we can figure it out. I don’t have any money. Hello, broke teachers! \xa0I hear you. And I’m not saying you’re business isn’t going to cost anything (though that can be done in some cases), but it can be done for a lot less than you think. \xa0 There are lots of free tools available and there are programs developed with teachers in mind, like Side Hustle Summer Camp (shameless plug), that are incredibly affordable. I can’t sell. Yeah, that one’s not going to fly at all. \xa0You spend your days convincing kids, big and small, to do things that they don’t think they can do, don’t want to do, and maybe can’t see any need for. You’ve got this. I’m not tech savvy. If you can work your school’s grading program, website, and/or all things Google, you have the tech skills to build a business. Don’t be scared off by the fact that some entrepreneurs have a very tech-heavy business. \xa0That’s a choice they made. While it’s likely you’ll want some tech in your business - Facebook, Pinterest, a website - there’s no reason they have to be complicated, or that you have to do all the things. I’m part of an MLM, or an agent of another company. Awesome! \xa0Not only do you have something to sell (half the battle), but you have a company backing you up. But that in no way prevents you from having your own business, in which you can incorporate this ready-made product. \xa0In fact, many of the people who are most successful at things like direct sales or VIPKid are those who have their own business where the company the work with provides one of many streams of income. In addition, building a unique-to-you business solves 2 major problems faced by folks like you who are independent agents for a larger company. \xa0  You set yourself apart as an expert, not just one of 20,000 people selling essential oils. You expand your customer base beyond your immediate circle of friends and family because the internet goes everywhere.  \xa0 Are you ready to jump in? \xa0Side Hustle Summer Camp is now open for enrollment at the early bird rate until Mother’s Day, May 12, 2019. \xa0In this 8-week small group program, I will walk you through everything you need to get your side hustle up and running before you go back to school. \xa0Just go to sidehustlesummercamp.com to enroll.

Nell starts the discussion by mentioning that Agile came out of the Scrum movement and gives a brief history of how it started. She reads out the Agile Manifesto, and Scott explains what it is. They agree that “move faster slowly” can be considered as a motto of Agile. Scott talks about the testing aspect of it from a philosophical perspective, and Nell chimes in with comparison to how things were being done in the past versus now.They discuss the 12 principles behind the Agile manifesto. One - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Two - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer\'s competitive advantage, basically valuing learning and improvements. Three - deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference for a shorter time scale, the focus being on the code being in a working state. Four - Business people and developers should collaborate daily through the project. Scott elaborates on the point further, and shares his experience where it was challenging to work with the business side of the project.Five - Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the support they need and trust them to get the job done, trust being the most important factor here. Six - The most efficient method of conveying information is having a face-to-face conversation, here the panelists provide a counter-argument that in the era of online platforms and remote work, this is not necessarily essential. Seven - Working software is the primary measure of progress. Eight - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. ‘Sustainable’ is key here, avoiding overworking and burnout is important anyday. Nine - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. This means doing the full set of code reviews and tests and still deploy software quickly and making sure that it doesn’t break things, if it does, it has to be rolled back.Ten - Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential. This highlights the need for focus in the product, and not writing a lot of code that could eventually be unusable. Eleven - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Panelists talk about people involved in open source projects as an example of such self-organizing teams, where they work on their own schedule and have great interest in what they are building. Twelve - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Retrospectives, reflecting where you are, how the team works together and documenting results as some sort of a learning exercise, are some of the practical examples of this.Nell then talks about the three layers of Agile infrastructure by Patrick Debois - considered as the father of DevOps. These constitute of technical - the hardware and software, project - the process that introduces changes in the environment, and the operations - the process of keeping the environment working.They state that we can build effective technology if we can relate to each other as humans, and discuss how Agile is perceived in certain controlled environments, if it’s possible in an Agile fashion and still have prescriptive solutions. They end the show with picks.PanelNell Shamrell-HarringtonScott NixonSponsorsAdventures in Blockchain - Devchat.tvReact Round Up - Devchat.tvAdventures in .NETCacheFlyLinksThe Agile ManifestoPrinciples behind the Agile ManifestoKubernetes co-founder Craig McLuckie is as tired of talking about Kubernetes as you arePicksNell Shamrell-Harrington:The Great British Baking ShowKinesis Advantage2 KeyboardScott Nixon:The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the WorldGatesnotes books - The blog of Bill Gates | Episode SummaryOn this week\'s Adventures in DevOps, Chuck talks about the recent Twitter thread about 10x engineers. He goes through each of the points in the tweet and talks about each of them in turn. There are only two points he sort of agrees with, and believes the rest to be absolute garbage. One of the issues with this tweet is that it doesn’t define what a 10x engineer is.Defining a 10x engineer is difficult because it is also impossible to measure a truly average engineer because there are many factors that play into measuring productivity. Chuck turns the discussion to what a 10x engineer is to him and how to find one. A 10x engineer is dependent on the organization that they are a part of, because they are not simply found, they are made.When a 10x engineer is added to a team, the productivity of the entire team increases. Employers have to consider firstly what you need in your team and how a person would fit in. You want to avoid changing the entire culture of your organization. Consider also that a 10x engineer may be hired as a 2x engineer, but it is the employer that turns them into a 10x engineer.Overall, Chuck believes these tweets are asinine because it’s impossible to measure what makes a 10x engineer in the first place, and hiring a person that fits the attributes in the list would be toxic to your company.PanelCharles Max WoodSponsorsiPhreaks - Devchat.tvThe Dev Rev - Devchat.tvReact Round Up - Devchat.tvCacheFlyLinks10x engineer Twitter threadFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Copyhackers.comGood to Great by Jim CollinsKeto dietPodcast Movement | Episode SummaryIn this episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast, the panelists talk about getting started with DevOps and learning its principles and technologies. Lee and Scott mention that they share a similar journey, initially starting as system administrators and working their way into DevOps. Nell says that she was a Ruby and .NET developer before learning cloud technologies such as Heroku, Chef, and Docker.To someone with a programming background wanting to get into DevOps, Lee highly recommends three books - The Practice of System and Network Administration, The Practice of Cloud System Administration: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services - Volume 2, and Time Management for System Administrators. He mentions that they are technology-agnostic and help in understanding what is really going on in the system. Scott stresses on the importance of understanding basic networking, linux systems and commands, bash scripting and knowing the core fundamentals and interactions of the underlying systems. He suggests going for online resources, tutorials and boot camps which are plenty nowadays and easily accessible as well.Nell advises listeners to pick a cloud provider such as Digital Ocean and learn the basics by working with it, which can later be applied to any other cloud provider. She also recommends learning programming languages to get a good software development foundation. The panelists talk about working on specific projects and getting hands dirty rather than traditional learning, to enhance their DevOps skills.Nell explains how they implement the \'learning by doing\' concept at work. She mentions that understanding how virtual machines and physical servers work is crucial before moving on to learning about containers. Lee suggests Vagrant - a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, as a good resource for the same. They caution that while it is important to learn things during our time off, self-care and setting healthy boundaries is paramount. It is ok to take longer to learn something given that DevOps as a whole can be extremely complex, and working in a non-pressure environment can be very beneficial. They recommend Ops School for beginners which is a comprehensive program aimed at people who want to get into operations engineering.They then share their insights on monitoring and how to get started with it. Lee recommends the book Practical Monitoring, and Sensu - a monitoring event pipeline, as good starting points.DevOps can be considered as a technical as well as a cultural movement. To that effect, they discuss where should people start learning the associated cultural elements. Nell recommends reading the books - Effective DevOps, and The Phoenix Project and Crucial Conversations. Lee advocates going old school with the writings of Richard Stallman, and books of the 80s and 90s such as The Art of C Programming. They mention that conversational skills and dealing with people are critical skills in today\'s work environments.

Regular panelists Nell Shamrell-Harrington, Principal Engineer at Chef Software, and Scott Nixon, Principal Consultant at Cloud Mechanics, discuss one of the most significant aspects of any given software environment - disaster recovery, what is it and what to do when the unimaginable happens.They start the show by explaining that disaster recovery can be considered as a subset of business continuity planning. They state that two main things need to be defined while planning for disaster recovery in any organization. First one is the recovery time objective (RTO), which is the maximum acceptable length of time that an application can be offline, and this information is generally included in a Service Level Agreement. The second one is Recovery Point Objective (RPO), which is the maximum acceptable length of time during which data might be lost from the application due to a major incident. Nell gives examples of each and Scott mentions that we need to understand the time taken for restore as well, and it is very important to restore data regularly.Once the RTO and RPO have been established, the software needs to be prepared for disaster recovery, including verifying that the software can be installed correctly, as replication can be very hard, especially when it has been installed long ago. They transition to the topic of security concerns, for example, how to deal with cases when there are multiple security groups, ACLs, etc, and the cloud service in an entire region goes down.They advise listeners to make sure that the disaster recovery environment should match the compliance requirements, make cloud storage a part of daily backup routines, and to use configuration management tools most suitable to the work environment so as to make the process seamless. They talk about cloud-agnostic tools that help in cross-cloud replication and syncing data across. They also raise certain points to consider for successful recovery, including estimating the time and bandwidth required to transfer large amounts of data, balancing image configuration and deployment speed along with the time needed to handle dependencies, image consistency across hybrid environments, implementing tiered storage, and share relevant examples.Another pattern they discuss is the idea of maintaining the same IP address for an application to make disaster recovery easier, which can be possible if it\'s in the same region, using elastic IP or load balancing, but can be challenging with multiple cloud providers across different regions. However the solution would be quite challenging as well as expensive, so there is always a tradeoff involved.They then move on to some common mistakes that people make in disaster recovery. Nell says that while creating a good plan it is really crucial to bring in people from across various businesses, while Scott talks about regularly documenting everything including bits and pieces like manual configurations and such. They discuss that security consistency is often overlooked, and describe some recovery services offered by cloud providers such as Amazon, Azure and some multi-cloud services like Zerto and Arcserve.

They start the discussion by talking about the difference between monitoring and alerting. They discuss how logging comes into picture in monitoring, two main types of logs - structured and unstructured, log management in the DevOps environment, information storage, parsing logs and log aggregation. They list two major kinds of monitoring software - pull and push. Nell explains what they mean and how they work, and Scott gives examples of each including syslog, healthcheck, etc.They then talk about what it means by a "working" system, and consequently, when can something be considered to be non-functional. This leads to answering the important question of what exactly should be monitored. They explain to what extent should one go while monitoring and how to determine the significance level of the events in general. They discuss some concepts from Mike Julian\'s book "Practical Monitoring" including anti-patterns such as tool obsession, what not do do in monitoring and the fact that businesses need to customize their systems based on what works for them. They talk about the tool Nagios, benefits in using default monitoring tools provided by native cloud systems, using monitoring as a crutch, and manual configuration. They then discuss some good practices, namely composable monitoring, performance monitoring from the users\' perspective, the mantra - \'buy not build\', and continual improvements. They briefly touch on the topic of security in monitoring, and wrap up the episode with picks.LinksPractical Monitoring-Mike JulianAccelerate: The State of DevOps with Dr. Nicole ForsgrenHigh Output Management - Andrew S.

He manages a team of developer advocates working on cloud native solutions. He explains what developer advocacy means in terms of the work they do at Oracle and elaborates on the term \'second generation cloud\'. He then talks about how feature compatibility works with different types of cloud platforms, moving legacy applications to cloud and the best practices involved in cloud operations in general.With respect to the Oracle cloud, he talks about how isolation is achieved when dealing with different customer requirements, hybrid models and their inter-workings, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications on top of the cloud, GPUs, Kubernetes and managed services. He presents his thoughts on what could be the next big thing in cloud technology given that newer concepts are being introduced day by day, and shares anecdotes where clients such as CERN have migrated to Oracle\'s cloud infrastructure and even those who have transitioned from a different cloud provider to theirs. In the end, he mentions some of the most heavily used cloud features and applications, and they move on to picks.LinksBob\'s TwitterBob\'s LinkedInRefactoring - Martin FowlerThe US Air Force Is Adding Algorithms to Predict When Planes Will BreakPicksNell Shamrell-Harrington:Ubuntu ubiquity bug reportCanlisLee Whalen:AI made from a sheet of glass can recognise numbers just by lookingHugoMicromastery: Learn Small, Learn Fast, and Unlock Your Potential to Achieve AnythingCharles Max Wood:Adventures in DevOps RecommendationsCannyGood to Great - Jim CollinsBob Quillin:CERN Uses Kubernetes to Reduce WebLogic Deployment TimeCloud Native Labs - OracleOracle Developers | SponsorsCacheFlyPanelNell Shamrell-HarringtonLee WhalenEpisode SummaryThis episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast is all about Chef. Nell Shamrell-Harrington - Principal Engineer at Chef Software is interviewed by panelist Lee Whalen starting with what Chef is and what it is used for. Nell describes how Chef works with containers, Chef Habitat and how it fits into the overall DevOps culture. Lee asks if it can be used to manage systems with push-pull based configuration management as well. Nell shares how Chef can be advantageous for the higher management and the business as a whole by being automated and high-speed. She compares different configuration management tools and lists certain compromises when using Chef over the others. She explains why they had to apply Apache 2.0 license to the software, but explains that it does not include the code which is totally open source, only the executable build. She mentions some popular Chef code bases that have numerous good contributions from the community. She says that Chef has about 1000 open source projects currently, and appeals to listeners to take a look at the\xa0GitHub book\xa0that they\'ve written containing information about all of those.LinksChefChef HabitatPicksNell Shamrell-Harrington:Mario + Rabbids Kingdom BattleLee Whalen:NeuralinkElon Musk’s Neuralink Says It’s Ready for Brain Surgery | PanelCharles Max WoodScott NixonLee WhalenJoined by Special Guest: Ashar RizqiSummaryAshar Rizqi, co-founder and CEO of Blameless, Inc., shares his approach to taking an\xa0unreliable system and making it reliable.

Nell is a principal engineer at Chef, Lee runs the DevOps consulting team Fuzzy Logic Systems, and Scott runs Cloud Mechanics consulting. The topic of today’s podcast is containers. They begin by defining what a container is, with each sharing their own definition. Containers aren’t really new, they’re just a hot topic because companies like Docker made them easier to use and has brought them into the mainstream. The panelists agree that containers are not for storing data, only for running applications, but that data can be mounted to a container. This is one of the biggest beginner mistakes.\xa0They discuss situations that are conducive to the proper use of containers. Containers are best added to mature and large scale projects. They discuss the pros and cons of Kubernetes. The panel gives advice on how to start using containers, suggesting new users start by containerizing one thing at a time rather than trying to do it all at once. They remind listeners that if you want something to stick around for each deploy, it should not be in the container itself because containers are temporary. They talk about how to create a container, good patterns and anti-patterns found when using containers. They discuss possible security concerns with anti-patterns in containers. They finish by talking about other container orchestrators and how to get traffic to Docker boxesLinksDockerContainerLAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)KubernetesHabitat.ioCICDDocker SwarmApache MesosFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksNell Sharmell Harrington:Trader Joe’s Iced CoffeeBig Little LiesLee Waylin:Magic SandboxFall, or Dodge in HellWhisper RoomScott Nixon:\xa0An Absolutely Remarkable ThingThe Book of Beautiful Questions', 'chan_desc': 'Adventures in DevOps is a weekly podcast about everything DevOps', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/80/f7/dd/80f7dd80-a6eb-7e00-c14d-f77188700ebf/mza_6404363961485638276.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-06'}}

ET, as he is better known, has taken the world by storm, with his creative style and high-energy messages. His words continue to impact tens of millions of people in several hundred countries across the planet! Through a significant social media presence and his recent domestic and international tours, “ET, The Hip Hop Preacher” has become a global phenomenon!Drawing from his own personal experiences as they relate to homelessness, the absence of his biological father, scholastic struggles, and various other obstacles, ET allows his life to be an “open book” from which radiates dynamic and inspiring messages that relate to many people across all strata.While the typical undergraduate student takes between four to six years to complete their studies, ET took 12. For most, that would have signaled the end of any future academic aspirations. For ET, it was a springboard from which his academic success would be launched! In 2005, ET completed and received a Master’s Degree from Michigan State University and on February 5th of 2015, Eric successfully defended his dissertation and will receive his PhD in Education Administration on May 8th, 2015, from Michigan State University.Eric’s commitment to community activism has been long standing. It began with his award-nominated GED Program that lead to his non-profit, Break The Cycle, I Dare you, and a plethora of ministerial and educational endeavors. The culmination of those efforts resulted in the development of the Advantage program at Michigan State University. This program targets high risk college students by improving their study habits and increasing their retention rates. Michigan Sate University is where he continued to pursue his passion to remedy the effects of adverse societal influences plaguing both the young and old. It is from this platform that he created International Urban Education Consultants; a non-profit organization committed to finding solutions to close the achievement gap in urban schools through goal framing and helping students to reform their perception of learning.ET is the epitome of hustle, drive, determination, and success. Millions of followers have been able to apply the principles revealed in his award nominated autobiography, The Secret to Success, which has scaled the social media charts with over 50 million hits. His sophomore release, Greatness Is Upon You, features 24 life changing fundamental precepts andis meeting with equal success. Both titles are available through Eric Thomas and Associates Publications and can be purchased online at\xa0*etinspires.com.* ( https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fetinspires.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Ty6fP1COmZdU7CEbKfEVLOW-2_5EK6SxwNghaZT0cC55UNXEHLxOVMFs&h=AT1tdpN5JoV5c-x-2OWc1YwHzOM3_yjMsr4swFK03WhQb1pVQ9ZEVbm_J2kWU6hQSmA9f27moO8620SYcrdiMkReCX0fcO45ouezGOa3gvkXN-47-jLZL4iONxy8Kh6gC0KlwCu4chU )As CEO of his Consulting Firm, ETA LLC., Eric has led his team through the doors of dozens of reputable organizations and Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric, Quicken Loans, AT&T, Nike, Under Armour, New Balance and UPS. He has also consulted for major Universities and the major sports teams within the MLB, NBA, NFL and MLS.Eric’s spiritual walk, tenacity and drive are the perfect example of his quote,“When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you‘ll be successful.” At a recent business meeting, Eric had the opportunity to learn more ‘Secrets of Success’ from Mr. Warren Buffett. This invitation-only event, broadened his mind and further strengthened his resolve to empower others in their pursuit of greatness.Eric Thomas PH.D.

Listen in as I chat with my good friend Nate Adams (a true genius) to get an update on his extraordinarily execution of ordinary measures in his new concept of Home Performance 2.0. \xa0 This is a follow up to Episode 36, where I interview two of the HP 2.0 practitioners, Neil Comparetto and Michael Housh. \xa0 Measurements (so near and dear to my heart) are at the core of what he and his HP 2.0 army are all about. \xa0 For a more complete overview, tune in to a recording of his recent webinar on HP 2.0: www.bit.ly/NATE-HP20 \xa0 Nate’s book, The Home Comfort Book, is perfect for consumers or practitioners alike and can be found at TruTech Tools or on Amazon. \xa0 You can reach Nate at Nate@EnergySmartOhio.com.   | May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house. George Carlin   Yep, Radon is force of evil. \xa0 Pure evil. Colorless. Odorless. Deadly. \xa0 But sneaky. It’s deadly over decades. \xa0 My good friend Dick Kornbluth joins me to unravel the intricacies of all aspects of Radon – a colorless, odorless, poisonous radioactive gas. \xa0 Dick explains how and where radon is formed, how it gets into the air we breathe and the health impact it has on us. \xa0 He reveals where the famous 4 picocuries per liter exposure amount comes from, underscoring that there is NO SAFE LEVEL. \xa0 The US EPA has a treasure trove of information on Radon at www.epa.gov/radon \xa0 Dick shares with us his extensive and practical experience in how radon gas moves through a structure, how it is measured and how Radon mitigation systems work along with a note about radon resistant construction. \xa0 Dick is very engaged in the home performance world, and believes an improved understanding of Radon is key part of the home performance goals of healthy, more durable and energy efficient homes and buildings. \xa0 You can reach Dick at Dick@DickKornbluth.com \xa0 TruTechTools carries a broad array of radon detectors.

Jimmy Dean   While we picked a specific topic, this is a wide-ranging episode with my friend in the industry, Eric Stromquist of Stromquist.com – 2nd generation controls distributor based out of Atlanta, GA.   We discuss our thoughts and opinions on: How hard it is to actually get access to people – cold calling is basically dead Closed vs. open architecture in building automation systems C suite execs focus on productivity, which ties in to all building systems How the internet has changed the way information is shared- knowledge hoarding is done The psychological effects of improper lighting And much, much more. \xa0 Eric teams up with Ken Smyers to manage a ton of educational and informative resources centered around building controls and automation that you will find at\xa0 www.ControlTrends.org They even have their own Awards ceremony that takes place before the AHR Expo! \xa0 Eric is an avid podcaster and actually had me on his show in Episode 311!

Buddha   HVAC and building performance contractors are seeing more homes built or retrofit to tighter levels. Blower door test outs like 3, 2, 1 ACH50 or less. \xa0 What do you do when the “house can’t breathe?” \xa0 Hopefully, you see the humor in that statement. \xa0 Of course - you build it tight and ventilate it right!\xa0 \xa0 (Credit for that phrase likely goes to Earle Perera and Lynn Parkins as the title for their article in the June 1992 Building Services Journal a UK publication) \xa0 Listen in as Ty Newell founder of BuildEquinox shares with us how he got to the point of feeling the need to create his own ventilation product, the CERV2: Conditioning Energy Recovery Ventilator. \xa0 This unique product senses when to run, ventilates or recirculates the “fresh air stores” in the space using a small variable output heat pump. It incorporates slick controls and internet connectivity. \xa0 Plus, I cannot wait to be using it the new high-performance home we are building for occupancy by the summer of 2020. \xa0 Learn more about the product and more importantly the philosophies behind the product by surfing over to www.BuildEquinox.com \xa0 The BuildEquinox site has numerous white papers, tech specs & installation info, recording and upcoming webinars and more.

William H. McRaven (American Solider)  Attention all HVAC Techs: Soon someone will be looking over your shoulder. \xa0 Not it’s not the Homeowner, with severe coffee breath and a million little questions, it’s going to be a Home Energy Rater giving a grade to your HVAC installation. \xa0 What???!!! \xa0 Yes, like it or not, this will happen. \xa0 And it is justified. \xa0 It’s because the work done by HVAC Technicians is so important; important to the occupant’s comfort, safety and health as well as their utilities bills AND the utility companies in general as they try to balance the supply and demand of energy.\xa0 \xa0 Residential HVAC energy demand is a big topic in the utility world. (We’ll do a podcast on this later.) \xa0 Listen in as Jeremy Begley of HVAC Design Partners of Cincinnati, OH shares with us how paying attention to standards as helped to shape his entrepreneurial career. Specifically, the upcoming ACCA/RESNET standard on Grading the Installation of HVAC Systems. \xa0 One timely note here: the comment period on the first draft of a new RESNET standard (BSR/RESNET/ACCA 310-201x, Standard for Grading the Installation of HVAC Systems) closes on Aug 6, 2019. If you want to review and/or comment go to this link ASAP www.bit.ly/RESNET-ACCA-310 \xa0 Jeremy’s got a lot to share with the both the HVAC and Building Performance industries. He came on the podcast to encourage others to review and engage in this and other important HVAC Standards. \xa0 The methodology in the standard has five steps – a design review, a total duct leakage test, a Blower Fan CFM test, a Blower Fan watt draw test, and a non-invasive evaluation of refrigerant charge (NIST found in MeasureQuick). These five tasks should be completed in sequence and upon completion the results are evaluated for compliance with thresholds. The result of this process is anywhere from a failing system to a grade 1, 2, or 3; with 1 being the top grade and all grades yielding extra points in the HERS rating. \xa0 Besides being important to HERS ratings, it is basic physics and the methods described have positive impact outside of the rating world. \xa0 Learn more about the standard itself by going to http://bit.ly/RESNET-310-INFO, where you will find a link to RESNET conference slides on this topic and a link to the other podcast I host, RESTALK, where I interviewed Wes Davis (ACCA) and Den Gamble (EPA) on this standard. \xa0 If you want to learn more about the services and training (coming) that Jeremy offers you can reach out via the contact form on his website: www.HVACDesignPartners.com | Looking to be a better HVACR Tech? \xa0 One key aspect is keeping up to date with changing equipment, products and techniques. And that is no mean feat. \xa0 In order to do so, you need to help yourself to training and education where ever you can get it. Like this podcast… especially because it is on a lesser known topic: HVACR Chemicals and sealants. \xa0 Mike Walton of CoolAir Products in Maryland, joins us on this episode to focus on 2 of the products he has brought to the US market: AC SmartSeal External- a line and coil repair product and AC SmartSeal Quick Shot, the 3 in 1 internal seal, lube and leak check dye. Interestingly, these two products work best together. \xa0 Mike discusses how and why he formed the company starting in his garage in 2014. \xa0 He describes his company’s focus on the technician, by making products that are safe, effective, and easy to use. \xa0 Part of this ease of use comes because all products are 100 % safe to the touch, non-toxic and non-flammable. \xa0That means no warning labels and for our friends in California, no prop 65 issues. Plus, he backs up the product with 3rd party lab testing by Intertek \xa0 Mike’s got a lot to share with the industry. \xa0 You can buy Mike’s products at wholesalers across the US or online at www.trutechtools.com/Cool-Air-Products   If you want to learn more you can reach out to Mike at www.CoolAirProducts.net or MikeWalton@CoolAirProducts.net | Today we turn the tables and your host becomes the guest!   As you may or may not know Marilyn and I are building a new high-performance home this year (2019). \xa0 Even though I have been involved in home performance for 30 years, it was in the narrow field of test and measurement, not in construction detail and aspects. \xa0 And because it is our home and our money, everything about it is personal and I have a real hunger for the details which tends to complicate decisions! \xa0 So, I asked my thoughtful pal, Nate Adams to pitch some questions at me to get me to talk about the subject and share our journey up to this point. \xa0 We were calling it a high-performance house, but recently I’ve changed that to a new concept (in my mind): personalized performance – it’s what we want our home to be. \xa0 I hope you enjoy the listen.

I just thought they always existed. \xa0 Well, in the nascent world of building performance, I should have known better. \xa0 Listen in as we chat with Ryan Miller, the founder and executive director of the North Carolina Building Performance Association, as he describes his vision for the future of building performance. \xa0 He believes poor building performance is one big problem to solve and he aims to do it in his state by connecting all the stakeholders with education and information, as well as lobbying and training. \xa0 And he is not just stopping in his state as he supports and gets involved with like-minded organizations across the country. \xa0 Pay particular attention to the four points he notes in his strategic plan: Market Valuation Policy and legislation Work Force DevelopmentAnd Consumer Education \xa0 If you want to learn more you can reach Ryan via his website: www.BuildingNC.org   | Some of our listeners have likely heard of the term Home Performance. \xa0 But have you heard of Home Performance 2.0? \xa0 Michael Housh and Neil Comparetto join us to describe how they are helping to develop this new approach to serving customers with total home performance. This is a systems being developed by Nate Adams and Ted Kidd. \xa0 They describe a well performing home as one that is healthy, comfortable, safe, durable and, as a side benefit, uses less energy. \xa0 Michael and Neil are both trained and experienced HVAC technicians; mechanics in their own words. \xa0 They discuss how some simple changes in the approach to the way technical work is presented is resulting in better business and happier clients. \xa0 They describe the HP 2.0 process as consisting of 6 steps: client education, initial PAID consult, a comprehensive planning process, executing the project, QC, and continuous optimization with monitoring. \xa0 A large part of the client education consists of the resources available at www.NateTheHouseWhisperer.com – there you will find an inexpensive book that educates consumers (and techs!) on home performance, as well as 2 free downloads(chapters from the book) \xa0to share with Clients: Home Comfort 101 and HVAC 101. \xa0 These steps help to remove the pain of being a residential HVAC business owner: (Much of this is based on the Sandler Selling Process) \xa0  Avoid fights over stuff you can’t fix  \xa0  More Happy Clients - Actually SOLVE client problems, no band aids  \xa0  Smooth out monthly sales with large HP projects in off seasons  \xa0  Onboard Staff Faster-with something else for apprentices to do  \xa0  Fewer Unhappy Clients  \xa0  Reduce Mold Risk  \xa0  Reduce Boredom with Challenging projects and new twists all the time  \xa0  Reduce or eliminate free quotes  \xa0  Increase Ticket Sizes w/o Home Performance Jobs  \xa0  Lower sales and marketing costs, with better word of mouth and paid consultations.  \xa0  Bigger, more satisfying jobs vs Small jobs with lots of up-front work that often don’t solve problems  \xa0 If you want to learn more you can reach Michael at MHoush@HoushHomeEnergy.com and Neil at Neil@ComparettoComfort.com or Nate Adams and Ted Kidd at Nate@EnergySmartOhio.com | You may know the answer to this question: “Why would I want to use an air flow hood?” \xa0 You might not know the answer to this one: “How do I find a good air flow hood?” \xa0 Steve Rogers, President and Owner of the Energy Conservatory, joins us to answer both of these questions as well as provide a rich background to his company and his career. \xa0 We hear how a customer ride-along stimulated a multifaceted investigation into the critical parameters involved in making great residential airflow measurements which could lead to a breakthrough product in the future \xa0 Steve explains how milkshakes help him focus on customers’ needs in the product development cycle. \xa0 Visit www.EnergyConservatory.com to learn more about their products and training resources which are available through several distributors including TruTechTools, www.trutechtools.com/EnergyConservatory \xa0 If you read this before January 24, 2019, you can sign up to watch the webinar Steve will present with TruTech Tools on this topic: sign up link is www.bit.ly/TEC-FLOW  If you read this after that date, a recording of that video will be present on the TruTech YouTube channel: www.bit.ly/TruTechTubes', 'chan_desc': 'Building HVAC Science covers a broad array of topics in building science and HVAC diagnostics, as well as human comfort, health, and safety.

When meeting with a field insurance adjuster and compiling your Xactimate estimate, how you formulate your strategy can mean all the difference for winning roofing contractors. You already have the disadvantage of not being able to discuss policy and coverage. This video will cover some advice and tips on how to neutralize and equalize the situation to give yourself the advantage. This is a segment from the 100 Towns Tour - Insurance Restoration Masterclass by Chad Michael, recorded live in Denver, Colorado on August 20, 2019. | It is perplexing to me how many roofing contractors, general contractors, restoration contractors, public adjusters, insurance adjusters and property owners aren\'t FIRST focusing on protecting properties after a catastrophe. Roof tarps are insurance company APPROVED! Drywall, insulation, carpet, wood, etc... these products cannot withstand rain. The property owner has the obligation to mitigate the damages; to stop the bleeding. If the roof is damaged and water is leaking into the property, the property must be tarped. The insurance company will approve the tarp to prevent further massive damage to the property. Not only in major hurricanes, but also when the roof suffers damage from extensive hail. This is a segment from the #100TownsTour - Insurance Restoration Masterclass by Chad Michael, recorded live in Chicago, Illinois on August 06, 2019. | Insurance Adjuster Rebuttals |\xa0Ridge, Starter, Waste, O&P and More What do you do when the insurance adjuster says they don\'t want to pay for items on your Xactimate repair estimate? Ridge caps, starter, waste factor, overhead & profit (O&P) and more. Let\'s solve these problems for the many Insurance Restoration Contractors, roofing contractors, general contractors, etc who need the help!

For LIVE TRAINING EVENTS "Insurance Restoration Masterclass - by Chad Michael" on the #100TownsTour go to: https://www.InsuranceRestorationTraining.com | Is your customer on your team? Are you on the same page? Signing a new customer to a roofing sales (or insurance restoration sales) contract is a serious commitment, and one that should be taken seriously. Properly preparing and educating your customer about the insurance restoration process, about Xactimate and helping them anticipate what to expect from the insurance adjuster can go a long way towards saving you future headaches and keeping your customer in good standing. Chad Michael, The Practitioner, shares some insight in The Practitioner Podcast - Episode 05. #ThePractitioner | Property owners have the obligation of immediately mitigating damages. Tarping a roof 100% can be a great profit generator for roofing contractors, and can help win more roofing jobs. Xactimate pays quite a bit when estimating and installing correctly. In this episode, we will cover it all. Let\'s get it! -Chad Michael #ThePractitioner | Welcome to another episode of The Practitioner Podcast! Xactimate pays significantly less and is not correct in many of its default trade settings in estimates for: RFG vs DMO, INS vs DMO, DRY vs DMO and much more. Xactimate trade differences pay less. Knowing how to manually correct these line items in Xactimate after consuming Xactimate Sketch training is only part of the problem however. It doesn\'t mean that the insurance carrier will approve your Xactimate roofing estimate including o&p, for example. But following a strategy, along with your Xactimate training, for how to end up at an approval is what\'s most important. Learn how in this insurance restoration podcast. Insurance Restoration Training at its best. | In this episode we address questions from the community with our guest, Brian Macdonald. Questions include: "When should I send the Xactimate estimate to the insurance company?" "What do I do when the insurance adjuster says that the roof isn\'t covered because of \'blistering\'?" and more! Brian Macdonald is an independent expert damage consultant and his company provides services for Inspections, Estimates and Supplements.

I’m podcasting to you from beautiful end-of-summer Orlando, Florida. I am an extremely busy consumer expert, money-saving advocate, syndicated newspaper columnist, and the guy that turns digital entrepreneurs into media celebrities with UpMyInfluence.com. I love what I do and can’t wait to get going on today’s episode. In order to help you save more, earn more and live more abundantly on today’s show I’ll be covering: \xa0  How to Make Breakfast Easier and Cheaper Earn Swagbucks Rewards While Savings on Groceries The Best Deals for Your Entertainment Needs Be Your Own Boss in as Little as 4 Months  \xa0 - - - - - - — \xa0 How to Make Breakfast Easier and Cheaper School mornings are crazy busy. Finding time to make and eat something other than cold cereal or granola bars can become a dream relegated only to weekend mornings. But what if you could serve a more substantial breakfast every morning in minutes, while staying in budget and on schedule? You can. Here’s how to make breakfast easier and cheaper.\xa0 \xa0 Egg Scramble in a Mug. While already making dinner, saute extra diced onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach or other similar ingredients and meats as desired. Allow to cool. Beat eggs with dashes of salt and pepper until uniform. In ceramic or glass mugs or small bowls, place 1/4 cup cooked vegetables and meats, 2 beaten eggs (uncooked), and 1 ounce shredded cheese. Stir to incorporate, then cover and refrigerate. To cook, place in the microwave on high for 60-90 seconds or until eggs are completely cooked. Eggs should be slightly soft (not overcooked and rubbery) and the other ingredients warm. Making these yourself is a huge savings over buying similar ready-to-cook products at $2-3 each. You can put together a dozen cups for less than $12, depending on the ingredients you use, making them at least 50% cheaper at $1 each. \xa0 Heat and Eat Pancakes. A full box of pancake mix will make approximately 50 small pancakes. When making your pancakes, be sure the batter isn’t too dry and don’t over-mix it (leave lumps). Keep a close watch on your skillet so your pancakes nicely brown but stay moist inside. This will keep them from drying out when reheating. Allow finished pancakes to fully cool, then freeze. Pop them into the toaster to quickly reheat. By making these yourself, rather than buying boxed ones, you can make 4 times the pancakes for the same money (approximately $2). You can similarly make toaster waffles! \xa0 Overnight Slow Cooker Oatmeal. By gently cooking oatmeal overnight in a slow cooker you can have it warm and ready-to-eat when you want it. Online recipes abound with the proper measurements for the oats, liquids, and any additional ingredients, such as brown sugar or raisins. With this method, you can both control the sugar content and your costs. Even as convenient as individual oatmeal packets are, they easily cost 2-3 times the price of making several family-sized batches from one canister of rolled or steel-cut oats. \xa0 English Muffin Breakfast Sandwiches. Using a muffin tin, make cooked eggs the perfect size and shape to fit English muffins. Simply beat eggs with dashes of salt and pepper into a uniform consistency. Lightly grease muffin tin and then portion half an egg into each space. Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for about 8 minutes or until just cooked through, yet soft. Carefully remove egg circles from tin and allow to fully cool. Layer on an English muffin, along with other desired ingredients such as sliced cheese and precooked sausage patties or bacon. Place sandwiches in a freezer-grade bag and freeze. To prepare for eating, wrap sandwiches in paper towel and heat in the microwave for 1.5-2 minutes. Compared to paying $1-2 apiece for commercially produced frozen or drive-thru sandwiches, you can make a dozen for less than $9.\xa0 \xa0 Breakfast Burritos. You can make breakfast burritos in a similar fashion to sandwiches, using tortillas, shredded cheese, diced onion and bell pepper (or salsa) and crumbled sausage or bacon. The two tricks are to soften the tortillas so they are pliable and to make sure the salsa you use contains nearly zero liquid. Be sure any filling components are completely cool before filling and tightly rolling the burritos. Tuck in the ends of the tortillas and then lightly toast in a skillet before wrapping and freezing. Because you can make 20 burritos for less than $10, they easily beat the price of drive-thru fast food breakfast burritos. \xa0 French Toast in the Toaster. In the oven, lightly toast and slightly dry out a full loaf of bread on a baking sheet. This will help make French toast that can stand withstand freezing and reheating. From the prepared bread, make a large batch of French toast using your favorite recipe. Allow the finished pieces to fully cool without getting soggy, then freeze into portions. Reheat in the toaster for quick French toast. Instead of paying over $2 for 8 commercially produced slices, you’ll have nearly three times as much for around the same cost. \xa0 Grab-n-Go Yogurt Parfaits. Build yogurt parfaits in small cups or bowls by layering yogurt with fruit such as sliced strawberries or halved grapes or whole blueberries. Make the very lop layer yogurt to keep fruit fresher. Then cover and refrigerate. For toppings to add before eating, secure a small portion of granola or nuts in squares of plastic wrap. With this method, you can make eight 4-ounce parfaits for around $5, depending on the price of the fruit and nuts you choose. \xa0 - - - - - - — \xa0 Speaking of saving on food, did you know that Swagbucks offers cash back rewards and free gift cards when you use their grocery coupons?

I’m podcasting to you from Orlando, Florida, where Podcast Movement 2019 has just wrapped up. I am an extremely busy consumer expert, money-saving advocate, syndicated newspaper columnist, and the guy that turns digital entrepreneurs into media celebrities with UpMyInfluence.com. I love what I do and can’t wait to get going on today’s episode. In order to help you save more, earn more and live more abundantly on today’s show I’ll be covering:  How to Change Your Shopping Habits to Save Money Love Going Out? I’m going to give you $100 right now in this show. How to get paid for watching videos  - - - - - - — \xa0 How to Change Your Shopping Habits to Save Money You watch the grocery budget, shop sales and use coupons when you can. But, somehow, you still can’t seem to lower your family’s food bill. You don’t know what else to try. Good news, I might know what’s happening. You could have some shopping habits you aren’t even aware of. I’ve created a little quiz to help you to identify them and I’ll give you suggestions on how to change your shopping habits to save money. Question #1 - Do you feel trapped into shopping the same store(s)? If you answered yes to this question, you might have a bit of a mental block in how you think about shopping.\xa0 Question #2 - Does your nose wrinkle up when people suggest buying things like bread from the dollar store? If you admitted you do (or if your nose wrinkled just reading this question), you probably have built up expensive biases without realizing it. Question #3 - Do you find yourself drawn to how packaging looks, rather than choosing products by the content, volume and quality? If so, you might fall victim to impulse or justification buying more often than you realize. (I’ll explain justification buying below.) Question #4 - Do you look into your pantry, fridge and freezer and regularly end up throwing food away? If that’s you, your buying habits aren’t matching your eating habits, resulting in pricey food waste. Now let’s fix these... Recommendation #1 - To get out of a “store rut” (shopping the same place), be open to exploring your area. Throw away the idea that you can only go to {insert store name of choice} for {insert item you always buy}. Why? There are smaller places that hold some of what you need and you may have never even considered them. Here is an anecdote that demonstrates this: Last week my friend ran into Walmart to grab a small list of specific items. As she entered the store, she nearly laughed out loud. There, parked in front, were two identical carts of shelf-stable groceries, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. Adorning the fronts were the price totals; what you would pay buying at Walmart or at a “local competitor”. The totals were both over $100 and the amount separating the two was a mere $5 and change. This marketing display was intended to instill confidence in Walmart’s “always low prices” - but it didn’t. In a quick glance, my friend noted several items she knew she could purchase elsewhere and come nowhere close to paying $100 for the half-full cart of groceries. Furthermore, it completely ignored any store sales and coupons shoppers can take advantage of at other grocers. Save a mere $5 on over $100 in groceries? No, thanks, I can do better than that, Walmart. Recommendation #2 - Conquer your biases to really save money. As mentioned in the acetadote above, my friend knew she could buy several of the items at a local discount (aka salvage grocery store) for half of what it cost at Walmart. If your nose just wrinkled again, let me encourage you to check smaller stores before you just assume the quality is bad. I assure you, it isn’t. Smaller grocers can save you up to 50% and it’s the same products sold at the “big names”. To get you started, reflect back to our original Question #2. Many dollar stores (Dollar Tree brand, in particular) carry things like fresh bread. For $1. And they get a wide variety of healthy, name brand bread that elsewhere is $2.50 or more. Give it a try to start. Then open yourself up to other potential places in your area. Recommendation #3 - Time to talk about justification buying. This is where, maybe on the whole you’re good at not impulse buying but when it comes to buying what you do need… you find yourself buying the larger package or the prettier package. After all, you need it. You’re going to buy it anyway. So… it’s justified, right? Wrong. Take emotions out of it and evaluate: Are you buying a more expensive product just because it’s pretty? Or buying more than what you need just because you “need it anyway”? Stop doing that. Evaluate the best value based on the quantity and the quality. Not on how nice the packaging is or on “getting more while you’re already at the store”. Recommendation #4 - Speaking of buying too much… If you’re regularly throwing food away, it’s costing you. Big time. Begin to cut back on the quantities you buy. Don’t grab multiple similar items and throw them in the cart. You won’t get around to eating them fast enough. Consider tracking your family’s consumption with a food diary for a week or even two to gauge volumes and preferences more accurately. Buy less = spend less. Use these suggestions to reset your spending habits and save money this month!  - - - - - - — \xa0 Who doesn’t love going out to see their favorite band rock the house or their favorite sports team rock the playing field?

Our school piloted a program that was completely unheard of in our school district. I had the honor of being a part of this life changing experience. We took part in the first newcomer program. During the day 50 newcomers in grades 6-8 we a part of sheltered instruction. In our school setting, newcomers had a science, social studies, and an ESL class from an ESL teacher. Math was taught to by grade level math teachers, who had an interest and desire of supporting English Language Learners. During this time I was working with the math teachers I learned some valuable tips that I would like to share with you. There is also a free cheat sheet that goes along with this episode which I will link in the show notes. Use visuals and manipulatives as much as possible with your ELLs in math.  Math is a visual subject. I think of formulas and equations when I see visuals. You can use visuals such as diagrams and processes for your ELLs. For example, if a student is learning the process of rounding, create a visual step-by-step process to support the students in this task. In some cases we had students with interrupted education who were learning numbers. The students used visuals to assist in learning how to count. Manipulatives are visual and also increase engagement in the math class. They provide a hands on way to support your ELLs in math.  Introduce and pre-teach key vocabulary to students before introducing word problems and new concepts.  Just because it is math doesn’t mean that academic vocabulary should not be a focus of the lessons. Just as you would teach key vocabulary in ELA classes. It is important to teach vocabulary in math classes. Students are going to encounter word problems and new math concepts. Teaching them key vocabulary is going to help them with they encounter these concepts and word problems. Teachers can use the Frayer Model for teaching key math concepts. The great thing about the Frayer Model is that it allows for you to include visuals for the students. These visuals can be a sample word problem, equation, or a formula.  Math video tutorials are powerful!  Think about when you want to learn something new, you might just go to YouTube and click on a topic. There are so many tutorials that provide students with step-by-step instructions on how to learn math concepts. I used them all the time when I was teaching myself and the students a new math concept. The one that is highly recommended is Khan Academy. What makes Kahn Academy a beneficial tool is that it FREE and it aligns directly with the math Common Core Standards. So if whatever math concepts your students are learning there is a high chance there is a step-by-step video on Khan Academy. Kahn Academy is also available in Spanish for first language support  Math Interactive Notebooks \xa0  I had the pleasure of working with a phenomenal math teacher Mrs. Francesca Hall who is an advocate for English Language Learners. In her classroom she used math interactive notebooks. In the notebooks there was basic numbers, formulas, and tips. Whatever the student was going to learn for that lesson was put into a notebook. It proved to be a valuable resource that the students used throughout their year in math. In these notebooks you can also have the students record examples that include a step-by-step process for completing a problem. This will allow the students to return the notebook if they need help working a problem. In the interactive notebook you can also keep track of those key words that was mentioned above.  \xa0If you want a full list of strategies and tips, head over to myadventuresinesl.com/mathstrategies to download the free cheat that accompanies this episode. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Social Studies was always one of my favorite subjects. I loved hearing and learning the history of others. However social studies can present a challenge to many of our English Language Learners. I think it is the perfect connection to English Language Arts, and to extend some of those same strategies in Social Studies. \xa0Take time to build background knowledge  Social Studies requires a lot of background knowledge for English Language Learners. It is key that you take time to build background knowledge about the topics that they will be encountering. For example, if students are learning about the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, you would want to build background knowledge about what is the Civil Rights. ESL teachers can do this by doing book chats, gallery walks (with visuals), and read alouds of the events that were happening in that period. My personal favorite is doing a read a loud with a book packed with visuals. I don’t want you to think that just because it’ a picture book that it is easy. There are tons of complex picture books, and they are so beneficial to use with your ELLs. Videos also are a great way to build background knowledge for your students. Some of my favorite places to get student friendly videos are PBS and CSPAN.  Use graphic organizers and timelines whenever you can in Social Studies.  Social Studies is a lot of events that may be difficult to keep track of for students. Using graphic organizers is a visual way for students to organize the information. Timelines are also helpful for students in organizing information. Notetaking is also key in social studies. Use graphic organizers for students to take notes and record key events. This school year I am going to be using Cornell Notes for note-taking. On the Cornell Notes there will be visuals for the students.  \xa0Chunking (Breaking Down into smaller pieces) the text  Social Studies is a text heavy subject (especially in the upper grades) It might be tempting to level the text or provide the students with a summary. Remember your goal is to promote comprehension so the students can read and understand the text independently. One way to support the students in doing so is chunking the text. Chunking the text is taking portions of the text so it is not overwhelming for the students and breaking it down so it is more comprehensible. It is important that you take time to read and do this in advance. There will be times when you might have to do it on the spot. By chunking the text you can have the students summarize, identify the key points, annotate, etc. This is a great strategy to use with ALL students at ALL levels.  I would love to hear how you are supporting your ELLs in Social Studies. Also if you have tried any of these strategies and they have worked for you I would love to know more about it. ESL Adventurers I want you to know that you are a FANTASTIC ESL teacher! You got this! \xa0 See you next week! \xa0 \xa0 | Supporting ELLS in Science The English Language Learners that I have taught have always loved science! It was their favorite subject, and it is easy to see why they love science. Science is filled with visuals, diagrams, and hands on processes. Out of all the subjects I found science the easiest to support ELLs for this very reason. Over the years I have picked up some strategies of supporting ELLs in Science that I would love to share with you today! \xa0Take advantage of the diagrams and processes that are available in science.  If you can use a diagram or visual of a process with your ELLs do it! This is a great scaffold that will benefit them while in science. You can even have them study the diagram/process then have them explain it to you using academic language on FlipGrid. Students can even take the diagram or process and write about it using academic language and complex sentences. These strategies are going to benefit all ELLs not just newcomers.  Use a visual dictionary and/or bilingual dictionary in science.  Over the years I have learned students know and understand a lot of the science processes in the their native language. There are going to be some exceptions. However having a visual and/or a bilingual dictionary has proven to be very helpful when students are doing classwork. My favorite (which I will link) is the Oxford picture dictionary for the content areas. Here is a tip: use this opportunity to having visual/bilingual dictionary in class to create a vocabulary notebook. You can do a frayer model in the notebook so students can have a visual to refer to throughout the school year.  \xa0 Provide supports for ELLs in the science discussions  English Language Learners are going to benefit greatly from participating in the science discussions. This gives them opportunity to practice and master the academic language of science. To ensure they are successful put supports in place, so they can be able to actively participate. Some examples of supports you will be able to provide are complex sentence frames, a word bank that consists of the academic language, and higher order questioning stems. When you see that your English Language Learners are mastering the concepts, remove the supports. You do not want them to become dependent on the supports that you are providing them.  I would love to hear how you are supporting your ELLs in science. Go over to myadventuresinesl.com/science and drop a comment. Next week I will be sharing some strategies on how you can support your ELLs in Social Studies. | I stumbled onto FlipGrid by chance. I was searching for speaking apps and this one popped up on my google search. While I was exploring the app, I noticed all of the features that can beneficial to English Language Learners. FlipGrid is a video discussion platform that is being used in classrooms around the world. I loved that is resembles students favorite social media platflorms such as SnapChat and Instagram. This had students more motivated to participate in the activities. Here is how you can use FlipGrid in your ESL classroom. I stumbled onto FlipGrid by chance.

FlipGrid is a video discussion platform that is being used in classrooms around the world. I loved that is resembles students favorite social media platflorms such as SnapChat and Instagram. This had students more motivated to participate in the activities. Here is how you can use FlipGrid in your ESL classroom. \xa0Flip your Discussion Questions  Before or after teaching a lesson post a discussion question on Flipgrid instead of the students writing the discussion down, I want to note that it would be very important for you to explicitly model your expectations to the students on how you want the question answered. Students then login and simply respond to the question. You can encourage students to use accountable talk frames during the discussions. To take the students speaking to the next level use a Speaking Rubric A speaking rubric in student friendly terms sets the expectation of how they should be speaking. If you want an amazing speaking rubric you can use with your ELLs go to myadventuresinesl.com/speakingrubric.  \xa0 \xa0 Encourage Teacher and Student Discourse \xa0  After some reflection, I learned that my students needed some work on register. A lot of them did not understand how to switch between a casual and formal register. By using FlipGrid this encouraged discourse between the students and I where they can flip between the two and practice. On FlipGrid you (as the teacher) can post a video of yourself, and the students can respond to your video with a video. Teachers can also respond to student recordings with a personalized recording that is just between the students.  \xa0Remix your favorite speaking activities with FlipGrid  If you have a favorite speaking activity such as Think-Pair-Share, remix it with FlipGrid. This allows students to practice how to speak confidently into the microphone. This is going to benefit them greatly when it is time for their speaking assessments. You can also do other fun speaking activities such as news anchor and pair discussions onf FlipGrid.  Just as with any computer app there is important to find balance. Just remember this FREE and interactive activity for your ELLs when you are planning your speaking activities. Want a speaking rubric you can use with your ELLs? Check out this  Speaking Rubric you can use with your ELLs. | In the beginning I struggled with getting funded on Donor’s Chose. My students in my ELL classroom needed technology and new books. I would post a project for $1200, and let it sit there hoping it get funded. I didn’t realize at the time that I need to put in some elbow grease to get the project funded. Within a year I have had a total of 10 projects funded with Donor’s Chose! I have included some tips on how you can get your project funded on Donor’s Chose. \xa0 Follow My Adventures in ESL on Instagram and Facebook! | ESL teachers around the world all have the same question….”How do I teach when I have 4 or 5 different levels of ELLs in my classroom?” This may seem overwhelming at first, especially when you first start teaching. Even if you are a veteran teacher you can still feel overwhelmed by having various levels in your classroom. Here are some strategies in how you can balance multiple level English Learners in your classroom. | My first year of teaching I had a lot of random items all over my room. Posters in my room were not hung, and the who area was in a disarray. I tried “decorating” my room, but I was told by veteran teacher in what’s the point of doing that when you have more important things to be doing. However that view took a drastic turn when my teacher mentor came in and explained to me why the thinking and statement of that teacher was incorrect. In this episode you will learn tips and strategies that will help you setup your ESL class for the new school year. | I can remember staying until 6pm every school day trying to cram in as much work as I could. I was even waking up on Saturday and Sunday working hours on end with lesson planning. Finally, it all blew up in my face. I was at a breaking point and I knew what I was doing wasn’t sustainable. My husband had started to ask me …. “Why are you working till almost 6 everyday?” He was starting to see that I was exhausting myself. In the middle of my third year teaching, I started to see teachers quit because they were so overwhelmed with the workload. I started hearing murmurs that there was a high amount of teachers on anxiety medication because of the overwhelm. That is when I woke up! I loved teaching and I didn’t want to get burnt out and quit. I immediately implemented the following. I started to say “No”. No to extra professional developments that didn’t fit my goals, no to staying late, no to spending hours on my weekend planning. At first it was hard because we are in a service profession. However, when I started asking veteran teachers they gave me this advice. “It is okay to say no”. So if there is a professional development I attend, it aligns with my goals and it will be one that I KNOW I am going to have a blast. I started committing to leave school at the bell. This required some extra reflection. I was staying late preparing because I didn’t have an effective system in place on how I should prepare. Once I got a system in place I was able to save so much time and I was able to leave on time everyday. This allowed me to spend more time with myself, my family, and my friends. Guess What! When I was refreshed, I could teach with a clear mind. Before you get out of the car every day, have a moment of silence. Use this time to pray, mediatate, or whatever you do to get your thoughts together. I NEVER set foot in the school building before taking this moment of silence to gather my thoughts. This helps keep me focused and calm. You don’t have to feel like you have to check everything off your to-do list for the day. I started reducing my to-do list to 3-4 priority items I have to do for the day. If I don’t get to everything, I make peace with that I DID my absolute best for the day. Just include the items for your priority list for tomorrow. Above all else remember your mental, physical, and social health is the priority. For you to teach you best you need to feel your best. So don’t every compromise on your HEALTH. | Building a relationship with the mainstream establishes trust and mutual respect. By building a relationship you start see how the mainstream teaches and operates his/her classroom. You will also develop a mutual respect for the teacher that will be reciprocated if nurtured throughout the school year. This will help tremendously if you are co-teaching/pushing in for the school year. You can start off by building a relationship by simply introducing yourself at the beginning of the school (or before if you know). Offer your strengths and reach out to learn more about their strengths in the classroom. Then offer to setup a meeting/working lunch were you discuss your vision for the classroom with ELLs. Make the first meeting informal, so during this time you can get to know each other. After the first meeting, then reach out to setup a second meeting where you discuss expectations. During this meeting get a clear understanding of what the mainstream teacher(s) are expecting from you during the school year. At this meeting you can also set clear expectations of what you expect from the mainstream teachers. Building trust requires that you be transparent. If there are any requirements and/or compliance let the mainstream teachers know as soon as possible. This requires of you to be organized and diligent about the requirements and/or compliance. Sending teachers emails with deadlines two days before they are due puts a lot of unnecessary stress and causes distrust. So always stay on top of such requirements and allow teachers ample time to complete the requirements. Attend the same professional developments and staff meetings as the mainstream teachers. This shows mainstream teachers that you are open and willing to be on the front lines with them. During these meetings you can also present the perspective of an ESL teacher and how the mainstream teachers can better serve their students. You will be surprised at how much you can learn at these meetings. Offer professional development for mainstream teachers around areas where you see there is a need. Some mainstream teachers are eager to learn how to better serve English Language Learners. Listening to their needs and offering professional development around those needs strengthens the relationship between the ELL teacher and the mainstream teacher. Always respectfully advocate for your English Language Learners. When advocating for your students always do so in a respectful manner. This means taking a moment to look at the whole picture before approaching a mainstream about a concern. If there is ever a concern, always speak with the mainstream teacher personally.\xa0 I would also suggest following up the conversation with an email. In most cases the concern will be resolved. If not, then follow the chain of command at your school. I have found in my efforts to build relationships that ALL the mainstream teachers I have worked with greatly appreciated it that I have spoken with them directly. Let the mainstream teachers know that they can come to you with any concerns or questions they have about the students. It may sound simple, but just letting the teachers know that you are there to help them support the students is powerful. Always remember that building a relationship with mainstream teachers does not happen overnight. It requires that you be intentional and thoughtful about your endeavors.\xa0 Visit Website for Freebies! https://myadventuresinesl.com/ | 1. Taking time for self-care The past school year has been so hectic for me as a teacher. I tried to prepare for EVERYTHING and in doing so I simply overwhelmed myself. There were also some instances where it was the exact opposite. I should have been more prepared. In light of this reflection I promised to take some time to spend with myself and my loved ones. I am doing things I love like driving around the city with nowhere to go.I am spending WAY too much time in my favorite craft stores. In addition, I am taking the time to follow my dreams…helping other ESL teachers. When I go back for the school year, I am going to be so refreshed.  2. Reflecting on the strategies that worked and strategies that need improving for the next school year. One of my strongest attributes is reflecting on the upcoming year. This summer I am going to be at ease, but intentional about my reflection. As I am preparing for the upcoming year, I want to think back on the strategies that worked for my students. For example, going into the school year with high expectations for the students that I will be teaching. There is so much power in that mindset, and I will be doing the exact same thing this summer. I am also reflecting on my consistency. Going into this school year I plan to be more consistent in how I implement my classroom routines. There were some routines I got too relaxed too soon last school year. I WILL NOT make that same mistake for the upcoming school year.  3. Analyze the data from the previous school year This year I am analyzing and owning my data as I enter the school year. What this looks like is me sitting down and looking at my areas of strength and what I could have improved on last year. I am also reviewing the students data, so I will have a good idea of what the students will need as they enter the school year. I have always thought “data walls” were silly, however this year I am planning to put my own spin on a data wall. I am preparing for a “Goal Wall”. Students are going to put what they would like to score on the end of the year language assessment on the goal wall. Also at the beginning of the school year, I am planning to meet with them individually to discuss their upcoming goals for the school year.  4. Create a classroom management plan that is tailored to the needs of my ELLs EVERY teacher needs a classroom management plan. This summer I am tailoring my classroom management plan to the needs of my students. I am also going to be mindful that even if I create a plan that I need be aware that I need to be flexible. If I see that the plan is not working, then I need to be ready to adjust.  5. Design a long range plan for school year for EVERY class that I am teaching  6.

If you listen to this podcast regularly (and I hope you do!), you probably have heard me tell you to look at what tools the lean or quality folks are using in your organization. And there is a good reason for that. They CAN help you improve safety processes. I am going to reference two good books I studies and will draw upon their lessons in this episode. One is called Lean Safety: Transforming your safety program with lean management by Robert B. Hafey and the other is called Safety Performance in a Lean Environment: A guide to building safety into a process by Paul F. English. Lean is a manufacturing philosophy that reduces the total cycle time between taking a customer order and the shipment by eliminating waste. What is excellent about lean principles are they apply to all business processes and especially safety. Also, lean can be used for all types of businesses. Edward Demming is widely considered the father of lean and what became the Toyota Production System (TPS). He went to Japan after WWII to teach Japanese business leaders how to improve quality. His work went unnoticed in the US until the early 1980’s. Of course, that period is important; it’s when Japanese automakers overtook US companies in quality and productivity. Ford first brought Demming in to help improve their quality. This is when Demming determined Ford’s quality systems were not at fault, but instead, their management practices were. A significant cultural change would be needed. So Demming developed 14 points of management. Let’s go through them and see how they relate to safety: 1. Create constancy of purpose for improving products and services. 2. Adopt the new philosophy. 3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. 4. End the practice of awarding business on price alone; instead, minimize total cost by working with a single supplier. 5. Improve constantly and forever every process for planning, production, and service. 6. Institute training on the job. 7. Adopt and institute leadership. 8. Drive out fear. 9. Break down barriers between staff areas. 10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce. 11. Eliminate numerical quotas for the workforce and numerical goals for management. 12. Remove barriers that rob people of pride of workmanship, and eliminate the annual rating or merit system. 13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone. 14. Put everybody in the company to work accomplishing the transformation. It is clear to see how universal these can be. Another useful tool we can take from lean (and trust me, there are many, as I have covered in past episodes) is DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analysis, Improve, and Control. Let’s go through what this might look like for safety. Define: Who is the customer? What is the voice of the customer? What is critical to safety? What is the cost of poor safety? Measure: Cause & Effect fishbone. Is the safety process state and in control? What is the current safety process performance (or capability)? What actions are being taken to protect the employee/company (containment)? Analysis: Which issues are effecting health & safety the most? How many samples do you need to conclude? Improve: What is the ideal solution? What is the proof the solution will work? How many trials are needed? What is the work plan to implement and validate the solution? Control: Can you demonstrate the improvement is sustainable over time? Is the process in control? How do we keep it that way? Again, here is just one example of how lean principles and tools can be applied to safety. Furthermore, this can empower everyone in an organization to champion safety. So safety leadership doesn’t require a business leader or manager. Shop floor workers can get lean training and begin identifying ways to improve the systems they have to interface with every day; including safety. We see this in accident investigations as well. One of my favorite lines to use is to focus on the process, not the person. In his book, Lean Safety, Robert Hafey tells a story about accidents at a manufacturer he once toured. There they uncovered a trend involving forklift accidents. Some managers looked into force monitors; these shut down the forklift in the event of an impact requiring operators to seek out a manager to turn it back on. You see, most of the incidents were hit and runs, no witnesses. His approach was different. Because they had no idea who caused the damage, since someone other than the driver usually reported it, they needed a plan that removed that aspect from the equation. The approach was to invite a forklift driver (any driver) in that area and help investigate. They were told that they would not be spending time looking for WHO was responsible, but rather to determine the root cause and come up with corrective processes in place to prevent a recurrence. \u2028What they discovered was the majority of the incidents were a result of poorly placed racks, improper clearances, etc. So they went about fixing those things, and wouldn’t you know, soon enough the drivers that had an incident began self-reporting. The reason is TRUST! The approach to many accident investigations destroys trust - if it focuses on “what did you do wrong?” instead of “how can this be improved?” I remembered at a client site years ago an operator got a laceration from removing a glove to grab a sample piece of metal off the line for a quality check. Management wanted to issue discipline, for removing PPE. The problem was that everyone was issued the same gloves - heavy leather gloves because of the sharp metal edges on their product. But they were also required to cut a sample piece for a quality check. They all knew you could not pick up this thin 4” wide sample with those gloves on. So, everyone, every worker removed their glove to do so. And management knew this. But the others had not gotten a laceration…yet. So issuing discipline would destroy trust, and drive reporting underground. Also, it did NOTHING to address the root cause; the conditions remained the same. Therefore they were doomed to repeat this cycle. By focusing on the process, we were able to determine the form, fit and function of those gloves (on that line anyway) needed to change, and samples were brought in for operators to try and then score based on cut resistance level needed and dexterity. That operator, he became a part of the solution, not just another victim of a hazard of the job. I could go on with hundreds of stories like this I have seen in my work as a consultant for over a decade. But let’s save those for future episodes! The main takeaway I want you to get here is to look toward Lean principles to help you improve safety. Mainly build the trust needed to create a collaborative environment where you turn workers into champions for change and improvement across all areas of the business. You can find me on LinkedIn!

There are several tested methods that Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS)\xa0leaders use to reduce employee incidents and illnesses. Among the leading methods, which the Gensuite\xa0white paper discusses, are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)–or leading and lagging indicators.  Leading indicators are pre-incident measurements, as opposed to lagging indicators, which are\xa0measurements collected after an incident occurs. For example, a slip and fall incident from stray\xa0construction materials is a lagging indicator because the incident has already occurred, but an\xa0inspection that notes the poor quality of the surrounding area and prevents a future slip and fall\xa0from taking place is a leading indicator. A key component of leading indicators is that they\xa0measure safety events or behaviors that precede incidents and have a predictive quality.  By measuring leading indicators including conditions, events and sequences that precede and\xa0lead up to accidents, these KPIs have value in predicting the arrival of an event and can provide\xa0the opportunity to introduce control measures to stop the event from happening.  Recently, many articles have stressed the importance of looking beyond lagging indicators, but\xa0then how can your organization learn from past incidents and track results? By combining\xa0incident measurement and training management software, your company or organization can\xa0adopt a holistic approach to reducing workplace incidents and meeting Occupational Safety\xa0and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.  Both leading and lagging indicators can be relevant to workplace safety and worth measuring.\xa0They present important aspects of an overall safety management system. We have to use all the\xa0tools available to us to create an environment that drives us to a zero-incident job site.  Selecting and Using the Right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for\xa0Your Organization  Attempting to track complex data analytics and results, train employees and keep your team\xa0safe on your own can be dicult tasks to handle. Leading and lagging indicators can help\xa0reduce and prevent incidents. One way EHS leaders begin using KPIs is by selecting the\xa0appropriate sets for their organization.  Lagging Indicators  OSHA recordable injuries OSHA citations OSHA recordable-case rate DART-case rate Fatality rate Worker compensation claims Experience modification rate   Leading Indicators  Near misses (Note: this is still responding to something that already happened, just no consequences; might consider this lagging) Behavioral observations Training records Department safety meetings Employee-perception surveys Trainee scores on post-training quizzes Preventive-maintenance programs   When trying to pinpoint the indicator type essential for your organization–understand that both\xa0are essential. Leading indicators are like a car windshield, and lagging indicators are like the\xa0rearview mirror. You’ll certainly spend more time looking out the windshield to see what's\xa0coming–with leading indicators–than looking in your rearview mirror to see where you've\xa0been–with lagging indicators.  Look at your company and see how you can start moving\xa0forward–toward a culture of safety–rather than looking behind.\xa0Within the leading and lagging indicator types, there are eight important characteristics that\xa0KPIs should have. Ensure that you follow this guideline when selecting the ones important for\xa0your workplace.  1. Actionable–metrics that have measurable steps  2. Achievable–setting goals that are obtainable  3. Meaningful–obtaining information for continued tracking  4. Transparent–metrics that are clearly understandable  5. Easy–to communicate effectively  6. Valid–relevant to the organization’s objectives  7. Useful–metrics that are beneficial to the organization’s safety goals  8. Timely–distributing information that is still relevant to the organization  Once you select your set of indicators and follow the necessary characteristics, it's important to\xa0track how well they are working and be flexible if the set needs to be revised for consistent\xa0improvement.  Why Leading and Lagging Indicators Are Important: Rising OSHA\xa0Regulations & Safety Trends  Each year brings about new regulations and carries over existing regulations that companies\xa0must abide by. Thus, it’s important to stay on top of ever-evolving regulatory trends so you don’t\xa0risk non-compliance. Use the leading and lagging indicator system to help with the following\xa0key OSHA regulations and safety trends.  Overview of the Occupational Exposure to Crystalline Silica Rule  OSHA’s final rule aims to reduce the risk of lung cancer, silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary\xa0disease and kidney disease in America’s workers by limiting their exposure to respirable\xa0crystalline silica. The rule is comprised of two standards, one for Construction and one for\xa0General Industry and Maritime. Responsible employers have been protecting employees from\xa0the harmful substance for years, but now it’s becoming mandatory. Here are some of the rule\xa0requirements:  Reduces the permissible exposure limit for silica to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air Requires employers to: use engineering controls to limit worker\xa0exposure; provide respirators when engineering controls cannot\xa0adequately limit exposure; develop a written exposure control plan, and train workers on\xa0silica risks and how to limit exposures Provides medical exams to monitor highly exposed workers and gives them information\xa0about their lung health   Overview of OSHA Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses Rule  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports more than three million workers suffer from a workplace\xa0injury or illness every year. Currently, little or no information about worker injuries and illnesses is\xa0made public or available to OSHA. With this new rule, employers are required to submit a record\xa0of the injuries and illnesses to OSHA to help them with identifying hazards and fixing problems.  Here are the rule requirements:  Establishments with 250 or more employees must *electronically submit injury and illness\xa0information from OSHA forms 300, 300A and 301 (300 & 301 starting in 2018) Establishments with 20-249 employees in high-risk industries must submit information\xa0from OSHA form 300A   Trend #1: Dealing with Workplace Stress  The National Institute of Occupational Safety And Health emphasizes that work-related stress\xa0disorders are expected to rise as the economy continues to undergo various shifts and impacts.  Therefore, companies should take steps to ensure that any current programs are robust enough\xa0to reduce the concerns associated with stress in the workplace, as well as implement any new\xa0programs that show an increased effectiveness at reducing the generation of stress.  Trend #2: Leveraging Risk Management  2017 saw a continued trend in developing internal risk management programs and systems,\xa0and 2018 into 2019 looks to be the year where many of these programs are leveraged for results\xa0across the company spectrum. In other words, sucient time has occurred for the internal\xa0development of risk management data and effectiveness that this can now be translated\xa0directly into specific areas of the business to further reduce inherent risk development within\xa0the company.  Trend #3: Increased Reliance on Predictive Analytics  A new trend becoming prominent in 2018 is an increased reliance on predictive analytics. Many\xa0companies have been developing risk management and mitigation data and using analytics to\xa0help derive sense from this mountain of information. 2019 looks to be the year where many of\xa0these are put into practice company-wide. In addition, the trend of emphasizing the use of\xa0these predictive analytics is expected to rise as much of this information is refined even further.  This should begin to show positive returns for companies that have been implementing this\xa0predictive technology as part of a risk management profile. However, there is still time to take\xa0advantage of these systems for those companies that have not implemented these types of\xa0analytics.  Trend #4: More Regulatory Changes  There are few that doubt that more regulatory and legislative changes are expected in 2018.  While many differences continue to grow between national policy and those enacted on the\xa0state and local level, few can predict what the specific changes will actually be. However, what is\xa0an almost certainty is that for companies, flexibility will be necessary in order to adapt to the\xa0new policies to come.  Models and Methods for Using Leading and Lagging Indicators:\xa0A Contextual and Visual Guide  Various proven, yet antiquated and manual, methods have been used for measuring KPIs, such\xa0as those discussed in the report, A Method for Modeling of KPIs Enabling Validation of Their\xa0Properties. The authors cover two techniques workplaces use to track KPIs.  The first model integrates the following attributes for tracking performance: indicator name,\xa0type, scale, source, owner and threshold. Though, it is not easy to find all of this information so\xa0EHS experts often rely on documentation, expert knowledge and previous conceptual models.  The second model used for KPI formalization is known as performance indicator expression. It is\xa0“a mathematical statement over a performance indicator evaluated to a numerical, qualitative”.  In other words, a given value for a time point, for the organization, unit or agent. The authors\xa0suggest specifying the required values of performance indicators as constraints coming from\xa0goals. The relations between performance indicators are modeled using predicates.  The third model used by EHS professionals and safety teams is known as the Heinrich\xa0Pyramid–a traditional way of tracking occupational illnesses and injuries.  The Heinrich Pyramid (also known as the Safety Triangle) quantifies the number of reported\xa0workplace incidents into four main categories: major injuries, severe accidents, first aid cases and\xa0near misses. Employee concern reports, safety observations and at-risk observations can also be\xa0added to the base of the triangle to incorporate leading indicators into the analysis.  This is a 1-10-30-600 model. For every 1 incident reported in the major injury category, severe\xa0accidents are 10 times as likely to happen. Also, for every 1 major injury, approximately 30 first\xa0aid cases, and 600 near misses.  When companies plug their own incidents into this model or pyramid, they can see if they have\xa0the corresponding model ratio, as described above, and if they have a significant amount of\xa0major and severe incidents. The premise for this model is that the more companies focus on\xa0reducing the numbers at the bottom of the pyramid, the more likely they are to reduce major\xa0safety incidents at the top.  The pyramid is inclusive of many types of injuries and incidents, but it doesn’t assist EHS\xa0professionals with narrowing down the data to the critical cases/accidents, root causes and\xa0solutions. For example, a site could have a series of cases that stem from ergonomic-related\xa0issues and spend significant amounts of time on root cause and trend analysis instead of the\xa0cases/accident that have a high potential to result in an employee fatality or significant property\xa0damage.  Critics of the Heinrich Pyramid also claim that “adhering to it can lead to an over-emphasis on\xa0worker behavior and not enough attention on health and safety management software systems.”\xa0No matter the flaws, there is always a solution to the system.  These methods are used to benefit companies’ safety success rates and business performance\xa0objectives. The methods can be adapted to any enterprise modeling approach. Companies can\xa0apply these measures of thinking into a conventional and modernized process by integrating\xa0EHS management software into their workplace as discovered in the following section.  A Gensuite Solution: Implementing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\xa0Into Your Workplace  To simplify and digitize the three models and methods discussed above, companies turn to\xa0compliance and management software systems such as Gensuite. Such systems enhance\xa0workplace safety performance by simplifying the tracking of leading and lagging indicators.  Utilize Gensuite EHS software tailored to measure KPIs and manage training compliance. Just a\xa0few of Gensuite’s specialized features of these tools include:  Framework for managing regulatory and program-specific training requirements. Validate training effectiveness through course-specific e-quizzes Incident investigation, root cause analysis, corrective and preventive action tracking Integrate with occupational health, medical and computer systems for case tracking and\xa0program visibility   What makes this important right now? Why should your business invest? Other than avoiding\xa0everyday safety violations and reoccurring workplace injuries, investing will help you meet\xa0current and upcoming OSHA regulations. Here’s a look at customizable Gensuite applications.  Incidents & Measurements  The Gensuite Incidents & Measurements application can help you address the new regulation by\xa0enabling one-click generation of a site/business OSHA 300, 300A, and 301 forms. In addition,\xa0Gensuite joins ongoing discussions with subscribers and industry groups to meet with OSHA to\xa0talk through options for direct system integrations, thus removing the need for sites to manually\xa0generate logs and input them into OSHA’s website.  Other benefits of the Gensuite Incidents & Measurements application:  Tracking of hours worked and sites recordable rates Monitoring site performance on a monthly/quarterly basis through auto-generated site metric\xa0reports Instant system-generated email notifications upon entry/modification of incidents so\xa0site-leadership stays up-to-date   Training Compliance  The Gensuite Training Compliance suite can help you address both new OSHA regulations by\xa0keeping your employees up-to-date with OSHA’s mandatory training requirements.

Technology like mobile devices and apps has made digesting information easier and more interactive. So in this episode I want to focus on what works best as far as online safety training goes, and what to avoid. Years ago, a model for training emerged called Adaptive Learning. I won’t bore you with the higher education definition of the term. Not because I don’t think any of you would understand it; of course you would! But because when we use the term in the context of online safety training, the definition takes on a whole new meaning. Adaptive learning for this discussion simply means the learner can drive the direction of the training based on their interactions. This goes well beyond the old “CORRECT/INCORRECT” feedback responses they typically get. So let’s get into what to look for in online safety training and what to avoid. So for online safety training, adaptive learning is simply the lesson presenting an activity whether it is a questions, matching, photo to select what is wrong, even a short clip of a work scenario and some question after, and then, based on the learners answer, they are presented with more information. A simple example is if the lesson presents a question like, True or False: “safety glasses are only to be worn when you are performing a task with a power tool.” and the learners selects true, the lesson presents information explaining that “many times employees are around someone or will pass by someone using power tools that may present a hazard, given this information what should you do?” The learner would then select an answer, again, either answer results in more information other than a simple CORRECT/INCORRECT. You see, the lesson seems to adapt to the learner’s responses. So how does this work? The answer is quite simple. Using software one can easily create different “slides” with this information. Then using buttons for answer options, link each option to a slide with the relevant info. You could even do this with PowerPoint - create branching slides based on responses. The question is, how deep do you want to go with it? Ideally you want to go as far it takes to make a point. If someone doesn’t get a simple concept by the third slide or so, it would be best to present a policy statement and ask several different ways if they understand; requiring a “yes, I understand” selection. If not, their training is paused until an actual person can coach them. But back to the training concept, it is that simple. It is more engaging and informative to ask if PPE needs to be worn in a specific scenario (either described or shown in pictures or video). And if they choose the wrong answer, present a slide or video or picture with text with the rationale for the right answer, then ask it again in a different way to verify they understand the concept. Make sense? So imagine an online training lesson that adapts this way? It is far better than the old “Pump and Dump” approach that is still used today. This adaptive learning model is great as it allows you (if you are the creator) to really dive deep on concepts and ideas for the learner. Even the correct answers can introduce another level of depth into a concept. This graduated approach makes complex issues like CSE or Fall Protection easier as it allows you to introduce and validate foundational elements before getting into more complex ones. The learner tells the system when he/she is ready for the next level. Another way to approach ANY online safety training is to use a blended approach. This can be live or broken up over time. Meaning, combining online training with instructor-led training. This can really enhance learning. Imagine taking basic definition of terms on concepts of fall protection in an online adaptive learning course, then jumping into the classroom for hands-on demos and activities to reinforce what you were introduced to online? That is really powerful. I have seen this work well. This brings up a distinction worth noting; the difference between training and education. I have a simple way (maybe too simple) of looking at the two terms: Education is transferring knowledge of a particular subject. Training is the practical application or use of that knowledge. So to me, taking an online course about fall protection simply educates one on the requirements of the subject; definitions, procedures, policies, etc. Training is the hands-on demonstration where learners have to inspect harnesses with hidden flaws, practice donning/doffing, using snap hooks, practice using a beam strap on a simulated beam, etc. You need BOTH in many safety and health topics. So to me, you need to be involved in the training and education process for all employees. You cannot simply pass this off to an online option with no input whatsoever. That said, online safety training is extremely effective and user friendly, accessible, and affordable. Many topics that simply require knowledge (education) about requirements can be taken online. A lot of us safety professionals need to keep up on regs, permit requirements, etc. and much of this is at the education level I just talked about. Maybe one could add an activity to fill out a permit or shipping manifest or something like that as a training aide. But by and large, much of what we professionals need is definitely in the realm of education vs training. There are so many options out there for this. Personally, I have an affiliate relationship with Atlantic Training. Their courses are affordable, and give you what you need to get started; knowledge of the topic. I have a link in the show notes if you want to check them out. Again, they are not a sponsor or anything like that. Other options are the National Safety Council. They have industry recognized training and education courses that I have recommended for years now to clients and even listeners that have contacted me about how to brush up on their safety management skills.\xa0 So look around, ask peers what they did and how they liked it - that is still the best way to get feedback before you buy. Also, many offer free lesson previews as well. So be sure to look at those to see if the look, feel and style of the online training is best for you. I have taken some where the voice was digitized, monotone and just unbearable! I would not have chosen that course if I had a preview first. So look for that. Also, look for anything that provides downloads or supporting materials like manuals, handouts, even job aides to use with others at work, like tool-box talks, safety huddles, etc. The internet is seemingly endless with options these days. So I hope I have given you some options to look for. Let me know what you think - have you taken some really bad lessons? How about your recommendations?

The link to the book mentioned in this episode can be found HERE So in this episode I want to talk about changing workplace culture. I have had a couple of episodes on Safety Culture already. And all of that still applies. Again, for the discussion let’s define the term: Culture is the character and personality of your organization. It's what makes your organization unique and is the sum of its values, traditions, beliefs, interactions, behaviors, and attitudes. This is key: the values, traditions, beliefs, interactions, behaviors, and attitudes. These are what drive behavior, specifically, what help workers make CHOICES that we then see in actions, or behaviors. The reason I bring this up is that for the last year or so I have been talking to colleagues, reading and chatting in online groups and I keep reading about a common theme out there by so-called “thought leaders’ and ‘guru’s’ in organizational development and safety culture development. As many of you know I had been in consulting for a decade specializing in these areas; culture development. And yes, I have an opinion on this as you may have guessed. So let me use a specific example of what I am talking about;\xa0 I have seen a number of LinkedIn posts and articles about NOT talking too much about regulations or starting a conversation with “OSHA says…”. or similar discussions. While we can all agree that not having to drag in the references to regulations is good; we often have to go to those minimum standards. The reason? It is a sign of a “bad” safety culture. Workplace culture often drives HOW we communicate about safety. The mistake most folks make is they manage by aspirational cultural values or from a future state. Here is what I mean; I see a lot of professionals pick up a book about culture this and culture that or read The Toyota Way and then look at their work culture and think, “yeah, we need to be like this!” Problem; You are NOT like that. You need a roadmap to get there, yes. But do NOT approach your work culture as if they already are, based on what you wish were true about your work culture. These aspirations are commendable, but sets you up for failure. You manage from where you ARE, not where you wish to be. So I have some examples of what I mean. If you think you should not have to talk about minimum regulations because you feel your culture is so much beyond this yet you continually get challenged by leaders and coaches to “show me where I have to do this” or “where does it say I have to do that?” then you are not there yet! You can try and avoid stating regulations or reciting the unfortunate phrase “according to OSHA…” but at some point, you will have to simply because your culture is still at that place. I have heard time and time again and have had key maintenance and leadership personnel flat out ask, “What is the policy or regulation on this or that?” And if they are seeking validation, give it to them. These are folks that just need to be consulted. Give them the info because this is what they are saying they need as a basis for their work. OR justification for how they work. You may eventually get past this point but if this is where you are now…manage from there. Another sign of where you are is when key personnel ask what the minimum amount of effort needed is to get by? Or, when you attempt to go above and beyond but the workforce pushes back with “we never had to do this before…” These are clear signs of YOU needing to understand where your work culture is right NOW, not wishing where you would like them to be. Again, those aspirations should motivate us to discover where we are (or current state) and determine the difference between that and the ideal (or future) state. This is the gap we need to work to close. That way we can devise a change plan that is realistic and addresses the areas that need developed and not focus on things we will never be able to improve. So, if you are tired of having to say, “According to the Standard…” then ask WHY you are still having to say it. If you try to improve something beyond minimum compliance and get pushback, ask WHAT it is folks are resisting. It may just be the change, and not the specific safety rule. So you may want to shift focus to change management in general. Go ask the quality folks or the lean folks if they have issues implementing even small changes to tasks or the work environment. Chances are they do. So don’t get wrapped around the axle that your SAFETY culture is broken, when it may just be a PEOPLE thing. Strive to work with the other teams to find common obstacles and barriers. Safety needs to STOP operating in a vacuum and collaborate with other areas of the business to strategically align efforts to improve workplace culture. If you are reading a book about workplace safety culture, fine. I recommend several on my resources page. But again, don’t get so wrapped up in your silo and think that this is unique to YOUR department. Most likely it is not. And if you have something figured out, like an aspect of the culture that you can improve, then you need to reach out and share this with others. Look into some management of change approaches. Helping workers deal with change. You have a change plan, laid out timelines for training on this initiative you want to implement, how long before everyone gets the new equipment, etc. You know, a project management process. But do you have a process for change? One example is the ADKAR Model (again, just ONE example). This is a framework for understanding change at an individual level. It has 5 elements, or building blocks, that bus be in place for real change: ADKAR stand for: Awareness: this represents a person’s awareness of the nature of the change, why it is being made and the risk of NOT changing. Desire: This represents the willingness to support and engage in the change. Knowledge: This represents the information, training and education needed to know HOW to change. Ability: This represents the realization or the execution of the change. It addresses turning the knowledge into action. Reinforcement: This represents those internal and external factors that sustain change. The elements of the ADKAR model fall into the natural order of how one person experiences change. Desire cannot come before awareness because it is the awareness of the need for change that stimulates our desire or triggers our resistance to that change. Knowledge cannot come before desire because we do not seek to know how to do something we do not want to do. Ability cannot come before knowledge because we cannot implement what we do not know. Reinforcement cannot come before ability because we can only recognize and appreciate what has been achieved. The lifecycle for ADKAR begins after a change has been identified. From this starting point, the model provides a framework and sequence for managing the people side of change. In the workplace, ADKAR provides a solid foundation for change management activities, including readiness assessments, sponsorship, communications, coaching, training, recognition and resistance management. Look, there are other models. This is but one that I have used and have seen success with in the past. But I want to point you in the right direction to get started addressing what I stated earlier, that is identifying the change that is needed is one thing, having a process to facilitate the change, ensuring its success is another. This is a tool that can help. Stop managing from where you wish you were. Identify where you are today and get started laying out a plan to achieve successful, lasting change.

He is the VP of architecture at DAZN, a multi-country live streaming platform for sports, Google developer expert, and London JavaScript community manager. Luca got his start in programming 16 years ago when a friend told him about it and gave him a book. He was very intrigued and went on to learn multiple languages and travel the world for his job. For the last 4-5 years he’s been working in architecture, and is now the leader on thoughts on micro-frontends.\xa0Luca first defines what he means by a micro-frontend. He advises that when designing a new application one should consider how to make it scalable from the beginning. His passion for micro-frontends came from working with DAZN, where they need to enable hundreds of people to work on the same project in different time zones and locations. This problem was solved by microservices.A microservice is a self contained, autonomous, independent service that can be deployed inside a system responding to an API you can consume. It only does one job, and when you have a backend that has multiple microservices you can move away from the old monolith, and scale one API at a time and apply an independent release of a service.Microservices are often applied to the backend, but Luca talks about how the same principles can be applied to the frontend. This is similar to the way that Netflix works. His advice is to think about how you can slice your frontend into individual pieces. Micro-frontends can work with both regular and micro-backends. Luca talks about how DAZN has developed, from a monolith front and back to utilizing microservices. He has found that using microservices has decreased the amount of code they release, increased their speed because decisions happen locally and independently from the rest of the program, and enables teams to work in parallel. Using microservices on both the front and backend has given this large organization greater agility overall.\xa0\xa0Luca addresses some risks with using micro-frontends. It is important to identify your business model before implementing a micro-frontend. They are more effective when you know where your site traffic goes and you can slice your frontend properly. When applied correctly, microservices can enable your app to get more elaborate because it will only load the code that it needs.\xa0Ari Clark wonders if having a micro-frontend helps you create autonomous teams with expertise that benefit your company or if the specialization affects your operational readiness if something goes wrong. One of the main challenges DAZN has had is knowledge sharing between teams, and he shares practices the company has implemented to help spread the information around to keep people from feeling isolated. He talks about how developer teams are set up in his company, with some temporary roles and some people in rotation. Developers are encouraged to change their team if they want to try another challenge. Luca has found that this set up causes people to stick around longer, but notes that it is important that your location be pretty stable in the number of people there before implementing this method. He also talks about how people other than developers are divided in the company.\xa0Luca talks about some of the challenges they’ve had with this organization and the tools they’ve employed that are conducive to this business structure. Some of their management methods are working in small iterations, creating bridges between teams, and centralizing some teams. They are currently working on creating a structure where developers at any stage can chip in. The panel discusses the value of this business setup.\xa0The panel asks Luca his feelings on code reuse. He believes it to be important, but not essential. He talks about how resing code is implemented in his company and how they are working on a way to make it better. Luca notes that if you have a unique framework you’re using, you need to have try to have multiple libraries of the same framework for different versions. He also talks about situations where he found duplicating code helpful. The show finishes with the panel discussing his article on micro-frontends on Medium.\xa0PanelistsAri ClarkChris FritzElizabeth FineBen HongWith special guest: Luca MezzaliraSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planElixir MixLinksDAZNMicroservice\xa0Amazon style dictionaryI Don't Understand Micro Frontends by Luca MezzaliraFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksAri Clark:What We Do in the Shadows on Netflix and HuluChris Fritz:VoiceAttackLover by Taylor SwiftElizabeth Fine:CookBook appBen Hong:Exhalation by Ted ChangPerplexus EpicLuca Mezzalira:The Phoenix ProjectBuilding Micro-Frontends Webinar September 30, 2019Follow Luca @lucamezzalira and at https://lucamezzalira.com | In this episode of Views on Vue the panel interviews core team member Rahul Kadyan. They discuss his various contributions to the vue ecosystem and his recent conference, Awesome Conf. The panel starts by asking Rahul about rollup-plugin-vue. Rollup is a bundle like webpack. When Rahul got his start in Vue he wanted to use rollup so he created rollup-plugin-vue. This caught the eye of the core team and he received an invite to join the core team.\xa0Rahul spends most of his time in Vue working with compilers, the panel asks him about template compilation. He explains when template compilation happens and how knowing how it works can help you create better templates. Rahul shares all the awesome things that can be done with templates.The topic moves to stand alone and runtime only builds in Vue. Rahul explains how each of these builds. The panel considers possible use cases for both builds. The stand alone build being larger is good for only about 10% of cases. The runtime only build works well in cases where you already have a build process. On top of Vue being smaller, it can also make your website run faster.\xa0\xa0\xa0Rahul recently gave a talk about single file components or SFC in Vue. He explains the easiest ways to use SFC and what it is capable of. The panel compares SFC to an ordinary JavaScript file. Rahul lists the benefits of using and SFC over a regular JavaScript file, one being you get the best out of the box render function in Vue.\xa0The panel asks about the work Rahul is doing at work, building a design language system. He explains the difference between a design system and a design language system.\xa0 A design language system defines what every interaction will look like, it has a larger scope than a regular design system. He explains how useful it is and what they use it for.\xa0Some of his other contributions to the Vue ecosystem include the vs code language plugin he is currently working on. In this project, he is exploring ways to find all your global components so that way he can provide completions for all the components. Also in this plugin, he is exploring using a compiler to get all the information about each component.\xa0 He is hoping to include editing capabilities which gets the panel really excited.\xa0Rahul has a repo called vue-lazy-hydration, which allows you to hydrate components as you need them while doing server-side rendering. He explains what he means by hydration and how by using async hydration the long delay that normally comes with server-side rendering is no longer a problem. He is currently creating demos for the repo.\xa0The first Awesome Conf was held recently and Rahul shares his experience setting it up. Awesome Conf is different than other conferences in that the speakers were actually the attendees. Rahul explains how all this came about. At first, they were going for a normal conference but didn’t get enough speakers, so they reached out to the attendees and told them they would have to provide the talks. They provided topics for the attendees to choose from and chose 15 talks from the ones submitted. With such a small conference they let everyone bring a plus one. The conference was a success and everyone had a great time.\xa0Rahul is looking forward to doing another Awesome Conf this time for design. He is still working out the details but he wants a diverse group that can really learn from each other. The panel considers what they would do if they were asked to speak. They share their fears of speaking and Rahul shares some of the advice he gave to the speakers as he helped them prepare for their talks.\xa0To finish the episode, Chris Fritz asks Rahul why he chooses to work with compilation. Rahul shares his story about getting into computer science and eventually compilation. He explains why he loves working in compilation and how it helps him as a front end developer.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0PanelistsChris FritzElizabeth FineAri ClarkGuestRahul KadyanSponsors\xa0\xa0Adventures in DevOpsSentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planThe iPhreaks ShowCacheFlyLinksDemystifying: The Dark Art of SFC Compilation with Rahul Kadyanhttps://github.com/vuejs/rollup-plugin-vuehttps://github.com/znck/lazy-hydrationhttps://connect.tech/https://twitter.com/znck0?lang=enhttps://awesomeconf.design/\xa0https://www.facebook.com/ViewsonVuehttps://twitter.com/viewsonvuePicksChris Fritz:Build a self-care appCrazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American PsycheChildren of RuinInterference: a novel (Semiosis Duology Book 2)Elizabeth Fine:https://illustrated.dev/Ari Clark:ForagerRahul Kadyan:Love, Death & RobotsDetroit: Become Human | Episode Summary\xa0In this week’s episode of Views one Vue, the panel interviews Vue’s biggest fan, Gwendolyn Faraday. Gwen shares her story of getting into vue. How she was a little reluctant at first but ended up being so impressed with everything Vue has to offer. Gwen is a Vue educator and loves how easy it is to teach Vue, with its great docs and human-focused design.\xa0Gwen explains why she is such a big fan of Vue. It is easy to use. It is intuitive to use. The documentation is wonderfully written. She loves that Vuex and Vue Router are actual Vue products that work seamlessly with the framework, making a cohesive ecosystem. She declares that Vue is not just for beginners, it is a production-ready, battle-tested language with a human-driven design.\xa0\xa0\xa0The panel asks Gwen what makes learning and teaching Vue easier. Gwen explains that Redux is complex and hard to understand while Vuex is much simpler to understand. She tells the panel that Vue is much easier to learn because it has fewer complex concepts and fewer layers of abstraction. This makes it easier for new developers to get started coding sooner.\xa0\xa0Gwen considers some of the common problems she experiences while teaching programming languages, not just Vue. For Gwen it can be hard to go slow and hit each step, not skipping any small step or concept. Explaining, Gwen tells the panel it is hard to remember what it was like not to know anything or remembering what was hard to grasp at first. Vocabulary and programming jargon is another thing Gwen share that can be hard to teach. This inspires the panel to consider how often developers get drawn into their own world and language, not remembering that others might not understand what they are talking about.\xa0\xa0Chris Fritz, who has a background in education, wonders how Gwen got started teaching. Gwen explains that teaching is just a natural way for her to learn. When she wants to learn something she started meetups. Her meetups help her learn and grow. The panel considers that concept and thinks of their experiences learning through teaching.\xa0\xa0The panel brings up Gwen’s self-taught coding education. Ari Clark wonders how being self-taught affected her teaching abilities. Gwen considers this, then gives some of her thoughts on the different ways someone can learn to code. She gives a few recommendations for learning code and encourages everyone to figure out if they can or want to actually do the job before putting in too much time and resources into learning.\xa0\xa0Gwen, shy by nature, explains how she goes about getting to know people at meetups or in the community.\xa0 She explains how she likes to give a talk as a way of introducing herself to everyone at once. The panel thinks this is a genius plan for shy people. They explain that people are often shy and awkward because their role is undefined. By speaking or running a meetup they are in control, they know what they are supposed to be doing and have a defined role.\xa0The next topic the panel discusses is Gwen’s meetups. She runs two meetups, the first is a group for beginners and intermediate. It has grown to over 1100 members. Also, she recently started a blockchain meet up. Gwen admits that she is no blockchain expert and loves that hosting this meetup she is pushed to learn. The panel is impressed that she admits that she is not an expert and consider how fearful people can be of admitting that they don’t know everything.\xa0\xa0The panel asks Gwen questions about running her meetups. She explains how it can be a struggle to find speakers. Though it is easier to find speakers for her beginners' group because people are always willing to help beginners. Blockchain being more niche has more of a study group feel, as the number of members is lower and they are all sort of learning together.\xa0\xa0The panel asks Gwen about her talk in Australia about why Vue is growing so fast. In her talk she describes Vue as the gold standard of the JavaScript world and that all other frameworks need to catch up. In her talk she points out her frustrations when using other frameworks and how Vue takes all the good elements from other frameworks. She admits she wanted to call her talk “Why Vue.js is the Best Framework Ever”.\xa0\xa0Confident Growth, the title of a podcast episode about Gwen is discussed. Gwen explains that that podcast episode was about her journey and the producers came up with the name Confident Growth after the interview. The panel then asks Gwen about imposter syndrome and the advice she would give for those who are struggling with it. Gwen explains that we all experience the same struggles and we need to support and encourage each other.\xa0\xa0Gwen has a great approach to things that make her uncomfortable and an addiction to learning. She explains she hates not knowing how to do something. The panel considers how Gwen’s homeschool background inspired this love of learning. Chris’s activist side comes out as he touches on his frustrations with how education works in this country.\xa0\xa0Gwen has a few things to say to those programmers who feel that Vue too simple and only for beginners. She gives many examples of how Vue can be used to build simple yet advanced apps. The panel considers the mindset that something that is simple or easy to use and understand can’t be a powerful tool.\xa0\xa0The episode ends with Gwen telling listeners to look for her at a few upcoming conferences around the world. She also has a book coming out about teaching yourself how to code.PanelistsBen HongChris FritzAri ClarkGuestGwendolyn FaradaySponsors\xa0\xa0My JavaScript StorySentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in DevOpsCacheFlyLinks\xa0Why Vue.js is Taking Over the Front-end World - Gwendolyn FaradayEpisode 347 | Gwen Faraday - Confident Growthhttps://www.meetup.com/Free-Code-Camp-Indy/members/188721354/https://www.meetup.com/Indianapolis-Blockchain-Developers/https://www.meetup.com/vuejsindy/GOTO Copenhagen 2019https://www.buildstuff.lt/https://ndc-london.com/https://twitter.com/gwen_faraday?lang=enhttp://gwenfaraday.com/https://github.com/gwenfhttps://www.facebook.com/ViewsonVuehttps://twitter.com/viewsonvuePicksBen Hong:ScreenflowChris Fritz:Elite Dangeroushttps://www.alfiekohn.org/Noam Chomsky- Manufacturing consent (1992)Exhalation: StoriesAri Clark:GlowGwendolyn Faraday:https://www.freecodecamp.org/Saga | Episode SummaryIn this episode of Views on Vue, the panel waxes philosophical while talking with Microsoft advocate Chris Noring. Chris is also the senior cloud developer at Microsoft and has experience in a variety of frameworks including, .NET, Angular, React and Vue.\xa0The first topic the panel discusses is Chris’s work with VuePress. Chris shares why he chose VuePress and what his experience has been with using it. Chris describes the absolute simplicity of using VuePress. Chris goes on to explain that though VuePress may not come with all the bells and whistles, it is easy to add the features he wants with his opensource GitHub repo. The panel takes a minute to discuss the VuePress blog plugin.\xa0\xa0Remembering a talk that Chris gave, the panel discusses imposter syndrome. The panel all shares the feelings of inadequacy they have all felt at some time or another. Chris explains how he overcame imposter syndrome and share tips for others to overcome it as well.\xa0\xa0The panel then discusses the interesting story of how Chris became a developer advocate.

The panel lists attributes they love in a talk that makes them want to jump onto their computers and code: having an easy call to action with resources, start the talk with why the audience should listen and what they stand to gain from the talk, and authentic humor are only a few. Amazing example talks and speakers are given as resources to study these attributes. The panel also discusses cringe-worthy mistakes made by speakers that can kill an interesting talk: too many words on your slides or reading from your slides, rambling personal anecdotes, tangents, and jokes, or being overly professional and talking down to your audience and many more. Advice is given on how to correct these problems\xa0The panel discusses how to get started speaking at conferences and gives advice for submitting conference proposals (CFP). The benefits of starting small by speaking at local meetups are considered. Local meetup organizers are always looking for willing speakers and by giving talks here first speakers can receive friendly and honest feedback. Chris Fritz gives instructions on how to get useful feedback instead of polite compliments from the audience. The panel gives advice on writing talks, most importantly to have an objective for your talk. Ben Hong explains why it is important to submit more than one CFP\xa0and more than one type of talk. The panel discusses the different types of talks and reminds listeners not to undervalue case studies because each experience is unique and valuable. Chris and Ben share what organizers look for in CFP’s and why they may be rejected.

She makes awesome care package designs that you can buy. I ask about inexpensive ideas for things to send, unique ideas, homemade, staples to send every time etc. She sends a large flat rate USPS box about once a month full of goodies when her husband is deployed. We talk care package themes, her favorite one to put together, his favorite one he has received. She also gives the best tip: wrap all the contents inside the care package for a little extra fun and surprise. You don’t need to do this every time but it’s a fun surprise.Rachel also mentions how during Christmas time she will spend a box full of stuff that her husband can give to the other guys because some guys don’t receive mail during their deployments. I get the run down on just how to ship care packages to deployed soldiers: hint use the USPS (they are the cheapest and will have all the forms you need.)\xa0One of the things I love most about Rachel’s shop is when you buy a care package design she includes a list of things that could go with the theme of the care package you bought. How cool, right?\xa0Rachel’s instagram\xa0Rachel’s shop: Countdowns and CupcakesHurry Up and Wait Instagram\xa0 | On episode 23, I talk about the importance of having a duty station bucket list. Get your free printable checklist here. Start making a duty station bucket list 2 months before you PCS to your new duty station. First make a bucket list of the things you want to do at your current base with only 2 months left. Is there a restaurant you have been meaning to try or an activity that you loved doing and you want to do it again before you PCS? Setting up a duty station bucket list also helps you get out of PCS mode. PCSes are stressful and usually I keep my head down and power through but that means lost time that I could be enjoying the area I am in. So this is a good reminder to do that.\xa0I would start my bucket list for the base I am PCSing to about a month before. This gets you excited about going to a new military installation even though you are in the mist of a stressful time. First category to think about when making your list is food/ restaurants. What is your favorite food or a food that is unique to that area? Maybe you are going to Washington State and you need to try the coffee at the original Starbucks. Maybe you are going to the south and need to try the pulled pork. Then think about outdoor or nature activities that you could do. Are there state parks near by? What about museum or education things to do?\xa0Don’t forget about free activities. And things to do at home like painting a wall or making a really delicious dessert you don’t make often. Also, a great way to find cool things is searching the events of the towns near you and seeing what they are putting on.\xa0Hurry Up and Wait on Instagram\xa0Hurry Up and Wait Blog\xa0 | On Episode 22 of Hurry Up and Wait, I talk with Lizann Lightfoot, the Seasoned Spouse, about the new book she wrote called Ultimate Deployment Guide which is available on Amazon. Her and her husband have been together for 19 years and through 7 deployments so she knows a thing or two. She is a writer and blogger and creates awesome resources for other military spouses which can all be found through the links on her blog.\xa0She is passionate about answering questions, sharing knowledge with other spouses and pointing them in the direction of the resources they have available to them. We then drive into her recently published book Ultimate Deployment Guide. She created this guide as a way for spouses to feel more confident and at peace when facing a deployment. The book is non branch specific so it should work no matter what branch of the military your service member is in. This book includes checklists and worksheets which means it is personal and you make it your own. The worksheets include getting emergency contact info, writing down all the joint account passwords/ usernames, household budget, car maintenance, etc. The book also includes information on care packages, self-care, and creating a bucket list for yourself during the deployment.\xa0Then, we chat about communication during a deployment. Lizann gives some great advice about keeping expectations manageable. You don’t really know what communication options are going to be available for a certain deployment until your service member is gone. They might have an idea but remember every deployment is different. Also, Lizann says she gets a ton of questions about the homecoming part of deployment and this again comes down to expectations and communication. Also, I ask about sharing stressful news with your service member that is deployed and how to go about that if they can’t really help with the situation. Will it just make them more stressed?\xa0I end the interview by asking Lizann some logistical questions about writing and publishing a book as well as other resources.\xa0Go find Lizann at Seasoned Spouse and you can get her book on Amazon.\xa0Also, remember to contact her if you are buying in bulk because she can give you a discount!\xa0Instagram: The Seasoned Spouse\xa0Most popular post on the Seasoned Spouse: 17 unusual things military families get for free.\xa0 | Hurry Up and WaitOn Episode 21, I talk all things PCS Binder. The PCS Binder is a school binder you make and fill with all your important documents, in transits papers, and other useful information to stay organized and help you be a little less stressed during your PCS. There is a lot of paperwork that goes into a PCS and having it all in one place is necessary to stay sane. Keep this binder on your person throughout your PCS. You want to know where it is and you never know who is going to need a copy of your orders.How to make the PCS binder? First you need a binder, minimum of 2 inches. I have and love the one that fully zips around, you know like the ones we had in elementary school. Then you’ll need dividers to divid your sections, plastic page protectors, and a pencil pouch.\xa0Then I walk you through my PCS binder. First is the pencil pouch which has our passports, extra car keys, check book, and other random things. The first page after the pencil pouch is all the copies of our orders. I have about 10 copies all within one plastic sleeve. Orders are really one of the most important pieces of information in your binder so I keep them at the front. Next I have is an emergency contact list. On this list are numbers of friends, hotels, airlines, etc, this is just in case your phone dies or you lose it at some point. Get the Master List of all things to possibly include in your PCS Binder.\xa0Next the dividers. Go check out the awesome company List and File they create beautiful PCS binder dividers. They make military life more beautifully organized while giving you greater confidence and peace of mind.First divider, Personal Info, this divider should include things like birth certificates, social security cards, marriage certificates, copies of passports/ IDs. Listen to the full episode to get the list of all the things I actually put in my binder behind each divider. Second divider is housing which includes lease agreements, security deposit receipts, HHG shipment paperwork, inventory, etc. Next, is auto/ vehicle under this tab you should include car titles, registrations, any shipment info. Next, is the pet divider this should include rabies vaccinations, health certificates, microchip numbers etc. Other dividers to include medical (health), legal, finance, and any other ones that apply to you and your family like if you have kids you might have an education tab for their school records.\xa0The PCS Binder is a must have for any military family. Remember there is no right way to do it, just make it work for you.\xa0PCS Binder paperwork list.\xa0Again, check out List and File to order beautiful PCS binder dividers and find them on Instagram.\xa0These look like great PCS Binder Printable’s if you are looking for some. | Today I talk with Samantha about the program her husband is currently doing called Green to Gold. It’s a program in the military that allows enlisted soldiers to transition to officers. The option in this program that Samantha’s husband chose is for 2 years where he finishes his Bachelor’s degree and does ROTC at the college as well.\xa0I ask Samantha about pay, benefits, and BAH. What does healthcare look like since they aren’t close to a base? How did their family go about choosing a college? Does the GI Bill pay for his school? What was the application process like? She said that the process is super competitive and takes about a year to complete all the requirements. The basic requirements are you have to be 30 or under and have enough time in service to complete the program.\xa0Samantha talks about going back to work full time. I ask Samantha about any role changes in the home since they do have young kids and since she is working full time. She says that her husband has taken on lots of those responsibility now and they are all joyful to be getting to spend more time together since Samantha’s husband was previously in a drill sergeants position. Now he is in college and making his own schedule.\xa0This program is a great option for those that are looking to be career service members. Your soldier gets payed while going to college, you get more family time, you have more stability (no unexpected deployments) and when the soldier is finished they will be an officer.\xa0Instagram: @raisealittlewonderBlog: Raise A Little WonderArticles by Samantha on Military Family Magazine.\xa0Hurry Up and Wait on Instagram\xa0 | On this episode I give you the most important acronyms that any military significant other or spouse should know. I say there are 25 but in reality there are closer to 35 acronyms in this episode because some that I placed under one number are actually multiple acronyms depending on the branch or where you are located. Anyway, here I am just going to give you the top 10 acronyms you should know and you will have to listen to the episode to get all 35!\xa0DOD - Department of Defense. The executive branch department of the federal government in charge of the military and national security. So all service members are employees of the DOD.\xa0MOS - Military Occupational Specialty. The job that the solider has. In the Navy they call them ratings. \xa0PCS - Permanent Change of Station.CONUS - Continental United States (the 48 states)\xa0OCONUS - Outside the Continental United States so everything overseas and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam.\xa0BAH- Basic Housing Allowance. The money you are allotted to pay for housing if you live off base.\xa0DEERS - Defense Enrollment Eligibly Reporting System. You need to be enrolled in this system to get any benefits, have TriCare insurance, etc.\xa0OPSEC - Operational Security\xa0FRG- Family Readiness Group. A group to help support the family members of the soldiers.\xa0TLA/TLE - Temporary Lodging Allowance or Expense. The allowance you get or expenses you accumulate when you are PCSing.\xa0Listen to the full episode to get all 25 acronyms. Which is closer to 35 since some acronyms had multiple variations.\xa0The cool thing I am sharing with you this week is the children’s book My Letter to Daddy by Renee Walker.\xa0Follow my podcast on Instagram.\xa0 | On episode 18, I talk with Shawna about the pressures and stereotypes of being an officer’s wife. She mentions the expectations of being an FRG leader and also the pressure to know the language of the army since her husband is a Major and in a command position. We chat about why higher ranking officer wives and enlisted wives are usually the ones in the FRG or Spouse club leadership positions. This shows that there is community and supportiveness not just for the soldiers but also for their families.\xa0I ask about dress and behavior since the family might be seen as an extension of the spouse in command. Shawna mentions it is not too much of a concern for her but she is aware of what is appropriate to wear and how to behave. Shawna answers the question “Is being an officer really ‘political’?”\xa0Then, I ask Shawna about all the officer wive stereotypes. Can enlisted wives and officer wives be friends? Shawna says yes absolutely. The only time it might get iffy is when the enlisted personnel is under the command of the officer. Do officer wives really request to be saluted at the gate? Do they think they are better than enlisted wives? Shawna gives us the run down on all the stereotypes and busts the myths that are out there. We then end on a positive note and Shawna gives us a wonderful example of the community coming together to help each other out. Shawna's Instagram: @fieldslikehomePodcast InfoInstagram @hurryupandwait | On episode 17, I give you the run down on the Loaner Closet or Lending Locker (it has various names) resource that the military provides during your relocation or PCS move. Almost all bases have one and it is a service that provides household items during your PCS either in or out of the duty station while you are waiting for your goods to arrive. There is definitely going to be a time when you are without your things and this resource is helpful to reduce costs and makes it so you don’t have to buy duplicate items.\xa0The resource will be located at your base's family/community center. In order to use the resource you need to show your military ID and your PCS orders. When you go into the loan closet you will most likely fill out a form with contact info and mark down on an inventory sheet what you are taking.\xa0The average check out window for items is 30 days for CONUS stations. A few bases policy was 2 weeks for check out time. OCONUS the check out time is usually 90 days. Usually you can get an extension if you still need the items. Makes sure to clean the stuff before you return it. And this service doesn’t take personal donations.\xa0So what’s available? Kitchen stuff is going to be the most important items for day to day use. Things like plates, bowls, cups, silverware, pots, pans, bakewear, knives, mugs, can openers, etc. Some bases also have small appliances like coffee pots, blenders, tvs, and irons. It’s all first some first serve but you might luck out and find air mattresses, sleeping cots, or futons available. Most bases listed some baby items like high chairs, pack and plays, strollers. One big thing to note: no one is going to provide linens. So when you are packing for your upcoming PCS pack linens with you for when you're in limbo and sleeping on an air mattress.\xa0Today’s shout out is to the subscription box for military spouses, Brave Crate. It is a box full of products, calendars, challenges, and inspiration to help you get through and count down the months until your soldier returns from deployment. Check it out on instagram.\xa0Podcast InfoInstagram @hurryupandwait_ | On this episode I talk with Michelle about the opportunity and her family’s decision to stay at one duty station for another 5 years. So Michelle will be at the same duty station for 8 years (10 years for her husband) which isn’t really normal by military standards.They decided to stay because, for one no one likes moving. But more importantly because Michelle has established a career, they have purchased their home, and they have great friends. Pros of staying at one base: really making it your home, knowing the area better, keeping the same doctor, being at the same church, getting to know people better, and having stability while there are unknowns like trainings and deployments. Cons: not getting to experience other places.I ask about having friends come in and out of her life while she stays at the same base. She gives some great advice that any military spouse should take: continue to expand your friend group, even when you think you have a good one. Then we talk Michelle’s job and how lucky she has been to have a great career but staying in the lower 48 states was needed.I ask her about routines and Michelle says they aren’t routine people and hey, that’s okay. They don’t like routines but they love the stability and knowing they have a home to come back to especially since Michelle travels for work and her husband has trainings and deployments.I ask her what she likes about Fort Bragg because being in one duty station would not be fun if you didn’t like that duty station! She says it has everything a person could want. It’s driving distance to the beach, major cities and airports and just 4 hours to the mountains. She also mentions how Fayetteville is an awesome town and the people have great respect for their military community.Michelle’s Instagram\xa0Michelle’s PodcastPodcast InfoInstagram @hurryupandwait_ | This episode is all about preparing for the day the movers come to pack out your household goods. I know it might seem like since the military is moving you, you shouldn’t have to do any prepping but if you want a smooth move for yourself then there are a few things you should do. Most of these things will make it easier for your future self when you go to unpack your goods, some of these things are to help with making the moving day as easy as possible, and some things are to help with everyone’s sanity.\xa0First, clean! Vacuum out your couches, dust of places that haven’t been seen in a while (like the tops of printers), and wash your towels and linens. Declutter and then declutter some more. 1st episode of this podcast on declutter before a PCS. Don’t forget to remove all the garbage from your house. Have you heard that horror story of people’s trash getting backed with their stuff or what about someones plunger getting packed with their clothes! ewww.\xa0That leads me to my second point, organize. You need to separate shipments. What are you packing and taking with you on your flight or in the car? Do you have an unaccompanied baggage shipment? If so, separate those and remove them from the area where the movers will be. Locking things in your car or in a bathroom is a good idea. This is especially crucial for important documents and necessary items, like medication.\xa0You need to remove the photos and shelves from the walls. Put similar items in gallon size ziplocks things like pens and pencils, silverware, hair ties and bobby pins etc. This just makes it easier for your to find things later. The movers won’t care if this is done or not they will pack everything the way it is when they come into your home. Every company is different but this is a pretty good list of items the movers won’t pack.\xa0Next, be prepared to label your boxes on the day of the move. I print out categories on the Avery 3x4 labels but a big sharpie pen will do and just walk around and label the boxes as the packers are packing. You probably should provide water for your packers and also getting a light lunch or box of donuts is nice although not necessary.\xa0Last, if you have kids or pets it is a good idea to arrange day care for them on the day the packers come. It is a long stressful day(s) even for adults!\xa0Podcast instagram: @hurryupandwait_", 'chan_desc': 'Army wife and podcast host Carlee Wengel shares tips, tricks, advice, and personal stories to help guide you on your military spouse adventure.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/8e/d5/6c/8ed56c9b-43d4-9299-f27e-3985f11d3a99/mza_4035976595213843132.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-10'}}

The students examine the concept of academic identity, where students become so wrapped up in academic achievement that it starts to define them. Teacher Frank Mata was the advisor to the club and says because students were not being graded on this project he thought they were freed creatively. This is Mata’s first podcasting project with students and he sought help from two passionate teachers in his district who co-host an EdChat podcast. | In this episode we go to Cedar Ridge High School in Hillsborough North Carolina and listen to Laura Isenhour's class's podcast discussions.

These include efforts by the U.S. Department of Education to alter rules developed during the Obama Administration. In addition, Congress continues to focus on trying to come up with a workable plan to update the Higher Education Act. Regulatory Activity The Department of Education has been attempting to make a number of revisions to rules created during the Obama Administration. Most recently, the Department made a seismic shift on gainful employment on June 28. The department soft-launched a final rule that overturns the 2009-2010 regulations as well as the 2014 regulations, including Subpart Q and R, and drops the mandated reporting requirements, student warnings for programs that were deemed failing and any further notification or follow-up of pending appeals with the department. Because of the master calendar, the full rescission was to be effective on July 1, 2020; however, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos used her authority to allow institutions to begin to follow this new rule after it was published in the Federal Register. The Department did attempt to fill the void in accountability after rescinding the rules. The Department plans to make significant changes to the College Scorecard by adapting much of the previously required information and create additions that would address disclosures. This change would offer transparency by allowing students to see this information (although it doesn’t address programs that are performing at a “lesser than” level). Some people have expressed frustrations and concerns about these changes but it’s good to remember that over the years, educational policymakers and stakeholders have learned a lot. Therefore, this approach to disclosure may be better than using a guillotine on institutions. Moving forward, policymakers and institutions can continue to learn more about improving institutional assessment using the three-legged stool: accreditation’s oversight of curriculum; state review of institutions based on their role and responsibilities; and the Department of Education’s focus on oversight and financial aid. Additionally, more changes are expected on the regulatory side. The Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations have been approved to go forward, although they are expected to be subject to court challenges once published. They are now with the Office of Management and Budget and should be published in the near future. In addition, three packages that were part of the most recent round of federal negotiation and rulemaking on accreditation and innovation were approved by consensus. The Department published a notice in May/June that the first of those packages was subject to notice of proposed rulemaking so that interested parties could review. That feedback was due by July 12. The other two packages still have to come out. Because there was consensus, these packages are on their way to final rule by Nov. 1. However, there are three major areas where disagreements still continue. These areas includes institutional eligibility and accountability, Title IX/Cleary and loan repayment. The concerns about Title IX/Cleary are at the forefront of the Senate HELP Committee’s discussion about reauthorization. These final rules probably won’t be agreeable to both parties. Democrats are concerned about protecting the interest of the victims while Republicans are focused on providing protection to the accused. Thus, the Senate committee is having difficulty finding a balance between offering protections to both parties. Upper-level legislative staff are currently in dialogue to try to find common ground. Concerns also exist about loan repayment. These include the opportunity for public service loan forgiveness, other types of loan forgiveness and the reduction of overall repayment plans. Higher Education Act With a short timeline available in the legislative process before the election cycle takes over, it’s becoming less likely that the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act will take place. Sen. Alexander, Sen. Murray and staff continue to hold weekly meetings as well as have discussions with members of their respective parties to see if they can come up with a comprehensive bill. There are pieces of reauthorization that everyone can come to terms with because they are much needed and in the best needs of students. These areas include student loan interest rates, financial literacy, loan repayment and simplification of the FAFSA. Sen. Alexander is focused on his burnishing his legacy by trying to pass revisions to the Higher Education Act. The question becomes whether he will be able to negotiate a bill that Democrats agree with or will end up crafting one that is specific to the Republican agenda. He also may focus on developing smaller bills that are bipartisan in nature that move smaller chunks through the legislative process. Discussions already have begun about alternate plans in case a comprehensive bill is not agreed upon. In the House, Chairman Scott has completed five bipartisan hearings that he and ranking member Fox agreed to. The committee will have one more hearing on apprenticeships. There remains a question about whether the House would take up the Higher Education Act in different forms, such as the piecemeal version mentioned earlier. Some insiders suggest that Chairman Scott is only interested in taking up a comprehensive bill. As we enter the second half of 2019, there is a lot of movement going on in the Congress -- and no assurance as to how things will play out. Netting will be surprised if reauthorization is completed this year. The Democrats probably won’t have time to put together a comprehensive bill unless they simply use the AIM Higher Act. However, that act has major issues from a scoring perspective and would need to be trimmed to make it fiscally palatable to Republicans. Trying to find middle ground going into an election year makes it tough. However, history shows that this type of collaborative effort can happen in an election year. Higher education—especially in areas such as student cost, student debt and academics--has changed significantly since the last authorization in 2008. Therefore, college students and the higher education system deserve a more timely authorization process. Recommendations for Higher Education Leaders:  Keep an eye on what is happening on the regulatory front. This could especially impact the functions of the financial aid office, human resources office and law enforcement office. Take the opportunity to make comments about proposed rules. Higher education leaders’ comments need to come from a holistic institutional perspective. Watch for a Senate bill to reauthorize the Higher Education Act moving forward between July and the end of September. If legislation doesn’t start moving in September, the chance that Congress will pass legislation will start dwindling as the election cycle approaches. Review the College Scorecard and the proposals in relation to it for the upcoming changes.  Bullet Points  The U.S. Department of Education continues to revise and reverse rules created during the Obama Administration. The most recent revision involves gainful employment. This revision drops the reporting requirements. The department plans to include some of these deleted reporting elements in the College Scorecard. The Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations have been approved to go forward. These are now with the Office of Management and Budget and should be published in the near future. Three packages that were part of the most recent round of federal negotiation and rulemaking on accreditation and innovation were able to achieve consensus. Major disagreements still are evident in the rule-making process for institutional eligibility and accountability, Title IX/Cleary and loan repayment. With the election cycle on the horizon, it’s becoming less likely that Congress will complete the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Therefore, there may be an effort to offer piecemeal solutions to areas where Republicans and Democrats can find common ground. These areas include student loan interest rates, financial literacy, loan repayment and simplification of the FAFSA.

She was the longest-seated president in the CSU system and the first woman to hold this role in history. Haynes began her presidency in 2004 when the institution had a student population of 7,000 and an alumni base of 13,000. Through her leadership, the campus grew to serve 17,000 students and now has approximately 45,000 alumni. More than 100 new academic programs were launched during her tenure, including the first engineering program in 2019. Haynes also has overseen the addition of 15 new buildings as well as the planning for the university’s Extended Learning Building, which opens in fall 2019 through a one-of-a-kind public-private partnership. Establishing Bold Goals Haynes believes that holding a university presidency offers the opportunity to work with faculty and the community to envision what a truly 21st-century\xa0university can look like. In her own case, she pointed to the richness of the San Diego region, the area’s diverse demographics (which include the military and 18 tribal communities) and the ongoing population growth as fuel that helped Cal State San Marco, which is 100 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and the only higher education institution in this area, to evolve and prosper. Haynes entered Cal State San Marcos’s presidency when the university was 13 years old. The fact that she was able to set what she described as “audacious” institutional goals and then go on to achieve them was due to a supportive faculty and community as well as having a legislature that was supportive of Cal State San Marcos’ efforts. These goals included:  Raising the educational attainment rate for the entire region. Diversifying the student population to mirror the diversity of the region. Changing the narrative so that Cal State San Marcos was no longer the best-kept secret in North County; instead, the institution connected through partnerships to different constituent groups and organizations who understood the institution’s value.  In addition to setting goals, the institution identified strategies to create, execute, annually measure, refine and revise these goals. Increasing Educational Attainment One example of how these goals made a difference was in relation to the institution’s education attainment rate. To begin to understand this rate, Haynes looked at the college-going rate of the area’s school districts. At that time, most school districts were not adequately preparing students to enroll in college following their graduation from high school. In addition, the majority (70%) of the students who were academically ready for college were white. Realizing the gap that existed, Hayes worked with CSU San Marcos administrators and faculty to establish numerous bold goals. The institution also identified strategies to create, execute, annually measure, refine and revise these goals. The results of their work included:  A 50% increase in first-generation students attending Cal State San Marcos. Graduating classes have grown to between 50-55 percent first-generation students. The university grew from 7,000 students to 17,000 students during Haynes’ tenure.  Data-Driven Decision-Making Ultimately, Cal State San Marcos’ decision to be data-driven to identify what practices worked and what was less successful put the institution ahead of the curve when the Cal State System started to focus on specific achievement gap. Haynes noted these sustained efforts resulted in Cal State San Marcos enjoying a 0 percent gap between majority and under-represented students from first year to second year, which often indicates whether a student will complete their degree and graduate from college. Working with School Districts Haynes noted that achieving these results required non-traditional thinking involving both the university as well as the school district. She pointed out that some Cal State San Marcos stakeholders (especially faculty) belived that working with school districts was outside of the university’s scope and mission. However, Haynes disagreed, saying that without creating these partnerships and helping teachers understand what students needed to start learning and by what grade, students would not be ready for college. CSU San Marcos established multiple partnerships with local school districts, and as part of these partnerships, the university created guaranteed admission for K-12 students if they followed the pathway identified by the University.These efforts raised attainment rates and diversified Cal State San Marcos’ student population. More importantly, these partnerships brought more students to the institution who were prepared for college work and didn’t need remediation. Faculty and other stakeholders worked with K-12 school districts, which ultimately saved CSU San Marcos money and faculty time. Extensive Partnerships Haynes formed a number of key relationships with North San Diego County communities and businesses in a strategic effort to reach out and operationalize the president’s initiatives. For example, Cal State San Marcos created Chamber Champions that involved the city chambers and economic development companies from the 11 communities in the institution’s service area. Through this effort, 6-8 Cal State San Marcos administrators or faculty were involved with those chambers. These individuals were the university’s voice while also serving as a conduit for the businesses to express their feedback on workforce issues to the university. These connections increased Cal State San Marcos’ visibility in the county. In addition, the university and each of its colleges had an advisory board that served as a sounding board in which to get stakeholders’ input. When she took over the presidency, Haynes inherited a small (10-member) council that wasn’t representative of the region’s sectors or demographics. She used this as a starting point, but also began to diversity and increase it to where it now has 40 members. These advisory boards give the institution input that helps it identify workforce issues as well as emerging areas where new programs are needed. A great example of this is Cal State San Marcos’ new biotechnology and engineering programs.Haynes used this feedback to create these new programs as well as other degree and certificate programs. There was an added benefit to these boards in that they also helped the university communicate its needs with the legislature and community, as well as developed its outreach efforts to Temecula.These efforts led to its creating an off-campus center in Riverside County, thus helping students who lived there and expanding CSU San Marcos’ footprint in the region. Real World Experiences Cal State San Marcos has developed and continues to develop programs that give students real-world experience prior to graduation. For instance, the school’s business school has implemented a program called Senior Experience, a required credit course, that requires its students to work in a team and to do a high-quality project with a local company during their senior year. This project gives students work experiences that are more extensive than an internship.Many students get job offers from the businesses that participate in these experiences. These projects also serve as good publicity about the quality of Cal State San Marcos programs. Another business school program, the mentor program, involves MBA students, who are assigned a mentor that they can rely on. The program has grown and is drawing high-caliber mentors who love working with students. Three Tips for New University Presidents Three pieces of advice for new university presidents:  Start by actively listening. Whatever experience or vision you have that you can bring to the new job, you also need to hear the stories and aspirations of the people on campus. Otherwise, it will be difficult to get these individuals to follow and align with you. Pace yourself. Everyone will want a piece of you. Within that pacing, the preponderance of time and focus needs to be internal to listen to these constituencies. Take the position very seriously. University presidencies are important to complex organizations. However, don’t take yourself seriously. Be authentic and have fun.  Bullet Points  Higher education institutions can set “audacious” institutional goals if they have faculty and community support. To reach these goals requires the institution to identify strategies to create, execute, annually measure, refine and revise these goals. Some goals require innovative partnerships to be successful. For instance, Cal State San Marcos formed a partnership with school districts to increase educational attainment. This effort enabled university representatives to educate K-12 administrators and faculty about college-level work and to increase high school students’ level of knowledge by graduation. This meant that Cal State San Marcos could forego the cost and time needed to remediate these students. Cal State San Marcos created a number of innovative programs, including advisory programs and Chamber Champions. This latter outreach effort involved the city chambers and economic development companies from the 11 communities in the institution’s service area. This effort placed university administrators and faculty as representatives to the chambers so they could learn about industry needs and also communicate the university’s programs. Cal State San Marcos is increasingly trying to provide more real-world opportunities to students prior to graduation. For instance, business students work in teams during their senior year to assist a business or organization on a project. This enables the students to get experience beyond their internship and often results in a job offer.

Developing these strategies should include reviewing current messages, crafting new messages, and reallocating resources from ineffective marketing efforts to promising pilot programs. Changing the Paradigm Higher education marketing departments get a bad rap because many don’t have marketing experience that corporations or other industries have. However, the majority of higher education’s marketing issues are not due to failures of the marketing department. Instead, these issues are due to the institution’s inability to identify the type of students who enroll, the reasons why they come to the institution and why are they successful. Research tells us that most current students enroll in an institution within a 40-mile radius of their home so they can be a commuter student. An example of this is Aurora University outside of Chicago. Instead of thinking about how to market to more students from a wider geographic location to fill up dorms, Aurora realized it needed to meet the needs of commuter students who want to complete their degree program quickly at a very low price. The institution is trying to attract more of these types of students by offering top-quality programs attractive to commuter students. In addition, institutional leaders realize this approach may mean that some dorms may need to close. Refining Marketing Efforts Most institutions are trying to be “all things to all people” through casting a wide net for students, but this approach waters down the marketing message because the institution generally is not clear about what they offer--and do not offer—to prospective students. Smart institutions are realizing that they have to stop this, and they are becoming more targeted in their marketing efforts.\xa0 This leads to greater efficiency and more cost-effective marketing.\xa0 They increasingly are able to recognize who their target market is and then use that information to attract those types of students. These institutions look at the students who enroll and complete their degree programs in order to analyze several factors:  Who are these students? What do they look like? What do they want? Why are they coming to the institution? Why are they successful?  \xa0 Institutions then can use this information to craft marketing messages to attract more of these types of students. Market Research Institutions that take a blanket marketing approach (instead of a targeted personalized marketing approach) create a tremendous amount of institutional waste. The vast majority of institutions don’t have a large budget for formal market research, and consequently, don’t do the positioning and differentiation that’s important in marketing. Fortunately, College Board and ACT have resources and data to identify where an institution’s students are coming from and how to reach those students. Informal market research can be helpful too, especially through anecdotal information such as feedback from current students. Conversations such as these can provide rich data and are supplemented by having similar conversations with faculty, staff, and alumni, and will help institutions craft their messages on how they can differentiate themselves from competitors, as well as identify gaps in the university’s marketing materials. Finding New Avenues One area that is ripe for plucking is that many students do not have the realization that their career will require a lot of work on projects that have a messy start and require continual refinements until project completion. This has huge marketing implications. Institutions can highlight the number of students enrolled and educational outcomes, as well as the programs that help students be successful. This makes the degree worth it, thus offsetting questions about the value of a college degree, and can differentiate the institution from its competitors. Furthermore, it’s important for higher education institutions to look at today’s markets to identify what students want and then develop plans for how to offer these types of programs. For example, the traditional MBA program in which people take time off from their jobs to pursue this graduate degree is no longer working for many people, and consequently, the number of traditional MBA programs is declining. Aurora University has developed a plus-one program in which students who have completed their undergraduate degree can complete an extra year of business coursework, including an internship, to earn an MBA, thus helping students become more marketable.\xa0 Some institutions (Cal State San Marcos) are offering undergrad seniors practical work experience through a serious work project (vs. a fluff internship). These experiences give college seniors a chance to earn course credit by working as part of a team on a real-world project for a local business or non-profit, and they gain direct experience in their major and makes them more attractive to employers. Stacked credentials also make a lot of sense. In addition, some institutions are marketing credentials to businesses so that the businesses will pay for their employees to return to school. There’s a large market for higher education institutions to help businesses, which in turns balances higher education’s revenue streams. It also helps train people and creates a pipeline for high-demand jobs, such as coding and cybersecurity. However, because institutional accreditation can limit the flexibility in creating those types of mini-courses, it’s important to identify how to shift the higher education paradigm to become more nimble. Three Tips for Higher Education Leaders Three pieces of advice for higher education leaders:  Do market research. At the very least, talk to students and recent graduates, faculty, and staff to get a solid understanding of who you are. Craft marketing messages to reach prospective students who want what you’re really offering. Give your marketing department the freedom to stop doing some things that aren’t working. This will free up some dollars to pilot new marketing efforts that will help the institution personalize and target the right students.  Bullet Points  Higher education institutions need to do a better job of identifying who their ideal students are and then developing marketing strategies to reach those prospective students. Casting a wide net for students is an inefficient and costly approach, especially during a time when enrollments are declining and funds are limited. Therefore, institutions should review marketing efforts to determine what truly works to increase enrollments (and what doesn’t work). This analysis can help institutions build efficiency by refocusing marketing efforts. Market research is important. However, a formal market research effort – which can be costly – is not required. Informal marketing research can be conducted through having conversations with students, faculty, staff and graduates. Creating new programs that meet prospective students’ needs can make marketing more efficient.

The process, which ended in April 2019, focused on accreditation and innovation and will have wide-ranging implications on multiple areas that potentially affect student outcomes. This Neg Reg represents a critical shift, one that bears watching, because of the competing tensions among federal oversight, institutions and accreditors, and the higher ed marketplace which is shifting toward a more dynamic, more open, learner-centered postsecondary system. This also will result in increased partnerships, including public-private partnerships. Looking at Accreditation When Higher Education Act was passed in the 1960s, Congress set up a three-legged stool to manage the process: (1) Congress would provide the money; (s) states would approve the institution; and (3) the institution would need to be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. While this initially sound s straight-forward, what emerged was a very extensive list of rules, especially when applied to the accreditors’ role in ensuring institutional quality so that they could participate in the federal loan programs. Over the years, the accreditors have become in many ways subordinate to the Department in terms of how they go about doing their business. The recent Neg Reg process focused on accreditation and innovation. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and other Department officials argued that the rules should be changed to encourage innovation and competition among accreditation agencies, and this process led to major changes that could have profound implications for higher education institutions. Surprisingly, the Neg Reg ended in consensus (agreement) among the various stakeholders / negotiating parties, e.g., colleges, accreditors, consumer groups, states.\xa0 This is a critical conclusion, because when consensus is reached, the law requires that the rule that will be followed is based on the consensus – the Secretary does not have the discretion to change what was agreed upon. This finding of consensus means that higher education is at an interesting inflection point in the relationship between the federal and accrediting agencies. Now, with having consensus, the accrediting agencies are setting policies, vs having them handed down by the Department.\xa0 Previous examples where consensus was not reached include Title IX and Borrower Defense to Repayment, instances where negotiations proved to be contentious. Encouraging Innovation Many of the provisions that reached consensus (approval) are groundbreaking in many respects, including the strong emphasis on new programmatic approaches, which sends a strong message to accreditors. Instead of being penalized for thinking about the box, the new rules encourage finding faster, cheaper and better delivery of education. In the early stages of discussions leading up to the Neg Reg session, Department of Education leaders floated some very aggressive ideas but made it clear that these ideas were opening positions to enable negotiators to think outside the box so as to find ways to make the accreditation process innovative. For example, department officials set a target and encouraged negotiations to reach that target. This was different than in previous Neg Reg efforts. For instance, the Department proposed that an accredited institution that participates in federal student aid could contract out a program to an entity that is not accredited, with the approval of its accrediting agency. The process led to a decision to let the accrediting agency do a staff review of these types of proposals. This has two major effects – it simplifies the process and reduces the time from proposal to approval from months to a few weeks. That is a dramatic change; to date, innovation has been inhibited by the significant review time it takes for accreditation to consider this type of request and make a decision, as well as the expense of going through the review process. Additionally, this will open up more opportunities for relationships between academic institutions and non-accredited providers who provide a wide variety of academic services. This decision also makes it clear that rather than being exception, the relationship between higher ed institutions and OPMs / alternative providers should be considered “favored.” In many cases, these are more efficient, less expensive and substantially better ways of providing educational services than what are currently available in the institution. This type of innovation isn’t necessarily bad for higher education. When MOOCs first appeared and changed the marketplace, the assumption was that these would radically change higher education. That death was greatly exaggerated, but it has created a substantial industry of companies that are using private capital to create quality educational experiences. This regulatory change will make it easier for institutions to pick and choose and make these products part of their educational program. One note with this – the Department had proposed eliminating the 50% outsourcing limit, but the negotiators retained this limit for outsourcing courses if. Innovations in Courses These changes could make a difference in the scope and quality of courses. While a faculty-developed course relies on the developer’s expertise, it may not be as broad as it could be. Outside resources could help make course content more current than the faculty’s knowledge. Furthermore, it also lets faculty, department heads, program directors and deans be more creative about seeing what is available in the broader universe of educational services. The existing rule said that if a course was not created at the institution, it couldn’t be used; however, the new rules are encouraging faculty to realize that there is an enormous amount of services in the marketplace. This new reg gives institutional leaders and faculty the chance to identify and use the best services possible. For example, StraighterLine, an educational program provider, focuses on lower-division undergraduate courses that make up core curriculum. These lower-division courses are a very expensive enterprise for a school to provide and more often than not, these courses have little innovation. StraighterLine provides innovative approaches to these courses, enabling adult learners to fulfill their general education requirements without going to the institution, allowing the institution to focus on their own programs that are innovative. This is a very critical development. This new regulation also gives an institution the opportunity to pick and choose specific and complex programs that are outside of the institution’s core capability but still important to what they are doing. For example, Trilogy Education Services is collaborating with Harvard and other institutions to provide coding programs that many schools don’t necessarily want to provide or don’t have the capacity to provide on their own. If Competency-based Education vs. Credit-Hour Education The Neg Reg process made it very clear that the Department wants to move away from the credit hour as the benchmark for post secondary education. The credit hour was created in the 1920s for determining the hours of work by elementary and secondary teachers back when the first union agreements were being negotiated, and rightly or wrongly, was brought into use in higher education in 1965 through the Higher Education Act. The Neg Reg process is one among many that are encouraging discussions about alternate ways of measuring student outcomes. This would change the process from measuring “time in seat” to “what the student actually learned.” This is the idea behind competency-based education – what is the outcome of the education / what is the student learn. Many institutions are moving rapidly in this direction, including Western Governors and Southern New Hampshire. This change also will require more emphasis on assessment to measure what competency the student has gained vs. what they know. This is the difference between memory and mastery. The credit hour measures memory whereas competency learning and direct assessment measure mastery, i.e., skill vs. what a student can do with that knowledge. In terms of Bloom’s, credit hour measures the lower levels whereas competency and direct assessment measure the higher levels. Defining Faculty Interaction Substantive interaction with faculty was another important piece that came out of the Neg Reg. This was based on Western Governors University’s academic teams, which didn’t include traditional faculty. The Department’s Inspector General had ruled that faculty members need to be part of this interaction with students. However, Western Governors argued that the federal government was determining who made up faculty; instead, this decision should be left up to the university in collaboration with accreditors. In fact, the accreditor felt that the team approach to learning did include faculty because subject-matter experts were involved and helped guide students through the course process. There was significant support for Western Governor’s approach, which will result in a very radical change by opening up innovative learning environments by stating that online education doesn’t need to replicate a traditional classroom. Instead, online learning should be allowed to create a learning environment and that people who are involved in the faculty-side of the ledger add to the learning process (vs. them actually being a faculty member). By leaving the defining of faculty up to the institution and their accreditors, this will be beneficial for student/learners. Changes for States Some people involved in the Neg Reg process expressed concern that the current administration has loosened regulations which will result in institutions that are bad actors will continue to get a free ride or less rules being imposed on them. However, some states are stepping in to fill what they see is the regulatory void as the federal government continues to deregulate and not enforce current regulations. What we are seeing is that the states are stepping in to fill the regulatory void, and that is totally appropriate – the only role that the federal government should have is the handing out of federal financial aid. In California, there is a reactive set of laws that have been proposed that will be restrictive on institutional innovation. This may result in a tug-of-war between states and the federal government. While state attorneys general were left out of the Neg Reg process, the state education higher ed officials were in attendance. This allowed states’ voices to be heard. The Department has been compelled by the courts to put into effect the state authorization rule created by the Obama administration and suspended by the Trump administration. States have moved from focusing on authorizing institutions individually for distance learning because of state-authorization reciprocity agreements (NC-SARA) but now are focused on professional licensure. A new regulation that is similar but different would go into effect July 1, 2020. Three Tips for Higher Education Leaders Three pieces of advice for higher education leaders:  Follow what is happening in Neg Reg and implementation closely. These rule changes go to the heart of the core academic functions. Presidents, provosts, deans, and programs chairs need to be aware of these changes. Be aware of how accreditation agencies are responding to these changes. Higher education is currently in a dynamic state. Leaders need to aware of how to accommodate new learners, new learning opportunities, new markets and new demands created by those markets, particularly from employers. The rules are changing in favor of those opportunities and institutions need to learn how to take advantage of them.  Bullet Points  Neg Reg is a critical shift to the higher ed landscape. First of all, it was adopted through consensus. In addition, it focuses on innovation, defining student learning and recasting the definition of faculty. The new rules encourage finding faster, cheaper and better delivery of education. For instance, accreditors can now do a staff review when considering an institution’s request to use an outside entity to provide academic coursework support. The new rules will encourage institutions to create agreements with preferred external partners for areas such as undergraduate core courses so they can concentrate their time and financial resources on innovative areas in a college or department. These discussions continue to encourage institutions and accreditors to measure competencies instead of class hours. This will require more focus on meaningful assessments. The Neg Reg also begins to redefine a faculty member. This is necessary based on online education, which in some cases uses a team to guide students. These team members are subject experts, even if they are not the faculty-of-record for the class. Some states are concerned about the implications of Neg Reg. They also are looking at different areas such as professional licensure in relation to holding institutions accountable.

Not surprisingly, tremendous innovation in technology-enhanced education, including the ways that students are taught and learn, continues to emerge. Institutions like Drexel University are testing new models that allow them to individualize education and diversifying their portfolio of programs to fit employers’ expectation Shifting Demographics Institutions need to be watching the rapidly changing demographics. Serious shifts will be happening in the United States during the next five years. Institutions that are not taking these shifts into consideration in their planning processes will have a major shock. Many institutions are getting ready now through initiating new projects, models, and activities on campuses in order to navigate these changes while also taking advantage of these shifts. For example, the book,  Demographics and the Demand for Higher Education by Nathan Grawe, describes the impact that the 2008 economic crash had on the nation’s birthrates. The birthrates have not recovered over time. The greatest impact is in the Northeast as well as the Midwest. There also are pockets across the nation that will be impacted by this declining rate. The timing for the major decline in student enrollment will be in 2025-2026. This is due to the declining birthrate as well as fewer high school graduates. Institutions will be competing for high performing students; however, there will be fewer of these students coming through K-12 education. Institutions will face a challenge to create a brand that will allow it to recruit nationally instead of just regionally. Building a Brand The brand of the institution is important because it can help students feel like they are getting a quality education. For example, Drexel has created a brand that offers both face-to-face educational opportunities to regional students and online education that serves students in all 50 states and 30 foreign countries. That flexibility has been important since 90 percent of Drexel students work can’t attend face-to-face campuses on a regular basis. Many of these students, especially adult students, are seeking academic programs to enhance their credentials for a promotion, change jobs or careers. This population bases their enrollment decision on the quality of the program and the credentials that are offered as opposed to the institution’s location.\xa0 These students are savvy researchers who will search online to find the credential they will need to leverage their career. With thousands of institutions offering similar programs, it’s difficult to have visibility in this environment without very sophisticated search engine optimization teams, In addition, institutions are competing using the same word searches so institutions are driving up the cost of student acquisition for each other. Personalized Approach Drexel has worked diligently at personalization. This allows the institution to connect and build a relationship with the student that starts at the first contact where the prospect shows interest and continues through graduation. The technologies that are now available support personalization while creating efficiency and effectiveness, thus driving down personnel costs. Drexel believes that these technologies are an investment in the institution’s future. Optimizing the Prospective Student Experience Students have very high expectations and are willing to pay for their degree. However, they also expect to receive value for that investment through their experience at the institution. Therefore, institutions have to manage the student’s experience from beginning to end There are a number of ways that Drexel is trying to address this. For example, the institution originally outsourced its call center but has since brought it back in-house in order to ensure that every touchpoint where prospective students interface with the institution reflects the institutional brand. The institution also focuses on individualizing their approach to prospective students. They ask students how they want to receive messages. The institution also utilizes a system, which is based on student preference and allows counselors and advisors to communicate with the students. This system includes video-conferencing, chat, email or phone. There also is smart routing system that recognizes the prospective student when he/she calls and then automatically directs the candidate to the individual who specializes in that academic area (health care, business, etc.). While a call is being routed, multiple computer screens pop up so that the counselor has information regarding previous communications with that student, the student’s preferences of how to be contacted, and if that student spent time on specific web pages (such as how to finance an education). Drexel is committed to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage this flow, including routing and staffing decisions as to the counselors’ schedule. This analysis includes the number of calls that come in at certain periods of time and also which times candidates with specific academic interests call. In addition, AI is used for efficiency. This includes lead scoring, which analyzes each caller’s attributes to see which ones are most likely to be successful.\xa0 Candidates who have specific characteristics that indicate they will be successful at Drexel are routed to the counselors first. Drexel then personalizes follow-up messages so students feel connected and create a sense of urgency to complete the application process. Recommendations for how Drexel personalizes and improves its communication comes from the frontline staff. Drexel staff go out of their way to get feedback about each student’s experiences and then use this data to improve operations. Successfully Competing Competition will increase among higher education institutions. Many institutional leaders and boards are concerned about some of the new institutions that are coming into the online education marketplace, such as the Ivy League schools. These institutions have a known brand, are changing their pricing structure for online students, and have created a pathway for students to earn their way in. To compete, institutions need to focus on creating value for students’ investment. This type of focus can also lead to a strong relationship to the student will return to the institution to earn certificates, advanced degrees or professional development. In addition, Drexel wants these students to become donors. Therefore, institutions need to be very clear about their market niches and strategic in their investments. They need to figure out where students can find value and where the institution can serve at a national level. In addition, institutions that can adapt and create tailored programs that companies need will be successful in the future. Innovations Drexel has created a free website, Virtually Inspired, which focuses on innovation in technology-enhanced education. It covers a variety of technology as well as case studies. The institution also created V Artifacts portfolio that is open-sourced. These resources are designed to help faculty create more robust online courses. Bullet Points  Higher education will face major demographic shifts in the next five years. To survive, institutions need to take a strategic approach to their brand as well as the programs they offer.\xa0 Institutions need to focus on building their brand to set themselves apart from their competitors. This brand needs to take online students as well as traditional students into account. A focus on personalization can help institutions create a relationship with students that starts with the first contact and then continues through graduation. This relationship can lead to additional opportunities to educate the student through certification programs, graduate programs, etc. as well as the cultivation of a potential donor. Optimizing student engagement allows institutions to incorporate the student’s preferences, technology and data to refine interactions. This also leads to effectiveness (enrolling students who are a good match for the institution) and efficiency (such as staffing rates of counselors, better use of data to engage candidates, etc.) Creating value, being strategic about market niches and developing tailored services can help institutions succeed in the future.

This data is even more important as the demographics of students and expectations of what higher education should accomplish change. These instruments need to be part of a curriculum mapping process. In addition, meaningful assessments can be used to make instructional decisions in ways that are more student-centered. Changing Views of Assessment Many years ago, nationally accredited universities defined student learning through data such as retention rates and graduation rates, and used this information to measure institutional success and effectiveness.\xa0 However, traditional (regionally) universities used completely different measures for these purposes. These differences created a conundrum r-- What is student learning? Does passing a class means that a student has achieved identified competencies or is proficient in the topic? The role of assessments in classes is especially important due to the changing demographics of students as well as expectations of higher education institutions. Before, the majority of students were 18-years-old coming to college directly out of high school. Instead, 74% of college students are “non-traditional,” i.e., 24-70 years old, and are in the process of changing their career, looking for a job, or looking for a promotion and/or higher pay.\xa0 These students are looking for something different from higher education that their predecessors where.\xa0 Additionally, employers’ expectations of colleges and universities have changed; they are looking for graduates to be well prepared to jump into a job with the specific skills that they should need (instead of the job providing OJT). Curriculum Mapping Meaningful assessment ensures there is an alignment between the course catalog, the syllabus, the program learning outcomes, course learning objectives, and outcomes, and what is actually being taught (and more importantly, learned). Assessments should be included in the curriculum mapping process when developing a course. This systemic approach identifies the programmatic competencies to be addressed in a class, the sequence in which they are going to be taught and how course learning objectives align to program learning objectives.\xa0 Meaningful assessment determines whether students are understanding key concepts and are able to successfully utilize new skills. Therefore, it’s important that the assessment is a valid instrument and that grading is consistent both among the students in one class as well as across classes on the same subject.\xa0 A faculty-developed rubric that gauges the level of learning based on the student’s answers on the assessment is an important piece of this system. Assessments in Face-to-Face and Online Education Student outcomes should not differ between face-to-face classes and online classes; they should learn the exact same thing. The easiest way to achieve that is through the mapping process when a faculty member creates an artifact, which is an assignment that matches the learning outcome of the course. Additionally, faculty should create quiz questions, exam questions or an essay that are tied to the course objective statement. This data offers proof that the quality of instruction and outcomes are exactly the same for students taking online courses and those taking face-to-face classes. Competency-based Education vs. Credit-Hour Education CBE and the credit hour were key topics that were discussed during the recent negotiated rulemaking sessions in Washington, D.C. The Department of Education has a specific definition of a credit and that every single credit needs to accounted for based on the Carnegie Unit, i.e., for every hour of lecture a student has two hours of homework; over a term, there should be 45 student hours of effort for one credit hour.\xa0 Competency-based education is controversial because it is a new way of learning that is not reliant on the Carnegie Unit, and because of that, student financial aid comes into question. The money paid for credit hour is the same as the money paid for competency-based education, so policymakers want to ensure that all students are learning the same information while making the same level of effort.\xa0 CBE considers what skills are necessary and then assesses if students have those skills, instead of the number of hours they need to take to gain those skills. This latter approach would be beneficial for students who want to become a nurse, dietician or physical therapist. However, another approach may be beneficial for students who are majoring in history, liberal arts or education. Faculty and leaders need to consider whether the 45 hours per credit hour make sense in a particular program. This is one of the discussions at Neg Reg (no decision was made to move away from the Carnegie Unit measurement at this time). In some ways, competency-based learning is easier to assess than traditional credit education because it involves a checklist, externship or a list of skills that students need to demonstrate that they understand and can do (vs an arbitrary time in/out of the classroom plus examinations plus signature assignments plus etc.). Assessments as Part of Institutional Improvement Colleges and universities that have a structured plan in which the curriculum, objectives, and outcomes have been clearly mapped can see that the courses fit into the institutional mission. In large institutions, this can be assessed by the institutional research (IR) department/function. However, the dean or program director can take on this role in smaller institutions using an ongoing process. This process entails (1) looking at what is being assessed during the first quarter; (2) reviewing syllabi, competencies, artifacts, and assessments in the second quarter; (3) gathering data in the third quarter; and (4) completing a report in the fourth quarter that goes to administration and the board. Most institutions conduct annual program assessment and five-year program reviews to understand what’s being done and accomplished, how a program is performing and what improvements can be made. In addition, the results from the program review can be used as part of the institution’s annual planning processes. However, many institutions invest much time and money into the institutional planning process, yet forget to use this information to inform campus decision-making. For example, there’s a problem if students who are enrolled in a nursing program are not able to pass the licensure exam.\xa0 Having regular meaningful assessments allow faculty and leaders to identify where students are struggling, then make changes in the admissions process (such as requiring certain prerequisite skills), curriculum or budget (for updated equipment that matches what is available in businesses). Therefore, student learning assessment outcomes can also inform admissions, financial aid, enrollment management, staffing and even facilities.\xa0 Some accreditation bodies make assessment challenging. For example, WSCUC requires proof that the faculty were involved in the development of curricula and agreed to the important concepts. Once buy-in is achieved, items need to be mapped out to identify the competencies or skills that students need to learn in a course. Institutions that use meaningful assessment to ensure that students are learning also see their endowments and enrollment numbers increase, attract the best faculty and save money because they focus their efforts on areas that really need it. This is true not only for top-tier institutions; even small- and medium-sized institutions can be successful through using this type of informed decision-making. Three Tips for Higher Education Leaders Three pieces of advice for higher education leaders:  Meet with the institutional research department. Leaders who have worked in business will have an advantage because they can help streamline the process and focus on improving learning outcomes. Read the previous report to see what data has been used. This report can serve as a starting place for identifying gaps and places for improvement. Walk around and talk to students and faculty. Find out if there is a general consensus that the students are learning and becoming prepared to be a productive part of society.  Bullet Points  Institutions differ in the way they measure student success, institutional success and institutional effectiveness. Assessments are a critical part of the instructional process because they can ensure faculty remain on topic instead of veering onto tangents, the course’s objectives and outcomes are aligned with what is being taught, and students are learning and can apply new skills. Faculty should consider the placement and type of assessment to be used during the curriculum mapping phase of course development. In addition, a rubric should be used to analyze the quality of learning displayed on an assessment. Assessments can help ensure that instruction and learning are comparable in both face-to-face and online classes. Competency-based education and credit-based education are under the microscope. Each form may require a different type of assessment to be used. Assessments also can and should be part of institutional improvement. This data can be used beyond just instructional decisions; it also can inform admissions policy, financial decisions, hiring of staffing, professional development offerings, and facility updates.

Many of these issues are fanned by repercussions of historical events as well as unconscious biases based on unknown U.S. history and individuals tending to remain in monolithic groups. Institutions of higher education have a duty to make their campuses a model of inclusivity where every student, faculty member and staff member is wholeheartedly appreciated. To achieve this, higher education leaders need to find ways to surface their own unconscious biases, diversify campus leadership, create programs and structures to encourage diversity, identify ways to have accountability for these programs and create financial avenues to fund these efforts. Taking this inclusive approach can revitalize organizations through creating a common understanding, developing a community that embraces differences and establishing new and meaningful outcomes. This can include: rethinking faculty diversity in relation to faculty recruitment, retention, tenure and promotion; revising ideas of the quality of scholarship, including the paradigm of publish or perish; and creating community-engaged scholarship. Diversifying Higher Education Leaders Many higher education institutions have become very comfortable (and even robotic) concerning the diversity narrative. This often is determined by the culture of the institution and its cultural artifacts. However, the biggest driver of this narrative is the institution’s president, and how this individual embodies the ideas and promise of inclusivity. This idea extends past the individual’s DNA to include how they actually show up in their role. Students – especially undergraduates – can tell if a president is authentic and being honest in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This is one of the greatest threats to higher education leaders right now; presidents and chancellors are realizing that they need to have the personal capacity to handle the struggles and opportunities that come with diversity. Therefore, it’s important to get more diversity in higher education leadership positions, as these individuals bring a very specific level of consciousness based on their lived experiences. Gaining Momentum When faced with successive leadership moments around an issue, a president can decide what he or she is going to stand for. Then, the president can work with vice presidents and deans to set a priority for these things to take place, thus putting together an institutional effort across the various areas.\xa0 The president can create a structure and the associated environment where direct reports know that this is something that matters. Additionally, the president as chief executive officer of the institution can communicate the importance of these efforts.\xa0 The board also needs to be involved. Board members need to be diverse and have experience with diversity in their professional lives. These trustees need to be committed to the common good for both the institution and society. Without these types of board members, the president will have difficulty moving these issues forward. Working with the board chair, the president can make the effort an institutional priority, including having initiative progress measured as part of the president’s performance review. This will help create accountability, which then can extend to the president’s direct reports, including the vice president of business and finance, chief operating officer, the provost office and student services. Dealing with Unconscious Bias Much of the United States’ public education system has done a poor job of teaching history that includes all cultures and identities for the last 30-40 years. Americans have a very narrow story of history, which is reinforced by a tendency for individuals to remain in a monolithic community. While many higher education professionals – including senior leaders -- are doing good work, they don’t know what they don’t know in areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and can get defensive because they aren’t aware of their unconscious biases. Dealing Effectively with Discomfort Higher education institutions haven’t developed their truth-telling capacity because of the lack of knowledge of history or because the campus environment is created and maintained by leaders who are part of the dominant culture who maintain the same degree of comfort and engagement. Without diversity among institutional leaders, an environment emerges in which conversations are limited by individuals’ lived experiences. When those in academic settings don’t have knowledge of something, they stumble or withdraw and move to the next thing. This can lead to defensiveness and debate. If the leader hasn’t built up the mental and emotional muscles to identify, carry and push through the discomfort of a challenging or difficult topic, opportunities will be continually missed. Wholehearted Leadership Valuing people wholeheartedly is a critical part of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Higher education leaders also are called to be appreciative and reflective to determine patterns of how they have left people behind historically. Diversity is all about representation so that everyone feels good and is welcome on campus. Inclusion means that everyone has a part in it. Equity requires leaders to reconcile the ways in which departments, programs, and organizations operate. This includes identifying when the institution has not fulfilled its mission and identifying the gap between marketing and the actual lived experience. Faculty, staff, and students know when they have a leader who is really in their corner and really is committed to these ideals.\xa0 Equity asks these top leaders to address an identified priority through reconciling the institution and its mission as well as the ways it has not been fulfilled. This type of leadership makes a mark in the area of diversity and inclusion and also leaves a legacy. Reconciling the Past Colleges and universities – including leaders and faculty – need to do a better job telling the truth and reconciling their past in relation to diversity. For example, Georgetown University had to come to terms with its history where Jesuit priests sold 272 slaves to slave traders to secure the future of the university. In 2017, institutional leaders held a public ceremony in which they publicly apologized to the descendants of those slaves, some of whom were campus leaders or people who had been educated at Georgetown. This type of truth-telling leads to more respect, particularly from communities that previously have been marginalized. By telling the truth, leaders can help the higher education community reconcile the past to make the community whole and then imagine a better future. The residual of not telling the truth is significant. Therefore, it’s important for anchor institutions like universities and colleges to continue to maintain our place and step even more boldly into the role of taking a moral positionality.\xa0 Public institutions as well as faith-based schools can do this. The United States needs institutions such as colleges and universities to join with anchor institutions such as public libraries and other community-based institutions to provide leadership that is morally and principally based. A New Framework for Expanding Leadership Pipeline Utilizing a new frame for identifying aspiring leaders can break patterns that have led to the same types of leaders being placed repeatedly and historically in higher education’s leadership pipeline. Instead, institutions need to look at aspiring leaders’ cultural assets, cultural wealth and lived experiences to expand the leadership spectrum. Three Tips for Higher Education Leaders Higher education leaders should consider:  Being willing and open to engage with someone who will challenge their ideas around what diversity, equity and inclusion means.\xa0 Leaders also need to seek out a confidential relationship devoted to helping them develop competencies based on performance indicators. Having someone in their inner circle who will assist them campus-wide in doing this type of work. Identifying sustained financial support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. One option is to seek funds through the institution’s capital campaign.  Bullet Points  In today’s increasingly diverse world, it’s critical for higher education leaders to have the personal capacity to handle the struggles and opportunities that come with diversity. One way is through creating a more diverse group of leaders because these individuals will bring a specific level of consciousness based on their lived experiences to their positions. Leaders can develop institutional efforts through engaging their leadership team, creating a structure and associated environment, and then communicating the message to the broader community. Board members need to come from diverse backgrounds so they can bring their own lived experiences to the table. They need to work in partnership with institutional leaders to support institutional efforts. In addition, they need to demand accountability by making it part of the president or chancellor’s performance review. This, in turn, allows the president or chancellor to put accountability measures in place for the institution’s senior leaders. U.S. public schools do not do a good job of teaching history. Thus, many well-intended individuals are not well informed about issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. They can become defensive because they are not aware of their unconscious biases. Higher education leaders need to build up the mental and emotional muscles to carry and push through the discomfort of a challenging or difficult topic. Otherwise, opportunities continually will be missed because individuals will default into defensiveness and debate. Higher education leaders need to value people wholeheartedly as part of the institution’s diversity, equity and inclusion work. Higher education leaders also are called to be appreciative and reflective to determine patterns of how they (or their institution) may have left people behind historically.\xa0 It’s important for leaders to tell the truth based on today’s morals and values, instead of using a historical lens. Institutions need to find ways to identify, groom and hire diverse leaders. This can happen through valuing aspiring leaders’ cultural assets, cultural wealth and lived experience.

This can have severe ramifications for a department, college or university. Therefore, it’s important to identify and develop high potential leaders before the administrative job is open. Higher education could learn many lessons from counterparts in business and other organizations. For example, General Electric, which emphasizes leadership development, in its heyday, placed more of their executives in CEO roles at other companies than any other organization in the U.S. (and possibly the world).\xa0 Identifying Aspiring Leaders The first step to growing higher education leaders is identifying individuals who have potential. This can happen by watching how individuals interact and think during meetings and conversations. The next step is having conversations with these potential leaders. During these conversations, the senior leader can begin to explore the idea of whether the individual is interested in considering a leadership role. If the answer is “yes,” the senior leader can then begin to find ways to help the aspiring leader prepare for future leadership roles. Setting the Next Steps with Potential Leaders Senior leaders can assist aspiring leaders as they start their leadership journey in numerous ways. These include:  Encourage faculty who are aspiring leaders to gain leadership skills through participating in specific programs such as a leadership academy for faculty members who have promise. Participation in this type of program could prepare aspiring leaders to become effective mid-level leaders, such as a department chair or associate dean. Even if the faculty member decides not to assume a leadership position, they will have a better understanding of the complexities of leadership. Serve as a mentor or coach, or recommending other leaders who can serve in these capacities. Assign an aspiring leader to serve as a special assistant to the president. Nominate promising mid-level leaders such as deans for specific leadership programs and then eventually nominating them for presidencies.  Approaching a Potential Mentor While seasoned leaders need to be on the look-out for aspiring leaders, many leaders don’t think about serving as mentors. Therefore, it’s important for aspiring leaders to proactively seek out mentors and request assistance, such as asking if they could shadow the leader or schedule periodic meetings. Individuals from the Millennial Generation are more willing to reach out and ask a senior leader to serve as a mentor. They may meet a mentor at a conference or strike up a correspondence after reading an article that the mentor has written. Many senior leaders state that their motivation for becoming a mentor is to “pay forward” the kindness of an earlier personal mentor. Many mentors say they were spotted early in their career by a leader who helped groom than for success. Mentoring doesn’t have to be onerous or even formal – it can include providing feedback to young faculty or undergraduate students. These types of relationships create benefits for both the mentor and the mentees. While the senior leader’s schedule may not allow him or her to participate in time-intensive efforts such as shadowing, the leader may (and should) be open to having a conversation with an aspiring leader. This could open doors in the institution to help the aspiring leader grow. Key Steps to Support Aspiring Leaders Three critical steps that higher ed leaders can do to develop aspiring leaders:  Identify those individuals that have certain habits of mind and personality traits which indicate they have leadership potential. Have a discussion with the individual about their leadership options. Provide institutional opportunities for leadership development, whether through mentorships, coaching or specific training.  Bullet Points  Higher education leaders need to do a better job of identifying and nurturing the next generation of leaders. The first step is identifying potential leaders. This can happen during meetings or conversations. After the identification happens, the senior leader should be proactive in reaching out to that individual and schedule a time to talk with them to gauge his or her interest in assuming a leadership role in the future. If the faculty member is interested in leadership, the senior leader can begin to suggest opportunities, such as a leadership development seminar, a mentor or a coach. Aspiring leaders also need to be open to asking higher education leaders to serve as mentors. This could include having regular meetings together or the aspiring leader shadowing the senior leader. Senior leaders can nominate aspiring leaders for roles that would allow them to use their growing leadership toolkit and eventually nominate them for positions such as department head or assistant dean.

Robert Showers Esq. has had a long and storied career in law. Prior to founding Simms Showers LLP, he was a principal at Gammon & Grange in charge of the litigation department, and before that was with the U.S. Department of Justice where he was acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, a federal prosecutor and Chief of the Civil Section in the US Attorney's Office, and was Founder and Executive Director of what is now the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS). Episode Summary For many years, sexual harassment complaints were filed away without any action taken. This approach exacerbated the issue. These complaints–whether true or false--need to be taken seriously and investigated. Now with the emergence of the #MeToo Movement, institutions increasingly are seeing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct complaints filed by students, staff and faculty members. Therefore, institutional leaders need to be proactive in creating policies, procedures and training regarding these types of allegations. Increasing Number of Sexual Harassment Cases Expected Charges of sexual misconduct, particularly sexual harassment, are increasingly being taken seriously in the public eye. In the wake of the #MeToo movement with many high-profile offenders being found guilty of sexual harassment and sexual violence, higher education leaders need to be aware that their institutions have an increased risk of being caught up in the publicity of these types of allegations. College students have a higher risk of experiencing sexual violence than any other crime. Studies indicate that 80 percent of female students who have suffered an attack do not report sexual violence to law enforcement; however, that number will change. More than 50 percent of the college sexual assaults are against freshmen students, which also triggers child abuse laws that require mandatory reporting and increased scrutiny. These factors may lead to a tsunami of allegations that could swamp both secular and religious institutions of higher education. Therefore, all higher education leaders need to determine if their institution has appropriate policies, training, transparency and preventative measures in place in regards to sexual harassment. The Effects of the Court of Public Opinion The citizens who are selected to serve as jurors during trials are influenced by social and mainstream media. Previously, these jurors may have judged someone accused of sexual harassment or an institution that didn’t handle sexual harassment claims appropriately by saying that they were innocent until proven guilty. However, the #MeToo Movement has shifted the paradigm where many citizens are saying that these individuals and institutions are guilty until they prove themselves innocent. Ramifications of Not Taking Action Showers has worked on numerous cases in which a student lodged a sexual harassment complaint against a professor, who then gave the student the choice of remaining in the class or failing. The institution could have easily put the student in another class or allowed him/her to take another academic avenue to completing the course during the investigation. Instead, the leaders opted to have the student remain in the class with the alleged abuser. In several instances where this type of situation occurred, the students were re-victimized because they had to continue to interact with the alleged abuser. This approach led to a public relations nightmare as well as having additional financial damages awarded to the plaintiff following a court case. In the Michigan State case, additional ramifications included a decline in freshman student applications due to safety concerns. Changes to Title IX The first of the changes narrows the definition of sexual assault. The old standard was “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” and the new standard is “unwelcome sexual conduct; or unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.” The Ed Department justified this by saying it is in line with the Supreme Court guidance, but survivors’ advocates have come out forcefully and said that this new definition will put survivors’ education at risk. The second major change is the standard by which sexual assault is adjudicated. Previously, the standard was that the assault was “likely to have happened.” However, the new guidance provides for a higher standard, i.e., “preponderance of evidence,” the same standard used in civil suits. This is lower than “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the standard used in criminal trials, but it still creates a higher burden on the victim to prove that the incident happened. \xa0In its guidance, the Ed Dept stated that institutions can use either standard, but this potentially opens the institution up to lawsuits, e.g., institutions may face a lawsuit by the accused if they use the lower standard or the victim if the institution uses the higher standard. The third major change has to do with holding universities responsible. Under the previous guidance, universities and colleges could be held responsible if they “knew about or reasonably should have known” about an incident. However, under the new guidelines, the institution must have “actual knowledge” of the incident in order to be held responsible; this requires the victim to make a formal complaint through official channels. Telling a professor or resident adviser isn’t sufficient – it must be reported to someone who can do something about it, such as a school official who is involved in enforcement. Additionally, schools can only be held responsible for incidents that happen on school property or at school-sponsored events, not at private, off-campus residences. Thus, if a fraternity house is located off-campus and an assault takes place there (as was the allegation in the Judge Kavanaugh – Christine Blasey Ford incident), the institution cannot be held liable, even if they have knowledge that these events have taken place in the past. Lastly, the accused will have the chance to cross-examine the victim under the new guidance, and many feel this will discourage victims from coming forward and reporting incidents. A Robust Policy on Sexual Harassment As we all know, the Department of Education released its new Title IX guidance in November, which provides guidance on sexual harassment.\xa0 However, some universities and colleges – especially religious institutions – are not subject to these rules. Therefore, it’s important for these leaders to review their institutional policies to identify and close gaps that would make it easier for individuals to bring sexual assault and sexual harassment charges against the college or university. A sexual harassment policy that will stand up to scrutiny includes:  A clear definition of sexual harassment A statement that unambiguously says that this type of conduct is strictly prohibited A clear description of how to lodge a complaint and the process for starting and completing an investigation A prohibition of retaliation for reporting harassment A confidentiality statement about complainants An assurance that complaints are promptly investigated by objective professionals A way to separate the alleged victim from the alleged perpetrator A clear statement that makes clear that if the allegations are substantiated, a disciplinary action will follow and the investigation will be concluded A training process that moves the policy into practice so that all employees and volunteers are on the same page  Training Employees and Volunteers The training process for recognizing and dealing with sexual harassment and sexual assault should offer awareness so that employees and volunteers understand what is considered to be sexual harassment. This training should include:  The definition of what sexual harassment or sexual assault is, which involves unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. For example, Title IX’s standard is unwelcome sexual conduct or unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies someone equal access to education.   This is significantly different than the previous guidance from the Obama administration, which was “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.”   All allegations should be taken seriously. The individual who brings the allegation needs to be reassured that their voice will be heard and the charges will be investigated without delay or bias. The person who leads the investigation needs to be someone who is objective, thorough and timely.  Investigations Institutional leaders need to decide how to maintain an objective investigation that’s unbiased. Many cases can be investigated internally. However, internal investigators may know the alleged abuser so the investigation may be tainted, regardless of what is discovered, because the decision will not be taken seriously. In some cases an external investigation is needed. In these situations, Showers recommends that institutional leaders hire a law firm that is skilled in this area and is able to maintain appropriate protections for both the university and the victim. These types of cases provide tangible but objective results. Sexual harassment claims are particularly difficult to investigate because oftentimes it’s a “he said, she said” situation without much (if any) corroborating evidence.\xa0 These cases often have a lot of direct testimony where one person says that “This happened” and then the other person said, “No, it didn’t happen.” This is one reason why it’s important to retain an objective, unbiased and professional investigator who will keep confidentiality for both the alleged victims and perpetrators, as well as the university. Most colleges have outside or internal legal counsel. These types of cases need to be run by counsel because their expertise can help guide the decision as to whether an internal or external investigation is needed. This is important because the stakes today are high financially as well as in regards to the institutional image. It’s important that colleges and universities get these investigations right the first time. Additionally, historical sex abuse allegations, as illustrated by the Brett Kavanaugh case, are very, very complex to investigate. These cases, which happened years or decades ago, are especially difficult because memories fade, witnesses are lost and any tangible evidence is lost. Therefore, these cases provide even more reason to hire someone who understands and has done these cases before and who will be objective. Changes to Title IX The first of the changes narrows the definition of sexual assault. The old standard was “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” and the new standard is “unwelcome sexual conduct; or unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.” The Ed Department justified this by saying it is in line with the Supreme Court guidance, but survivors’ advocates have come out forcefully and said that this new definition will put survivors’ education at risk.

Lastly, the accused will have the chance to cross-examine the victim under the new guidance, and many feel this will discourage victims from coming forward and reporting incidents. Bullet Points  The #MeToo Movement, the resulting cultural shift related to sexual harassment and data related to sexual harassment of students suggests that higher education institutions will increasingly be dealing with sexual harassment and sexual abuse issues. Studies indicate that 80 percent of female students never report sexual violence to law enforcement. More than 50 percent of the college sexual assaults are against freshmen students, which triggers sexual harassment as well as child abuse laws that require mandatory reporting and increased scrutiny. Citizens who are selected to serve as jurors during trials are influenced by social and mainstream media. The #MeToo Movement has shifted the paradigm in favor of the victim and institutions are getting caught in the whirlwind. Higher education leaders need to review their institutional policies to identify and close gaps that would allow individuals to bring sexual assault and sexual harassment charges against the college of university. Institutions also need a strong training program to help educate employees and volunteers about the university’s processes related to charges of sexual harassment. This training should include defining sexual harassment and sexual assault, identifying the investigation process and ensuring that the process will be objective and concluded in a timely manner. Investigations need to be objective, thorough and done in a timely manner. Some cases can be investigated by internal team; however, these cases may be tainted by perception since some investigators may know the alleged perpetrator.\xa0 External investigations offer an outside viewpoint that can be seen as neutral in high-profile cases. It’s important to have a law firm that can offer appropriate protections for the victim and alleged perpetrator as well as the university. Higher education leaders should seek their institution’s internal or external counsel to get feedback on whether to create an internal or external investigation. This is important because of potential settlements as well as public relations fallout on specific cases.

And with the constant developments in technology, the delivery systems are rapidly evolving. Therefore, institutional need to be thoughtful about which programs they offer online, who they contract with to offer these services, what types of systems and support structures they put into place and how they get faculty buy-in. Background on WICHE and WCET Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) is a regional organization that was created in 1953 to facilitate resource sharing among higher education systems in western states and territories. WICHE’s members include New Mexico, Montana, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Alaska, Washington, California, Nevada, Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. WICHE analyzes student access, policy and research issues among these states. One of WICHE’s key initiatives is the WICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies (WCET), which is the leader in the policy, practice and advocacy of technology-enhanced learning in higher education. The group’s work concentrates on four focuses areas: institutional success, policy and regulation, student success and technology. WCET had a long history of working in distance education. Growth of Online Learning The U.S. Department of Education’s annual survey of fall enrollments over the past seven years shows that while higher education enrollment has been declining, distance education is growing. Currently, approximately 15 percent of students are taking all of their courses online. An additional 15 percent of students are taking at least one course online. Therefore, approximately one third of students are participating at some level in distance education. This increase is driven by a number of factors:  Millennials and Gen Z are very comfortable with technology K-12 schools are increasingly offering more online courses, especially with dual credit or concurrent enrollment courses that allow high school students to take college courses. The educational market has shifted, thanks to for-profit higher education institutions.  An Increasingly Crowded Marketplace Public and private institutions have joined for-profit institutions in growing their online presence. This has led to a crowded marketplace. For example, Western Governors University, which is entirely online, has over 100,000 students. Southern New Hampshire University, which has a large online component, is approaching 100,000 students. Arizona State University has grown its online presence and projections suggest about half of its enrollment will primarily be distance education within five years. These types of institutions are building a national presence instead of just serving as a regional institution. Online Program Management Online program management (OPM) allows an institution to outsource some operations to a company that focuses on these areas. Some of these operations could include getting programs online, instructional design or working with faculty to design online courses. OPM can offer many benefits, such as providing assistance reaching populations that the higher education institution hasn’t marketed to before. However, issues can emerge. For instance, faculty, accreditors and regulators may have concerns about whether the higher education institution is just selling its name. Concerns about who controls content are also common. In some instances, the company has tried to expand the curriculum or to create a new one without faculty input. And some states have laws that do not allow higher education institutions to have certain types of OPM relationships. Therefore, it’s important that higher education leaders use OPM with caution and make sure that they have done due diligence before signing any agreement. Faculty Buy-in Most institutions have some faculty who need to be “coaxed” into teaching online. It’s an iterative process in terms of trying to bring people along. Often, naysayers need to see others succeed in online learning. One way to get buy-in is through educating faculty about the growing interest in online education, which can translate into hiring more faculty. Open Educational Resources The cost of textbooks continues to increase, causing another economic barrier for prospective students.\xa0 However, there is a trend to create open textbooks that are available online for free or for a relatively low cost to students. These open educational resources (OER) are being created by a group of faculty working together. Because these texts are online, students have access once they enroll in the class or on the first day of class. WCET has received a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to analyze open educational resources in relation to policies, faculty support, library usage, bookstore usage. The goal is to see how to expand adoption of these types of resources and find ways to make OER sustainable. Adaptive Learning Adaptive learning through the use of technology involves little tests or quizzes that gauge whether the student is understanding concepts. If a student is having issues, the software sends the student to a reminder section to help them understand the lesson better. In addition, the student may be sent to a tutor or the professor or may get additional support that will help with understanding. If a student is doing very well, the software allows the student to progress at his or her own pace and may allow them to skip some modules because they understand those concepts. Adaptive learning is allowing some institutions to have improved learning outcomes because students get help on areas that they’re weak and are able to advance in other areas where they are strong. Providing Support Local centers for support offer a place where students can physically go and get help. This concept – which is similar to an Apple Store where people can get in-person, hands-on experience – is starting to be utilized by a variety of institutions, including the University of Phoenix, Georgia Tech and Southern New Hampshire. Other institutions are finding ways to use technology to provide additional support. Embry-Riddle is a good example. The institution has gone from being almost exclusively face-to-face to now having approximately 50 percent of their students at a distance. The institution increasingly is using virtual reality to connect with students and provide assistance. Learning Management Systems A Learning Management System (LMS) keeps information utilized in an online course, such as the syllabus, resources, and videos. Companies such as Canvas are capturing a larger and larger share of the market in this area. However, some companies are also putting as much effort in creating side services so they are able to provide more support beyond just being an LMS. These types of arrangements are helpful in times of a crisis such as the recent earthquakes in Alaska or fires in California that cause an institution to physically close. In these cases, online courses can continue all of the software and courses are maintained at another location. Advice to Higher Education Leaders Prior to creating an online learning presence, higher education leaders need to consider their goal, the institution’s mission and which programs would be best served in this type of learning environment. They also need to consider what already is in the marketplace and do a market analysis to see if they can differentiate their proposed online learning programs from their competitors. The third step is to create staff positions – such as a chief online officer or chief learning officer – who are responsible for overseeing online education and who will maintain a high level of quality. They also need to identify if they are going to use an external company or build the online program internally. Leaders then need to set goals related to the program and come up with appropriate strategies", 'chan_desc': 'Changing Higher Ed is dedicated to helping higher education leaders improve their institutions.

And all these things make me lose sight of the big picture. They zap my joy, steal my energy, and make me want more. Without realizing what I already have. You see, it's not about the material possessions. It's not about what we have to use in our homeschools. The best gift we can give our kids? The answer may surprise you!

She also talks about the internal obstacles she faced, questioning whether or not staying home and homeschooling was “all” that she should be doing.\xa0 If you have ever thought the grass was greener on the other side of the school choice fence, this episode is for you.\xa0\xa0 Be sure to listen to the whole episode.

When she’s not juggling all the things, you can find her in a cozy corner, sipping a cup of a hot beverage and reading a non-fiction book on minimalism, parenting, or homeschooling. You can find June at thissimplebalance.com where she helps moms simplify their lives and their homeschools.\xa0  Topics we discuss are:  Symptoms? What helped?\xa0 What would you say to a mom who thinks she may have PPD?\xa0 What advice would you give to someone who recognizes the signs of PPD in a woman they love?  June shares her story with PPD as well as the symptoms, what helped her, and how you can encourage a mom in your life who may be suffering from PPD.

That leads to a family questioning whether or not they should even continue homeschooling. I want to thank each and every one of my guests in advance for being willing to share these difficult topics and moments in order to encourage other homeschool moms who are on a similar journey.\xa0 Throughout this podcast series, we will talk about things like Postpartum Depression, Anxiety, rebellious teenagers, burnout, overwhelm, aging parents, tragedy and so much more.\xa0 The reason I wanted to do this series was because in my own life I have had seasons of overwhelm.

Since then bad days have come and gone, but how we overcome them have remained the same.\xa0 Having a bad day of school doesn't mean the homeschool year will be a failure, choose joy moms and things will get better! Resources:   Blog post\xa0  Joy in the Journey T-Shirt\xa0  | Today’s topic is going to be all about how friendships change between homeschool moms and public school moms. Once you’ve begun homeschooling many of us are so excited to start this journey and can’t wait to share it with your friends…. But, those friends who are NOT homeschooling, they aren’t that excited to hear about all the  curriculum options out there. The weekly lunch dates you used to have aren’t happening as often now that your kids are home with you. Those midday phone calls and text chats aren’t quite the same when teaching interferes with your ability to answer… I dealt with all of this when we first began homeschooling. I struggled with it a lot and wondered how in the world I could maintain my friendships with your public school friends while homeschooling? Through the last, nearly a decade I have been homeschooling I have found there are three ways to maintain school choice and friendship, and all three require participation from BOTH parties, so if you have public school friends and this episode resonates with you, please share this with your public school friends as well. The key to making friendships work when one family chooses a public school and another chooses homeschool lies in one word. CHOICE. You have to choose to respect a friend’s educational choice. You have to choose to make an effort to maintain a friendship. You have to choose to bite your tongue sometimes instead of making rude comments.\xa0 You have to choose to remember that regardless of the educational choice you have one common bond and that is a deep love for your children. You have to choose to be a friend. In doing this you will be blessed to have a friendship that surpasses what some may expect. Be sure to listen to the whole episode.

The benefits of monorepo development are that the tool chain enables you to interact with different projects in the same fashion, collaboration is more effective, and multiple apps can be refactored at once.\xa0The panel discusses what situations are appropriate for a monorepo and which are not. Victor believes that any company with more than one large product would benefit from a monorepo, but it would not benefit a company that wants to keep their teams distinct from one another. The hosts express some concerns about implementation, such as scaling and creating the infrastructure. Victor assures them that a monorepo is inherently scalable, and most tools will work for years and years. As for the infrastructure, companies like NRWL specialize in helping companies set up monorepos, and NX provides many of the necessary tools for a monorepo. A monorepo can be tailor-made to fit any size of company, and can even be created for already established projects.\xa0If you wanted to start your own monorepo, you can start by taking a project or handful of projects and moving them to the same place. As you develop, pull pieces of your applications out and put them into packages. Victor cautions that monorepos tend towards a single version policy, so you’ll want to get on the same version as your third party dependencies before you move your next application in. You can move things in and temporarily have different versions, but plan to make them the same version eventually.Victor talks about how the CI in a monorepo setup looks different, because you run tests against everything that might be broken by that change, not just the project its in. So, when you change something in your code, you need to consider what other pieces of code need to be taken into account. A monorepo does make dependencies more explicit, and when you have good tooling it’s easier to see the effect the changes you make have. This is where NX excels. One of the big advantages of NX is that it allows you to partition your application into packages with a well defined API, and prevents the project from becoming one giant node. You can then interact with those packages, and see what happens when you change something. You have a lot more clarity of how your app is partitioned and what the restraints are. NX allows you to share stuff between the front and backend.\xa0The show concludes with the conversation turning to Jeffrey and Victor’s consulting work. They talk about some of the interesting features that are happening outside of React that we are missing out on. Victor is very impressed with tooling in the Angular community. He talks about a tool called Console for NX. They end by talking about the schematic powered migrations in Angular.\xa0PanelistsLeslie Cohn-WeinDave CeddiaLucas ReisWith special guest: Jeffrey Cross and Victor SavkinSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planMy JavaScript StoryLinksNRWLAngularNXBuilding Fullstack React Applications in MonorepoAngular CLIFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksLucas Reis:Dear StartupCryptocurrencies video by 1Blue1BrownDave Ceddia:Help, I’ve Fallen (into code) and I Can’t Get Up!Code maps frontendVictor Savkin:Ember MugHeal the InternetJeffrey Cross:\xa0lululemon Commission pantLeslie Cohn-WeinWhy I’m No Longer Talking to White PeopleEverylayout.dev  | Zain Sajjad is a frontend developer at his company Peekaboo Guru, an app built in React. The show begins with Zain explaining why he chose to build Peekaboo Guru in React. Ultimately, he chose React for its composability and reusability. He talks about how much data is shared between his React and React Native applications.Zain explains what he means by a container since he is not talking about Docker, and how he has the app organized. He talks about the differences between routing and navigation between React and React Native. When approaching these differences, he breaks things down into components, containers, and platform, paying careful attention to how they work together. This differentiation can actually help a lot with testing as well.\xa0The panel asks Zain about choosing between React navigation and React Native navigation, but Peekaboo Guru uses both React navigation and React Native navigation, but on different platforms. They use each on different platforms because React Native doesn’t let you configure it with existing native apps. He talks about the pros and cons of each, but prefers React Native navigation. They decided to use both because Peekaboo Guru is based in a region where there aren’t many users with high end devices, so this decision was made to accommodate them.\xa0They then discuss how to approach making important software decisions with a team and how to make an objective decision away from your bias against old or new technology. Zain believes that you have to step out of your comfort zone and think of the team rather than yourself. They talk about the thought process of making these decisions, especially concerning who is going to do the maintenance. They talk about ways to give good feedback even when the maintenance is not going to be your responsibility and the importance of staying humble. Making decisions like this can be tricky because it is where hard skills and soft skills intersect.\xa0The panel moves on to talking about machine learning, and Zain talks about his experience using it to screen comments on Peekaboo Guru. Machine learning is getting more and more common, with giants like Snapchat and Facebook doing it as well. There is also a lot of machine learning on our phones that we don’t think about.Zain gives advice for those who want to start learning about machine learning. He advises people to think of it in two parts, preparing a model and using a model. Thomas feels that machine learning is more approachable than it first appears to be, though it is always related to how good the abstraction is. They compare machine learning to AI and a database to assist with understanding.\xa0If you want to play around with AI, Zain counsels that programming has the addiction of success. Keep your tasks small to keep getting those tastes of success. He advises that it is best to start by using the inference part and then make a model. He talks about different tools to help with the math. The show concludes with the panel agreeing to his counsel and reminding listeners that failure is trying to go from 0 to perfect in one step.\xa0\xa0PanelistsThomas AylottLucas ReisWith special guest: Zain SajjadSponsorsAdventures in BlockchainSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planMy Angular StoryLinksPeekaboo GuruReactReact NativeReact Native NavigationReact NavigationSQLTensorFlowFun Fun FunctionImmer.jsFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksLucas Reis:Ember.js3Blue1BrownThomas Aylott:Rite in the Rain notepad | Episode SummaryToday’s guest is Farzad Yousef Zadeh, a developer from Iran with a unique path into computer programming. He started by studying astrophysics and aerospace engineering in college, then dropped out in his last semester because it wasn’t the right path. He then taught himself to code, working mostly in web programming and frontend development. Despite his change in course, Farzad remains passionate about observing the night sky.\xa0Farzad is here today to talk about the ideas in his talk Explicitness and Consistency in UI, where he talks about the difficulties of developing a user interface and how the experience can be improved by using state machines and state charts. He talks about his inspiration for the talk and how he has implemented state machines and state charts into his work.\xa0The panel backtracks and talks about the definition of state machines and state charts. A state machine, from an academic background, is a model for computing something. It's for managing and controlling, taking over branching and managing a finite amount of state declaratively. State machines are not so much about sharing or reusing, but about how your communicate a certain behavior. Despite the fact that event driven programming permeates the programming consciousness, thinking about state charts and state machines is actually more natural than it first appears. The panel explains how it’s the same principle as whiteboarding to solve a problem.Lucas asks how state charts are different from pure React. Farzad talks about how it’s important not to just treat your static states as first class, but also the transitions between them. Otherwise, you would end up with something that looks like a map with cities and towns, but no roads. Using statecharts and state machines makes testing an application much easier, and in some ways you let the machine test itself. The machine will know what to do with your states because you define the path, and the machine will take the path for you.\xa0They again talk about the difference between state machines and state charts. A state machine defines a finite set of states and defining the events that the machine can take and respond to when transitioning from state A to B. If you use only this, you will encounter a snag called ‘state explosion’ because not non-concrete things cannot be modeled. So, state charts were invented to compensate for this. A state chart brings the idea of an extended state, or the context and data you need to hold and reason from.\xa0Farzad talks about other types of machines and supports that exist for branching, entry actions, and exit actions. This is similar to the use effect hook in React. He gives examples of where you would use this logic and how it would be worked into frameworks. Farzad talks about how your machine is just a definition, a declarative model of how something is supposed to behave, and how having that separation between the definition of the logic and behavior vs the implementation of API has given us so much more freedom and portabilityThe panel talks about how using state machines and charts is an investment in the long term maintainability of your code. They agree that using state machines and charts makes it easier to communicate with other developers, new team members, and even non developers. They talk about Cerebral.js and its contributions and model.\xa0As with everything in programming, state machines are not a silver bullet and don’t work in every situation. Farzad talks about situations where state machines can be unhelpful. It is still valuable to consider state machines and charts because it forces you to dedicate time thinking and organizing your thoughts so that you can build something maintainable that won’t just be thrown away. The panel discusses how thinking things out before starting to code can be beneficial. They finish by talking about how React Hooks has started them on the path to implement state machines and charts into their code.\xa0PanelistsDavid CeddiaLucas ReisLeslie Cohn-WeinThomas AylottWith special guest: Farzad Yousef ZadehSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planMy Angular StoryLinksExplicitness and Consistency in UIDavid Khourshid xstate libraryRRU 069: The State Machines in React with David KhourshidState machineState chartCerebral JSOrigami by FacebookElm\xa0The GaryVee Content ModelOvermind JSFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksDavid Ceddia:Reverse InterviewThomas Aylott:Machine Learning Zero to HeroTensorFlow at Google I/O 2019 channelLucas Reis:How to Learn D3.jsLeslie Cohn-Wein:Write Fewer Tests! From Automation to Autogeneration by David KhourshidFarzad Yousef Zadeh:Don’t Let Architecture Astronauts Scare You | Episode SummaryToday’s guest is Håkon Krogh, and the panel is discussing his talk on lightning fast SSR React apps given at React Amsterdam. He gives a brief overview and defines his use of the Uncanny Valley (called the Valley of Lies in his talk). In this instance, the Uncanny Valley in programming occurs when everything in a website or application looks great, but none of the buttons work or users simply can’t connect. This is especially common when users try to connect to a site or app with their cell phone rather than a computer.The panel discusses what can be done. It’s important to begin by measuring the lag in your applications. Designing the progressive loading experience first is suggested as a solution, as well as organizing what loads first and using React and HTML for different parts of the app. It’s important to realize that some tools don’t work in every situation. The panel talks about the merits of Next.js.\xa0Next they talk about what kinds of applications require SSR that make the loading slow. They discuss the importance of SEO ratings and how it can affect your rank in a Google search. Services like Lighthouse can give you an SEO rating so that you can improve.\xa0Håkon and the panel talk about other ways to improve on the Uncanny Valley. It’s important to make sure that users have a way to use your site even if they’re stuck in the Uncanny Valley. One way to do this is to provide fallbacks so that if your React isn’t working, the site is still usable. They discuss the merits of micro frontends, using SSR for only part of the app, and reducing bundle size. Unfortunately there is no silver bullet, so solutions will vary by what you’re building.\xa0In spite of these setbacks, one of the great features of React is you don’t have to do everything in React. They discuss the emerging idea of shipping different JavaScript for different things and talk about some of the React-like alternatives available. Bridging the Uncanny Valley is vital because it is the reason many people are afraid of their computers, and a good user experience can make people gravitate towards your product. The show concludes with Håkon talking about things in the React community that are piquing his interest.\xa0PanelistsDavid CeddiaThomas AylottWith special guest: Håkon KroghSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planGitLab | Get 30% off tickets with the promo code: DEVCHATCOMMITLinksHåkon Krogh’s React Amsterdam talkNext.jsSEO ratingsGatsbyLighthouse\xa0Apollo GraphQLnpmTypeScriptPreactInferno.jsFollow DevChatTV on Facebook and TwitterPicksDavid Ceddia:FXmicrojs.comThomas Aylott:Mindset by Carol DwekHåkon Krogh:Bundlephobia\xa0 | Episode SummaryAndrey Okonetchnikov is a specialist in frontend architecture and design systems. He runs his own consultancy and made the package lint-staged. Andrey has been in programming for 20 years and talks about his background, how he got into React, and why he started component-driven.io. Andrey has always been interested in design tools and design systems, it just wasn’t the right time because the right tools weren’t available.\xa0Since Andrey has been working in frameworks for 20 years and has watched them come and go, Lucas asks Andrey how he has seen the communication between developers and business owners evolve over that time. Andrey reflects on his first conference talk and believes that not much has changed, even if the tools have. His perfect interaction between developers and business owners would be codeless, and would instead draw his design on a napkin.\xa0This idea ties into Andrey’s ideas of creating things in primitives instead of wireframes. He relates his idea to the pattern philosophy of the building architect Christopher Alexander, the idea that specific design problems require specific solutions. He talks about since everything in React is a component, we can encapsulate a design decision into a component.\xa0Since the power of components is redistributing knowledge, the panel discusses how components promotes reusability, accessibility, and sustainability in code. However, Frankenstein components are the dark side of reusability. Andrey talks about the dynamic view of a design system that does reuse and how to make sure that it evolves cleanly. They discuss how much of can be planned in advance the first time you’re creating a component versus how much should you not try to think too far ahead and fix it when it comes up. They all agree that early abstraction can be almost as destructive as early optimizationPanelistsLeslie Cohn-WeinThomas AylottLucas ReisWith special guest: Andrey OkonetchnikovSponsorsSustain Our SoftwareSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planGitLab | Get 30% off tickets with the promo code: DEVCHATCOMMITLinksLint-staged\xa0Component-driven.io\xa0PrimitiveShape Up bookCreate prototype using AI : Airbnb testMonica Lent twitterWireframe\xa0jQueryCoffeeScript\xa0Backbone.jsChristopher AlexanderFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksLeslie Cohn Wein:Frontend Masters Intro to Vue courseGatsby.js glossaryThomas Aylott:Designing Web Interfaces by Bill ScottLucas Reis:Shape Up bookMIT open coursewareAndrey Okonetchnikov:Components.ai | SponsorsReact Native RadioSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planGitLab | Get 30% off tickets with the promo code: DEVCHATCOMMITPanelDavid CeddiaLucas ReisWith special guest: Jamon HolmgrenEpisode SummaryToday’s guest is Jamon Holmgren from Oregon. Jamon is the the CTO for Infinite Red, a consultancy that designs and builds mobile apps. The show starts with Jamon talking about his background in coding, which goes all the way back to when he was 12 years old. The panel brings up his React Finland presentation on building a community around Ignite. Ignite is a plugins and boilerplate maker for React that can speed up app creation. Jamon talks about how it works and how it came about. The panel believes this to be an excellent product that will contribute to code quality and doesn’t contribute to the jumble of boilerplates out there.\xa0Since Infinite Red engineers work on both web and mobile applications, Jamon talks about how they navigate the differences between the two platforms. Their primary tool for doing this is MobX, and Jamon expounds on how it works. The panel discusses situations where using React Hooks and React Context are too low level for a state management solution for a big application, and thus where tools like MobX become necessary.\xa0The conversation turns to the React Core team and how they view the community coming up with their own solutions. The panel discusses the lack of executive decisions in React and compare it to other languages like Ruby, and how it affects the longevity of a language. They weigh the benefits of a core team that makes executive decisions and causes conflict versus one that doesn’t and the chaos that ensues. They discuss the benefits of standardization, but ultimately agree that collaboration almost always comes up with the best solution.\xa0\xa0LinksInfinite RedBuilding a Community Around IgniteIgniteBoilerplateMobX State TreeMobX ReactMobXEmerReact ReduxReact ContextReact HooksApolloElmPrettier@jevakallio TweetFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksDavid Ceddia:Devurls.comReducing Motion to Improve AccessibilityLucas Reis:CSS Grid like you are Jan TschicholdJamon Holmgren:React Node GUI | SponsorsAdventures in DevopsSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planMy JavaScript StoryPanelDavid CeddiaThomas AylottLeslie Cohn-WeinLucas ReisWith special guest: Bruno LourencoEpisode SummaryBruno is a developer specializing in multimedia. He is currently building websites with React and the creator of React Morph, an animation library. Bruno talks about what React Morph is, how it originated, and the flip animation technique. React Morph is uniquely designed to be compatible with many platforms. Bruno talks about his goal to make everything simpler, from having animations on your website, to making things easier for users of the application.\xa0The panel discusses the importance of animation and how it relates to user accessibility. They discuss how animation is interpreted in the brain to create meaning and purpose. On the other hand, it can be easy to go overboard with animation and can even make people feel sick. Since animation is important, Bruno outlines ways to avoid causing motion sickness in users. They discuss the difficulty of communicating animation intention between designers and developers. Animation should not be the last thing a team thinks about and should be given the same kind of considerations as for color and typography. They discuss the difficulties of adding animation to a project and whether or not animations should be included in the design system. They talk about the differences between mobile apps and web apps in how animations are used, and what the different expectations users have for them.React as a framework emphasizes static states, so Bruno and the panel discuss whether or not React is an animation friendly framework. Bruno talks about ways to get animations to fit the React paradigm so that they can be added. His hope is that React Morph will take care of a lot of animations automatically without CSS. He talks about other animation libraries that have influenced React Morph. The show finishes with Bruno talking about what he would like to accomplish next, which is to bring the design world and developer world closer together.\xa0LinksRender PropsReact MorphReact HooksFlip techniqueChange blindnessQartz composerOrigamiKeynotePopmotionPopmotion PopcornNode.JSDesigning Web InterfacesReduced motion preferenceFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksDavid Ceddia:DevJoyThomas Aylott:Lecture on Jung’s TypographyThomas’ Youtube channelLucas Reis:Information Theory for Intelligent PeopleLeslie Cohn-Wein:Resilient Management by Laura HoganSpider-Man: Into the SpiderverseBruno Lourenco:A-Frame ReactBruno’s React Finland talk | SponsorsNetlifySentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planPanelDavid CeddiaThomas AylottLeslie Cohn-WeinLucas ReisWith special guest: Shawn WangEpisode SummaryToday’s guest Shawn Wang is a career changer starts off the show about how he got from finance to programming. The panel talks about how they each got started in programming. Shawn explains his Learn In Public manifesto. They discuss the benefits of learning in public and how concepts like Cunninham’s Law and lampshading can be a good thing. Shawn talks about the differences between inbound and outbound marketing. The two biggest benefits of learning in public is that people will come to help you, it helps you to build capital, and it os the fastest way to learn. They discuss the balance between sharing too little and oversharing.\xa0\xa0Leslie brings up some possible safety concerns, and the panel discusses ways to stay safe while learning in public. Ultimately, it’s ok to learn in public and maintain anonymity. They discuss ways to adjust public learning to your comfort zone and how to know when you’ve done well with your public learning. Shawn talks about why he started doing TypeScript and React and the importance of saying thank you to your teachers, which also comes with some unexpected perks. They finish by discussing how to know if people care about what you’re producing.\xa0LinksVBAMicrosoft ExcelHaskellHoogleCunningham’s LawLampshadingNerd snipingJulia Evans cartoonsReact Suspense talk by swyxLin Clark code cartoonsSamantha MingReact/TypeScript Cheat SheetLearn In PublicFollow DevChat on Facebook and TwitterPicksDavid Ceddia:Why React HooksThomas Aylott:Atomic Habits by James Clear\xa0Lucas Reis:Tweet from James ClearLeslie Cohn-Wein:Storybook Accessibility Add-onShawn Wang:Lizzo’s Juice\xa012 Leverage Points | SponsorsNetlifySentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planPanelThomas AylottDavid CeddiaLucas ReisWith special guest: Christoffer NiskaEpisode Summary\xa0Christoffer Niska has been in web development for over a decade and works with mainly PHP and JavaScript, but knows about 8 different languages, often working in multiple languages simultaneously. The panel discusses the affect learning another language has on how you write the code you’re working on. They talk about TypeScript and Christoffer shares how he got into it. They discuss the prevalence of TypeScript and some of the tools available for it, like Fable.io. TypeScript is a very beneficial language because it can help with refactoring and automation. Christoffer believes that it is better to write libraries in TypeScript. He shares how to release an NPM package with Typescript. They talk about more tools that work with TypeScript.The panel talks about Reason ML, which is an alternative syntax on top of OCaml.They discuss how the success of ReasonML is evaluated. ReasonML has been found to dramatically reduce bugs and has many features, such as a pattern matching feature. The panel talks about the availability of ReasonML to those who are not on the Facebook team. ReasonML and Typescript can also be compiled into WebAssembly and other languages.

He starts off by talking about how he got from tail call optimization to Redux and global state. Daishi talks about his definition of global state, how it differs from a regular state, and why it is a problem with the current context implementation. Thomas talks about his work with Android and how React has helped solved some of the problems they encountered. They talk about when different rendering issues they’ve encountered. Daishi shares his unique approach to solving rendering issues and how it applies to his libraries. His solution is to combine the system in React with proxy based tracking to solve issues with rendering. Daishi explains why this works and the importance of benchmarking. Daishi’s solution is designed as a same use state API, so someone can drop this in and see if it works.Daishi talks about his definition of proxies and how it triggers the rerender. He also talks about how it handles conditional reads. This tracking happens every render and it doesn’t have the same limitations as hooks. The panel talks about the new version of React Redux library implementation and how it compares to Daishi’s. Daishi’s approach is useful for people earning Redux because the used tracked state gives you all the benefits without a lot of the complexity. Daishi talks about how it deals with deeply nested pieces of code.The panel discusses the delicate balance of optimizing, but not doing it too soon, but to also remember how vital it is to maintain the performance of your app. Daishi’s work with Reactive React Redux to make sure things perform from the beginning is really important. It’s also important to understand how your product works so that when things do go wrong, you know how to fix it.

After some playful banter about the naming of Ngrid, Shlomi shares the reasons behind building ngrid. The company he was working for at the time need a grid, he tested nggrid but wanted something completely opensource, so he built one. He also explains that nggrid caused some problems in their project which made him want something more customizable.\xa0Shlomi explains how much work is needed on the application and asks listeners to contribute to documentation or other areas of the project. Shai Reznik endorses Shlomi as one of the smartest peoples he knows and tells listeners if they want to learn from someone who knows a lot about angular to step up and join this project.\xa0\xa0The panel asks about the challenges Shlomi faced while building this app and what it was like using the CDK. Nggrid has a how company working on it but ngrid has only Shlomi. Shlomi explains that the CDK had a lot of the building blocks need to building blocks to build this application and was the power behind the project. The CDK’s lacks the ability to extend easily which was a challenge. He explains that his biggest frustration while building the application was the drag and drop feature.\xa0\xa0Shlomi shares many of the features he built into the application that even though he built it over a three year period he could do it piece by piece because of the way he designed it. He considers the selling points of the application and shares them with the panel. Shlomi compares ngrid to other grid, explaining how templating, creating columns and pagination are all made easier with ngrid. With ngrid there is also virtual scrolling and you can control the width of each column.\xa0\xa0Next, the pane considers performance, asking how the grid would handle if you loaded thousand or even tens of thousands of records and data onto the grid. Shlomi explains that unless the cells were extremely complex that ngrid’s performance would not suffer. The panel how ngrid could work with serverside rendering but not with NativeScript. Shlomi explains version support and advises listeners to use Angular 8.\xa0The panel ends the episode by sharing information about next year\'s ng-conf.

Ngx-build-plus is a way to extend how the CLI is doing its build. Manfred explains how ngx-build plus works in two different ways. The first is that it provides a partial webpack configurations file that merges with the webpack configuration that the CLI is using. The second, it provides a plugin with free methods that influence the CLI.\xa0\xa0Manfred consults with companies on architecture, he explains that the main problem when people take a simple application and make it complex, big, with a lot of entities and forms. This makes it difficult to manage in the long term. He borrows ideas from domain-driven design to help these companies structure their applications.\xa0\xa0Strategic domain-driven design is one of the main strategies he uses when structuring an application. Strategic domain-driven design is subdividing a big application into subdomains, then modeling those subdomains separately. By modeling the separately, the coupling is limited. This makes it easier to change parts of the code without breaking anything unrelated in the application.\xa0\xa0The panel asks Manfred for recommendations for using domain-driven design in their architecture. Manfred recommends using libraries within monorepos and outlines the benefits. Using this method creates isolation, you can’t easily access everything in the library because of the public API. Manfred explains how a public API works like a facade.\xa0\xa0Nx is the recommended tool for the monorepos, as it adds many great features to the CLI and is not as heavyweight as other monorepo solutions. Manfred explains one of his favorite features called tagging. This restricts which libraries can access another library. The panel discusses some examples of tagging.\xa0\xa0The panel wonders about Manfred’s opinions on state management solutions. Manfred explains that he doesn’t believe that every application needs a state management solution. When used at the wrong time a state management solution is an overkill. He also explains that not using a state management library does not make someone a bad person.\xa0The panel discusses how you know if you need a state management solution. Manfred indicates two things to look for when considering the use of a state management library. First, is there a lot of state? Second, is the state going to be used by many different components?\xa0\xa0If you are not sure he recommends starting with a facade and adding a state management library later if needed.\xa0 The panel explains what a facade is. A facade is when you combine a lot of systems under a single API, like jquery. Manfred gives an example of what a management facade should look like. The panel shares experiences explaining how it works and gives advice and examples of using a facade.\xa0\xa0The topic turns to the importance of testing. Manfred shares his testing philosophy, asking how do you sleep at night knowing you have to change a part of the application? Does it scare you because you know you are going to break everything in a terrible and painful way? Or, Do sleep soundly because you know you are safe to do what needs to be done. Shai Reznik equates this to the shake meter, how much does your hand shake when you push the button to execute a change.\xa0Manfred’s recommends starting with unit testing, testing where you need it and avoid a testing coverage goal. Unit testing he explains are more stable than end-to-end testing. You do need end-to-end testing but very little in comparison to unit testing. Aaron Frost shares the tool protractor flake as a way to combat the flakiness of end-to-end testing.\xa0Manfred explains that there are two common mistakes people make in their angular architecture. The first is over-engineering and under-engineering an application. He explains the problems that arise with each and how to combat this problem. The sweet spot can be found by knowing what you want, finding the right structuring to fit what you want.\xa0\xa0The panel wonders how to measure the cleanliness of code in an application. Manfred recommends looking at each indirection and deciding if it is necessary. The panel explains what indirections are, an example is event mechanisms, you can’t see a direct effect. The panel discusses NgRx as an indirection framework. Manfred warns not to use NgRx all the time only when you need it.\xa0This launches the panel onto a tangent of choosing tools and how to weight the pros and cons of each tool. The phrase “use it when you need it” is considered by the panel, the genericness of the phrase is discusses. The panel advises new developers who don’t have the experience to gauge if they need something or not to do the research necessary to understand a tool and to experiment with it.\xa0\xa0The panel comes back to the other common mistake made with architecture which is chatty applications. Applications that send thousands of requests to the backend causing the application to slow. The panel considers why this happens. Aaron explains the concept of affordance and how this results in chatty applications.\xa0PanelistsAaron FrostBrian LoveShai ReznikGuestManfred SteyerAdventures in Angular is produced by DevChat.TV in partnership with Hero DevsSponsorsSentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry small planAngular BootcampCacheflyLinksNgRx + Facades: Better State Managementhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor-flakehttps://twitter.com/manfredsteyer?lang=enhttps://www.softwarearchitekt.at/https://www.facebook.com/adventuresinangularhttps://twitter.com/angularpodcastPicksBrain Love:The 5 Big Features of TypeScript 3.7 and How to Use Them\xa0Shai Reznik:Angular Testing CourseHip-Hop EvolutionAaron Frost:RxJs Live\xa0Lover\xa0Manfred Steyer:Star Trek: Picardngrx-etc\xa0 | Episode SummaryIn this episode of Adventures in Angular Tomas Trajan, an angular elements expert, breaks down how to use angular elements for the panel. Tomas explains that angular elements are great for very specific use cases.\xa0\xa0Tomas starts by describing a scenario with a large enterprise with tens of developer teams and hundreds of developers, they have a few choices on how to organize their applications. The first option is a messy monolith. The second option is using monorepos and Nx. The final option is to use a multi-spa solution.\xa0Tomas explains how the multi-spa solution works. This solution consists of 80 stand-alone applications, on the same page and share components. Tomas outlines the common problems when using the solutions and how using angular elements combat those problems.\xa0The panel moves on to considers how you know if you should use angular elements in this way. Tomas provides two questions to ask yourself when deciding whether or not to use angular elements. The first question is, are you in a multi-spa scenario? The second question is, are components shared across applications? If the answer is yes for both of those questions then angular elements can only help the situation.\xa0\xa0In last week’s episode of Adventures in Angular the panel interviewed Victor Savkin about using monorepos and Nx. The panel asks Tomas to compare the strategy of using monorepos and Nx to his strategy of using multi-spa with angular elements. He explains why an enterprise might choose multi-spa over monorepos. He also gives the reasons the organization he is working with chose to work with multi-spa.\xa0\xa0Aaron asks for clarification for using elements in these multi-spa projects. Tomas goes into great detail, breaking down the way multi-spa and angular elements work together. They walk through it together using consumer profiles as an example.\xa0Tomas explains that using his approach all the applications update components all at once using angular elements. The panel considers the benefits of using Tomas’s approach and which scenarios it would work best for. Aaron expresses his appreciation for all the work Tomas did and the problems he overcame then bundling his solution in a library together so developers can just use it without all the pain.\xa0 \xa0\xa0The library can be found on Github. Tomas tells the panel that there has already been some community contribution to the library. He describes some of the pull requests they have received along with the plans they have for angular elements.\xa0\xa0The topic turns to mismatched versioning and how the bundle will work. Tomas explains that the only problem they have seen with mismatched versioning is with zone.js. He shares some workarounds to the problem and promises that they are working on a solution.\xa0\xa0The episode ends with the panel listing all the major benefits that an enterprise can gain from using the multi-spa and angular elements approach. It will save them money, allow teams to work together, create and isolation. Tomas also shares some of the new features available in angular elements today.\xa0\xa0PanelistsAaron FrostBrian LoveGuestTomas TrajanAdventures in Angular is produced by DevChat.TV in partnership with Hero DevsSponsors\xa0\xa0Sentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry small planAngular BootcampCacheflyLinksAiA 256: Debunking Monorepo Myths with Victor Savkinhttps://angular-extensions.github.io/elements/\xa0https://twitter.com/tomastrajan\xa0https://www.facebook.com/adventuresinangularhttps://twitter.com/angularpodcastPicksBrain Love:https://node-atl.org/\xa0Shai Reznik:https://netbasal.com/\xa0Aaron Frost:How to Be Less Stupid About Race: On Racism, White Supremacy, and the Racial DivideTomas Trajan:Slipknot EX | Episode Summary\xa0Victor Savkin, former angular team member and now cofounder of Narwhal Technologies Inc or Nrwl, returns to Adventures in Angular to teach the panel about monorepos. Victor starts by explaining what monorepos are and why you might need one. Monorepo style development is when multiple projects developed in the same repository and the tools used to manage code between those apps.\xa0\xa0There are many benefits to using monorepos as Victor explains to the panel, such as sharing code between apps. Monorepos help you see what\'s going on in reality as well as helps you take control of the structure of your code. It also allows for more interesting deployment strategies. Victor talks briefly about his time at Google, working on the toolchain and using a large monorepo.\xa0After the panel asks about the costs of using a monorepo strategy, Victor explains that there are many perceived costs that are actually false or easily overcome. The first perceived cost he tells the panel about is how people get confused and believe that apps have to be deployed together when they really have to be developed in the same repository. The second is the fear of misplaced ownership, that some other developer will come along and ruin their code. Victor explains that ownership can be configured and controlled so that no one you don’t trust can touch your code.\xa0\xa0The next myth developers believe about monorepos is that it doesn’t scale and especially when it comes to performance. Victor explains that when the app is set up correctly and testing used correctly this isn’t a problem. The final perceived cost is that Git will break. Victor debunks this by explaining that you would have to be doing extremely well in order for Git to be a bottleneck and even then there are ways around that problem.\xa0\xa0Victor explains the one real cost and that is you have to change the way you code. The panel discusses a few different coding styles. Victor recommends getting used to single version policy and trunk-based development. He defines trunk-based development, explaining how it works and why it is better for monorepos than long-range branch development.\xa0\xa0Victor sees two types of groups who want to get started in monorepos and he explains what they most commonly do wrong. The first is greenfield projects who jump right in without thinking about it and eventually crash. The second is teams with a giant app and through a monorepo in hoping it will help them structure their app. He explains there is a right way to start using monorepos in both situations.\xa0Asking the important question is how to get started. Agreeing upon the structure, naming, ownership, are you going to build the frontend and backend in the same repo, and the answers to a bunch of other questions will affect your work the most, even more than the tooling you use. Some of these answers will be specific to your company where others will be universal, like naming and ownership.\xa0\xa0With other tools for monorepo out there, the panel asks Victor why Nrwl decided to build their own tool. Victor explains that the current tools on the market do not do it all. Lerna only does one thing great and Bazel is very selective on who can run it. Nrwl is hoping to marry Bazel to Nx, so they can allow everyone to use Bazel. They want Nx to support all tools and even Windows.\xa0\xa0The panel wonders if Nx is perfect. Victor explains that it nearly there. Nx is pluggable and easy to use. It is easy to learn. Victor explains that they really care about developer experience at Nrwl. Nx is free and opensource so everyone can give monorepos a try.\xa0\xa0Resources for learning about monorepos are discussed. Victor invites everyone to watch the ten-minute getting started video on the Nx website. He also lets the listeners know about a new book coming out mid-September and it will be more organizational based than the last. The panel wants to know what comes with Nx. Victor explains that Nx gives you modern tools by setting up Cypress, Jest and other tools for you.\xa0Because Nrwl is a consulting firm, the panel hopes that Victor will have an update on the trends. Victor shares his view that trends don’t really tell you anything about the true status of a framework. How many downloads a framework has doesn’t show the longevity of that framework. Frameworks being used to make large scale apps that will be around for years is how you can tell the longevity of a framework. From that perspective, Victor feels that Angular is doing really well.\xa0\xa0To end the episode, Shai Reznik recalls how passionate Victor was about NgRx a few years ago. He asks Victor if he still feels the same way as before. Victor explains that NgRx is pretty well most of the time, has great docs, is well maintained, and he would still recommend it.PanelistsJennifer WadellaBrian LoveShai ReznikAlyssa NicollGuestVictor SavkinSponsors\xa0\xa0Sentry use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry small planAngular BootcampMy JavaScript StoryCacheflyLinkshttps://twitter.com/victorsavkin?lang=enNrwl Nx — An open source toolkit for enterprise Angular applications.Effective React Development with Nxhttps://connect.nrwl.io/app/bookshttps://nx.dev/angular/getting-started/what-is-nxMAS 040: Victor Savkin042 AiA Dependency Injection and Change Detection with Victor Savkin123 AiA Upgrading from Angular 1 to Angular 2 with Victor Savkinhttps://nrwl.io/https://nx.dev/Momentum\xa0https://www.facebook.com/adventuresinangularhttps://twitter.com/angularpodcastPicksBrain Love:https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/why-angular-for/9781492030294/\xa0Alyssa Nicoll:Caffeine Content Warning!Jennnifer Wadella:The Fall SeasonNGD ConfLaptop Safety at ConferencesVictor Savkin:The BoysUse Less Social MediaFreedom AppShai Reznik:https://bit.dev/\xa0True Detective\xa0 | SponsorsSentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planThe Freelancers ShowMy JavaScript StoryCacheFlyHost: Aaron FrostJoined By Special Guest: Jennifer WadellaEpisode SummaryThis week, My Angular Story welcomes Jennifer Wadella, Founder of Kansas City Women in Technology and JavaScript Developer at Bitovi.

Honestly, it\'s the worst story I\'ve ever run across in my tree, involving orphan\'s asylums, mental hospitals, untimely and tragic and violent deaths, and lives unfulfilled, while parallel lives went on undisturbed, comfortable, and full of success.

They are currently a candidate for MYP, DP, and the CP. This episode is actually a question/answer session recorded as a podcast for the local parent Facebook group. We weren\'t intending to make it an IB Matters episode but the conversation was so compelling and the content so universal, it is now included here.The questions that Maris asks come from their Facebook group but also from individual conversations held among parents wondering how IB was going to change their school and their children\'s experiences. They ask about grading, getting into colleges, the difference between IB and other college readiness options, and community service. The answers given by the IB coordinator (Dr. Scheidler) demonstrate his understanding of the multi-faceted IB Programmes he now works with and the various ways IB impacts his school community.Credit should be given to everyone in Rockford for their openness and engagement in this process. Becoming an IB World school is a challenging journey but it is definitely well worth the effort.

The Career-related Programme provides a very customizable form of IB education and looks different in almost every school as local communities bring their own strengths to the Programme.\xa0Chantell describes how the Programme works, why the CP core is critical to the philosophy of the Programme, and how schools across the globe implement the career-related aspects differently.Links:More about the Career-related Programme (CP)Mare about all the IB Programmes | Sometimes one good idea acts as a magnet for other good ideas. Such is the story told in this episode of IB Matters. We talk to Irena and Howard Burton who have taken an unconventional path to their work with the IB Diploma Programme.They do not come to the IB as former Diploma Programme teachers or school leaders.As filmmakers and academics from the areas of law and theoretical physics, they have been gathering video of leading thinkers and practitioners in a broad array of fields for many years. Eventually, their vast store of video resources led them to begin looking for a younger audience who might find this information useful.\xa0What they found, after looking at many high school programs of study across the world, was the IB. And, in particular, they were drawn to the Theory of Knowledge course.In this episode, we hear how the TOK course drew the Burtons to the IB and led them to create video and print resources for 21 different IB subjects and for the core of the Diploma Programme. They have taken interviews with world-wide experts in many fields and distilled them into curated, understandable, and print-supported resources for IBDP students.Subscriptions to all content are available individually and institutionally.\xa0 Individual subscriptions are $200 annually for teachers and $100 annually for students.\xa0 Institutional subscriptions are $50/DP student/year with all teachers getting access at no extra charge. Link to the Ideas Roadshow IBDP portalLink to the IB Diploma Programme | ManageBac, a very IB-oriented vendor, has partnered with IB Matters to produce an exclusively ManageBac centered episode, making this the first sponsored episode in our brief history as a podcast.\xa0You may have a heard us talk to Kari Davidson briefly at the IB Global Conference in our IB vendors podcast (episode 20).Here, Kari has the chance to expand on that discussion and tell us more about the recent changes in the ManageBac interface and the enhancements for the coming school year.\xa0ManageBac already serves the majority of IB schools around the world, so you may already be familiar with their products. But, we think you’ll find some exciting new features - especially for those of you in PYP and CP schools.

In fact, any sponsorships we receive will support podcasting in local IB schools by helping them buy equipment to host their own programs. | This is the second episode of a special series of podcasts which will take you through the IB school authorization process.We have a nearby district working to add multiple IB programmes to their high school. Rockford High School, located about 40 miles west of Minneapolis is a medium sized rural school adding the MYP, DP, and the Career-related programmes all at once to their 9-12 building.Over a series of podcasts - taking about two years - we will talk to Rockford stakeholders about the decisions leading to this implementation, the process, and the requirements they must meet to become part of the IB World School community.\xa0In this episode, IB coordinator Matthew Scheidler talks about the local and global IB support community he has found which includes IB consultants and other IB experts helping Rockford meet the various requirements along the way. Matthew describes the action plan his team has developed to tackle all the combined requirements of starting three IB programmes at once. He also shares his take-aways from attending his first IB Global Conference in New Orleans this summer.Please follow along as we take this journey with the RHS staff and community.\xa0Links to the requirements, the timeline, and the costs involved are found below.Links:Becoming an IB SchoolHow to become an IB SchoolAuthorization milestones including a downloadable pdf of the timeline | In this episode of IB Matters we talk to Asheesh Misra and Tim Kane about their work helping Diploma Program teachers build their DP courses in such a way as to give all their students the best chance to succeed. In other words, they show teachers and coordinators how to significantly improve Diploma scores.\xa0They are both experienced IB teachers with a long track record of doing just that and Asheesh worked for the IB Organization as the former directer of their Access, Equity and Excellence project. Tim was a consultant on that project.For both Asheesh and Tim this is an Equity issue. In their research, under represented students often don’t choose Diploma courses because they think they aren’t prepared, that they won’t succeed, or that the courses will leave them with no personal life. Asheesh and Tim have developed a set of strategies that improve success for all students in the DP courses. As a result they began an organization called IB School Improvement.com so they can share their expertise with others.\xa0Listen as they share their process and show IB Diploma teachers how to build streamlined courses that are focused on the aims of each course while leaving out the often uneccesary portions which cause both the students and the teachers to lose their way on the path to better scores and overall success in the Program.Links:IBSchoolImprovement.comIB OrganizationIB ResearchResults of the "Chicago Study" referenced in the podcast | In this episode of IB Matters we talk to Jonathan Bradley and Phil Evans who both serve the IB as development managers in the US. We caught up with them outside the conference rooms at the IB Global Conference in New Orleans.Jonathon and Phil talk about the role of the development managers and they express the philosophy of the IB as they describe their work.\xa0We think you’ll hear the passion they share for the work of building educational systems. Systems which will pay dividends when students become future citizens and leaders who can think critically and know how to learn in a future we cannot predict.You can learn more about IB development and how to become an IB school using the links below.IBO.orgBecoming an IB School | In this episode of IB Matters we talk to Trevor Bergman of We Help Two.\xa0A central component of IB education is turning learning into action at all levels - pre-K to 12th grade. There are various ways schools do this and We Help Two is an organization we have worked with in Minnesota. We took a few minutes at the IB Global Conference to talk to Trevor about his work.As Trevor explains, they work with schools (many of them - IB schools) to support service learning and student projects centered around taking action - a key part of the IB continuum of helping to build a better and more peaceful world.You can learn much more about We Help Two and other aspects of IB Action and service using the link below as well as on the IB website at IBO.org.We Help Two | In this special episode of IB Matters we talk to vendors at the 2019 IB Global conference in New Orleans.\xa0Each vendor briefly describes their products or services and gives you an idea of what expect when you visit their booth.

However, today's students are digital natives and may expect a different approach to learning than students just a few years ago. How do you harness the best of what technology has to offer to improve your courses and make your job easier? Dr. Monica Burns, host of the Ed Tech Made Easy podcast, joined us to share many tips for platforms and approaches for technology in your courses. For full show notes and transcript: www.teamhelium.co/episode31\xa0 | How do you obtain the first experiences in the classroom? How do you learn the vocabulary you need to discuss your teaching experience? As host of the Teaching in Higher Ed podcast and a faculty member herself these are the two questions Bonni Stachowiak sees early career researchers struggle with. She answers these questions and also jam packs this episode with manageable steps for any graduate student, postdoc or professor to improve their teaching. | As an early career faculty member you are often called upon to design or redesign a course. This can be something faculty dread as a distraction from research. But by following a framework for course design you can enjoy and excel in this process. In this episode Liesl Wuest walks us through a framework that will allow you to intentionally create your next course in a structured way with learning goals, objectives, content, activities and assessment in mind.\xa0 www.teamhelium.co/episode29 | Your brain creates your mind which creates your experience. It determines your happiness levels and your ability to make new discoveries. But how well do you understand your brain? How well do you take care of your brain? Author and engineer Sean Webb joined the show to talk about the benefits of understanding how your mental states are created and how you can train your brain to improve your cognitive processes through practices like meditation. Sean makes a convincing argument that meditation is a practice you should start today.\xa0 | Dr. Olivia Aguilar, Associate Professor at Denison University, joined the show to talk about her wide ranging experiences. How tough is the tenure process? How much tougher it is for someone who is a first generation in her family college grad? How do you manage and vet the opportunities given to you as a new assistant professor? How do you authentically engage early career researchers who come come from diverse backgrounds? These are just a few of the questions we cover in this interview.\xa0 | When you think to yourself, how do I make a bigger impact with my research? Are you lost about where to start? It was great to host Mark Reed, host of Fast Track Impact podcast, on this episode. We dove into the questions you should be asking yourself when you want to increase your impact beyond impact factor. We also discussed how to use social media properly for maximum effect. Mark also touched on mental health issues surrounding social media and academia. How do match your values with the time you are spending each week?\xa0 | How do make space for the joy in your career? Early on it feels like you must say yes to anything and everything but as Dr.\xa0Emily Bernhardt explains in this interview it quickly shifts to having to make space. This is space for those things that will both define your career and bring you joy. One strategy she shares is putting both financial and time price tags on projects to determine if you want to invest. She also provides encouragement all PhDs (or almost PhDs) out there who want to blend life and career into a joyous mix.\xa0 | Is it possible that graduate school transformed you into a less human version of yourself? Are you prepared to handle all humans that will be in your care as an advisor to your students? Are you prepared to take care of yourself properly so you can help others maximize their potential? If you said maybe to any of these questions this episode is for you. Dr. Antes joined us to help us rehumanize ourselves and our relationships to our lab groups. It is not complicated but she lays out some key steps we all need to build into our weeks to be better at creating connections with others.", 'chan_desc': "We help research leaders create better teams and achieve better results.

She warns you that using social media platforms do take a lot of time though. You must practice due diligence. But don’t by any means think that Facebook marketing has to be this big expensive thing. You can start really small, say $5 day and stop at any time.

Sometimes all it takes is that constant attention and awareness of expenditures to put into perspective the amount of money that is being wasted and which could be diverted into the homeownership process instead. In addition, Stephanie wants to remind you of all of the credit repair scams out there, and also the fact that your credit score probably isn’t as bad as you think it is! And to cap it off as well, Stephanie has a virtual program that will walk you through her six steps for owning a house that goes over the quantitative details about different loans and credit scores and such, and it will also consist of a monthly Zoom call to go over the finer details.

Listen to both to get the full picture of this contemporary approach that is shifting both how learning happens and the role of learning professionals in the organisation. \xa0 Hosts: Karen Moloney & Michelle Ockers Producer: Amanda Ashby Guests: Liv Wilson & Kerry Peguero Resources:\xa0 Learning Enablement at Spark – Overview - http://bit.ly/2Y39nSu Spark NZ website - https://www.spark.co.nz/ Here's Why You Should be Creating User-Generated Content http://bit.ly/2XYiweW More episodes & info:\xa0 More episodes:\xa0 https://learninguncut.libsyn.com About the Learning Uncut\xa0 podcast:\xa0 https://bit.ly/2HarIDD | ‘Freedom To Learn’ is the evocative title of the organisational learning strategy at Farmers Mutual Group (FMG).

He has started a keeping current email course through DevChat.TV and describes what lessons will be taught in this course. He encourages everyone to subscribe to the email course.\xa0This idea of keeping current is something Chuck has been thinking about for a while. He gives an intro to the subject, explaining the frustration programmers feel after the reach a level of knowledge in the developer community. They ask themselves what do I learn next? What should I be studying to stay current? Chuck counters that question with why.\xa0Why stay current? Chuck wants those who struggle with this to find their motivation behind staying current. He explains that if you are going to spend all this time to level up yourself you should have a goal to reach for. A common answer Chuck hears in response to this question is job mobility. Chuck shares some of his early motivations in staying current. It was partly wanting to stay competitive in the job market. Another part was wanting to sound smart. The last part was loving what he did and just wanting to learn more.\xa0\xa0\xa0Chuck gives advice for finding a job that you really want. He tells listeners to buckle down and really dive into the technologies at your current job so when you do go looking for a new one they know they can expect you to learn their technologies whether you know them or not. Another suggestion he gives is to find the company you want to work for and learn the technologies they are using. Your initiative and drive will impress them.\xa0Learning a skill for job mobility is okay but if you learn with a specific goal in mind the job mobility will come with it. Companies today hire based more on aptitude and compatibility than if you know the specific technologies they use.\xa0\xa0So Chuck's first bit of advice for staying current is to sit down and think of where you want to end up. Do you want to be a speaker, team lead, company engineer, blogger, podcaster or something else? He also tells listeners not to be afraid to change their end goal. Chuck explains that knowing why you want to stay current will help you know what to learn. Learning the technology a company uses is one example.\xa0\xa0If your goal is to speak at conferences, you might want to learn what topics are in demand, how to submit a good conference proposal, learn what people want to hear or what it takes to become a keynote speaker. If your goal is to become a blogger you will need to learn how to do SEO. If you want to become the software architect for your company you may need to improve your code organizational skills.\xa0\xa0The next question Chuck addresses is “how?”. Chuck recommends everyone get a plan. Some organizations like toastmasters have a plan already laid out. For those interested in blogging there is 31 Days to Building a Better Blog, a book that outlines step by step how to build a good blog. Courses and books can outline your plan, and if you can’t find one, write your own.\xa0\xa0When writing your own plan Chuck recommends finding someone who is doing what you want to do and ask them to list what you need to learn to do that thing. After that, you need to sit down and write out what and how you are going to learn.\xa0As Chuck has mentioned do not be afraid to change your goal. Chuck shares a time in college when he decided he wanted to go into patent law. He quit his IT job and took an internship. He hated it and within a few months had switched back to computers.\xa0 So don’t be afraid to scrap your plan and do what will make you happiest.\xa0Now for the actual learning, Chuck explains that there are so many ways to learn podcasts, videos, blogs, books, and courses. He describes how he learns best and advises listeners to find out how they learn. If you know what works best for you, you can design your plan to fit your learning style. Chuck encourages listeners to try a bit of everything. He shares how his attitude toward books changed as he put their concepts into action and all because he tried everything. Also, something types are learning for conceptual learning while others are more suited for practical learning.\xa0\xa0Chuck explains how building and playing around with what you learn. He also encourages listeners to shares their experiences through blogs, video or podcasting. This way you will have a way to demonstrate what you learned.\xa0\xa0The last thing Chuck explains is that even after you've completed your plan sometimes these things take time. You may learn everything on your list only to find you have more things to learn before you reach your goal.\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodSponsors\xa0\xa0Sentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in BlockchainReact Native RadioCacheFlyLinksGet a Coder Jobhttps://devchat.tv/blog/how-to-stay-current-effectively-in-2019/JSJ 387: How to Stay Current in the Tech Field31 Days to Build A Better Bloghttps://thinkster.io/https://www.pluralsight.comhttps://www.facebook.com/ReactNativeRadio/https://twitter.com/R_N_RadioPicksCharles Max Wood:Sometimes it takes time to get what you want | Episode SummaryIn this episode of The iPhreaks Show Andrew Madsen and Evan Stone discuss the recent Apple Event and the announcements made there. To start, the panel discusses their thoughts one the event as a whole. The panel was surprised that the event was very product-driven with only a few mentions of software changes. Andrew did notice that when they did talk about the software they introduced it with the hardware as one product, which he enjoyed as a more holistic approach than in previous years.\xa0\xa0Apple Arcade and the games they featured is the next topic the panel discusses. Andrew explains that he is not much into gaming but even his interested was piqued by the games they demonstrated. Evan wonders how the games will translate across platforms. He is especially interested in how they will translate to the Apple TV.\xa0\xa0This brings them to a discussion of the Apple TV+. The panel considers the risk Apple is taking by only airing original content. They comment on the trailer for See that was shown at the conference. Andrew explains that they will have around 50 shows to start all over various genres. Evan brings up the very affordable price of only 5 bucks a month or free for a year when you buy an apple product. The panel considers how this strategy will help them build up an audience.\xa0\xa0Another product announced at the event is the apple watch series 5. The panel jumps into discussing the new health features. They share how impressed they were the videos that explained the new health features. Andrew wonders with all the amazing things the watch can do what will they come up with ten years from now. He and Evan consider the possibilities, warnings for heart attack or stroke, blood sugar monitoring and more.\xa0\xa0Moving on from the health features of the watch, the panel discusses a feature that has been a long time coming, the always-on screen. The panel considers why it took so long for this feature to come out. Evan shares his particular interest in this feature because of the safety hazards of looking at his watch while biking.\xa0\xa0Another new feature for the apple watch 5 is the added compass. The panel laughs as they never realized the watch didn’t have a compass especially because the apple watch 4 comes with GPS. The panel discusses how the compass may help other functionalities of the watch like GPS and maps. The final point the panel discusses about the new apple watch is that through Apple Watch Studios you can choose your case and band.\xa0\xa0The panel talks briefly about the iPad announcements, which they deemed the least interesting announcement. Apple is adding a smart connector to the low-end iPads and increasing the size of the screen. The panel considers how these changes along with pencil support make it a great deal.\xa0\xa0The main show at the event was the iPhone 11 presentation. The panel expresses how impressed they were with the way the iPhone 11 was presented. Along with performance improvements and a second camera, the iPhone 11 comes in a lot more colors than previous phones. Andrew is especially excited about the green phone and hopes to pick up a green iPhone 11 Pro.\xa0\xa0The panel considers the look of the phone. Evan expresses his disappointment with the square bump on the back where the cameras are mounted. They consider how cameras work and why the bump is necessary.\xa0\xa0They move onto the quality of the cameras. Andrew explains that while he is a camera and photography hobbyist, most of the pictures he takes with his phone are personal, family photos. Evan is not much of a photographer but loves having a high-quality camera on his phone. He especially appreciated it on his recent trip to Portugal. The quality of the camera makes a difference, the example they use for this point is by comparing a picture taken with an iPhone and one taken by a $50 android phone. There is no contest. However, Google cameras have gained a reputation for quality, the panel explains why this is a good thing. A little competition will help apple stay motivated in advancing its camera quality.\xa0PanelistsAndrew MadsenEvan StoneSponsors\xa0\xa0Sentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planAdventures in DevOpsElixir MixCacheFlyLinksSeptember Event 2019 — AppleApple ArcadeSee TrailerList of AppleTV+ showsApple Watch StudioThe Green iPhone 11Light L16\xa0https://www.facebook.com/iphreaks/https://twitter.com/iphreaksPicksAndrew Madsen:https://www.wanikani.com\xa0Evan Stone:Advanced iOS Summer Bundle - 2019\xa0\xa0 | Episode Summary\xa0In this episode of The iPhreaks Show, the panel interview Brian Voong. Brian runs a YouTube channel where he teaches about iOS development. The episode of his channel that the panel discusses with him is about the Roadmap to iOS development. Brian starts by giving a brief overview of what his video contains and how it is given with the intent to help developers find jobs in the iOS industry.\xa0The YouTube video has over 40,000 views and the panel wonders who are all these people watching this video. Brian explains that YouTube is a major resource for many people learning about development. Also this video appeals not only to beginners but also mid-level and senior developers who want to know what to learn next. The video features a diagram that depicts the roadmap an iOS developer should follow, so people are interested to see where they stand.\xa0\xa0The panel dives into nitpicks of the roadmap. The panel disagrees that Swift is considered functional programming only. Functional programming on the map is at the top but the panel debates whether or not it should be further down on the map. The panel considers functional programmings place now that functional programming is becoming more prominent in the iOS world, especially with the Combine framework coming out. The panel points out that Swiftjective C is missing and wonders if it should have been included.\xa0\xa0Once you have mastered the basics the panel wonders at what is the most important thing to learn. Brian explains to those who can see the diagram that there are close to 50 subjects listed for developers to learn. He chooses a few he thinks are the most important subjects to learn if a developer is hoping to get hired soon. He lists: learning how to work with a database, create crud screens, interact with restful API’s and do some effective network programming. Brain describes these as items to get your feet wet.\xa0\xa0The panel explains that you don’t need to know all of the items on the roadmap in order to get a job. It is more important to have all the basics and good problem-solving skills. Brian does mention some of the skills at the bottom of the roadmap that might be good to learn, such as Build Config, Jenkins and knowing how to deploy an app.\xa0Looking at the map, the panel wonders at the best way to read it. Initially, they assumed top to bottom would be best and in order of priority. Seeing deployment at the bottom, the panel describes the roadmap as more of a life cycle because they consider deployment a skill every beginner should have.\xa0\xa0\xa0The panel gives advice to new developers. It might seem that you need to learn all this stuff and then start coding but the panel explains that the best way to learn is through coding, running into problems and learning these skills to solve them. The panel compares it to learning a spoken language, in the beginning, it is about making yourself understood and as you speak it your grasp of the language will grow. They suggest letting the subjects find you when you need them instead of seeking them out.\xa0\xa0Brian explains why he recommends learning Jenkins near the beginning. He explains that so many junior developers have the exact same skill set and by knowing something like Jenkins you can set yourself apart from the rest. The panel shares why it may be important to know some CI stuff and be able to do a few things with it.\xa0\xa0The last topic they discuss in this episode is what tips and tools a developer should learn listed under the tips and tools heading on the roadmap. Brian suggests Break Point and Instrument. The panel explains what Instrument is most useful for, finding excessive memory usage and performance problems.\xa0PanelistsAndrew MadsenJaim ZuberEvan StoneGuestBrian VoongSponsors\xa0\xa0Sentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planGitLab | Get 30% off tickets with the promo code: DEVCHATCOMMITMy Ruby StoryCacheFlyLinksiOS Roadmap to Professional Developer: Skills you MUST have!\xa0Roadmap to iOS Development\xa0https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/youtube\xa0https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/\xa0https://twitter.com/buildthatapp\xa0https://www.facebook.com/iphreaks/https://twitter.com/iphreaksPicksAndrew Madsen:http://www.waxtraxrecords.comhttp://www.waxtraxonline.com\xa0Jaim Zuber:https://cocaineandrhinestones.com/\xa0Evan Stone:https://iosdevjobs.com/\xa0Brian Voong:https://github.com/Dimillian/MovieSwiftUI\xa0 | SponsorsSentry– use the code “devchat” for two months free on Sentry’s small planGitLab | Get 30% off tickets with the promo code: DEVCHATCOMMITMy Ruby StoryCacheFlyPanelGui RamboErica SadunJaim ZuberAndrew MadsenSummaryBack by popular download, iPhreaks episode 252!\xa0\xa0In this episode, the iPheaks panelist speaks with, their very own, Gui Rambo.

Petrie has joined the podcast today to discuss his recent talk at TrySwift about Ray tracing. After defining ray tracing and explaining how it works, Petrie walks the panel through his demonstration for his talk. The panel discusses the technology he uses and how a bigger project becomes much more complex using a Mercedes rendering he did. Petrie introduces binary space partitioning and how this speeds up the process. The panel asks Petrie for recommendations for beginners to graphics, how to get started and what language to use.\xa0\xa0Petrie shares his opinions on the state of the industry. The first being that modern programmers try to solve problems that don’t exist. The second being that programmers are neglecting to focus on things that encourage productivity.

Katsumi shares with the panel how he got started and why he created a library that lets you use compositional layout back to iOS11. The panel considers the cool features that can be used with this tool and Katsumi shares some new features he is hoping to implement before the iOS13 release. Katsumi explains how the code tricks the compiler to make possible to backport to older versions of iOS. The challenges in backporting to iOS12 and 11, including orthogonal scrolling is discussed. Katsumi shares a bit about an application he built called Swift-ast-explorer. Impressed with all Katsumi’s work, the panel wonders how he gets all this done and they thank him for sharing his\xa0work.\xa0LinksUsing Collection View Compositional Layouts and Diffable Data Sources\xa0https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/IBPCollectionViewCompositionalLayout\xa0http://iosdevbreak.com/\xa0https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/IBPCollectionViewCompositionalLayout\xa0https://swift-ast-explorer.kishikawakatsumi.com/\xa0https://devchat.tv/iphreaks/160-ips-iot-with-evan-stone/https://twitter.com/k_katsumi\xa0https://kishikawakatsumi.com/\xa0https://www.facebook.com/iphreaks/https://twitter.com/iphreaksPicksMichael Holt:https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/combine-vs-rxswift/\xa0https://rderik.com/blog/using-swift-for-scripting/\xa0Evan Stone:Revolution in The Valley [Paperback]: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made | SponsorsSentry– use the code “devchat” for 2 months free on Sentry’s small planCacheFlyPanelAndrew MadsenJaim ZuberMichael HoltJoined by Special Guest: Donny WalsSummaryDonny Wals joins the panel to discuss his most recent talk at Try!Swift in Tokyo.

Your chest expands and you can hold your breath at the top. When you\'re ready, exhale with a long audible sigh. And at the end of that breath, breathe in deeply one more time holding it at the top.

It naturally reduces stress and lowers blood pressure. It builds focus and memory. But what if you’ve tried meditation and just can’t sit still? What if you have medical issues that cause great pain if you attempt to sit or even lie down stationary for a long period of time? For these, and for a thousand other reasons, walking meditations should be a critical part of every person’s tool kit of useful skills.What Is Walking Meditation?Walking meditation involves bringing yourself into a meditative state while moving through an area. You are no longer trapped like a bald saffron-robed monk in a high tower of a Himalayan monastery. Instead, you are roaming freely through a beautiful wood with birds singing high in the trees and the sun glistening down through the leaves. Maybe you are strolling along a river walk, taking in the ducks as they skim along the water’s surface. It could be you are mindfully navigating a labyrinth through a garden, watching as its twists and turns take you ever more closely toward its center.That is the beauty of walking meditation. It can be done anywhere. At any time. Even in the comfort of your own home.How Does A Walking Meditation Work?Learning how to meditate can often seem very complicated. Meditations can seem to involve special, embroidered cushions of just the right height. A piece of ideal music is often recommended that has just the right balance of soothing tone and swirly melodies. With walking meditation, though, the world is your soundtrack. Nature itself provides the atmosphere.Some people like to do a walking meditation through a city landscape, taking in the full diversity of humanity which forms our global community. Other people prefer to do their walking meditation in a park or garden, where the “civilization” falls away and we connect more closely with the world as it once was. The beauty of walking meditations is that you don’t have to limit yourself to just one option. One day you can choose to walk through an awe-inspiring art museum, pausing before each object to draw in its unique message. On another day you can walk through a quiet forest, allowing each rustle of leaf-on-branch to pull you further into your mindfulness.And some days you can walk in quiet loops around your home, letting the rain showers outside gently wash away any worries and concerns. All that matters is the heel-arch-toe. Heel-arch-toe.Breathe.Breathe.Find out more about Walking Meditation at MeditationLifeSkills.com...Support the show | What Are The Theta Binaural Beats Benefits?For those of you who don’t know what Theta waves are – they’re number ‘2’ of the slowest type of brainwave that occurs regularly in your brain. Theta waves normally surface when you’re experiencing potent emotions, including when you’re most creative or have heightened spiritual feelings.Binaural beats can help you experience your true self and feelings by using Theta waves in recordings designed especially to improve a behavior pattern or get rid of an addiction.There’s another brainwave called “Beta” that influences another area of your brain. When you’ve been on Beta brainwaves too long, you might experience imbalances in your potassium and sodium levels. Your conscious level then experiences a lack of concentration and mental fatigue.Sodium and potassium levels can be reset when you experience Theta waves. These two minerals help transport valued chemicals in and out of brain cells. When these two important mineral levels are reset, you’ll feel refreshed, mentally relaxed and ready to focus on work or creative pursuits.Learn More About Theta Wave Binaural Beats Meditation For Insight and Intuition HERE...Since we’re all different, many of us can delve into Theta states easier than others. Those who practice relaxation and meditation techniques on a regular basis are more likely to experience the many positive effects of Theta brain waves more naturally – and faster.It may also help to know that Theta waves are found in our brains when we experience deep relaxation, a spurt of learning activity and when we’re close to sleep. Understandably, Theta waves occur more often in children.Binaural Beats ScienceScientific studies have found that people who suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can’t focus as well because of less activity of Theta waves.More people are realizing the positive benefits of Theta waves – and are using binaural beats to achieve a Theta state of mind. Some other positive effects of Theta waves are:Healing – The body heals much more complete and much faster when you’re in the Theta state.Intuition – Who doesn’t want to have more acute intuition? You can work on improving your intuitive qualities with Theta waves.Confidence – Theta waves brings a sense of self-esteem to your brain. You’ll feel more confident about your skills and capabilities in a Theta state.Emotional Connections – Renew your enthusiasm about a relationship by experiencing Theta waves within binaural beats.Artists, writers and other creative people often have more Theta waves than others. They also experience a lack of creativity when they’ve been in the Beta state too long. Theta wave binaural beats are very effective for those who need to rid themselves of writer’s block or other creative roadblocks.The good news is that everyone is now able to experience more Theta waves by using binaural beats specifically designed to produce them.

BEGIN GUIDED MEDITATION SCRIPT:Welcome to this meditation for beginners it\'s wonderful that you are here. Meditation is a very important tool to use in our lives to keep us centered and balanced. Meditation is a practice and the best part is you cannot do it wrong. Today we will practice a very simple form of meditation, one that can be done anytime, anywhere. Begin by sitting in a position that is comfortable for you. Taking a moment to focus on your spine. We often have a tendency to sit hunched over, especially when we use electronics. Meditation is a great time to reach, retrain ourselves to sit up straight, tall, and proud. Let your palms rest gently in your lap, facing downwards and whenever you\'re ready, just softly close your eyes if that is comfortable for you. If it\'s not, you can just let your gaze rest gently on the floor. Begin to bring your awareness to your breathing without trying to judge it or change it. Just let yourself notice how you are currently breathing, and what muscles do you use when you breathe. Where does the air go when it flows in? How does it feel as it exits out? Anytime you find your mind wandering, no, that that\'s perfectly okay. Just return your awareness to your breath. Letting yourself be curious. How is my breath flowing in and out of my body? And on your next inhale, intentionally breathe through your nose, feeling your stomach and chest. Expand and exhale through your mouth, feeling your stomach and chest contract. Continue the cycle. Breathing in through your nose has your stomach and chest rises and exhaling through your mouth as your stomach and chest fall. As you let yourself be intentional with how you breathe, it gives your mind something to hold onto, something to focus on. Let yourself be fully present with this breath. Noticing the coolness of the air flowing in through your nose and the freedom you experience as you release it through your mouth. Letting yourself use this breath whenever a thought emerges, to retrain your focus on the present moment. It\'s okay if thoughts emerge. Just let them drift by without clinging onto them. Returning your focus on your breath. You are doing a great job of staying present with your breath. Even if your mind wanders the entire time. It\'s like flexing a muscle. It\'ll get bigger every time you practice this exercise, it will be easier and easier to focus on your breath. On your next inhale. Breathe in extra deep and hold your breath at the top. When you\'re ready, exhale with a long audible sigh. Letting your shoulders roll, wiggling your fingers and your toes. And when you are ready, gently open your eyes back to the room around you. Great job practicing this very simple form of meditation. Anytime you find yourself worrying about the past or your future, just return to your breath. Peace is always in the present moment.Support the show | Spiritual affirmations are meant to take you nearer to your Divine expression of your true Spiritual self.

And once you find yourself in a comfortable position, softly close your eyes, and just focus in on your breathing. Noticing how the air enters and exits your body, feeling your stomach rise on every inhale and fall on every exhale. Take a moment to let your breath slow.... down, feeling your body, heavy on the surface on which you are lying. All that matters in this moment, is your breath. And the words you are hearing, anytime your mind wanders, that\'s okay. Just return your awareness back to these words, back to your breath. And as you breathe softly and slowly, you feel yourself letting go. Entering into a state of deep peace and relaxation. (Long Pause)And as your breathing continues to soften and deepen, you began to sense the glow of a soft blue light, beginning to float down over the top of your head, flowing over your face, bringing deep relaxation as the soft blue light continues to flow down your neck, into your shoulders and your arms. Everywhere the soft blue light touches, your body experiences a release. As you enter into relaxation and you feel the soft blue light continue now down your chest, you\'re back, your torso. Feel yourself sinking into this wave of peace and relaxation as the blue light continues down through your hips, your thighs, your knees, your calves and all the way down into the soles of your feet so that your entire being is illuminated in soft blue light. And you feel every cell within you relaxing, letting go. Take this peaceful feeling with you as you slowly begin to wiggle your fingers and your toes, and waking your body back up, for a more relaxed and peaceful stay. And whenever you\'re ready, slowly rise. As you open your eyes back to the room around you.End Of 5 Minute Guided Meditation ScriptNow more than ever it’s important to take time out to relax your body and mind.

Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth\'s surface and the ionosphere.In fact, not having it can cause physiological problems, as NASA found out when monitoring astronauts in orbit. Now, there is actually a frequency generator on each spacecraft to mimic the ‘heartbeat’.This also explains why many people get “cabin fever” from staying indoors for prolonged periods of time.Many people who suffer from chronic diseases who spend long periods either at home or in the office usually find great relief from taking a vacation and spending time outdoors.So it is really important to get outdoors and spend time in nature. We are living creatures and being outside in the fresh air with the sky visible above us is what is most natural to us.The primary (strongest) Schumann frequency is 7.83 Hz. Others include: 14, 20, 26, 33, 39, and 45 HzThe primary frequency of 7.83 Hz was found to actually correspond to Alpha brainwaves and so understanding this is a very important part of the Alpha Mind System.Ancient mystics understood the presence of the Earth’s pulse thousands of years ago. The ancient mystics also used meditation techniques to reach alpha states of awareness where their own brain activity would be in perfect harmony with the pulse of the planet.You can now reach a perfect balance with the Earth’s own healing and life-giving resonance through this special meditation. The following meditation is a 15-minute deep meditation music mp3 embedded with a brainwave entrainment track that will take you from waking consciousness and into a deep alpha state that is exactly tuned to 7.83 HzThis is the living pulse of the infinite oneness of our planet earth that brings life and harmony to all things.Find out more about Deep Meditation Music Mp3s For Relaxation and Healing HERE...Support the show | Begin The 5 Minute Meditation - Morning Reawakening Session ScriptBegin this meditation while still lying in bed, before completely awakening. Take a moment to feel your body resting on the bed, enjoying the feel of the sheet, the pillow, the comfort you are experiencing and the beauty of the luxury of waking up slowly. What a beautiful morning this is. Take a deep breath in through your nose. Hold your breath at the top and when you\'re ready, exhale, a long audible sigh giving your body a stretch as you let it go. Let your breath be gentle as you allow yourself, still with your eyes closed to slowly bring your body up into a seated position in your bed. Take your time. There is no rush. Timing is working out perfectly for you. Once you find yourself sitting up nice and straight, let your shoulders roll back slightly to open up your chest. Really letting your Heart\'s energy center open up as you rest your palms in your lap, facing upwards, let your spine be tall and straight. As you take a deep breath in and feel your abdomen expand. Hold your breath at the top and when you\'re ready. Exhale. With a long audible sigh. Ah, very good. Now return to breathing slowly and gently this time, cycling your breath in through your nose and out through your mouth at a pace that feels good for you. As you begin to feel your body waking up, becoming more aware, feeling open, and ready for a beautiful day, say thank you out loud or in your mind for another day. Let gratitude flood your entire being. As you recognize this special moment, let yourself feel willing, open, and ready to experience a beautiful day. Think about all the ways you desire to feel today and let yourself feel those emotions in your heart. Let yourself confirm that you are ready to experience the emotions you desire to experience today. You are open and willing to receive them. Breathe in deeply through your nose, holding your breath at the top, letting these feelings build. And as you exhale with a sigh, gently begin to roll your shoulders. Wiggle your fingers on your toes, and when you feel ready, gently open your eyes to the room around you. Ready to embrace another beautiful day.End Of 5 Minute Meditation - Daily Morning Reawakening Session With Script________________________________________________________________You can meditate at any time, however forming a habit first thing in the morning will make it stick.

Be that as it may, though, he should also be remembered for the many incredible contributions he made to the world of psychology. Before Freud, there was no psychotherapy or counseling and before Freud, there was no concept of an unconscious mind.In Freud\'s view, the unconscious mind vs subconscious mind was everything going on \'under the surface\' throughout our waking lives. He often likened this to an iceberg – where only the very tip is visible with all the rest being murky and inaccessible. So you might say one thing and think another… but on some level, there is more going on under the surface that even you\'re unaware of.It\'s key to note at this point that Freud only ever described an \'unconscious mind\' because that was the part of the mind we weren\'t conscious of. He never used the term \'subconscious\' which is really just a misnomer.Complications In What Our Brain BelievesOur unconscious is made up of all the things our brain believes to be inconsequential or too upsetting for our conscious mind to handle. Thus we often \'repress\' memories and thus can\'t remember them, we deny things and we fail to notice things – but they are all still there working away under the surface.\xa0And if there are unconscious associations we hold about something or beliefs about something – then these can hold us back and cause us not to perform at our best, or event to become mentally ill.This then is the role of classic Freudian psychodynamic intervention – to help the individual come to terms and move past these unconscious roadblocks. Freud had many tools for doing this, from the \'inkblot test\' to the interpretation of dreams (the \'royal road to the unconsciou\').HypnotismAnother tool of Freud\'s was hypnotism, which aims to put patients in a \'suggestible state\' where they are able to almost \'switch off\' their conscious, critical mind for a bit. This allows the hypnotist, therapist or even the individual themselves to \'talk\' to the unconscious mind directly and even to plant suggestions that might alter it.MeditationLifeSkills.com - Learn How To Meditate Effectively | Free Meditation Podcast | Free Online Meditation Course - Your Meditation Journey | Free Guided Meditation | Free Meditation Music DownloadsSupport the show | Reduce Anxiety in 5 Minutes - Beginners Meditation SecretsBy Jonathan Masters Now more than ever it\'s important to take time out to relax your body and mind. With the current economy, it\'s not unusual that people would be more anxious and stressed than normal. Sometimes it can feel like you can\'t afford to waste a minute on something like relaxing.I know that seems like a logical conclusion, but I think the better question is can you afford not to find some peaceful moments in your life right now?If you could find just 20-30 minutes a day to relax with a technique like meditation, you could significantly reduce your anxiety, panic attacks and boost your drive and creativity during your working time.And getting started in meditation isn\'t as hard as many people believe. All you need to do is sit quietly and let your mind wind down. Too many times I think humans try to move the world by thinking about it. We feel like if we can just think hard enough, maybe we can change things. For right now, just let your normal, everyday thoughts go.Some people choose to sit in silence and try to quiet down their inner mind. You can do this if you feel more comfortable, but I\'ve found it to be too hard for beginners most of the time. Trying to force yourself to think of nothing is like trying not to let gravity get you down.I prefer to imagine a peaceful scene like lying on an empty beach. You can walk yourself through your own peaceful guided meditation. Go anywhere and do anything you want so let your imagination go for awhile.There is a common misconception that something is "supposed to happen" during meditation. People seem to think they\'re supposed to experience some religious experience. While I suppose that can happen, that\'s not the point of meditation and trying to make something happen only distracts you and stresses you out even more.Don\'t expect any certain thing to come to you, just let the meditation go where it wants without limiting your mind. If you can do this daily for even just 5 - 10 minutes you\'ll notice a huge difference in your anxiety within a month or so. Most people also find that even though it starts out as a chore that takes up too much time, meditation actually becomes a ritual they wouldn\'t be without.Jonathan Masters is a writer and former panic attack sufferer. In 2008 he partnered with End of Anxiety to share his knowledge and his story about how he cured his anxiety and panic once and for all.Article Source: Reduce Anxiety in 5 Minutes - Beginners Meditation SecretsSupport the show', 'chan_desc': 'Meditation is not a means to an end.

We’re going to make pickles and salsa this weekend. Pictures and video to come!Eric -\xa0 The summer is almost come to an end, and shortly your garden will be in a can!There are two main ways to can produce: boiling water bath and pressure canning.The water bath method involves packing glass canning jars with food, leaving adequate headroom, and heating the jars in a pot of boiling water for a prescribed amount of time.\xa0I find it easiest to use a canning kit that includes a funnel, and headspace measurement to ensure everything is in the can and head space is adequate.The heat drives any air from the jar, sterilizing the food and creating a vacuum.\xa0The water bath method works best with naturally acidic foods like fruits, and alkaline foods that have been acidified, like pickles.\xa0Improper canning can result in the growth of harmful spoilers, so find a reliable source to follow.\xa0Start out with something simple like salsa, its really hard to screw up and has high acidity so likelihood of bacteria is limited.PODCAST CHALLENGEUnder the banner of cost savings, buy some jam jars on blowout after the fall rush is over.\xa0 You’ll be set up for preserving next year, or at least have some trendy drinking glasses.\xa0Episode ClosingUpcoming events\xa0Anybody make it to taccom?Parksville-Qualicum\xa0 Gun show in Coombs, BC\xa0Sept 15, 2019Coombs fairground\xa0Next to goats on the roof and A Company military surplus.\xa0I’ll be at the CCFR booth.Shout OutsAlan - my buddy who’s giving up a saturday afternoon to help me learn about cars.Eric - The guys at firearm legal defence, thanks for making sure Canadians have a decent firearm insurance policy!Ian - my wife.\xa0 Who has a sense of humour about my sense of humour when it came to my Keto talk.\xa0 Also answered questions about canning I didn’t know about.\xa0\xa0Makers of “The Blackout” Podcast….\xa0 Scott Conroy and Rami Malek“A” Company Military Surplus.\xa0 Nomex work jackets for 15 bucks.\xa0 Extreme cold weather OD parkas for 60!Email / Itunes reviews?Eric - 31 5* 1 4* 1 1* \xa0 1 new written review Evan, but it’s taken!!

I’m a hunter, target shooter, HAM radio operator (VE3EPN), and computer geek. I got into preparedness when I was working front line in emergency services and witnessed an over reliance on Emergency Services during major events, such as ice storms, power outages, etc. I started a small preparedness company to help get people prepared and able to look after themselves for at least 72 hours, if not longer.Alan - I’m Alan, and my friends and family call me a safety nerd. My background as a First Responder developed a mind for safety. I teach first aid and coach family and friends to be better prepared. I'm a locksmith by trade and have worked in the physical security industry for more than 20 years now.Andrew - Normally you can listen to me hosting Canadian Patriot Podcast.

(Each host insert talking points here)Alan - What is an IFAK? Individual First Aid Kit is a fairly generic term, but the essence is that it’s the tools you need to save a life (your own, mostly).\xa0Basic contents:\xa0TourniquetPressure DressingHemostatic GauzeChest SealMedical gloves (not black. Any colour but black. The lighter the better)If you don’t know how to use these things, take a StopTheBleed class (if you’re Toronto way, Ragnarok Tactical offers them, if you’re in SouthWestern Ontario, message me and I’ll set one up)Chest seals: not covered by the STB curriculum, but an important tool to have. It’s a one-way valve that allows air to escape a penetrating chest wound without allowing air to enter the plural space between the lung and the chest wall from the outside. A combat medic told me once that the best tool to help with a chest seal is duct tape. On hairy or wet (sweaty/bloody) skin, they can fail. Duct tape around the edges keeps them in place. The guy who’s bleeding won’t mind the wax job on his chest, I promise.I challenge everyone who owns a gun, hunts, fishes, hikes, camps, or spends any time more than 3 minutes from an ambulance to build and know how to use an IFAK. There are a million stories of unintentional trauma that causes death because someone couldn’t stop the bleeding.\xa0\xa0Andrew - First off, I’m not an expert, but I am a Stop the Bleed Instructor, and I have received training on all the products I sell and some we don’t. I’m not a doctor, nurse, EMT, and odds are you aren’t either, so get training and understand what you are able and qualified to do. The time to make decisions is now, not when you see someone bleeding to deathWhy do you want an IFAK? What is an IFAK?Improved First Aid Kit, Blowout Kit, Ventilated Operator Kit.

He goes through each of the points in the tweet and talks about each of them in turn. There are only two points he sort of agrees with, and believes the rest to be absolute garbage. One of the issues with this tweet is that it doesn’t define what a 10x engineer is.Defining a 10x engineer is difficult because it is also impossible to measure a truly average engineer because there are many factors that play into measuring productivity. Chuck turns the discussion to what a 10x engineer is to him and how to find one. A 10x engineer is dependent on the organization that they are a part of, because they are not simply found, they are made.When a 10x engineer is added to a team, the productivity of the entire team increases. Employers have to consider firstly what you need in your team and how a person would fit in. You want to avoid changing the entire culture of your organization. Consider also that a 10x engineer may be hired as a 2x engineer, but it is the employer that turns them into a 10x engineer.Overall, Chuck believes these tweets are asinine because it’s impossible to measure what makes a 10x engineer in the first place, and hiring a person that fits the attributes in the list would be toxic to your company.PanelCharles Max WoodSponsorsThe Freelancers' ShowElixir MixMy Angular StoryCacheFlyLinks10x engineer Twitter threadWhat Really Makes a 10x Engineer?Follow DevChat.tv on Facebook and TwitterPicksCharles Max Wood:Copyhackers.comGood to Great by Jim CollinsKeto dietPodcast Movement | \xa0In this week’s episode of Adventure in .NET the panel shares their experiences using LINQ or Language Integrated Query. They discuss the benefits of using LINQ\xa0 along with the struggles they have with it. They share some of their favorite tips and tricks for using LINQ.\xa0\xa0LINQ is something .NET developers use on a daily basis. The panel starts by giving a little background on LINQ. LINQ was introduced to the .NET framework 3.5 with the intent of providing a better way of dealing with data. The panel explains what they did before using LINQ and what it was like making the switch.\xa0\xa0LINQ has two different syntaxes, the query syntax, and the lambda syntax. The panel discusses the similarities between query syntax and SQL. They explain why they didn’t just use SQL. Because SQL and query were so similar, the panel both started by using query. They share different ways to get used to the query syntax and the lambda syntax.\xa0\xa0One benefit of using LING is that it is supported in all .NET languages and has been ported over to other languages such as PHP, JavaScript, and Typescript. The panel discusses using in it Angular Typescript and the similarities between it and C#.\xa0\xa0The panel reveals that there are a number of features in .NET that were built to support LINQ. Lambda expressions, anonymous type, and tuples are some examples of features that support LINQ. The panel defines these features and explains how they help you sort through collections of data.\xa0\xa0The panel considers why some programmers are turned off by LINQ. They suppose it is because of its foreign look and that it is not highly structured. Also, LINQ has a lot of syntactic sugar, doing a lot of stuff for you behind the scenes. The panel discusses ways LINQ simplifies workflow and shares tips for using LINQ to simply code.\xa0\xa0Programmers often complain that using LINQ to objects or LINQ to entities and chaining LINQ extensions is an improper use of LINQ.\xa0 The panel explains how using LINQ this way makes the code cleaner and more readable. The panel compares the readability of LINQ statements to SQL statements. They explain why LINQ is easier to read and understand.\xa0The panel shares their tips and tricks for using LINQ statements and deferred executions. They discuss the possible use cases for using deferred executions. They also consider the downsides and gotchas to watch for when using deferred executions.\xa0\xa0LINQ to entity and the Entity framework are considered. The panel discusses the common complaints made about Entity. They address these complaints, explaining how LINQ to entity and the framework has improved. The panel suggests the use of LINQPad for LINQ statements to see the generated sequel statement. They explain what to watch out for when using LINQ pad this way.\xa0\xa0One struggle panel discusses is knowing when to use first or firstordefault. They share tips, things to look for when using either one of these in LINQ. First and single are compared, the panel explains why they use first more than single.\xa0\xa0The possibilities for extension methods in LINQ are considered. Along with using C# extension methods the panel discussing using custom extension methods. They share their favorite third party extension methods and explains how they have helped them simplify their code.\xa0\xa0While the panel is aware that many programmers are averse to mixing functional programming and object-oriented programming, the panel explains that there are a few functional programming concepts built into LINQ. The benefits of being able to use functional programming in C# is explained.\xa0\xa0The panel considers some of the hardest things to do in LINQ and share tips on how to better understand them. Select many and aggregate LINQ queries being to examples they share. The explain what powerful tools they can be.

They begin by discussing the evolution of running tasks and multithreading in async. Filip describes the evolution beginning with background workers, through task parallel libraries finally to async and await. The panel considers how managing tasks has been made almost too easy. \xa0\xa0Filip explains that there has been a drive to make everything asynchronous but explains that this approach doesn’t always make sense. The panel asks Filip when a developer should use async and await. If an application has a UI, Filip encourages the use of async and await and he outlines the benefits. He also explains that if someone wants to be a full-stack developer they need to understand async and await on both the serverside and clientside.\xa0\xa0The panel wonders what the most common async and await mistakes are in .NET. Filip shares a couple of the most common mistakes he sees. The first is deadlocking an application because of the inappropriate methods such as .result and .wait on tasks. The second is marking methods as async without running the await keyword. He explains what these mistakes do to your application and gives advice on avoiding these mistakes.\xa0\xa0The panel expresses past frustrations in making all methods especially tops methods when in ASP.NET. Filip gives the panel advice on making it asynchronous top to bottom and ways to handle those aggravating top methods. He also explains how to use the await keyword and state machines effectively.\xa0Debugging in async is the next topic the panel considers. Filip explains why debugging is so tricky in asynchronous applications. He gives a few tips, his biggest piece of advice is to update Visual Studio and you should get more help in debugging than from older versions.\xa0\xa0The panel moves on to discuss C# 8. Filip explains that C# is his language, he loves it! He shares three new changes to the language features in C# 8. They made changes to how tuples work, pattern matching and null reference types.\xa0\xa0Tuples are the first change the panel considers. Filip explains what tuples are and what they do. Tuples allow you to represent a type without actually using that type. The panel considers how tuples have changed in C# 8, they are still position based but are more flexible in calling them.\xa0\xa0Next, the panel discusses null reference types. The control null reference types allow over nulls is considered. Filip shares some recommendations for using null reference types. The panel considers what might happen if someone were to use null reference types in an existing application. The wonder if it would have any benefit or if it would break the whole application.\xa0\xa0The final feature they discuss is pattern matching. Filip explains the benefit of using the new pattern matching with the new tuples feature in C# 8. The new pattern matching can be used to find tupple patterns, position patterns, and property patterns.\xa0\xa0PanelistsShawn ClaboughCharles Max WoodCaleb WellsGuestFilip EkbergSponsors\xa0\xa0Adventures in BlockchainAdventures in DevOpsThe Freelancers ShowCacheFlyLinksC# 8 and Beyond - Filip Ekberg\xa0Back to Basics: Efficient Async and Await - Filip Ekberg\xa0https://twitter.com/fekberg?lang=enhttps://www.filipekberg.se/https://www.facebook.com/Adventures-in-NET-373059030062837/ https://twitter.com/adventures_netPicksCharles Max Wood:RR 429: Mechanical Confidence with Adam CuppyJSJ 392: The Murky Past and Misty Future of JavaScript with Douglas CrockfordDr. Mario WorldCaleb Wells:Upgrade to the new Nintendo Switch\xa0Filip Ekberg:Final Fantasy VIII RemasteredFinal Fantasy VII RemakeShawn Clabough:https://oz-code.com/\xa0 | Episode Summary\xa0In this episode of Adventures in .NET, James Montemagno, a PM in the developer division at Microsoft working with Xamarin shares with the panel all of the exciting things happening in the Xamarin world. Charles Max Wood invites listeners to check out James’s appearances on a different DevChatTV podcast, The iPhreaks Show. Charles expresses his excitement to see Xamarin from a .NET perspective.\xa0\xa0James starts the discussion by sharing how he got into Xamarin and .NET. He explains what he loves about .NET. James worked for Xamarin during the transition into Microsoft, he shares what it was like and how the unification of the two made their products even better. The panel discusses the changes in Microsoft’s practices over the past ten years, becoming more opensource friendly and less focused on selling products.\xa0What is Xamarin, is the next thing the panel answers. James explains that Xamarin helps developers build native apps in C#. He goes on to explain how the versions of Xamarin change based on the platform, Android, iOS and tooling inside visual studio.\xa0\xa0The topic turns to how Xamarin runs. James explains that there is a common theme in Xamarin, flexibility. Choosing how Xamarin is run is up to the developer, who can use AOT (ahead of time) or JIT (just in time). Charles explains what AOT and JIT mean and how they affect application size and performance. James explains how Xamarin runs differently for Android and iOS.\xa0\xa0James introduces a brand new mode called Startup Tracing and explains how it can reduce the start-up time for your Xamarin apps by up to 60% by using a small trace of AOT. He shares the future goals for this mode and explains that it is free and can be used today.\xa0\xa0\xa0The next concern the panel has is about sharing code between different platforms and how this works with Xamarin. James explains that this problem is solved with Xamarin forms, Xamarin forms has everything a mobile app developer could want. In Xamarin forms developers can create pages to share cross-platform or simply build their whole app for all platforms. James even explains how a developer can make platform-specific adjustments to the code.\xa0\xa0James defines customer-driven development and explains how this allows them to create the best product for developers. The flexibility and capabilities in UI’s and controls allows developers to choose what their app looks like. Caleb asks about the built template components that allows the developer to architect the navigation in their applications. James explains one of the tools, Shell and how it helps you set up your navigation how you want it while handling all the messiness with minimal code.\xa0\xa0Charles asks James about library integration into Xamarin. James starts by sharing what comes in the box with Xamarin, 100% API coverage for both Android and iOS. How this works is, a team looks at the needs of developers and makes a list of the necessary, popular and desired libraries and creates API bindings for them. Libraries that don’t make that list can have a binding generated with Xamarins binding generator, which will include the necessary features needed to use the library.\xa0\xa0The panel changes the topic to the new Xamarin features that James is most excited for. James mentions a one-stop library called Xamarin essentials that will hold all the things a developer might need. He also includes Xaml hot reload for Xamarin forms, this feature will create a better level of productivity as it reloads around typos and mistakes allowing developers to stay in their workflow. The panel discusses the other benefits of a feature like this. Caleb Wells warns how addictive a good hot reload can be.\xa0The episode ends with James giving advice and resources for getting into Xamarin. Charles praises the Microsoft documentation. Caleb gives an endorsement for Microsoft Learn. Charles invites listeners to suggest topics and guests at devchat.tv.\xa0\xa0PanelistsCharles Max WoodCaleb WellsGuestJames MontemagnoSponsors\xa0\xa0Adventures in DevOpsThe Freelancers ShowReact Round UpCacheFlyLinkshttps://montemagno.com/podcast-equipment-accessories-guide/\xa0https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/vov-078-waxing-philosophical-with-christoffer-noring\xa0www.mergeconflict.fm\xa0www.nintendodispatch.com\xa0www.xamarinpodcast.com\xa0https://www.mw-embedded.com/product/gameboy-color-replacement-lcd-module/\xa0096 iPS Xamarin and Wearables with James Montemagno\xa0iPS 206 Build Special 1: Embeddinator 4000 with James Montemagno\xa0175 iPS Xamarin with James Montemagno\xa0https://montemagno.com/podcast-equipment-accessories-guide/\xa0www.mergeconflict.fm\xa0www.nintendodispatch.com\xa0www.xamarinpodcast.com\xa0https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarinhttps://www.facebook.com/Adventures-in-NET-373059030062837/ https://twitter.com/adventures_netPicksCharles Max Wood:The ExpanseThe Black ListThe Amazing RaceCaleb Wells:Doom Patrol\xa0James Montemagno:The Bachelor\xa0The Bachelor in ParadiseOzarksThe Big Lebowskihttps://www.mw-embedded.com/product/gameboy-color-replacement-lcd-module/\xa0 | SponsorsCacheFlyPanelShawn ClaboughCaleb WellsJoined by Special Guest: Colby TresnessSummaryColby Tresness, from Microsoft, joins the panel to answer questions about azure functions. He starts by defining the two different types of azure functions. He overviews the different plans available and what they offer.

(https://www.smallscalelife.com) | How does a company grow 1 million meals in a place with incredibly high temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter?  On top of that, this company has no tillable soil, no heavy farm equipment (i.e., traditional tractors or combines) and only asphalt and concrete to grow food.  In addition, this company needs to move garden beds for new attractions and exhibits, so these raised beds need to be mobile.Impossible, you say? It is not only possible, it is happening right now in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  In fact, it is happening at the State Fair of Texas while the fair is happening!  In this episode, I sit down with Drew Demler from Big Tex Urban Farms and discuss various aquaponic systems and mobile garden beds used to grow 1 million meals for the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  We cover a lot of topics including who Drew Demler is, what kind of aquaponic systems are used, pests, fertilizers, wicking beds and small aquaponic systems you can set up at your own home.Big Tex Urban Farms has a focused mission: to "connect like-minded agriculture entities and provides fresh produce to organizations focused on hunger and healthy lifestyle programs."  With people like Drew Demler leading the way, there is no doubt in my mind that Big Tex Urban Farms will continue to push the envelope and provide nutritous meals to those in need for a long time to come.For more information, links and show notes, please head to the article titled "SSG: How to Grow 1 Million Meals with Drew Demler " on https://smallscalegardening.com! | In last week\'s News from Around the Bend on smallscalelife.com (https://www.smallscalelife.com/news-from-around-the-bend-back-to-school-edition/), I opened the article by talking about kids going back to school.  In some cases, our friends are taking their young adults to college for the first time. Julie and I have been there and done that. After all, both of our boys left our house and went to the US Army (Danny) or college (Ryan).  We just took Ryan back to Winona, Minnesota, for the next phase of his college career.  Whether you are taking your young adult to college for the first time, to kindergarten for the first time or sending your child to school for another round, we all have feelings of excitement, nervousness and doubt.Why do we feel this way and what can you do about it?  In this podcast, I am mainly going to focus on young adults going back to school or heading off to college for the first time.  A friend is feeling that sense of loss and depression after sending his son to college several states away.  He was feeling pretty bad, and I wanted to respond to some of his questions in this podcast.The bottom line is that you have to let these young adults launch and start to explore their world.  We are going to have to give up some control; these young adults are out of sight and out of "reach" (so to speak).  You don\'t have control, and you need to let them learn.  On the other hand, there are some things we can do to prepare for this phase of life.  We need to have a plan in case things go awry.  Life happens, and it can catch you by surprise if you don\'t have a plan.  At the same time, there are some things we need to do to think about the next phase of OUR LIVES.  Yes, the kids are going to leave the nest, so what comes next?  Remember: failing to plan is planning to fail.  We want you to be the best you, so start to put that thinking cap on, make some plans and execute!For more information and links in the show notes, check out the article titled "Preparing for the Next Phase of Life" on smallscalelife.com! | In this episode, I am trying something new!  This is the pilot episode of the new Small Scale Gardening Podcast.  In this podcast, I am focusing on gardening and food preservation, which are my passions.  As I learned from my good friend Greg Burns, I need to "Start with the Why" as I begin this effort.  I talk about the following topics in this podcast including:Why I started blogging, podcasting and vlogging in the first placeOur elders and their knowledge and experienceImportant Questions:Why start this podcast?Why split it out from Small Scale Life?What do you hope to accomplish?Check yourself before you wreck yourself....Goals and objectivesThe future: interviews and garden tours; livestreaming on YouTubeCall to ActionThis podcast will be hosted on Small Scale Life, and I will also provide links on Small Scale Gardening.

We need to be part of our community and strengthening existing relationships while making new ones.  It isn\'t always about the money; it\'s about building social capital!This is a Just Tom Show while I am on the road from Duluth, MN, to Minneapolis, MN.  As I worked on the shores of the great Lake Giche Gume (Lake Superior for everyone not in Minnesota), I had time to reflect on July.  We had a great time with family at our house and on the road in Stevens Point, Kimball and northern Wisconsin. It helped that we have a lot of July birthdays; that translates into family celebrations!  Family can be hard to love at times, but as my dad said, "Blood is thicker than water."  We have been working hard to build up those family relationships.At the same time, July has been a month of friendship.  We are thankful to spend time with our good friends and make some new friends along the way!  Friends have invited us over, and we have opened our house to them as well.  A great example is this weekend: we are heading north (after I just got home) to our friends\' cabin near Hayward, WI.  It is going to be a weekend of fun and shenanigans, but that is what it is all about, right?  We have to open ourselves up and take the time to connect with others, even those folks in our neighborhood.For more on this podcast (and the show notes), head over to this article on Small Scale Life! | In this podcast, Julie and I talk about How to Budget Your Way to Financial Freedom.  We unpack the 9 Steps to Creating Your First Budget (with an additional bonus step at the end).  This is the podcast you have been waiting for!  After recording this podcast, Julie and I realized that there was a lot to this topic. Budgeting so important to your future success, but creating your first budget can be overwhelming and stressful. Julie and I have done a lot of thinking about how to present this material and share our process with you.  To help you with successfully creating your first budget, Julie and I decided to create and release a Quickie Monthly Budget rather than a complicated spreadsheet.  We want you to try this method of budgeting in a simple and easy to follow format.  As part of Creating Your First Budget Week, Julie and I will be releasing a Quickie Monthly Budget with instructions on Wednesday this week at smallscalelife.com.  We will have a special page dedicated to this Quickie Monthly Budget, and we will include a link in the show notes once the budget has been posted.  In the meantime, head over to smallscalelife.com to find more information and get the show notes on this podcast! | "Your goal is your destination; your budget is your roadmap." - Julie DomresDo you have dreams and goals?  Are you making progress towards achieving those goals?  For some people, it is difficult to dream.  Others have big plans and goals, but they do not execute and take steps towards making those dreams a future reality.  In this podcast, Julie and I discuss How to Dream Big, Set Goals and Take Steps to Achieve Them.  Dreaming big and setting those goals are the "Secret Sauce" behind budgeting.  You are developing powerful "whys" for those times when you are tempted to engage in retail therapy, splurge on meals or rack up massive credit card debt to impress people you don\'t particularly like!   As we discuss in this podcast, you need to start with your powerful why.  Before you begin budgeting, you need to do some deep thinking and dreaming about what you want your life to look like in 10 years, 3 years and 1 year.  Once you have this vision set, you can focus on developing your budget that will set you up to achieve your dreams!We\'ll share with you how to dream big, set goals and take the steps to achieve them in this podcast.  How do we know they work?  Because we are using this to achieve our goals too!For more information on this post including getting the show notes, head to the article titled "How to Dream Big, Set Goals and Take Steps to Achieve Them" on Small Scale Life (https://smallscalelife.com) | Have you ever thought you were climbing a mountain? Huge obstacles in life take on different forms and shapes. They can be finances, health issues, clutter, relationships, work or just life in general! Those obstacles have a tendency to start as molehills and become mountains. Many times, we do not put those mountains in our lives on purpose; they just seem to happen.What happens when we do put those mountains in front of us on purpose?Last weekend, Julie, Savannah, the Old Trapper and I got to witness what happens when 110 souls put running up and then down a mountain that they put in their life on purpose. We witnessed these 110 runners competing in the Last Runner Standing Ultramarathon where these athletes truly began climbing mountains with mindset, heart and dedication!In this post and podcast, I will discuss the following topics:What is an Ultramarathon?What is the Last Runner Standing Ultramarathon?The Ultramarathon CommunityWinnersRunning the Last Runner Standing Ultramarathon – In their Own Words[For more information, please head over to the article titled "Last Runner Standing Ultramarathon" on smallscalelife.com!](https://www.smallscalelife.com/last-runner-standing-ultramarathon/) | Last week, the gardening world and I got some sad news that made me think about leaving a legacy.  Larry Hall passed away.  For those of you who do not know who Larry Hall is, he is the creator of the Rain Gutter Grow System that I have experimented with in the past (and will be experimenting with this year). Larry was from Brainerd, Minnesota, and he created a low-cost way for people to successfully grow food no matter where they lived.We are all going to die someday. It might be today, tomorrow or years in the future. We don’t know when, where or how. We can’t stop it, and it is part of the life cycle.  Knowing this, the question is: how are you leaving a legacy for those who come behind you (future generations of your children and grandchildren)?For the transcript of the article and lots of links, see the show notes in the article titled "Leaving a Legacy - A Tribute to Larry Hall" on smallscalelife.com. (https://www.smallscalelife.com/leaving-a-legacy-tribute-to-larry-hall/) | In this episode of the Small Scale Life Podcast, Julie and I discuss taking the first steps towards Financial Freedom.  To do this, you need to start by Taking Inventory and Tracking Expenses.In previous episodes of the Small Scale Life Podcast, Julie and I have told our story about making mistakes and doing stupid with zeros on it.  In order to break out of the box and go from Survive to Thrive, we needed to change our habits and our mindset.  To start down this path, you need to get a clear picture of what your net worth looks like.  Are you in the red or in the black?  Do you know?  Julie and I have prepared an inventory worksheet for you, and it is available on the Small Scale Life Resources Page. (https://www.smallscalelife.com/resources/)Once you complete this exercise, you can begin tracking ALL of your expenses.  You can do this by writing it down in a notebook or using apps like mint.com (https://www.mint.com/).

They explore the world around them through play, imagination, and discovery. They build meaning, they create understanding, and they unabashedly share their learning. It’s in this process that they find joy in life and relevance in the world around them. Why, then, do some of our students become disconnected from their learning in school? Where does this natural curiosity go? And how, as educators, can we ensure all of our students experience a meaningful and wonder-filled journey through their education? It’s these questions that Trevor MacKenzie, author of the critically acclaimed book Dive into Inquiry, answers in Inquiry Mindset. Co-written with kindergarten teacher Rebecca Bathurst-Hunt, Inquiry Mindset offers a highly accessible journey through inquiry in the younger years. You’ll learn how to . . . Empower your learners, increase engagement, and accelerate achievement. Harness the wonderings and curiosities of your students and leverage them into powerful learning opportunities. Cultivate an inquiry mindset both as a teacher and in your students!

And as they old adage goes, variety is the spice of life! When it comes to cooking and meal prep, if you’re bored you won’t continue to do it. In this episode of the food and other bites podcast, I share how to keep your food interesting, week in week out.\xa0 Understand Your Meal Prep Style Most people think meal prep looks one way, pick recipes, cook recipes, eat food - rinse repeat; but there is so much more to understand about meal prep. Understanding whether you are more rigid or more flex will change the game for you.\xa0 RIGID types should make composed meals, that simply require reheating. These are great for people who don’t mind eating the same thing all week long. I watch movies several times, listen to songs on repeat and, in that vein, I can eat the same thing days on end; I’m rigid.\xa0 FLEX types bore easily and eating the same thing over and over makes them want to order in lol. If this is you, your prep should look like this:  Make a few sauces Roast sweet potato, beets, regular potato Cook or buy a (cooked) whole chicken\xa0 Make 1 pasta and 1 grain Prep (if needed) 2 raw vegetables (think arugula, spinach etc) Buy 2 types of herbs  This prep will give you MEGA options throughout a week, because you can mix and match your heart out! GET YOUR SAUCE GAME TOGETHER- download the sauce making guide here with 5 delicious sauce recipes.\xa0 On the topic of sauce... Sauce is how you make very similar ingredients taste completely different, so if you require variation understanding saucery will save your meals EVERY TIME! Speaking of variation... Herbs are clutch when keeping your food interesting; but understanding where herbs belong is important, or you could disrupt the texture.\xa0 HERBY herbs like parsley (curly and Italian), mint, cilantro, basil, chives and dill are best used as a garnish or at the end of cooking. So think of making vinaigrette’s and raw sauces with these herbs.\xa0 WOODY herbs like thyme, rosemary and sage tend to be tougher in texture and can hold up to cooking, so use them in cooked sauces, or during the cooking process to take the edge off their bite.\xa0 I’ll say this ad nauseam, having your kitchen set up for success is the ONLY way to cook with ease, because there is nothing more frustrating than cooking in a kitchen that doesn’t have what you need. Cooking CAN BE simple, but you have to have your sh*t together.\xa0 I want to remind you that it is COMPLETELY possible to double the enjoyment of your food without doubling the effort and I hope this episode of the podcast showed you that! | As a chef I am always encouraging people to cook more at home, because it saves money and leads to a delicious life (IMO); but when it comes to cooking with ease- meaning you don’t want to throw a pot across the kitchen- you must first master the fundamentals. In cooking, as in life, one must walk before they can run. Read Recipes All the Way Through This is STEP ONE, and often the most overlooked aspect of recipe selection. When selecting recipes people generally read the ingredients and decide whether the recipe is a “make” or a “pass”, but this is only half the information.\xa0 Reading a recipe fully means you will know the equipment required, the process and more nuances that you only get reading the instructions of a recipe. Pick Recipes You Understand This should go without saying but if you read through a recipe and at any point wonder WTF they are talking about, this recipe is a pass- or a postpone for when you have more time on your hands! STAY TUNED FOR AN UPCOMING EPISODE WHERE I CLEAR UP COMMON COOKING TERMINOLOGY Find Similar Ingredients If you are one of those people that gets overwhelmed at the prospect of buying a lot of different ingredients, you need to find, what we call in the industry, a hero ingredient, which you will build your meals around. This means, less ingredients, and less stress in the grocery store. Reading recipes is a fundamental step in creating ease around the process of cooking and meal planning and if you didn’t know, now you know ;)   | Today is an exciting day for me because my food podcast is finally launched. Though this podcast is new, I’m not new to podcasting game. I’ve started and abandoned two past podcasts but this time feels new and fresh; frankly because I know myself and my strengths better than I ever have before and I finally feel expert enough to podcast. Imposter syndrome is real people! This food podcast has been a long time coming, because a) I love to talk, NO JOKE, take me on a road trip, you will not get bored and b) there is a gap in the food podcast space (no shade) and I want to fill it with information to help you with the day to day effort of cooking and meal planning for yourself and your family.\xa0 Why a Podcast? Why now?  I get asked all the time if I do radio, and since I do (and love) tv, I thought why not?! I repeat, talking is my favourite thing to do, next to cooking. It’s a natural fit.\xa0 I’ve been cooking for 10 years (13 if you include school and training) and in that time I’ve been a caterer, ran my own kitchen, ran other kitchens, taught cooking, meal planned for all kinds of diets and families and private cheffed for the highest end you can imagine, and thus I have A LOT to share!  What to expect from the food and other bites podcast Expect to feel like you’re in a classroom with your favourite teacher, learning in a dynamic and entertaining way. You will laugh- I’m told I’m funny; and you’ll come away from every episode feeling like you know what’s up when it comes to cooking and feeding yourself.\xa0 Although this podcasts main focus is to empower you in the kitchen, from time to time I will interview inspiring people in the food/cooking space...but only the best. I’m not here to waste anyone’s time lol.\xa0 It’s also worth noting that I sometimes swear, but I’ll give you fair warning. I also love to invent words, you’ll come to understand the nuances of my created language; and lastly, of the words that already exist, I will certainly abbreviate them, but as with above, you’ll come to understand me juuuuust fine.\xa0 How to listen This podcast is available to listen on all the biggies: Apple Podcasts Spotify Stitcher\xa0 Google Play Don’t sleep on it, and subscribe so you never miss an episode. On that note, you can expect a new episode every week.\xa0 Since I have zero issues being a shameless self promoter, I’m gonna ask that if you’re loving the Food and Other Bites Podcast please subscribe, rate and review; makes me feel good, helps people find the podcast- it’s win-win.\xa0 Enjoy the listen and thanks for your support! \xa0 \xa0', 'chan_desc': "Join chef and cooking expert Bianca Osbourne as she helps you grow your skills and confidence in the kitchen with real world, day-to-day, cooking and meal planning strategies to help you make magic with your meals.Expect to feel like you're in a classroom with your favourite teacher, learning in a dynamic and entertaining way; you'll laugh, learn and come away from each episode feeling like you know what's up when it comes to cooking and feeding yourself well!", 'cover_img_url': 'https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/a/a/c/d/aacd03ca49b4c83e/Webp.net-resizeimage.png', 'first_release': '2019-09-13'}}

My\xa0specialties include\xa0military service academies, ROTC scholarships, Ivy League, and student-athletes. | Show Notes:If your child does what most students do - and waits until 11th or 12th grade to begin thinking about and planning for college - they will be leaving 70% of their application up to chance. For students who aspire to the most selective colleges - this is not an option. This is a recipe for disappointment, frustration, and missed opportunities.\xa0If you have a child who is considering Ivy League or near-Ivy league schools (like Duke, Stanford, MIT, Vanderbilt), or a service academy, or is seeking an ROTC or athletic scholarship, please encourage them to engage in the process now - and by now - I mean 9th or 10th grade.Good news: Given how few people understand how this new reality works, your child can use this knowledge to their strategic advantage when it comes to college admissions.\xa0This episode walks you through my thesis and uncovers why most people (including guidance counselors) continue to use 20-yr old advice.\xa0And, if your child really wants to get ahead, you should encourage them to listen to this episode themselves and then enroll them in my online program, PrepWell Academy, which teaches 9th and 10th graders how this whole process works - in a series of short videos delivered to their phone every week.\xa0If you want to support the show, here are three immediate steps to take.\xa0\xa0Subscribe to the podcast where ever you listen to podcastsFollow me on\xa0Instagram\xa0or\xa0FacebookGive us a reviewJoin our mailing listEnroll\xa0your 9th\xa0or 10th\xa0grader in the programWhat I discuss in this episode:\xa00:01:36\xa0My most important (and controversial) insight0:01:52\xa0What do I consider "competitive programs”0:02:16\xa0What happens if your child waits until 11th grade to start?0:03:00\xa0The worst advice that you\'ll hear from friends0:03:20\xa0Why guidance counselors often give the wrong advice0:05:42\xa0Why some students don’t need to prepare early?0:07:04\xa0The “old system” and why it’s dead0:08:00\xa0Why it’s easy to fall into the procrastination\xa0trap0:08:46\xa0Why would I target such a niche market?0:09:32\xa0My bold prediction for the year 20300:09:55\xa0Why I don’t focus on the mass market?0:10:33\xa0What types of families I like to work with0:10:44\xa0Why 9th and 10th grades are the most important years0:11:27\xa0Why every student should be ready to apply early?0:12:25\xa0Why senior year is irrelevant0:13:35\xa0Only have 3 years to build your body of work0:14:13\xa0Top 10 Regrets of parents with juniors0:15:09\xa0What it’s like to talk to a junior about college admissions0:15:33\xa0How do we avoid the stress and anxiety?0:15:53\xa0Why should the number 66% scare you?0:16:26\xa0Why does everyone ignore these years?0:16:46\xa0What happens in 9th and 10th grade?0:17:48\xa0Will your child be able to use sports to get into college?0:19:41\xa0When should your child study for the SAT?0:20:12\xa070% of your child’s body-of-work is complete before junior year0:20:51\xa0Why 11th grade should be easier than 9th and 10th grades0:22:02\xa0What happens when everything gets pushed to 11th grade0:22:30\xa0Summary thoughtsResources:\xa0Follow us:\xa0Enroll in PrepWell AcademyFollow on InstagramFollow on FacebookPodcast Host:\xa0PrepWell Academy\'s Founder,\xa0Phil Black, has spent a lifetime\xa0cracking the code\xa0on the world\'s most competitive programs: Yale University, Harvard Business School, Navy SEALs, Goldman Sachs, Entrepreneurship, Shark Tank, etc.Inside\xa0PrepWell Academy, Black teaches students everything they need to know about the college admissions process in a series of expertly-timed, 3-5-minute, weekly training videos starting in 9thgrade and continuing through 12th\xa0grade [Note: this program can only be joined in 9th\xa0or 10th\xa0grade].

Welcome to the first-ever episode of the PrepWell Podcast. I hope you enjoy the show and stick around for all the exciting things to come. I wanted to start off by giving you some background about me and why I started this podcast.I created the podcast to help me communicate with you in a more meaningful way. Sure, I routinely send emails and post to social media – but these outputs often feel rushed and superficial.As a busy parent with four kids myself (three going through the college admissions process as we speak), I wanted to create an option for parents who would prefer to listen to my in-depth commentary and advice at their own pace. The longer format allows me to convey details and emotions that can’t be transmitted in a bullet-pointed email or filtered Instagram post.Since the subsequent shows are packed with my personal opinions and advice on how to help your child (and you) navigate the college admissions process, I thought I’d share some of my background, experience, and education. The goal of this “trailer” is for you to get to know me better and understand my approach to life.This "trailer" episode outlines my journey from recruited athlete in high school, to Yale University, to Goldman Sachs, to the Navy SEALs, to Harvard Business School, to 9/11, to Firefighter, to Shark Tank, and to College Admission Counselor.And, more importantly, it reveals the lessons I learned along the way that will help your child achieve similarly ambitious goals. (Feel free to skip this episode and come back later if you like).I realize that this podcast isn’t for everyone. Its message is directed, intentionally, to parents of 8th, 9th, and 10th\xa0graders whose children have big ambitions - children who aspire to attend highly-selective and competitive colleges programs. Namely: (1) Ivy League and near-Ivy League schools, (2) military service academies (e.g. West Point, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, etc.), (3) and those seeking athletic scholarships to college.I also appreciate that this podcast does not serve a big demographic of parents who have children in 11th\xa0and 12th\xa0grade – the sweet spot for most college admissions counselors. I based this decision on my strong conviction that early engagement of students (in 9th\xa0and 10th\xa0grade) is the most important factor in their success in the college admissions process – particularly at the more selective programs. Beginning the process in 11th\xa0and 12th\xa0grade is, in my experience, too late.If you want to support the show, here are three immediate steps to take. \xa0Subscribe to the podcast where ever you listen to podcastsFollow me on\xa0Instagram\xa0or\xa0FacebookGive us a reviewJoin our mailing listEnroll\xa0your 9th\xa0or 10th\xa0grader in the programHere is what I discuss in this episode:0:02:11\xa0- Growing up on Long Island, NY0:02:26\xa0- Athletic, smart, wealthy, connected?
