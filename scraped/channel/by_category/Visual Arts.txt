They were SO FAR behind Canon and Nikon that it seemed impossible for them to catch up... but, they did catch up around 2018, and in 2019 Sony solidly surpassed the Canon and Nikon mirrorless cameras.

What do those artists look for when they sketch? How do they remember the right colors or where the light was coming from? Hoping to get some answers to these questions and a whole lot more, I was pleased to sit down with the artist, Tom Hughes. In our conversation, Tom opens up about how he found his path as an artist, what it was like working for the Christian Science Monitor, and more. I can’t wait for you all to get a peek into the world of Tom Hughes!\xa0 Hearing the call Can you remember that moment when you decided you wanted to pursue your career as an artist? Or maybe for you, the draw to an art career was more of a gradual revelation. Slow or sudden, each artist has their own version of realizing their unique path as an artist. For Tom Hughes, the decision to embrace life as an artist was more along the lines of answering a “Calling.” If you are religious, spiritual, something in between, or nothing at all, I’m sure you can relate to what Tom talks about when he describes his draw to art as a “Calling.” For some reason, I’ve found that language to resonate with many artists, does it resonate with you?\xa0 Picking up skills along the way\xa0 As you’ve grown as an artist over the years, do you attribute it to practice or learning new skills along the way? While some artists love to explore new methods and push the limits, others like to hunker down and become proficient at one particular approach. Tom Hughes did not receive formal art training at a university for college; he took the route that included self-education. As you can imagine, Tom’s journey hasn’t always been easy. He has had significant moments of confidence, like his time at the Christian Science Monitor, and he’s had periods where he had to take a break and step away.\xa0 Finding the right process Through all of the highs and lows of Tom’s career, the one constant that gets to the heart of Tom’s career is his willingness to adapt and discover the right process. Rarely do artists get described as process-oriented. We artists often get painted with a broad stroke and labelled as flighty, inconsistent, and emotional, just to name a few! Tom worked hard for years to hone in on the process that would work best for him. One of the ways Tom likes to work is by sketching his subjects before he goes to the canvas. Are you drawn to a more process-focused approach in your art?\xa0 It’s OK to change over time I am still blown away when I look back to the start of this fledgeling little podcast and the few friends I knew who would listen to see the massive following we enjoy today - it’s incredible! There are a few elements from those early episodes that you’ll still notice as part of the podcast today, but there have been many changes. If you don’t learn and adapt over time, what is the point? Too often, I find my fellow artists are more adverse to change and evolution then I had expected. We are the ones who get the opportunity to push the envelope and help the public look deeper - it’s OK to change over time! Outline of This Episode  [0:50] I introduce my guest, Tom Hughes.\xa0 [2:20] How Tom got started as an artist.\xa0 [9:00] Skills that Tom picked up and learned along the way.\xa0 [14:00] Tom’s studio process.\xa0 [19:00] Diving into the details of Tom’s sketching sessions.\xa0 [26:40] Tom’s process when it comes to plein air painting.\xa0 [34:15] What is Tom’s color pallet like?\xa0 [40:00] How we change as artists over time.\xa0 [46:20] Tom’s struggle with watercolours.\xa0 [50:20] Why I love watercolours and life as an artist.\xa0 [1:00:00] Have tolerance for your bad paintings!\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Winslow Homer Rembrandt  Resources Mentioned on this episode  Tom’s website  Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | When was the last time you really took a moment to slow down and notice your surroundings? Do you find that you are easily distracted by your cell phone notifications or the million other things demanding your attention? You aren’t alone! I’ve struggled with managing my distractions for years, so I was thrilled to hear my guest, Michelle Dunaway address this critical topic. In our conversation, we also discuss Michelle’s oil painting, her recent arm injury, how to be honest with yourself, and much more. I know that artists like you will get a ton of value from Michelle’s thoughtful perspective, enjoy!\xa0 Space to daydream and wonder What was your childhood like? Did you have a ton of expectations placed on you from an early age or were you free to find your own path? While many parents have nothing but the best of intentions - the truth is - a carefree childhood can quickly get pushed to the wayside. Thankfully, Michelle was given permission and encouragement to explore her creativity. Looking back, she is especially fond of the moments where she would get lost in a daydream or playing in a field. Michelle also points to a critical influence in her life, Richard Schmidt - he also took time to invest in Michelle and encourage her abilities both professionally and as a peer. An unexpected injury\xa0 Don’t you hate it when life throws you a huge curveball that you never saw coming? Maybe for you, it was an unexpected expense like a car repair or the illness of a loved one, or maybe your story is a lot like Michelle’s and you’ve experienced a personal injury that you have to overcome. After recovering from a misstep that caused an injury to her arm, Michelle started to get back into the swing of things. Before long, she realized that she wasn’t able to put in the hours painting as she had before the accident. It turns out that Michelle had re-injured her arm and now has to undergo surgery and an extensive recovery process.\xa0 Managing distractions\xa0 The experience with her arm injury highlighted an important aspect that Michelle had been working to focus on for years - managing distractions. From her cellphone to the news and everything in between - Michelle’s life felt like it was full of distractions. As a spiritual person, Michelle looks to prayer and meditation to help her find her center. Cutting through all the noise of daily life is no easy task! The injury to her arm has forced Michelle to become more aware and present - she still struggles with the distraction of her cell phone, but she’s making progress. What can you take away from Michelle’s story?\xa0 The moments that make you smile\xa0 Have you had a moment in your art career that made you pause in gratitude? Let’s face it; gratitude is not an easy attitude to cultivate. We can get so focused and caught up in what we don’t have or what isn’t going right that we fail to reflect on the good things in life. Michelle will be the first person to tell you that her life is filled with things to be grateful for. Looking back on her career - Michelle points out one person’s reaction to her oil painting of Richard Schmidt as a particularly remarkable experience. The man that was viewing her painting was moved to tears and explained that Michelle’s painting made him feel like he had met Richard Schmidt. What a compliment! Outline of This Episode  [1:00] I introduce my guest, Michelle Dunaway.\xa0 [2:30] Michelle talks about her influences and why she started a career in art.\xa0 [5:30] How has Michelle’s arm injury impacted her journey?\xa0 [19:20] Michelle and I discuss the “Artist’s eye.”\xa0 [21:00] Learning to be honest with yourself.\xa0 [29:30] What does Michelle look for in a subject?\xa0 [39:00] Michelle talks about her experience working with Faso.\xa0 [42:00] A typical day in Michelle’s studio. [50:00] Removing distractions.\xa0 [54:40] Proud moments from Michelle’s career.\xa0 [1:04:00] Michelle shares a story about a painting that moved her.\xa0 [1:13:30] What is Michelle’s dream project?\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Richard Schmidt John Singer Sargent\xa0 Monet Cecilia Beaux Jeremy Lipking Mary Oliver Stephanie Paige Thomson\xa0  Resources Mentioned on this episode  Michelle\'s website  Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | Have you found artists who paint Americana inspiring? Are you drawn to the romanticism and grandeur of the genre? How do artists who focus on painting Americana feel about their genre of work? I was thrilled to sit down with the talented and generous artist, Susan Lyon. In our conversation, Susan opened up about what led her to her career as an artist, why she decides to change things up, her dream of mentoring young artists, and much more. I can\'t wait for you to get to know Susan\'s inspiring story!\xa0 A captured imagination\xa0 When you look back at your start as an artist, who do you point to for inspiration? Was your imagination captured by the likes of Georgia O\'Keeffe and N. C. Wyeth? Susan Lyon\'s imagination was ignited by a whole range of artists, including O\'Keeffe and Wyeth. Today, Susan finds herself encouraged and inspired by her peers who paint Americana. Susan also enjoys studying and painting the faces of people she loves. Listening to Susan, you really get the sense that her heart is poured out into her artwork.\xa0 Practicing meditation\xa0 How do you deal with all the stress and challenges of life as an artist? What practices help you focus and unlock your creativity? For years Susan Lyon would practice meditation, but it wasn\'t until the last couple of years when everything started to "Click." By practicing meditation, Susan has learned how to calm her nervous system and ask open-ended questions. Meditation has given Susan the gift of perspective and peace - key elements for a healthy career as an artist! What can you learn from Susan\'s story? What practices have helped you in your career?\xa0 Don\'t chase perfection!\xa0 Have you been caught up in the perfection game? Some artists learn quickly how detrimental the pursuit of perfection can be - for others, it can take years. We\'ve all been there - you have a particular idea of how you want your artwork to turn out but reality jumps in and messes everything up. It\'s at that point where you need to decide if you are going to keep pouring in your time and energy or cut your losses and start something new. Susan recalls how challenging it can be to realize that you\'ve sunk way too much time into a project that needs to end. I hope you find her advice and insights as helpful as I did!\xa0 The power of group energy When was the last time you got so caught up in the electric energy and positive influence of your fellow artists? Some artists love to get alone with their canvas and explore the depths of their creativity while others feed off of and thrive in a more communal environment. Beyond personal preferences - Susan makes an excellent point about the power of group energy, especially when it comes to artists. In her experience, when like-minded artists gather and encourage one another - powerful energy is unlocked. Have you experienced that time group energy? Outline of This Episode  [0:53] I introduce my guest, Susan Lyon.\xa0 [3:05] What led Susan to her career as an artist.\xa0 [12:00] Susan talks about changing things up.\xa0 [17:15] Reverting back to a safety zone.\xa0 [19:50] Susan shares the benefit of practicing meditation.\xa0 [29:30] Why Susan enjoys painting the image of people she loves. [35:00] The challenge of chasing perfection.\xa0 [40:10] What is Susan’s process like in the studio?\xa0 [45:30] Susan’s dream of mentoring younger artists.\xa0 [50:10] The power of group energy.\xa0 [53:30] Branching out with a one-person show and teaching.\xa0 [1:06:00] The power of vulnerability.\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Richard Schmid\xa0 Georgia O\'Keeffe Bettina Steinke Howard Terpning N.

Can you make a living off of an Etsy business? What should you look out for? Good news! I put all these questions and more to my returning guest, Jenni Waldrop.\xa0 In our conversation, Jenni opens up about realistic expectations, why it’s not enough to just build a shop on Etsy, how to plan for seasonal changes, and much more. If you’ve ever wanted to know how to build a presence on a platform like Etsy - this is the episode for you!\xa0 Addressing Criticism The last time I had Jenni on as a guest, we had an excellent discussion that resonated with a lot of Savvy Painter listeners. Just recently, I received a message that had some pointed criticism for Jenni and the numbers she shared regarding her Etsy earnings. In our conversation, Jenni breaks down why she shared the numbers that she shared and why she had to split up her shops to increase her earning potential. After our conversation, I’m confident that you’ll have a greater understanding of what to expect when it comes to building a presence on Etsy.\xa0 Don’t be afraid to test What is the best product to sell on Etsy? For each artist and seller, the answer to this question will change - especially depending on the season! While small prints will sell well for one artist - large prints will sell better for another. The key is to give yourself permission to test the market and find out what works. When it comes to selling your art - there is no one size fits all solution you’ve got to be willing to make adjustments and learn as you go. Jenni encourages artists to look around at what is selling, especially given the season.\xa0 If you build it - will they come?\xa0 Remember that old Kevin Costner movie, “Field of Dreams?” Wouldn’t it be nice if your business were as simple as setting it up and waiting for the customers to flock to your doorstep? Unfortunately - as many of you know - selling your art isn’t easy. Just like nurturing relationships with a gallery - you’ve got to nurture a relationship with your audience on platforms like Etsy. Consider sharing part of your story or starting a blog to feature artwork and projects you’ve worked on in the past.\xa0 One step at a time How do you feel about starting your Etsy store? Does it sound daunting and overwhelming? If so - you aren’t alone. There are so many artists out there who want to begin selling on Etsy and other platforms, but they don’t know where to start. I get it - I’ve been there! Don’t think that you need to have everything up and running right away - you don’t! Listen to Jenni’s advice and start one step at a time - break it down into manageable steps that you can accomplish at your own pace.

Back when I first started, there were hardly any podcasts about, by, or for artists. Today, there are a ton of options out there, and I’m happy to call many of them friends! On this episode - I decided to do something different - I sat down with a handful of fellow podcasters to answer three questions.\xa0  \xa0What is one common thread you noticed from speaking to so many artists?\xa0 What advice would you give to an emerging artist who sometimes questions their resolve?\xa0 What is the worst advice you hear given to artists?\xa0  Not surprisingly, each of my guests had varied answers that kept me engaged and curious. I can’t wait for artists like you to dig in and hear from their unique and fascinating perspectives! A common thread What would you say is the common thread that ties artists together? As I asked this question to my guests, I was encouraged by their answers. Again and again, the common thread that binds many artists’ seems to be freedom and autonomy. Each person that chooses the path of an artist will follow the call to creativity by creating their own path. I love the boldness that each of my guests tapped into when they answered this question - they weren’t afraid to get it wrong! I hope you get a lot of helpful insights from their unique perspectives and make sure to check out their podcasts. Advice for emerging artists\xa0 There are so many things that I wish I would have heard when I first started out as an artist. What are some of the tips and insights you wish you could have heard? Many of my guests stressed the value of putting in the work - and hard work at that! Too often artists get portrayed as struggling and starving or esoteric and whimsical - but what about the hard-working artist? At the end of the day - if you aren’t working hard and creating - do you really want to be an artist? Another one of my guests encouraged their peers to give yourself permission to call yourself an artist - yes, you can wear that title.\xa0 Terrible advice to avoid\xa0 Sometimes the best advice is to avoid bad advice. What are some terrible pieces of advice that people have given you over the course of your career? I can think of one person who decided that it was their calling to make sure I knew how unbelievably hard it would be to make it as an artist. Yes, it is hard to succeed as an artist, but it’s also hard to succeed as a doctor or a business leader, but we don’t go out of the way to highlight the difficulties of those professions! My guests have a ton of bad advice that you should avoid - let me know which ones resonated with you.

Have you explored the joy of painting animals and pets? Most of you know how excited I am about Trekell’s new Pet Portrait Competition. Guess what? I’ve got the judge for that competition joining me for this episode of the podcast!\xa0 Jennifer Gennari is a classically trained figurative artist. She graduated in 2005 from Ringling College of Art and Design and in 2008 left for Italy to study at the Florence Academy of Art where she spent three years abroad studying classical realism. In our conversation, Jennifer opens up about her time at the Florence Academy, how she trained herself to see colors differently, how she views commissioned paintings, and much more.\xa0 Florence Academy I don’t know about you, but for years I dreamt of attending the Florence Academy - so I jumped at the chance to get Jennifer’s insights from her time there. While she was overwhelmed by many aspects of her time at the Florence Academy - drawing was not one of them. Jennifer was able to pull from her rich childhood memory of obsessively drawing the same Disney characters over and over again. When the time came to drawing with charcoal - Jennifer was out of her element - but thankfully that didn’t last long. Looking at color differently\xa0 How did you develop your feel for using color? Did it come easy for you, or did you find the work challenging? I remember one torturous assignment I was given in school where I had to match the color of this massive collage that I had created - the result? I can now match just about any color I encounter! Jennifer’s story is a little bit different - but she also struggled with finding the right way to incorporate color into her artwork. Looking back - Jennifer notices that while the Florence Academy was great for many valuable lessons - color development wasn’t one of them. Painting animals\xa0 Some of you love painting animals and pets in particular - if that is you - you’ve got to check out Trekell’s new Pet Portrait Competition. Jennifer got started painting animals when she got tired of painting people. Still wanting to improve her skill at painting skin - Jennifer came up with a great solution - painting hairless cats! From there - Jennifer branched out and starting painting animals with fur and then she started dabbling in commissioned paintings of animals and pets. If you are interested in entering Trekell’s Pet Portrait Competition, make sure to check out the link in the resources section!\xa0 Are you a “Sell out” if you create commissioned paintings?\xa0 Speaking of commissioned paintings - what is your take? Have you created a commissioned painting? Do you feel like creating commissioned paintings is selling out? I know that many of you have strong feelings about commissioned paintings - but I’d love for you to hear Jennifer out. In her view - commissioned paintings are only as good as the joy and fulfilment you experience creating them. Creating a commissioned painting for someone who has a special connection to animal or pet is what makes the endeavour worth it. Jennifer only sees creating commissioned paintings as a “Sell out” when the artist is in it exclusively for the money.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [1:05] I introduce my guest, Jennifer Gennari.\xa0 [3:10] Jennifer shares her early artistic influences and her first career moves.\xa0 [9:20] What was it like at the Florence Academy?\xa0 [16:00] How did Jennifer train herself to see color differently?\xa0 [30:30] Jennifer talks about why she loves painting animals.\xa0 [38:00] What is Jennifer’s studio process like?\xa0 [44:40] Jennifer talks about her color pallet.\xa0 [51:20] Why does Jen always start off with warm colors?\xa0 [56:00] Commissioned paintings - is it “Selling out?” [1:04:00] What is Jennifer currently obsessed with? What is she working on?\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Alicia Rius Photography  Resources Mentioned on this episode  Jen\'s website Jen on Instagram Trekell Pet Portrait Competition Bargue Drawings Florence Academy  Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | If you are anything like me - you’ve struggled with how to deal with your inner critic over the years. There are a few things that have helped me deal with my inner critic, but I am always excited to hear what my peers have done to address this common issue in the art community. Here to share his unique and valuable perspective is the artist - Danny Gregory.\xa0 Danny is an artist, and he has written nearly a dozen internationally best-selling books on art and creativity. He is also the co-founder of Sketchbook Skool with tens of thousands of students worldwide. In our conversation, Danny opens up about how he got started as an artist, why he loves working on “Zines,” how he deals with his inner critic, what it takes to stay creative, and much more. I know you’ll get a ton of benefit from Danny’s thoughtful perspective.\xa0 Find your people! If you’ve been around the Savvy Painter community for any stretch of time, you know that I am passionate about encouraging artists like you to find your people. Let’s face it - life as an artist can be a lonely existence - but it doesn’t have to be! Even back in the ’90s, artists like Danny Gregory found a way to connect with peers who would encourage and challenge them in their creative pursuits. Discovering an artist from eastern Oregon by flipping through a “Zine” at Tower Records in New York City changed Danny’s life. He quickly befriended this artist via correspondence, and the two went on many trips together. Have you found your people yet?\xa0 Why “Zines” are so appealing Speaking of “Zines,” have you ever encountered one before? When Danny mentioned reading zines in Tower Records back in the 90’s I had a total flashback to my college years. For my millennial followers - zines or fanzines are publications produced by enthusiasts of a particular niche interest. Traditionally, zines are circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. There are so many amazing things you can do with the zine medium - and according to Danny, they are starting to make a comeback! Nurturing a creative focus\xa0 A few years ago, Danny wrote a book called “Art Before Breakfast.” I love that title by the way! His book explored several small ways he incorporated his drive for creativity each day. From keeping a sketchbook next to the kettle in the kitchen to sketching an image while waiting for his wife to finish shopping - there are a ton of helpful ideas that artists like you can use. At the heart of Danny’s message is this - you can fit creativity and art making throughout your day if you just redefine what that means. For many of you - Danny’s approach will be a bit of stretch - after all, we are conditioned to think of “Art-making” as a structured and specific time we set aside.\xa0 Dealing with the inner critic\xa0 Another book Danny wrote is called, “Shut Your Monkey: How to Control Your Inner Critic.” In this book, Danny explains how he’s dealt with and learned to live with his inner critic. Do you still struggle with silencing your inner critic? If so - I can’t recommend Danny’s book enough! He dove deep into where the inner critic comes from in our minds and how to better understand it. Danny discovered that the voice of the inner critic actually is there to protect us from making risky decisions - which is great when it comes to danger - not so great when it comes to creating art. Make sure to check out the links to Danny’s website and his books in the resources section - I know that many of you will find them helpful!\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [1:15] I introduce my guest, Danny Gregory.

Is it a sustainable model or has Facebook’s acquisition taken all fun and profitability out the platform? I put all of these questions and a lot more to my guest, Kate Zambrano.\xa0 Kate is a fine artist based in California specializing in realistic portrait art and figurative art, made up mostly of females. Sometimes described as dark art, her work is a personal study of human psychology and complexity. Kate creates melancholic body languages and expressions, capturing the nuanced truth.\xa0 I can’t wait for you to learn from Kate’s unique perspective - I know you’ll find what she has to say is knowledgeable and entertaining! Putting in the hours\xa0 Sometimes it can take a while to find that medium that you love and there are some artists like Kate who fall head over heels in love with their medium quickly. While Kate enjoys painting, she really comes alive when she uses charcoal. Kate says that charcoal fits her because of her very “Black and white” way of viewing the world. She also loves color and vibrancy, and she loves to express that when she paints but at the end of the day - charcoal is Kate’s one true love. Kate has incorporated some of the skills she developed as a painter into her work with charcoal, and you can tell!

Kate has incorporated some of the skills she developed as a painter into her work with charcoal and you can tell! Navigating Instagram\xa0 Instagram - do you love it or hate it as an artist? Have been able to grow your audience and deepen your connection to your followers? Kate enjoyed a huge boon to her business and her career as an artist once she began posting on Instagram. Quickly, Kate became quite the force as a popular artist on Instagram - then the bottom fell out. A year and a half ago, everything changed with Instagram’s algorithm - small businesses that were thriving on the platform started shutting down left and right. Since they reworked the platform, artists like Kate have noticed that their content hasn’t been getting nearly as many likes or engagement as years past. Instagram’s change has had a huge negative impact on Kate and her business. She thought the decline in support was attributed to her skill and ability as an artist. Today, Kate is doing a lot better - she found a new way forward and shifted her view of success.\xa0 Kate’s view of success What does success look like for Kate today? With all the instant validation of Instagram no longer factoring into her view of success - Kate has had to rethink her personal definition of success. Kate is now focused on maintaining a positive attitude and a healthy mindset - she believes that forward thinking and staying in-tune with her emotions will put her back on the right track. Professionally, Kate finds encouragement in the positive feedback she gets from her peers - she’s not chasing approval, but she’s grateful to get it from her friends.

How would you optimize your working area? What materials would you use? Instead of guessing the answers to this beautiful scenario - I got to ask my friend Kaethe Bealer all about it! Kaethe is a long time listener of Savvy Painter and she’s participated in several of my workshops over the years. I have been so impressed with Kaethe’s growth as an artist. From life on a boat to her process using acrylic paint I know Kaethe’s unique insights and reflections will help artists like you in a number of ways. Life on a boat Seriously though - what is it like living on a boat near San Francisco? Don’t you want to know? Apparently, it is not always as romantic as it sounds. As you can imagine space is at a premium. Forget leaving a studio space set up - if space isn’t being used - then things have to be put away. Thankfully, Kaethe has a supportive spouse who encourages her and supports her in her growth as an artist. While life on a boat sounds challenging - Kaethe also has some stellar work to show for it - which she has to store off boat at her father-in-law\'s house. Why acrylic paint? Speaking of Kaethe’s artwork - I was interested to hear what type of paint she uses on her boat and why. Kaethe uses acrylic paint and works mostly on pannel - her subject matter is all over the place - she loves to explore whatever catches her interest. With her life on the boat - Kathe has found acrylic paint to be the best material to use - it’s easy to clean up! She has a little evaporation bucket outside that she uses to discard her dirty water. Kaethe also uses Open Golden which is an extended drying acrylic paint. Just keep painting “Just keep painting” is one of the mantras that has impacted Kaethe’s on her journey as an artist. She experienced a significant period in her life where she stopped painting and it took her while to get back into the rhythm. These days Kaethe is committed to putting in the time and logging those hours at the canvas. She wants to encourage her artisitc peers to keep at it and stay in the game. Selling her work on the internet was a huge turning point for Kaethe - that experience also buoyed her spirits and emboldened her to get her work featured in art galleries. Workshop junkie Have you heard the term, “Workshop junkie?” I would consider myself a workshop junkie - I LOVE workshops. If money wasn’t a factor I’d fill up my days in workshops with fellow artists honing my skills and learning new techniques and insights. In our conversation - Kaethe and I also discussed the danger of using workshops as a crutch. Attending too many workshops can lead to thinking too little of your abilities and hamstringing your growth. Finding the balance is not an easy task but it is crucial - you need to have a healthy mindset! Outline of This Episode  [0:45] I introduce my guest, Kaethe Bealer. [3:15] What led Kaethe to her current work with acrylic paint? [5:15] Living on a boat, is it as romantic as it sounds? How does Kaethe manage it? [8:45] Kaethe describes her process and how she works with various acrylic colors. [15:30] How did Kaethe lose the “Chalky” feel of her paintings? [20:30] Kaethe and I talk about the influence of Peggi Kroll Robers. [23:30] Make sure to check out the Trekell Art Supplies competition. [25:30] Just keep painting. [30:00] Kaethe describes her evolution as an artist. [37:30] Advice Kaethe has for fellow artists. [40:30] How does Kaethe decide which art competitions to enter?

Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | I’ve got a special episode in store for you all this week including questions and answers to a few select topics. I wanted to experiment with a new format, and I’m glad to have you along for the ride! On this episode - I cover how artists like you can navigate art competitions, I give an update about my move to Argentina, and I go over some productivity tips. I’m so thankful to all of you who have been so supportive and encouraging as I’ve made the transition back to Argentina - I excited to roll out some exciting new interviews and innovative episodes like this one! How to find the right art competitions I know it might feel that way, but here is the truth - not all art competitions are shady. It is also unfair to lump them all into the same category, some art competitions will be a great fit for one artist, and they’ll be a terrible fit for others. Here are my four tips for finding the right art competitions.  Understand your goal. Do your homework. Celebrate when you get in! Just move on when you don’t get in.  You are responsible for your own career - so act like it! Don’t get upset about the cost of entering into an art competition, if you think it’s a right fit and that you have a shot then go for it. As you can tell, I’ve got a lot to say about this topic, and I know it’s not an easy one. I’d love to hear from you - what tips do you have to share about finding the right art competitions? Argentina update We did it! We’ve made it to our new home in Villa Carlos Paz in Argentina. It’s been great to hear from many of you as you’ve patiently waited to hear from me during this whole transition process. My new studio is all set up, and I am ready to jump back into my routine. One thing that is a bit of a love/hate factor of life here in Villa Carlos Paz is all the mom and pop stores. I love that I get to directly support the local economy with my purchases - I hate that it can take weeks and weeks to get something as simple as binder clips. All-in-all life is good, and I’m glad for this new chapter of life! Be kind to yourself! As an artist, you want to create worthwhile art, and that’s great! Let’s be honest - when you fail to create the stellar art you have envisioned in your mind - you let yourself have it. We are notorious at holding ourselves to such high and lofty standards that when we fail, we are our own worst critics. Self-reflection is great! Beating yourself up is not so great. Think of it this way - you wouldn’t let your friend beat themselves up - so don’t do it to the person in the mirror! I firmly believe that you cannot create from a place of frustration or negativity - if that sounds too fluffy - too bad :) Outline of This Episode  [0:15] I introduce this special question and answer episode. [2:20] My tips for navigating juried art competitions. [8:00] What is a reasonable price to expect for entering an art competition? [10:00] I give an update on my move to Argentina.

The Renaissance Society in Chicago is showing  "LaToya Ruby Frazier: The Last Cruze." The exhibition features a new body of work that focuses on the United Auto Workers members at General Motors\'s Lordstown, Ohio plant. The facility, which had produced automobiles for over 50 years, was recently "unallocated" by GM -- a term-of-art that indicates the plant has been shut down. Until recently it produced the Chevrolet Cruze. Frazier\'s pictures present members of UAW Local 1112, and tell the story of their lives and the community they\'ve built in northeastern Ohio. On September 14, the day the exhibition opened in Chicago, the UAW\'s current national contract with the Big Three automakers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- ended. The UAW instigate a strike at GM plants. It is already the longest strike against GM since 1970. LaToya Ruby Frazier is a Chicago-based artist whose work most often examines the ways in which corporations have impacted the lives of workers, their families and their communities.

The New Museum is presenting  "Lubaina Himid: Work from Underneath" through October 6. It is Himid\'s first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Lubaina Himid was a pioneer of the British Black Arts Movement of the 1980s and \'90s.

Himid\'s work has been the subject of recent solo shows at the Baltic Center for Contemporary Art and the Platt Hall Museum of Costume at the Manchester Galleries.

It features a large deity in the center of the orange and black earthenware object with a band of glyphs around the edge of the dish. This object is well-known to Maya specialists, not only for the mastery of the design, but because of the inscription that not only mentions the name and location of the donor but also explains that it was a plate used to serve white venison tamales.In this episode, we talk to four experts in the field, Gardiner Museum educator and curator Siobhan Boyd, Metropolitan Museum curator James Doyle, cultural historian Margaret Visser, and Popti storyteller Maria Monteja to peel back the layers of history in this wondrous artifact from ancient times to learn about Maya traditions and culture through the lens of today.A special thanks to SunSon for providing the music to this special series, which is produced by Hyperallergic in conjunction with the Gardiner Museum. | Joseph Pierce wants you to question everything, but especially queerness.The Cherokee citizen and Stony Brook University assistant professor believes the moment has come for queer academia to seriously question the roots of their discipline, and ask how the field can expand to include more voices outside the Euro-American canon of Judith Butlers and Jack Halberstams."When we think about queerness," Pierce explains, "it\'s seen as a universal theory that can be applied everywhere. But often what that does is maintain a framework based on coloniality and white supremacy. What we want to do is question how queerness circulates."Accordingly, the young researcher has teamed up with scholars from across the Western hemisphere to produce a special edition of GLQ, an important journal of lesbian and gay studies published by Duke University Press. The forthcoming issue intends to address the limits of queerness outside normative white contexts, and how decolonization and the schema of radical liberation might provide new context to how LGBTQ culture operates in regions like Latin America and the Global South.An erstwhile contributor to Hyperallergic, Pierce has also written a new book that will release this November, called Argentine Intimacies: Queer Kinship in an Age of Splendor, 1890–1910. The result of extensive archival research, the book is a study into Argentina\'s turn-of-the-century crisis of modernity, and how political and economic changes in the country opened up new ways of conceptualizing family.For a discussion about the relationship between queerness, decolonialiality, culture, and politics, we invited Pierce onto the Hyperallergic Art Movements podcast to share some insight into how he and other academics are trying to evolve queer studies into a more open field of inquiry.The music for this episode is available under the Creative Commons 0 license.Subscribe to Hyperallergic’s Art Movements on iTunes, and anywhere else you listen to podcasts.hyperallergic.com | There\'s a curious collection of 18th-century porcelain figurines displayed on the second floor of the Gardiner Museum. Set amidst an impressive display of European ceramic table wear and figurines, this small assortment of Harlequin sculptures don dark masks that stand out for contemporary audiences. One of the colorful sculptures is by Wenzel Neu and hails from the Kloster-Veilsdorf Porcelain Factory in Germany, c. 1764–65, and beside it is a sign that asks, "Is Harlequin in blackface?"In this episode, we talk to Professor Cheryl Thompson, anti-racist educator Rania El Mugammar, and the Gardiner\'s Chief Curator Sequoia Miller about this figurine that portrays a character from the Commedia dell\'Arte that was a precursor to the more violently racialized images of blackface in 19th and 20th-century minstrel shows.

In this episode artist Kent Monkman recounts his own youth visiting institutions that didn’t reflect the lived reality around him and his Cree community in Winnipeg.\xa0Since those formative years, Monkman has become an important voice in contemporary art who challenges the histories told inside the hallowed halls of museums, pushing them to reflect the complexity of the world around them. He is an artist who teaches us to imagine the world we want to see, one that refuses to erase the stories of pain, but instead uses them to portray the power of resilience and future possibilities.This is the first in a four-part series by Hyperallergic in conjunction with the Gardiner Museum and its Community Art Space, a platform for experimentation and socially-engaged art. The series explores the role of museums, ceramics, and the stories they tell.A special thanks to Brooklyn-based musician SunSon for providing the music to this episode, and you can check out his website sunson.band.

For that project, she recreated objects destroyed by the ISIS terrorist organization in Iraq. For that ambitious endeavor, she used the few images she could collect of the artifacts themselves and then 3D printed them in a beautiful translucent material that revealed a USB — filled with the related data — buried deep inside the new works.Her latest project, which is performance-lecture that was commissioned and presented by New Museum affiliate Rhizome, is titled Physical Tactics for Digital Colonialism, and it builds on her concept of digital colonialism in relation to the technology of 3D printing.The lecture was just released online by Rhizome, but I wanted to invite her into our Brooklyn studio to talk about the issues surrounding digital colonialism.A special thanks to Prince Harvey, who provided the music for this episode. Titled “Stay Gold” you can find more about the artist on his website at www.princeharvey.com. | What is June, really? It\'s a time for the LGBTQ community to come together and reflect on the ongoing fight for equality, even as we honor the hard-won achievements by queer activists past and present. It\'s also an opportunity to reflect on the rich creativity and diversity of our friends and chosen families.That\'s why Hyperallergic is putting a special spotlight on the queer arts community this month. Writers, philosophers, activists, illustrators, painters, sculptors, poets, filmmakers, performers, drag queens — everyone, all creative people are important beacons of hope and resilience in a time of political uncertainty. We\'ve always been devoted to using our website as a platform for historically marginalized peoples, and Pride Month is also a time to celebrate and double-down on that work.Inaugurating this effort, we invited artist and actor Cristina Pitter to share a selection of readings from her solo performance, Decolonizing the Color of Queerness on our Hyperallergic Art Movements podcast. It\'s something of a paean to self-discovery that weaves its way toward self-actualization through histories of hardship and episodes of revelation — something every queer person can relate to. The music in this episode is generously provided by the composer Serena Ebony Miller.This episode is part of our "2019 Pride in Art" series, which is sponsored by Swann Auction Galleries who are running their "Pride Sale," a curated auction of material related to the LGBTQ experience and the gay rights movement on June 20, 2019 at their location at 104 East 25th Street in Manhattan.This episode is sponsored by Swann Auction Galleries.Swann’s first ever "Pride Sale," a curated auction of material related to the LGBTQ+ experience and the gay rights movement, takes place on June 20, 2019.

Harris get together, sparks fly. Wolfson’s art confronts intimacy, violence, and desire with sometimes shocking honesty. Likewise, O. Harris, whose buzzed-about and radical Slave Play comes to Broadway this fall, uses music and bodies to complicate themes of violence and sex—and perhaps most powerfully of all, race and history. O. Harris is able to dip in and out of absurdity even at his most serious, something that Wolfson has also mastered in his mysterious narratives. Here, they debate and cover everything from suppression and transgression, sexuality, Lady Gaga, porn, and more.Get tickets to Jeremy O.

In this first episode we discuss his background in Norwich and his studies at the Courtauld Institute under Nikolaus Pevsner, where he wrote his PhD on the history of the modern movement. We then consider his involvement with 'The Independent Group' at the Institute of Contemporary Art, his support for the 'New Brutalism' of Alison and Peter Smithson, and his role in British architectural culture.Central to the development of Banham's project was his obsession with technology and his growing fascination with the potentials of American consumerism and the ways it might change architecture. We conclude with his ecstatic vision of the mechanical pudenda of technological architecture, in his first visits to America and his plastic bag homes.Here are the key Banham texts we discussed in this episode:PhD thesis (later to be published as Theory and Design in the First Machine Age)'School at Hunstanton, Norfolk' Architectural Review, September 1954'The Machine Aesthetic' Architectural Review, April 1955'Vehicles of Desire'  Art, September 1955'The New Brutalism' Architectural Review, December 1955Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, 1960'The History of the Immediate Future' RIBA Journal, May 1961'What Architecture of Technology?'

We discuss Prince Charles' architectural interventions and the theories of our future king's favourite architect, Leon Krier (and Krier's problematic fave, Albert Speer). We also dive into the hotbed of Trad theorising, Peterhouse College Cambridge, and its two favourite sons, architectural historian David Watkin and philosopher Roger Scruton. We explore the framing of traditionalist theory against modernist hegemony, and ask if the architectural consensus of the 21st century is a bit more Trad than some advocates would admit.We also dip our toes into the culture war, and ask questions about the political connotations of architectural style in the age of social media. Is an obsession with style actually holding us back from confronting the real social, economic and political problems that ail the city? Ultimately, we lament the destruction of good architecture of any style, with a poignant reflection on the proposed fate of the Aton Estate in RoehamptonEdited by Matthew Lloyd Roberts.

Modernism became the hegemonic architectural and urbanist mode in England during this period, and we examine those who rejected the consensus, and sought to continue the retreat into the past, designing architecture that occasionally verges on Caesar's Palace, without any of the fun.In this episode, we discuss Raymond Erith, the traditionalist architect who restored Number 10 Downing Street in the 1960s. We go on to discuss his pupil, Quinlan Terry, whose Richmond Riverside Development we went to visit and recorded our observations in situ. Their stodgy, and often unsuccessful attempts to revive and reconjure a classical vernacular expresses a political and ideological agenda that we attempt to unpack, and will go on to discuss in our final episode on the Reactionaries.

We'd love to meet you!Modernist Architecture has always had more than its fair share of critics. In this episode, the first of a two parter, we discuss the reactionary, counter-revolutionary opposition to modernism in Britain during the interwar period. First, comes an examination of the stodgy, flag-waving, imperialist Classicism of the Edwardian era, which Luke thinks includes some of the worst architecture in Britain. One of the perpetrators of that style, Reginald Blomfield, wrote a patriotic screed against the continental, ‘cosmopolitan’ Modern architecture, which he subtly titled ‘Modernismus.’ We also examine Lutyens’ review of ‘Towards a New Architecture,’ a critique of Corbusier’s theory, but also a refutation of modernism as an appropriate style for living in. Lastly we consider the slightly outlandish ‘England and the Octopus’ by the eccentric architect Clough William Ellis, famous for designing the town sized folly of Portmeirion in North Wales. Fruity characters, problematic tropes and anxiety about a declining Empire abound.In the bonus episode we will discuss the Evelyn Waugh's 'Decline and Fall.'This episode is sponsored by The Article Trade Program.Edited by Matthew Lloyd Roberts.

If you’ve only ever heard of one manga, it’s probably this one. We’ve been reading the definitive  black and white version — worth getting hold of if you can.  Actually we didn’t even get to start talking about the book proper because we went on about context too long. We talked a bit about the earlier works ‘Fireball’ and ‘Domu’, the documentary ’God Speed You Black Emperor’, manga as a genre, and a load of other stuff.

Vast, white, monumental and enigmatically detailed, the Hawksmoor churches are a looming and mysterious presence in the architectural consciousness and mythic history of London, somehow both of time and out of it. Bombed, burned, spurned by popular taste before they were even completed, they have nevertheless survived to become objects of fascination, speculation and obsession. Created on the threshold of modernity, they reach back toward an imagined (and distant) past when the Church was young, and the worship was pure. We’ve recorded a series of observations of the churches on site, and attempted to locate them in the world of early 18th century England. On a forthcoming bonus we’ll be exploring the fictional Hawksmoor — as time-magician, cabbalist, summoner of Egyptian gods and more.

Russell & Robert meet Vik Muniz, the superstar Brazilian artist best-known for his complex photography made with a diverse range of materials including sugar, toys, diamonds and even trash to recreate and interpret famous images, such as the \'Mona Lisa\' (which he executed in peanut butter and jelly), or a Picasso (created entirely with raw paint pigment). Muniz taps into our collective memory of known and recognisable images and artworks. With a wry and canny combination of high and low, Muniz uses the photograph not in the traditional sense, as a recording of reality, but instead as a document of his illusion. Recorded live in front of an audience at Soho House Greek Street, we discuss his new Ruinart collaboration \'Shared Roots\' on display this week at Frieze Art Fair in London. As well as looking back to his childhood dyslexia, drawing cartoon clouds in the Manhattan sky and his legendary \'Verso\' series in which Muniz recreates the back panels of world famous paintings like Van Gogh’s \'Starry Night\' or Vermeer’s \'The Girl with a Pearl Earring\'.\xa0We discover why he decided to work with photography following a life-changing shooting which led to him moving to New York to become an artist.

Russell & Robert visit NYC to meet gallerist Jasmin Tsou (JTT Gallery). We discover why she set up her Lower East Side gallery in 2012, initially exhibiting her peers, but soon expanding her program to include emerging artists in a climate that she describes as ‘scary and intimidating.’ Tsou has a very collaborative approach: ongoing conversations with colleagues have shaped JTT’s program and remain at the heart of her activity as a gallerist. We explore the work of her artists Marlon Mullen, Diane Simpson, Issy Wood, Jamian Juliano-Villani & Borna Sammak.

For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Russell & Robert meet artist Wong Ping at Camden Arts Centre, London for a special tour around his solo exhibition \'Heart Digger\'. Wong Ping creates digital and sculptural works that reveal very human, often universal fantasies, through absurd narratives. Drawing from his own social encounters, he elaborates his stories into dark humorous tales that touch on political and cultural anxieties. Digitally rendered in a seductive technicolour language, they recall the modernism of Fernand Leger, the pop language of Tom Wesselman or Allen Jones, and the design aesthetic of The Memphis Group and early 1980s video games. These simple but seductive animations also disguise a deeper critique of technology.Wong Ping is the inaugural recipient of Camden Art Centre’s new Emerging Artist Prize at Frieze (2018). The Prize was established in collaboration with Frieze Art Fair, as part of Camden Arts Centre’s commitment to nurturing and celebrating the most innovative artists of the moment, who have yet to receive the recognition their work deserves. The annual prize awards an artist exhibiting in the Focus section of Frieze London with an exhibition at Camden Art Centre.

We learn how he has been addressing the challenge of bringing art to as many people as possible (including a notable recent collaboration with Arthur Jafa) as well as his early interest of bringing together art & science, the legacy of curator Lucy Lippard, of caring for the environment and the importance of taking ecology to the centre stage.

to you from Europe today but before we begin this episode, go download the FREE GUIDE TO SELL YOUR OWN WORK.“How to Sell Art Online”https://www.emilyjeffords.com/howtosellartThis guide is going to make the whole process of bringing your work to the world clear and inspiring. \xa0Two weeks ago we talked about ways to create authentic art that is pure and from YOUR inspiration \xa0\xa0Before we dive into this too far, we need to lay a foundation:\xa0 EVERYTHING IS A REMIXEverything builds on something that came before.Acknowledge the massive amount of inspiration that went into the formation, creation, and execution of your own work.You and I are part of a long, long lineage of artists building on ideas and working within mediums.What an honor!\xa0\xa0Thoughts travel at the speed of light in our connected worldIf your ideas are good, and if you share them (which you should) they WILL travel around at lightning speed and they WILL inspire others.\xa0If your ideas are resonating with you, chances are they will also resonate with something else\xa0This often leads to purchases and buyers and collectorsBut it can (and probably will) mean that you also inspire other creatives.\xa0THIS IS A GOOD THING\xa0In order to make any measurable impact on the creative landscape your work WILL impact others\xa0We’re all inspiring each other all the time, and if that includes you and your work, it means your doing something really meaningful.\xa0The collective unconscious has become the collective CONSCIOUS as we become more and more interconnected\xa0\xa0Ok, but don’t miss hear me:I’m not saying “if people copy your work you should be thrilled!”\xa0 No…. not exactly.\xa0\xa0As the creator of your work you are also in charge of protecting your work.\xa0This is not an act of selfishness or fear.This is an act of valuing and honoring your work and asking others to do the same.\xa0\xa0Don’t hide your work feel the need to keep it behind a tall wall.\xa0 The energy in your work wants to be shared.\xa0 It wants to be seen and loved and a source of light to others.\xa0Keeping it behind closed doors or hiding it behind a giant watermarked image doesn’t allow it to sing.\xa0\xa0\xa0If you don’t stand up for the integrity of your work who will?If you don’t preserve the value and preciousness of your work then who will?Especially if you are a fine artist or an independent designer… the value of your work is your lifeline - and by proxy, your creative work’s lifeline (if you feel stolen from and abused your work suffers most of all).\xa0Innovate.\xa0 Always.\xa0In the episode, we talk about practical ways to talk with people who are "copying" your work -- give it a listen if this is a subject that impacts your work.\xa0\xa0XOEmily Jeffords\xa0\xa0\xa0 | Having been in the creative world for quite a few years with a pretty wide audience, I\'ve had the "honor" (lol) of having my work copied many, many times.\xa0\xa0In this episode, I get into why copying someone\'s work is harmful to not only the original artist but also for the person who is being heavily inspired.\xa0\xa0We also get into mental shifts and practical tips for creating good, authentic, ORIGINAL art that is going to help your work thrive.\xa0 Creating work you are proud of and that speaks from your point of view and personal aesthetic leads to great success in your career.\xa0\xa0This topic is sensitive, and I want to approach it with love and understanding, but I also want our industry to grow and improve, and the only way we can do that is by exposing our wounds and allowing them to heal.\xa0Keep creating good work.\xa0 XO\xa0Learn more about Emily Jeffords:

A group of artists, architects, scientists, critics, and collectors sympathetic to Ruskin’s ideas formed the Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, which sought reform not only in artistic practices, but also in the broader political arena. In a paired lecture delivered at the National Gallery of Art on June 16, 2019, Sophie Lynford and Diane Waggoner described further what Lynford has called the American Pre-Raphaelites’ “comprehensive, multipronged agenda.” By looking beyond painting to the group’s ideas about architecture and photography, Lynford and Waggoner more fully illustrated the philosophy of the American Pre-Raphaelites, whose search for truth had both pictorial and moral stakes. | Ken Burns, filmmaker, in conversation with David M. Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, trustee of the National Gallery of Art, and chairman of the Smithsonian Institution In documentaries such as The Civil War, Baseball, Jazz, and The West, filmmaker Ken Burns has spent 40 years investigating American history and culture. His films tell the American story not only in terms of victories and major historical flashpoints, but also through the lives of individuals and relationships. Burns’s films have been honored with dozens of major awards, including 16 Emmy Awards, 2 Grammy Awards, and 2 Oscar nominations; in September 2008, he was honored by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The National Gallery of Art, in collaboration with the Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE), hosted Burns for a conversation with David Rubenstein on April 28, 2019. | Paul Carter Harrison, playwright and expert in African American theatre, and Quincy Troupe, poet, in conversation with Harry Cooper, senior curator and head of modern art, National Gallery of Art American painter, printmaker, and sculptor Oliver Lee Jackson (b. 1935) has created a complex body of work which masterfully weaves together visual influences ranging from the Renaissance to modernism with principles of rhythm and improvisation drawn from his study of African cultures and American jazz. In a paired talk on May 19, 2019 at the National Gallery of Art, Paul Carter Harrison and Quincy Troupe, both writers and friends of Jackson, discussed their parallel pursuits of new avenues for creative thought and action. Harrison shared anecdotes from late-night studio discussions with Jackson, along with explanations of Jackson’s understanding of how his heritage factors into his work. Troupe read from his poetry and talked about the social and artistic environment in St. Louis, Missouri, that produced jazz musicians Miles Davis and Julius Hemphill, as well as the Black Arts Group that supported Jackson’s early work. Harrison and Troupe were then joined by curator Harry Cooper for a brief conversation. | David Gariff, senior lecturer, National Gallery of Art. The First World War, known as the Great War, was also the first modern war, claiming millions of lives, in part, by newly invented weapons such as the machine gun, tank, aircraft, and poison gas. The arts of the period present a portrait of the terrible price paid by humanity—the carnage and suffering caused by the war were documented in paintings, sculptures, novels, memoirs, and poems produced both during, and immediately after, the struggle. In this presentation on March 27, 2019, senior lecturer David Gariff explores the responses of artists and writers to the trauma of the First World War, which transcended national boundaries. Paintings, sculptures, and prints by Otto Dix, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Käthe Kollwitz, Fernand Léger, John Singer Sargent, and Natalija Goncharova; poems by Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, and Anna Akhmatova; and memoirs and novels by Ernest Hemingway, Erich Maria Remarque, and Robert Graves are discussed against the backdrop of “the war to end all wars.” | John Hobson, staff assistant, department of special projects, National Gallery of Art The study of Slovene photography has remained intertwined with the medium’s specific relation to pan-Yugoslavian artistic development, generally focusing on the period between 1945 and 1991. In celebration of the National Day of Slovenia, John Hobson expands the current understanding of the development of photography in the Slovene region, breaking from the Yugocentric narrative to present his research on the breadth and complexity of twentieth-century photography created by Slovenians. In this lecture at the National Gallery of Art on June 3, 2019, Hobson discusses the creation of photographic conventions and traditions, as well as transgressions against them, across the twentieth century. | Jeffreen M. Hayes, executive director, Threewalls An outstanding sculptor associated with the intellectual and cultural awakening known as the Harlem Renaissance, Augusta Savage (1892-1962) overcame poverty, racism, and sexual discrimination in pursuit of her goals. Creating new visions of black identity in her work, she was also an activist, campaigning for equal rights for African Americans in the arts. The traveling exhibition Augusta Savage: Renaissance Woman and its accompanying catalog is the first to reassess Savage’s contributions to art and cultural history in light of 21st-century attention to the concept of the artist-activist. The exhibition viewing dates are as follows: the Cummer Museum of Art, October 12, 2018-April 7, 2019; the New York Historical Society, May 3–July 28, 2019; the Palmer Museum of Art, Pennsylvania State University, August 24–December 8, 2019; and the Dixon Gallery and Gardens, January 19–March 22, 2020. The groundbreaking catalog features illustrations of more than 40 works by Savage, her students, and her contemporaries, archival letters, rarely seen photographs, and an extensive bibliography and essays by Kirsten Pai Buick, Bridget R. Cooks, and Howard Dodson. In celebration of the Washington, DC, book launch on June 23, 2019, exhibition organizer Jeffreen M. Hayes discusses the life, work, and lasting legacy of Savage as an artist and a community builder. This program was proposed and made possible by Darryl Atwell. | Kristen Gonzalez, department of northern baroque paintings, National Gallery of Art Jacobus Vrel is not exactly a household name. A painter of quiet Dutch genre scenes, he produced some fifty works and quickly fell into obscurity. Composing modest interiors and street scenes, Vrel’s mature paintings predate those of the most celebrated Dutch masters in the 17th century. In fact, many of his works were misattributed to Johannes Vermeer. In this lecture held on April 22, 2019, Kristen Gonzalez discusses the Gallery’s Young Woman in an Interior by Jacobus Vrel and the striking modernity of his genre paintings. In anticipation of a major retrospective exhibition in Munich, Paris, and the Hague next year, Kristen discusses the challenge of studying the enigmatic Vrel and establishing his artistic identity distinct from Vermeer and his contemporaries. | Lorena Bradford, accessible programs, department of education, National Gallery of Art Since it opened to the public in 1978, the East Building has been recognized as one of the National Gallery of Art’s most prized masterpieces. The passing of the building’s architect, I.M. Pei (1917–2019), invited a new look at his building projects around the globe. In a talk given on July 7, 2019, Lorena Bradford situates the commission of the East Building within the context of Pei’s blossoming career and shares some of the challenges Pei and his team faced in developing the final, inspired design. Bradford analyzes the responses of critics, fellow architects, and the public to the East Building both before the completed structure was unveiled and after it opened in 1978, concluding with reflections on Pei’s legacy. | David Gariff, senior lecturer, National Gallery of Art. David Smith (1906–1965) is arguably America’s greatest sculptor of the 20th century. His art enlarged the vocabulary of sculpture by employing welding and industrial processes and materials, laying the groundwork for the directness of minimalism and the realization that sculpture could be anything the artist desired. Smith’s oeuvre is a logical outgrowth of earlier 20th-century sculptural trends in cubism, constructivism, and surrealism. However, his work also represents a new paradigm for the language of modern sculpture that reflects the dynamic growth and industrial prowess of the United States after the Second World War. Smith’s confrontation with the process of creation broke the rules and expanded the possibilities of his art form. In part two of this lecture, presented at the National Gallery of Art on March 7, 2019, senior lecturer David Gariff explores Smith’s revolutionary art through a discussion of some of his most important and innovative works, including the Agricola, Tanktotem, Sentinel, Zig, Voltri, and Cubi series. | David Gariff, senior lecturer, National Gallery of Art.

And acquisitions have actually declined since 2009, according to a major new study “Women\'s Place in the Art World: Why Recent Advancements for Female Artists Are Largely an Illusion ” produced by\xa0In Other Words\xa0and\xa0artnet News. The report found that there has been no progress in museum acquisitions, and that just 14% of exhibitions were of work by female artists. The auction market for work by women doubled, but still only represents 2% of the global total—with just five female artists (Yayoi Kusama, Joan Mitchell, Louise Bourgeois, Georgia O\'Keeffe and Agnes Martin) accounting for 40.7% of that total.

Hollein discusses the distinct role he believes the Met can play in terms of contemporary art, and gives an update on recently-stalled plans for a $600m Modern and contemporary wing—part of more than $1bn the museum is slated to spend on renovations and expansions. In a week in which the Met returned to Egypt an ancient gilded coffin that had been the centerpiece of the exhibition “Nedjemankh and His Gilded Coffin”—but which prosecutors deemed to have been looted, Hollein talks about how the Met is tackling the fraught issue of cultural repatriation. He talks about the museum as a platform for debates: from the morality of where money comes from to diversity in programing and governance. \xa0\xa0 For this and much more—including what success looks like to Hollein—tune in today.

He has described the fraught political process of designing the prize-winning National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in Washington, D.C. in 2016, as eight years of pain. But “these buildings are long overdue,” Adjaye says, “There’s a language they need to bring, which is about the reality rather than the fiction of nation imagery.” In this podcast with Amy Cappellazzo (co-founder of AAP and a chairman of Sotheby\'s) and host Charlotte Burns (executive editor,\xa0In Other Words), Adjaye—who has designed the forthcoming expansion of the Studio Museum as well as the plans for the National Cathedral of Ghana—talks about how space can change the way we think about our own histories. “We’ve all been numbed into never dealing with big questions,” he says, asking: “Then what the hell are we all doing here?” For this and more, tune in today.

There\'s definitely a ‘too big’ possible.” In conversation with Allan Schwartzman (co-founder of AAP and a chairman of Sotheby\'s) and our host Charlotte Burns (executive editor,\xa0In Other Words), Zwirner discusses the future of the business and the state of the market—and talks about what he is looking for in the next generation of artists.

He shifted the conversation. That\'s why we\'re still grappling with him. Love him or hate him,” says Donna De Salvo, the senior curator and deputy director for International Initiatives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, who recently organized the blockbuster exhibition "Andy Warhol—From A to B and Back Again" (on show now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, until 2 September). Beyond the glamour of the celebrity and consumerism so often associated with Warhol, there is something destabilizing about his work, says Dominique Lévy, the co-founder of Lévy Gorvy—which is showing “Warhol Women” in New York (until 15 June). “If you spend enough time in front of a Warhol painting, little by little it unnerves you,” Lévy says. When people fetishize the trophy of the Marilyn, they\'re missing a certain point of the way that Warhol is constantly disrupting,” De Salvo says: “Whether it\'s the off registration of the screen, through the color, through the scale, the multiplicity of images. He\'s not about a fixed image. He\'s actually quite the opposite and that gets to issues of identity.” Together with host Charlotte Burns, Lévy and De Salvo discuss the radical aspects of Warhol\'s work, discussing how much of it is still undervalued and under-appreciated—particularly drawings from the 1950s and works from the 1970s and 1980s. “He reinvents himself and becomes more and more conceptual, and more and more relevant,” Lévy says. “His project ends because he dies,” De Salvo says: "He was just getting going again." Ultimately, she says, Warhol “reflected these twin American desires, which are at odds: our desire to innovate and our desire to conform.” For this and more, tune in today.

Taking different approaches, Hudson and Bröcker Wieder are both interested in what a more equitable art world would look like and both are invested in community and collaboration.\xa0 The dialogue on democracy, community, tech and collaboration closes with a call for openness. “I see a big role for institutions reclaiming this territory of culture,” Hudson says: “How we shape and create our culture as being above and beyond politics and economics.” Tune in today for more.

On today’s show, the legendary dealer talks about the history and future of her gallery together with Steven Henry, who has been the gallery director for more than two decades, Allan Schwartzman, co-founder of Art Agency, Partners, and host Charlotte Burns. Known for her eye, Cooper has represented some of the most important international contemporary artists of the past half-century. “Artists will give her the best shows, the best work,” says Henry. The gallery has remained a leader of the pack throughout the past 50 years, despite seismic shifts in the art world and market. Nowadays, “it’s this huge international money world,” says Cooper, who also discusses new styles of collecting and the impact of politics on the art world. She also talks about the future: “I really have to think about not being here, now at this point," she says. Ultimately, the legacy of the gallery will be the artists it has supported, she says: “The gallery will be forgotten.

It started coming down hard just as I entered SNP east and just after they closed the park.

After many more trips, Bazan finally moved to Cuba in 1997, documenting daily life, raising a family, and teaching photography classes during the "Special Period." Bazan\'s images document the country\'s socioeconomic crisis and the tensions between rich and poor after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of its financial support. He captured the Cuban people\'s despair and hopelessness as well as their joy, resilience, and dignity of his neighbors. This fourteen-year project--awarded a W. Eugene Smith Fund Award for Humanist Photography--documents the island\'s struggle to maintain its socialist identity in a post-communist world. \xa0 Photographer Links:\xa0 Ernesto Bazan  Robert Frank Barbara Peacock \xa0 Education Resources:  Tokyo: Explorations in the Metropolis with Ibarionex Perello & George Nobechi Momenta Photographic Workshops \xa0 Candid Frame Resources The Candid Frame Newsletter  The Candid Frame Alexa Skill  Lessons from the Street eBook by Ibarionex  Making Photographs: Developing a Personal Visual Workflow The Candid Frame Flickr Pool  The Candid Frame YouTube Channel \xa0 Download the free Candid Frame app for your favorite smart device.

Solomon, being half Japanese and half Caucasian, is interested in the idea of hybridization and mixed media work. Her work revolves around themes of domesticity, craft, and archetypes of masculinity and femininity.

Her drawings and installations have been featured at numerous national and international venues.

Simple compositions depicting singular moments and objects, within a shallow pictorial space, allow Reimus to freely explore her interests in formalism, geometry and abstraction. Thoughtful investigations regarding tactility and surface often lead to experiments with media closely associated with domesticity and the feminine--\xa0\xa0glitter, gold leaf, flocking fibers, textiles and spray paint.\xa0   Reimus\'s work has been featured in numerous exhibitions and publications throughout the United States. Recent solo and two-person exhibitions include Tiger Strikes Asteroid (Chicago, IL), Knox College (Galesburg, IL), and The Mission (Chicago, IL). Recent group exhibitions include Left Field Gallery (Los Osos, CA), Kirk Hopper Fine Art (Dallas, TX), Platform Gallery (Baltimore, MD) and No Place Gallery (Columbus, OH).\xa0Her work has been included in ArtMaze Mag, Maake Magazine and New American Paintings\xa0(#88, #113, #125), where she was highlighted as both an "Editor\'s Selection" and a "Noteworthy Artist."\xa0Reviews include The Boston Globe, The Washington Post and NPR. Upcoming exhibitions include Left Field Gallery (Los Osos, CA) and Massey Klein Gallery (New York, NY).   \xa0   In this episode, Allison and I dive into her background, and how growing up in Michigan shaped who she is as a driven artist. We discuss her process within her work and how we were both told not to have children in order to have a career in the arts. This conversation sheds light on how women are told to live their life which we are currently seeing in politics with the challenge to Roe vs Wade. Predominantly white men are telling women what to do with their bodies.

Daisy is so easy to talk to and incredibly sharp, it was a blast to record this with her. In this episode we talk about getting out of grad school, changing mediums, death, photography, painting, treating yourself and a ton of other great topics! I felt like I was hanging out with my painting BFF. From Los Angeles, California, Daisy Patton moved back and forth between Oklahoma and California during her childhood. She spent much of her early years reading adventure and detective tales, history and art history books, and ghost stories. Patton’s practice is focused on history, memory, and social commentary stemming from this youth soaked in such specific cultural landscapes. Her work explores the meaning and social conventions of families, little discussed or hidden histories, and what it is to be a person living in our contemporary world. One such series is Forgetting is so long, reviewed in Hyperallergic and The Denver Post, as well as featured in Create! Magazine, The Jealous Curator, Vasari21, Fraction Magazine, Full Blede, and Backroom Caracas.   \xa0   Currently residing in Seattle, Washington, Patton has a BFA in Studio Arts from the University of Oklahoma with minors in History and Art History and an Honors degree. Her MFA is from The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Tufts University, a multi-disciplinary program. Patton received the Montague Travel Grant for research in Dresden, Germany, and she was also awarded a position as an exchange student at the University of Hertfordshire, UK while an undergraduate. Patton has completed artist residencies at Minerva Projects, Anderson Ranch, the Studios at MASS MoCA, RedLine Denver, and Eastside International in Los Angeles. She has exhibited in solo and group shows nationally, including her first museum solo at the CU Art Museum at the University of Colorado. K Contemporary represents Patton in Denver.   \xa0   LINKS:   \xa0   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/791098.A_Gentle_Madness   \xa0   http://daisypatton.com/   \xa0   https://www.instagram.com/daisy_patton/   \xa0 | FATE Conference 2019 "The Secret Handshake" \xa0  Abstract: The mysterious inner workings of academia, museum and gallery systems, and granting agencies are not always evident to individuals who desire to work with/in them. If only we had insight into what the hiring committee/ granting agency/ juries were thinking, we could customize our submissions materials to be most appropriate. We all know that we need to have sharp images and equally strong written content, but what are the more nuanced things that we should be taking into consideration? This panel invites individuals who have been on search committees, juries, or other relevant committees who will share their experience and insider knowledge of the selection process. Also, it invites individuals who have found successful ways of navigating these systems from the outside from managing their academic career to finding and creating exhibition opportunities. Sometimes it seems like you need to know the secret handshake to be successful in academia and the arts; this panel seeks to let people in on the secret.\xa0 \xa0 Panelists: "The Successful Candidate: Two Perspectives on the Tenure-Track Faculty Search Process" Amy Broderick, Florida Atlantic University Corey Lamb, Florida Atlantic University \xa0 "Giving It the Ol\' College Try" Jessica Burke, University of North Carolina Charlotte \xa0 "Finding the Candidate that Fits the Glass Slipper" Kathy Liao, Missouri Western State University  |  John Bokor is an Australian artist.

Her work discusses real events, embracing complex and innovative visual strategies that utilise both traditional documentary techniques and more contemporary and conceptually rigorous forms of representation. Barnard connects her interest in aesthetics, current photographic debates around materiality, and the existing political climate. Of particular interest to her is global capitalism, the relationship between the military industrial complex, screen based new technologies and the psychological implication of conflict.Lisa is an Associate Professor in photography and programme leader of the MA in Documentary Photography at The University of South Wales, where she also has PhD students and teaches on the BA in Documentary Photography course. She has published two monographs with GOST books: Chateau Despairand Hyenas of the Battlefield, Machines in the Garden which was funded by the Albert Renger Patzsch Book Award, and nominated for the Prix Du Livre at Rencontres D’Arles in 2015.Lisa’s latest book, recently published by Mack, is The Canary and the Hammer, an ambitious, complex and wide-ranging project detailing our reverence for gold and its role in humanity’s ruthless pursuit of progress.

He recently became the first photographer ever (probably) to have an exhibition of wedding photography in a ‘proper’ gallery, with a show at the Martin Parr Foundation in Bristol, England. He also produced a book to coincide with the show, publishhed by RRB PhotoBooks and entitiled, of course, “I Am Not a Wedding Photographer.”Partly as a result of the show, Ian has subsequently had a lot of press coverage in major outlets including the BBC, The Guardian, i-D.Vice, Creative Review, Huck Magazine and It’s Nice That. He has 18.2K folllowers on Instagram. Which is a lot.Ian also hosts and produces the second best UK-based photography podcast: Outerfocus, in which he talks to photographers about their work and whatever else comes up. (My appearance, for what it’s worth, is here.)On episode 113, Ian discusses, among other things:His solo show at the Martin Parr FoundationBeing taken into care as a young childHis time in the army……and going a bit nuts on drink and drugs after leavingHow photography saved his lifeGetting into shooting weddingsHow his ethos evolvedHis podcast, OuterfocusBeing offered a very personal commission from Martin ParrReferenced:Martin Parr (Ep 91.)Helen LevittBruce Gilden (Ep 84.)Richard AvedonDon McCullinWebsite | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | Podcast“Photographing granny on the dance floor with two pints of lager in her hand purposely is different to recognising something that you connect with and photograph.

I just want people to get what I do and when people get that, then great, we’re on.” | Mark Steinmetz is an American photographer who makes black and white photographs "of ordinary people in the ordinary landscapes they inhabit” and "in the midst of activity”. His work is held in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hunter Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York Museum of Contemporary Photography, to name but a few. He is the recipient of numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship and his work has been exhibited in too many major museums and art galleries to list. He has produced 15 photobooks, such as South Central (2007), The Players (2015), Fifteen Miles to K-Ville (2015) and the Angel City West trilogy.Mark was born in New York City and raised in the Boston-area suburbs until he was 12 at which point he moved to the midwest. At age 21 he moved to New England to study photography at Yale School of Art in New Haven, Connecticut. He left that MFA program after one semester and in mid 1983, aged 22, moved to Los Angeles in search of the photographer Garry Winogrand, whom he befriended. In 1999 he moved to Athens, Georgia where he still lives, with his wife, photographer Irina Rozovsky, and their young daughter.On episode 112, Mark discusses, among other things:Delving into the archiveAngel City WestFirst darkroom in IowaGoing to L.A. and meeting WinograndEarning a livingMOMA showBring drawn to The South and shooting thereWhy he works in B&WHis aesthetic and why he still prints his own workMeditation and avoiding distractionsReferenced:Henry WesselGarry WinograndRobert FrankWalker EvansDavid M.

He joined Magnum Photos as a nominee in 2014 and is currently an Associate member. His work has been shown in solo exhibitions in London and in Kolkata, India.Sohrab was born in West Bengal and attended India’s most highly regarded boys boarding school, The Doon School, in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. He has a masters degree in economics from the University of Delhi and began making photographs during college with a Nikon FM10 given to him by his father.His self-published trilogy Sweet Life comprises the books Life is Elsewhere (2015), A Proposition for Departure (2017) and Look It\'s Getting Sunny Outside!!! (2018). The latter was shortlisted for Photobook of the Year in the  Paris Photo–Aperture Foundation PhotoBook Awards. The trilogy focuses on Sohrab’s relationship with his mother, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1999, when he was 17 years old.In 2011 the British Journal of Photography included Sohrab in its Ones to Watch list. Sean O\'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, included Hura\'s The Lost Head and the Bird exhibition in his "The top 10 photography exhibitions of 2017" describing it as “overwhelming, disorienting and utterly unforgettable.”Sohrab’s fourth book, The Coast, was self-published in 2018 under his own Ugly Dog inprint and has been met with critical acclaim.On episode 110, Sohrab discusses, among other things:How misunderstanding the instructions for are grant led to something interestingFeeling like he’s full of accidents and going with the flowSeeking instablilityPhotography as therapy in response to his mum’s illness - the Sweet Life trilogyBoundaryless journeys, animals and birdsStaying in Magnum by the skin of his teethHow he visualises his work as a treeHis latest book, The CoastPiece on Magnum websiteDiscussion with Colin Pantall on Magnum WebsiteWebsite | Instagram (Ugly Dog books)“For me, photography is just an excuse to insert myself into situations or spaces and to respond to those situations and spaces and to see what my relationship is with that.” | American photographer Ed Panar has a BA from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and an MFA from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. He has published several photobooks including: In the Vicinity  (Deadbeat Club, 2018), Animals That Saw Me Volume One and Volume Two (2011 and 2016, The Ice Plant), Nothing Changes If Nothing Changes (Spaces Corners & The Ice Plant, 2013), Salad Days (2012 Gottlund), Same Difference (2010, Gottlund), and Golden Palms (2007, J&L Books).Ed “is a compiler of small moments, a celebrant of the everyday. Nothing dramatic happens in his photographs; nowhere exotic is shown. Rather, his prosaic images force us into a sustained encounter with the ordinariness of urban life, bringing together both meanings of the word pedestrian. In his ongoing body of work Out West, Panar reveals the fluidity of the interaction between the banal and the beautiful. (Panar also has a series, Back East, that produces a similar effect.) Some of the photos do indeed display the striking beauty of Western landscapes, but even this is contained within the bounds of ordinary life: Panar’s views are the kind you might have walking home from somewhere not far away, if you were to take that little detour that goes up the hill just a bit. We are a long way here from the majestic waterfalls and granite domes in Ansel Adams’s work. Panar’s photos seem to be saying that if we pay attention there is no need to venture far and wide, to scale the peaks or traverse the wilds — that something of value is just around the next corner.” (Aaron Rothman)Ed’s photographs have been widely exhibited at venues including The Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago, The New York Photography Festival, the Cleveland Museum of Art and Pier 24 Photography in San Francisco. Ed is co-founder - with his partner, photographer Melissa Catanese - of the project space and photography bookshop Spaces Corners, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he currently lives and works.On episode 109, Ed discusses, among other things:Learning from Todd Hido in San FranciscoFiguring out how to keep going no matter whatWalking Home - his first series, still not a bookGolden PalmsThe importance of editing and how it starts while shootingAnimals That Saw Me Volume One and Volume TwoHis interest in speculative realismThe importance of walking… and humourIn the Vicinity HIs project space in Pittsburgh, Spaces CornersReferenced:Todd HidoChris McCallWolfgang Tillmans (Burg)Nick WaplingtonWilliam EgglestonClint WoodsideWebsite | Instagram | Spaces Corners“If I’ve figured anything out it’s how to kinda keep going no matter what. And I think maybe Todd [Hido] instilled that in me, that sort of work ethic. You have to get it done. You have to find a way. Make things now, ask questions later, kind of thing.” | Irina Rozovsky was born in Moscow, Russia, and grew up in the USA, having moved there with her parents at the age of seven. Irina makes photographs of people and places, transforming external landscapes into interior states. She has published two monographs, One to Nothing (2011) and Island in my Mind (2015). Her work is exhibited internationally and is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and has appeared in The New Yorker, New York Times Magazine, Harpers, and Vice.

And if you’re never lost then you’re kind of just always in this neutral grey town.” | Simon Norfolk (b. 1963, Lagos, Nigeria) is a landscape photographer whose work over twenty years has been themed around a probing and stretching of the meaning of the word \'battlefield\' in all its forms. As such, he has photographed in some of the world\'s worst war-zones and refugee crises, but is equally at home photographing supercomputers used to design military systems or the test-launching of nuclear missiles. Time’s layeredness in the landscape is an ongoing fascination of his.His work has been widely recognised: he has won The Discovery Prize at Les Rencontres d\'Arles in 2005; The Infinity Prize from The International Center of Photography in 2004; and he was winner of the European Publishing Award, 2002. In 2003 he was shortlisted for the Citibank Prize, now known as the Deutsche Börse Prize, and in 2013 he won the Prix Pictet Commission. He has won multiple World Press Photo and Sony World Photography awards.Simon has produced four monographs of his work including Afghanistan: Chronotopia (2002) which was published in five languages; For Most Of It I Have No Words (1998) about the landscapes of genocide; and Bleed (2005) about the war in Bosnia. His most recent is Burke + Norfolk; Photographs from the War in Afghanistan (2011).He has work held in major collections such as The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, The Getty in Los Angeles as well as San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Wilson Centre for Photography and the Sir Elton John Collection. His work has been shown widely and internationally from Brighton to Ulaanbaatar and in 2011 his Burke + Norfolk work was one of the first ever photography solo shows at Tate Modern in London.  He has been described by one critic as “the leading documentary photographer of our time. Passionate, intelligent and political; there is no one working in photography that has his vision or his clarity.”On episode 107, Simon discusses, among other things:Why being married to a surgeon makes photography feel ‘really rather trivial’Instagram and some of its young starsNot wanting to do “any shite”Climate change and his ‘pyrograph’ project on Mount KenyaWhy he went to Afghanistan in 2001Why his work is ‘intensely English’Why he left Oxford after his first yearHow he made his famous balloon seller pictureNot seeing a future for himself in photographyReferenced:Joey LThomas HeatonKlaus Thymann (Project Pressure)John Wyatt ClarkePaul LoweAntonio OlmosBen LowyClaude LorrainNicolas PoussinWebsite | Facebook | Instagram“There is a huge photography thing out there. It’s just that this rather narrow band of snobby, up its arse art photography has kind of wandered away from it. This used to be where the currency was, in The Photographer’s Gallery and in the prizes and the shows and stuff, and nowadays it’s become a sort of self-referential clusterfuck really.” | Andrea Modica was born in New York City and lives in Philadelphia, where she works as a photographer and teaches as professor of photography at Drexel University. She is a Guggenheim Fellow, a Fulbright Scholar and the recipient of a Knight Award. Andrea is perhaps best known for her portrait photography and for her use of black and white film, shot on an 8"x10" view camera and printed using the platinum-palladium process.Her books include Treadwell (Chronicle), Minor League (Smithsonian Press), Barbara (Nazraeli), Human Being (Nazraeli), Fountain (Stinehour Editions) and most recently As We Wait (L’Artiere), now in its second edition and more recently a collection of portraits of ‘Mummer Wenches’, titled\xa0January 1\xa0(L’Artiere). Her latest book, featuring work shot over a 30 year period, is Lentini (KGP) and her upcoming is a book of photographs made at a horse clinic in Italy, titled\xa0Clinica Equina Bagnarola\xa0(Tis Books).Andrea’s photographs have been featured in such prominent publications as the New York Times Magazine, the New Yorker and Newsweek, she has had solo exhibitions at numerous prestigious museums and her photographs are part of the permanent collections of several of them.On episode 106, Andrea discusses, among other things:The act sometimes being more important than the resultHow she earnt money shooting real estateNot being deterred by gender biasGetting ‘her hands in the clay’ with the 8x10 cameraHer book, TreadwellRecent book project, LentiniInstagramHer current horse hospital project: Clinica Equina BagnarolaWebsite | Facebook | Instagram“Using the big camera, processing film, washing it, waiting for it to dry, making proof prints, looking at those, deciding - which sometimes take quite a while - if anything is worthy of printing further, and then deciding if it’s worth keeping. That’s when my hands are really in the clay...” | Rebecca Norris Webb was originally a journalist and a poet before falling in love with photography and transitioning to a career that has since incorporated all of those disciplines.

Each concert pairs two composers—an early-20th-century innovator, and a New Yorker they influenced.  The music is performed by alumni and faculty of the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival at MASS MoCA, a program dedicated entirely to the creation, study, and performance of the most adventurous music of our time. This second evening in the series features one of Arnold Schoenberg's shortest, oddest, most intense pieces, Herzgewächse, a shockingly expressive vocal miniature originally written for Vasily Kandinsky's journal The Blue Rider. Morton Feldman's meditative work Three Voices, for solo voice and two prerecorded solo voices, a luxurious, introspective setting of a poem by Frank O'Hara, has a much slower tempo than the Schoenberg piece, but is ultimately no less intense. | In conjunction with MoMA's presentation of Wolfgang Laib's Pollen from Hazelnut, Agnes Gund, President Emerita of The Museum of Modern Art, joins the artist in conversation about the installation and his creative process. Ann Temkin, The Marie-Josée and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture, moderates. | Media artist and filmmaker Scott Snibbe and his collaborator Lukas Girling discuss their work and its relationship to sound in space, with a particular focus on REWORK_(Philip Glass Remixed) [GLASS MACHINE], which is featured at MoMA Studio. | Artist Joe McKay discusses his work and its relationship to sound in space, with a particular focus on Light Wave and Tweetagraph, his interactive installations in MoMA Studio. | Claes Oldenburg reads from Writing on the Side 1956–1969 (edited by Achim Hochdörfer, Maartje Oldenburg, and Barbara Schröder), a newly published selection of diaries, notes, poems, scripts, and statements that the artist wrote in the 1960s. The event is introduced by Ann Temkin, Chief Curator, Department of Painting and Sculpture, and organizer of the exhibition Claes Oldenburg: The Street and The Store and Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum/Ray Gun Wing; and Maartje Oldenburg. The reading is followed by a book signing and reception. | Curator Mathieu Copeland discusses the poetics of interstitial, neutral and otherwise overlooked off-spaces—and off-times—of museums and galleries. He envisages how they can be activated and seen anew through a variety of perspectives, and thus subvert the traditional role of exhibitions and renew the way they are perceived. | This half-day symposium explores the art scene and artistic production in Tokyo in the 1950s and 1960s through a series of film screenings and discussions with directors, curators, critics, and artists. The films, including ANPO: Art X War (Linda Hoaglund, 2010), Some Young People (Nagano Chiaki, 1964), and Japan: The New Art (Michael and Christian Blackwood, 1970), are followed by the roundtable discussion, “What Was So Avant-Garde about Tokyo from 1955 to 1970?” | On the occasion of the publication of Robert Motherwell Paintings and Collages: A Catalogue Raisonné, 1941–1991, this roundtable discussion explores Robert Motherwell's role as a thinker across creative disciplines including painting, poetry, philosophy, and music. Presenters include Debra Balken, Bill Berkson, Tim Clifford, Heidi Colsman-Freyberger, Robert Hobbs, and Katy Rogers.

But every so often I come across artists who are just as interested in learning about business as they are in being an artist. And I feature them in my interviews on the podcast and blog. Miriam Schulman is one of those artists. She discovered a gift secondary to her art—a curiosity about how the art business works. Combined with the fact that she loves to talk and ask questions, Miriam found her calling in her weekly podcast, The Inspiration Place. But it was a lot of work to start, and it’s a lot of work to keep up. If you have ever considered starting a podcast or sharing your story on a podcast, this episode of the Art Biz Podcast is for you. In this interview you’ll hear about:\xa0  Miriam’s background in engineering and corporate finance and how she found the courage to transition to a full-time artist.\xa0 How she promoted her work early on and why she still believes in using a brag book.\xa0 The teaching spot she created called The Inspiration Place to collaborate with other artist teachers. What gave Miriam the idea to start a weekly podcast under The Inspiration Place umbrella and how she committed to making it happen a few months later. The production team and systems Miriam has behind her now and the coaches and mentors that have helped her along the way.\xa0 Why she feels that podcasting is the perfect platform for her to share her voice and build her influence.\xa0 Miriam’s decision to focus on business lessons and translating them as they pertain to artists specifically.\xa0 Her automated process for inviting and booking guests and her advice for artists who pitch to be on her show.\xa0 Why Miriam plans to keep podcasting every week and how it serves her in her business.\xa0  See Miriam\'s work:\xa0SchulmanArt.com Follow her on Instagram: Instagram.com/schulmanart Listen to the latest episode of The Inspiration Place Podcast:\xa0https://www.schulmanart.com/category/podcast/ You can leave a comment for Miriam or me along with this post at\xa0https://artbizsuccess.com/produce-podcast-schulman\xa0(episode 34).

It was all she could do to paint fast enough to supply these galleries with new work. What a great problem to have, right? But something wasn’t sitting right with Ali. So she asked each of the 11 galleries to return her work. One by one they sent back what few paintings remained in their inventories. She had begun to reconsider not just what her business model looked like, but the art itself.\xa0 She decided to take control and be very deliberate about her next moves.\xa0 In episode 33, you’ll hear about:  Ali’s first steps as an artist and initial gallery representation. Why galleries weren’t interested in work behind glass. How Ali took 6 months to teach herself a new watercolor technique and why it was important to do this. How Ali used her blog to attract press coverage and interest from galleries. How Ali has expanded her audience using social media. Ali’s philosophy of the artist’s journey and micro-evolution. Why it’s critical to challenge yourself as an artist. Why Instagram is the perfect platform for getting affirmation for your work. The reason Ali pulled her art from galleries and what happened to those 25 pieces. How Ali began raising her prices and why art fairs were the best venue for the new prices. Ali’s monograph that was published by Unicorn Publishing in 2019. Details of Ali’s intention to renovate a property in the small town of St. Genevieve, Missouri. Ali’s upcoming plans for Patreon.

How to Be More Successful and Lucky The Art Career Success System | When I heard Sean VanderVliet mention the word “legacy,” I knew I had to talk with him. He thinks big and I like that. Check out episode 15 and\xa0 episode 19 for more on legacy. Sean is the artist behind Fenway Clayworks based here in Denver, Colorado, and in just a few years he has created a brand and a buzz around his functional pottery. A number of Denver’s finest restaurants commission Sean for their signature dinnerware. He wasn’t always a ceramic artist. For a number of years Sean worked in tech startups and even, with partners, started his own niche business for rock climbers. He has been able to translate the lessons he learned in those positions to his career as an artist. Sean says that people work with him because they see his passion. Although 60% of his current business is from commissions, he makes work in his style. If you want something with a flower or aspen tree on it, look elsewhere.\xa0 He enjoys immensely the collaboration with chefs and others, but he is also clear that not everyone is a customer. This is just one of the numerous business lessons in Sean’s story that are applicable regardless of the type of work you do. After hearing his vision, you may want to start looking out for a Fenway Clayworks in your neighborhood.\xa0 Our topics of discussion include:\xa0  Sean’s background and how his childhood community influenced the work he does today. Why he left his corporate job to be “part of something small” and how working at other companies has served him in his pottery business. The business model he operates and the breakdown of his income streams - 60% wholesale dinnerware to restaurants in the Denver community, 20% wholesale to retailers, 20% direct retail sales. How Sean’s confidence has grown, which has allowed for more success in his business.\xa0 His commitment to his own design style.\xa0 How Sean plans to scale his business and hire help to support his growth. The role he’s assigned to social media and email (and Instagram as “the perfect platform for potters”). Why he believes that people choose to work with him over other artists. Sean’s dedication to educating and explaining his process and how this translates to pricing. And his realization that “not everyone is a customer, and that’s okay.”\xa0 What’s next for Sean and his plan for an “experiential retail” space.\xa0  Follow Sean on Instagram.

For years, Marilyn had been wondering what art project she could possibly do that would be grand enough to match the significance of the occasion. She came up with one—Her Flag—and joins the show to talk about it. It includes collaborations with artists and public performances in each of the 36 states that passed the amendment. After more than a year on the road, Marilyn will complete the enormous flag. \xa0 Marilyn talks about what inspires her to honor this occasion. She also shares how we can get involved. \xa0 In this interview, you will hear about: ● The research and passion that drove Marilyn into this ambitious project. ● Why it was important to Marilyn that the project be open to anyone who wants to celebrate, regardless of race or political affiliation. ● Why Marilyn knew if she wanted this project done, she needed to do it herself and not wait for anyone else. ● How Marilyn selected the 36 women artists in each state to work with. ● Why it was important to Marilyn that she pay the artists. ● The decision to make the flag at Rainbow Pennant, a business in Oklahoma that already employs women to make American Flags. ● A glimpse into the states Marilyn will travel to throughout her epic journey. She will start in Wisconsin in June to travel the path of ratification, and end her trip in Tennessee on August 18, 2020, the anniversary of the date on which the 19th Amendment was ratified. ● The physical details of the 18 x 26 ft flag, and how Marilyn plans to sew everything while she is on the road. ● The team Marilyn has hired to help her work on Her Flag, including one very important full-time project manager. ● The systems Marilyn used to keep their internal and external communication flow organized. ● The need for artists to not be so attached to their original idea that they miss out on something better. ● The decision to feature women of color and focus on women like Ida B. Wells, Mary McLeod Bethune, and Sojourner Truth. ● The part of the journey that is most uncomfortable for Marilyn, but why it’s important that she do it. ● Marilyn’s big dreams for the finished Her Flag. \xa0 \xa0 Resources: Blog post for notes and comments: https://artbizsuccess.com/artus-her-flag-podcast Her Flag https://herflag.com CaFÉ https://www.callforentry.org/ Basecamp https://basecamp.com Book: Fresh Lipstick: Redressing Fashion and Feminism by Linda M.

She rose to meet the challenge and joins the show today to share her experience and provide a cautionary tale to others. Leslie talks about how she started working with Firebirds, and how she found a way to not only stay afloat but succeed when 50-60% of her income went away. She also talks about living frugally, playing to your strengths, and the planning and strategizing that went in to her one-woman show. \xa0 \xa0  In this interview, you will hear about: ● How Leslie got her gig with Firebirds Restaurants in the first place, and how she landed her deal with them from 2014 to2018. ● Why her time with them came to an end, and a lesson when there is a change. ● The role of her art consultant, and the pros and cons of them working so closely together. ● What her production schedule looked like while working with Firebirds including payment, deadlines and production. ● How she came to pick the 10-13 same paintings that were used and replicated over the past 4 years. ● How she survived Firebirds ending although it was on average 50-60 % of her income. ● The importance of living frugally and debt free. ● The one person show that Leslie put on in June of 2018, which made her a half of a year’s earnings in just one night. ● The mistake that Leslie made, and why she doesn’t want you to make it — stay in touch with your base no matter how busy you are. ● What she re-established that had gotten pushed aside and how she uses her newsletter and social media to stay in touch using a voice authentic to her own. ● Leslie’s strategy in the next year. ● Playing to her strengths of interfacing with people rather than doing business over the computer screen. \xa0  Resources: Leslie Neumann http://leslieneumann.com\u2028Leslie’s Instagram https://instagram.com/leslieneumann Firebirds restaurant locations https://firebirdsrestaurants.com/find-a-location/ Show notes and comments  https://artbizsuccess.com/neumann-commissions-podcast \xa0  Quotes: ● “The production was like a puzzle, and I like that kind of stuff.” ● “What was appealing for me is that I got to paint every day.” ● “It always works out.” ● “Stay in touch with your base.” ● “Make the very best art you can and start planning for whatever it is that will provide income next.” \xa0 This episode is sponsored by the 10th anniversary edition of I’d Rather Be in the Studio: The Artist’s No-Excuse Guide to Self-Promotion.

Many pundits have argued that the political tactics and rhetoric of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump echo those of fascist leaders like Benito Mussolini and Hitler. On the other hand, a smaller number of pundits have made the same claim about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Furthermore, the 2016 Olympics in Rio marked the 80th anniversary of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, which expressed the fascism of Adolf Hitler\'s Nazi regime.  In this episode, we discuss the rise of modern fascism; outline the major characteristics of fascist aesthetics; and look at a few examples of fascist aesthetics in practice, from the 1930s to the present day. | \u200b\u200bIn 2011, shock waves erupted in the art world when the long-established New York gallery Knoedler & Company announced it was closing. Knoedler had been in major dealer in modern art, handling works by mid-century American masters like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Robert Motherwell. The closure of the gallery coincided with persisting rumors that a number of works the gallery had sold were highly convincing forgeries. In the past few years, details have emerged that link the gallery to a dubious dealer and Chinese immigrant who painted works resembling those of well known artists in his apartment in Queens.  In today\'s episode, we discuss the Knoedler case, as well as the notions of "originality," "authenticity," "copying," and "forgery." As we will see, these complex ideas become more complex--and even\xa0contradictory--when\xa0translated between the cultural contexts of the US and China, where copying now operates on an industrial scale in the notorious Dafen Oil Painting Village. | In this special Memorial Day Weekend episode, we interview Harriet F. Senie, Professor of Art History and Director of the M.A. program in Art History and Art Museum Studies Program at City College of New York, and co-founder of the organization Public Art Dialogue. Our topic is\xa0her recent book\xa0Memorials to Shattered Myths: Vietnam to 9/11 (Oxford University Press, 2016). Using the case studies of the Vietnam Memorial and the 9/11 Memorial, which open and close the book, we discuss how the function of public memorials has evolved over the past few decades: whereas memorials formerly helped the public to make sense of history, now, they\'re more likely to prompt private experiences of grief. We\'ll learn how and why this transition was made, and consider its negative impact on our ability to properly "memorialize" the tragedies of our time. | In today\'s Valentine\'s Day-inspired episode, we delve into the history of Japanese erotica, with the help of our friend, Maggie Mustard. Maggie is a PhD Candidate in Art History at Columbia University specializing in Japanese art, and is also the inaugural Teaching Fellow at the New Museum in New York City.(Please note that the images we discuss are of an overtly sexual nature, therefore this episode could fall into the realm of NSFW!) | Chances are you probably remember "Beast Jesus"--the fresco painting in a Spanish church that was lovingly "restored" by a local parishioner in 2012, and soon became the laughing-stock of the internet. In today\'s episode, we discuss this and three other acts of conservation and restoration of works of art and architecture. In addition to explaining what made these acts controversial, we\xa0consider why conserving and restoring works of art raises philosophical questions about how we define, understand, and value works of art. | It\'s our 20th episode, so we decided\xa0to talk about two things that are near and dear to us: cats and art.

Called "Dismaland," the park,\xa0erected on the site of a derelict lido, was actually a curated exhibition of works by dozens of artists, all of which expressed critical views of mainstream culture and politics.\xa0In this episode, we introduce you to Dismaland through a\xa0discussion of street art and Banksy\'s\xa0oeuvre; look closely at a few works on display; consider the ways in which Dismaland intersects with three major trends in contemporary art; and talk about the fate of Dismaland as recycled materials for a notorious refugee camp near Calais, France.\xa0 | Continuing with our recent theme of New York City architectural and cultural gems, today\'s episode delves into one of the most vital elements of the city\'s infrastructure: its transportation system.

This week on Creativity School, I’m speaking to BJ Williams about breaking stigmas surrounding mental health and being vulnerable, particularly for black men in America who are 20% more likely to experience mental illness than the general population. BJ is the creator of a video series called Can I Be Vulnerable?, which encourages black men to face and normalize their vulnerability and mental health. BJ talks about how the series got started completely unplanned, when he shared his own raw and vulnerable video talking about his background and going to therapy. As a result, many men began sharing their own stories and Can I Be Vulnerable? was born. Listen to find out why destigmatizing mental health and speaking openly about the things that make us vulnerable is so important, and why it’s essential to learn healthy emotional intelligence. BJ also shares how he deals with negativity online, and how a lack of resources can lead to great creativity and innovation.

If you’ve never heard of Human Design before, you’re about to get a crash course on how this tool gives you an overview of the mechanics of how you operate, and “is the owner’s manual that we didn’t get at birth.” By learning our Human Design type we can gain a deeper understanding of who we really are, and remove all the baggage of who the world tells us to be. As Laura says, truly compelling creativity comes from a deep place of inner knowledge. And the more we know about ourselves, the more we can create better work.

But is it possible to build a successful business by intentionally growing it slow and without the pressure to grow as quickly as possible? This week on Creativity School, I talk to Jessica Gonzalez, a beekeeper and the founder of Happy Organics, a wellness company that provides honey and CBD products for the body and mind. Jessica shares her journey to accidentally starting her company during a time when she was burned out and exploring the things that made her happy after quitting a tech company she founded. She began helping her father with his bees when he got diagnosed with terminal cancer, and developed honey and CBD products to help with his pain and anxiety. When people started asking to buy them, she had a business. Jessica shares how she was able to keep her company going through the devastating loss of her dad, how her incredible pain became her purpose, and how she’s been able to successfully grow her company slowly and at her own pace by being focused on her values and the bigger picture. \xa0 \xa0 **Today’s episode is brought to you by Audible!

In 2017, I became are DIY Paint retailer selling my DIY tutorials online, started a membership group for furniture artists and developed a love for teaching. Since then, I host online paint classes/courses and paint workshops. I am proud to say I’m a cheerleader to so many creative entrepreneurs.

Jennie sat down with me to share her process for live painting and the types of events she paints for. We also talk about how she schedules these events, what travel looks like and which supplies are her go to\'s for live painting. If you\'ve ever thought about live painting or wondered what it\'s like, this is the episode for you! \xa0 From Jennie Lou Tucker: While studying graphic design at Baylor University, I began painting to escape the dreaded hours making art with a computer. I had not picked up a paintbrush since elementary art class, but blending colors came easily, and organic shapes appeared before me on my canvas. Since then, painting has become a quiet expression and gentle release from everyday life. After graduating from college, I immediately set out on a grand adventure as a Teach for America corps member teaching middle school world history in a rural town near Charleston, South Carolina. As my short teaching career came to an end, I was not quite ready to set my roots in one place. So I hit the road again, only to find myself destined for fresh mountain air. Originally I was born and raised in Austin, Texas, but currently, I reside in Denver, Colorado. The mountains and the great outdoors inspire me every day and remain a constant reminder of the natural beauty all around me.\xa0 Technically, I initially began using oils, but have since realized how acrylic’s fast-drying nature is more conducive to my quick painting style. Head over to my Commissions page to ask me about personalized paintings. We will find a size that fits both your budget and your wall space.\xa0 Specifically, I am most passionate about "live wedding paintings", and specialized commission pieces, but my main concern is equipping you with a timeless piece of artwork to hand down for generations.\xa0 Thank you for your interest in my artwork, and I look forward to hearing from you! xo Jennie Lou Website: https://www.jennielouart.com Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jennielouart/ Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/jennielouart/ Links: To get 50% off your first year with Honeybook, go to positivelycreative.net/honeybook!

We talk about how motherhood was the catalyst for starting her painting journey. Whitney shares what inspired her early designs and why partnerships are important. She also shares how she\'s developed and shared a diverse product line. \xa0 From Whitney Winkler: Hey! I\'m Whitney Winkler. I hail from the heartland of the US, but currently call Memphis, TN home; and a good home it is! I have a steady, gem of a husband, and three little babies who stole my heart and ran away with it. I have always loved to create. I\'ve been a songwriter since I could talk, and I’ve always been a bit heavy-handed with the glitter, if you know what I mean.\xa0 My sister calls me the "more is more" girl, and it couldn\'t be more true. As I\'ve grown, I am learning that more of most is more, and that sometimes restraint is the loveliest.\xa0 I\'ve always been passionate about beauty and truth. To me, the combination of those two elements is unstoppable. Painting has come along later in life. I am finding that it is another way to question and answer; express emotion, muddle in, and settle into process. It is like no other medium I have encountered. I always walk away from a paint brush energized and refreshed. My love of beauty draws me primarily to the design aesthetic of art. My favorite design elements are the modern and whimsical. I am always drawn to blues, greens , greys, and pastel everything(s). Natural elements such as florals and rocks can be found in my work, paired with wafty brush strokes and ink bleeds. Soft and clean lines are best when paired. I love bold and feminine; neutral and geometric.\xa0 An extrovert at heart, I am most inspired when in community. I am so very inspired by the Memphis and online art community, and how much thought is put into the other. I want my (and all) art to be a spring board for the good of a broader collective, and a boost to the individual heart to boot. Thanks for checking out Whitney Winkler Art. My heart beams and bursts that you came!

Conventional coaching bias leads people to believe that only "experts" in their topic can coach.That\'s why I became a strength-based Co-Active coach. By using powerful questions, global listening skills, and the strength-based framework, our dynamic coaching duo can\'t be boxed in, contained, and confined to the topic. The topic is a springboard, the jump-off point, or the first step our transformative journey. By putting you first, and not the topic, we are free to explore the connections and inflection points that define you as a whole person. We are able to dig through the superficial layers to get at the real issue at hand. We are able to develop strategies and accountabilities that are required to evoke transformation.I push the boundaries of conventional coaching bias. You see, I served as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy for 22-years. I served at multiple levels of leadership over the course of my 23-year career. I spent seven of those 23-years in senior leadership roles that culminated with my service as the Commanding Officer of a Navy shore facility, where I led a total of 242 service members, junior and senior enlisted leader, commissioned officers, and Department of Navy Civilians. As a Navy Officer, I have had the honor and the burden of leading and serving citizens (people)- our most precious resource and treasure, from all over these United States of America. I didn\'t have the luxury to pick a niche of sailors. I had to connect and relate to service members from different regions, different military branches, different naval communities; and different races, ethnic groups, religions, and sexual orientation in order to effectively coach, counsel, evaluate, lead, manage, and mentor them. Diversity and cultural competence weren\'t a luxuries. They were necessary skills that I developed to effectively lead and influence. I had to meet people where they were. I have participated, planned, and lead global operations in the Arabian Gulf and Indo-Pacific regions. I have lived in India and Japan, and worked in the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. I collaborated with senior military officers and peers of regional allies and partners; and business leaders from major defense contractors. I have conducted more than 900 instances of personnel counseling, coaching, mentoring, and performance evaluations over the course of my Navy career beginning in 1996. Because of my unique and diverse experiences, perspective, and strengths; I am confident of my ability to coach anyone, everywhere.

We talked about her creative childhood, the winding journey she took to becoming an artist and why she is drawn to her current artistic style. Jess also shares the power of layers and changing subjects as well as her personal opinion about painting with acrylic vs. oil. \xa0 About Jess Franks: Jess Franks is known for vibrant acrylic paintings that dance the line between real and abstract. As a magazine graphic designer by trade (including work for Greenville Magazine, South Carolina Magazine, and Mechanical Engineering Magazine), she has spent countless hours on her computer poring over photography. A few years ago she discovered that painting not only allows her to delve back into a more tactile world, but also to create scenes in radical colors that no photo could capture. She uses the familiar structures of the natural world around her to explore new palettes, resulting in paintings that are at once both unexpected yet accessible. In between paintings, Jess has spent much of her time researching how social media and online commerce can create communities and sustain artists through untraditional avenues. She has found an incredibly interactive art-collecting community on Instagram and uses that platform as her primary location for studio updates and shop news. Her prints are sold at Minted, Anthropologie, WestElm, and MaineCottage. Jess has placed in multiple contests on Minted, including first and second place wins in the Minted X West Elm contests, and a third place win in the Minted X Domino contest. She lives with her husband and brood of children in New England. \xa0 Website: https://www.jessfranksart.com/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jessfranksart/ \xa0 Links: Fredericks Canvas Minted \xa0 To get 50% off your first year with Honeybook, go to positivelycreative.net/honeybook! \xa0 About The Positively Creative Podcast: The Positively Creative Podcast was created by Dorothy Collier, artist of Dorothy Art, for creative entrepreneurs.

That event played a major role in the way her art has developed and yet she has not discussed it publicly until now. \xa0We explore how such experiences can shape our art and whether this is something we should share with others. Does it help us connect with art buyers more authentically? Or is it too much information?

Others haven’t even collected email addresses in the past.We’re hoping today’s discussion will inspire you to get started and/or to crank up your current efforts. The truth is that email has an important role to play in your marketing mix. Yes social media is important, but when someone gives you their email address, they are taking a step closer to you - giving you a valuable opportunity to make and keep a connection.We share tips, discuss areas where we could improve, and invite you to sign up for both our newsletters, so you can experience what happens when you do.

Why am I making this particular series of paintings? And, at the granular level, why am I making this one specific painting?Our wide-ranging conversation spans the desire to create things, the need to be seen, the drive to communicate our internal experience, and whether what we are really seeking is love. (Deep stuff!) We also get into how you find your purpose. It isn’t something you can just come up with in 5 \xa0minutes. For most of us, it is a gradual process of discovery and it arises from the work we do. We also acknowledge that so much of this changes over time - even if we know our why at this moment, it may well change in future years.MentionedSimon Sinek \xa0TED talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuABuy us a coffee and support the podcast here\xa0Submit a question at bit.ly/artjuicepodcastFollow us on Instagram:@alicesheridanstudio@louisefletcher_artSee fuller show notes on our websites:www.alicesheridan.comwww.louisefletcherart.comCredits"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License | This week\'s discussion was sparked by a question we received from a listener. AJ asked this question about commissions: “I am an up and coming artist with a handful of commission requests. I would love to learn about the professional way to handle commissions. How do you and Alice do this? How much do your charge? What do you do about edits? Should the client pay upfront or give a deposit?”The question led us into an interesting debate about how formalised a commission process should be. Alice sets clear parameters and her process has worked very well for her, while Louise has found that any kind of commitment feels heavy. She is therefore taking a much more informal approach (including refusing commissions unless they feel just right).\xa0We discuss practicalities (pricing, process, deposits etc), share our successes (as well as those that didn\'t go so well), and debate the pluses and minuses of allowing client input during the creative process.\xa0In the end, we both agree that there is no one-size-fits-all "professional" methodology and that the most important thing is for each artist to determine an approach that works for him or her (and make the parameters very clear to the buyer in advance).\xa0This week we also share some exciting studio news, celebrate the success of a fellow artist, and (literally) get a little bit potty-mouthed (!)Mentioned:Zandra Stratford\'s show at https://afternynegallery.com \xa0\xa0(Until Sept 21st)Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here\xa0Submit a question at bit.ly/artjuicepodcastFollow us on Instagram:\xa0@alicesheridanstudio\xa0@louisefletcher_artSee fuller show notes on our websites:www.alicesheridan.comwww.louisefletcherart.comCredits"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License | Do you feel the need for a “good” result every time you paint? Or hope for a painting that looks good at every stage?This can bring an added stress to making art and limit your ability to experiment. We discuss what might be at the bottom of this, quite natural, desire to feel satisfied and how we can work this into our process.\xa0Also, one listener asks "Am I not going to move forward in my art if I keep using my phone?" and we have some ideas of the advantages and disadvantages of using your phone as a recorder and where it may be holding you back.Mentioned:Kyle Cease podcast interview - creativity and taking that one step (Warning; curse words!)https://podtail.com/en/podcast/you-made-it-weird-with-pete-holmes/kyle-cease/Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here\xa0Submit a question at bit.ly/artjuicepodcastFollow us on Instagram: @alicesheridanstudio\xa0 @louisefletcher_artSee fuller show notes on our websites:\xa0www.alicesheridan.com\xa0www.louisefletcherart.comCredits"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License | Settle down, you are in for a treat in this discussion of the artist as problem solver!\xa0Megan Woodard Johnson is a mixed media artist who layers vintage paper ephemera with paint, various drawing media and found objects to tell evocative stories within her work.Alice talks with Megan about that fact that an artist\'s growth is rarely linear and how we can only make sense of it all when we look backwards at everything that happened.\xa0The wide-ranging discussion also covered building a creative practice alongside a family, how to find honest critiques \xa0of your work, and how new classes and experiences can invigorate us as artists.

Influenced by music, lyrics, feelings, stories, other artists, and the materials themselves, Jacqui’s art is as varied as her ever changing hair – sometimes light, humorous and colourful , while at other times serious with a touch of dark.In this podcast, Jacqui and Louise dive deeply into issues around the creative process, scaling up your work, your personal voice and and how we define success.\xa0Part of the conversation centred on this quote:"It quite frequently happens that you’re just treading water for quite a long time. Nothing really dramatic seems to be happening. … And then suddenly everything seems to lock together in a different way. It’s like a crystallization point where you can’t detect any single element having changed.

Alice’s much anticipated summer break was swamped by rain, meaning a lot of wet walks and NONE of the planned sketchbook days out. To compound the situation, she also lost internet which meant she couldn’t catch up on important work. Louise worked for months on an online course, only to be let down by Zoom, YouTube and Mailchimp all on the same evening. The result was less than pretty!Given these mini-disasters, we discuss how we react when things go wrong. It’s easy to say ‘put things into perspective’ but do we need to feel that emotion first? And if so, is there a way to feel the emotion, but also keep things in perspective?We also answer a question about art degrees. One listener is considering whether to go for an MA. \xa0We acknowledge that being an artist is about learning and stretching yourself, but we wonder whether taking an advanced degree is a safe option that simply postpones the inevitable time when you have to do this for yourself anyway.We would love to hear you views on this topic too, if you’ve taken an MA, what did you feel it gave you?Mentioned:\xa0Louise\'s course - Find Your JoyTwo Dots - you really don’t want to waste your time on this (unless you are only human!)Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here\xa0Submit a question at bit.ly/artjuicepodcastFollow us on Instagram: @alicesheridanstudio\xa0 @louisefletcher_art \xa0See fuller show notes on our websites: www.alicesheridan.com www.louisefletcerart.comCredits"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\xa0 | This week we’re discussing gender and how it influences the way we work. The high-end art world continues to be dominated by men and yet attend any workshop and most of the artists there will be women. Are female artists victims of a sexist society? Or are we actually holding ourselves back? We discuss how our parents influenced our attitudes, how women’s tendency to care for others can hinder us, and how we might make our way confidently in a man’s world without resorting to mimicking our male colleagues. We also wonder why some men take up two seats on a plane instead of just one!\xa0(Damn! Should have scrolled further down the page… look at this article!!!

Alice has children, which means her summers have always been a time for family. Even with the best will in the world, it’s almost impossible to work while caring for young children so she has always had to find ways of creating that could be squeezed into the gaps around family time. This has included other creative projects including home decor, gardening, cooking, and reading the art books that she has never got round to.

Craig was photographically born into the fashion world in October 1994 after receiving a formal education in photography. He has been published in several fashion and photography magazines, as well as billboards across the country. After teaching at the college level for more than seven years, it was time to become more creative and break out. In 2010, Craig began teaching workshops, touring the US as a speaker for industry conferences, and published his first book, “Fashion Seniors.” Two years later, his second book, “Dynamic Posing Guide,” sold over 5,000 copies on Amazon in three days, placing it on the retailing giant’s Top 100 Photography Books list. In 2014, Craig was the lead photographer for “Green Bay: A City and Its Team,” a book written by Jim Hurley and commissioned by the NFL Hall of Fame to document and highlight the rich history of the Green Bay Packers. His hard work and signature style have always shown him to be a risk-taker, catching the eye of social media pages Instafashion and Vogue Venezuela, as well as Dish Network’s Fashion TV whose spotlight on both him and his images on display in London thrust him onto the international fashion stage. Craig has an “open house” attitude, always willing to take time for others and answer questions for those who call. Craig is currently sponsored by Bowens USA, Photobiz, and Savage Universal, and his speaking resume includes WPPI, Imaging USA, SYNC Seniors, MDPPA, WTPPA, After Dark, Foto Chaos, Creative Fashion Artist USA, Sandy Puc’s Hands On Tour, and Senior Style Guide’s The Push Conference.“My success revolves around my family.” | “It’s hard to not be in your own head all the time.”Christina Ramirez came back from burnout and tragedy with a new lease on her business mindset and her life.“It was more than be being in a creative rut.

I was struck by her openness and her honesty. It’s one thing to talk about being in a rut after you’re out of it, but Christina was right in the middle of it and she laid it all out there. If you haven’t heard that conversation yet, I’d highly suggest you have a listen before you continue with this one. In any case, we sat down again at PUSH conference in Green Castle, Indiana for an update and, once again, Christina had quite a bit to share. This time, I was double struck. No matter which side of the rut you’re on right now, this one will be good for your soul, my friends.Christina Ramirez operates a studio in downtown San Antonio, Texas. She left a job in corporate banking for photography 6 years ago and has been specializing in senior portraits for the last 4.5 years. Her love for all things colorful and bold has helped shape the photographic style she is known for yet she’s always seeking ways to grow and evolve and is the first to encourage others to do the same. Christina has a degree in education so teaching photography and mentoring is something she truly enjoys. She has had the honor of speaking at Senior Style Guide’s PUSH conference for 3 years, along with speaking at Conference 12, The Blink Conference and Reset Conference.

Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 I’m Katie Wilson-Milne. Steve Schindler:\xa0 Welcome to the Art Law Podcast, a monthly podcast exploring the places where art intersects with and interferes with the law. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 And vice versa.\xa0 The Art Law Podcast is sponsored by the law firm of Schindler Cohen & Hochman LLP, a premier litigation and art law boutique in New York City. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 So if you look down on any of the measures it recapitulates a simple refrain (singing). Steve Schindler:\xa0 So, Katie, do you want to tell our listeners about the new idea that we have to have some shorter interviews with artists who engage with the legal world? Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Yeah, so we are going to be releasing a series of podcasts intermittently in which we interview artists who tell us about how their work engages legal structures.\xa0 So, rather than Steve and I and a guest examining the art world through law and legal structures, we are going to flip it and ask artists to tell us about how their art is inspired by and reflects the law. Okay, we are here today with the artist Aviva Rahmani, who is going to share with us some information about her practice and her work using law as a medium and a tool in her work.\xa0 Aviva began her career as a performance artist founding and directing the American Ritual Theater, performing throughout California.\xa0 She graduated from the California Institute of the Arts and received a Ph.D. from Plymouth University in the United Kingdom.\xa0 She has presented workshops on her theatrical approach to environmental restoration and her transdisciplinary work has been exhibited internationally at many prestigious museums and exhibition spaces.\xa0 So, Aviva, thank you for being with us. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 I am honored to be here with you.\xa0 Thank you for inviting me. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So just for our listeners who are not familiar with your work can you talk about your artistic practice and then also maybe when the legal system first entered your practice. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Well what’s interesting about law is that it’s a system to preserve civilization.\xa0 And I often think about the role of art in the anthropocene as the glue that may hold us together through this very perilous time.\xa0 So if you think about systems that way, it’s a hop, skip, and a jump between law and the judicial process and any other system that preserves culture.\xa0 My interest specifically in the kind of law I’m working with now developed in the late 70s when a lot of artists were using appropriation.\xa0 And what I noticed was that appropriation was very often an excuse to rip off other artists, other people in general, and very often women.\xa0 That really incensed me.\xa0 So I began to inform myself and follow some of the arguments.\xa0 So when I had this opportunity that came up that became the Blued Trees Symphony I jumped on it because I thought, “wow, that will be really, really interesting.”\xa0 Take the concept of copyright law and culture jam it so that it serves the society as the law for Eminent Domain, which is supposed to protect property, is supposed to protect land owners and actually serves corporations right now. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So what is the Blued Trees project? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 The Blued Trees project began when a small group of activists, who called themselves “fracktivists” and were fighting fracking, looked for an artist who could work with them.\xa0 They had been inspired by Peter von Tiesenhausen in Alberta, Canada who had copyrighted his entire ranch when the natural gas pipelines wanted to go through.\xa0 And that intimated them enough that they backed off, but that was a few years ago and it was never tested in the courts.\xa0 So they came to me and said, "Can we somehow copyright the trees that are in the path of these corridors?" \xa0And I said, “no, that’s what Monsanto does.\xa0 We are not going to do that.”\xa0 But we could copyright the relationship between the trees, the community, the people, and the habitat.\xa0 And then I looked at where the pipelines were projected to go and I thought well that would be interesting.\xa0 Think of it as a miles long installation.\xa0 And if you are looking at it aerially you could think of it as a musical line. So that was the beginning.\xa0 And then I designed a series of designated trees in those corridors that would represent musical notes but also would represent an obstacle to any heavy machinery that might want to go through.\xa0 And if you look down on that line it creates an actual musical score that can be sung and performed and I’m now using it as the basis for a complete symphony and an opera. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So the idea is if you took an aerial view of the path of a proposed pipeline you are creating an art project along that path. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Within that path. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 And there is no pipeline yet so this is sort of anticipatory. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Correct.\xa0 Yes.\xa0 And I specifically only work with landowners whose land has not yet been condemned by the corporations.\xa0 That’s really important, because if the land has been condemned and they were to act on this project it becomes designated only as activist art which can’t be defended under copyright law.\xa0 And the landowners are liable to prosecution.\xa0 They could even be jailed. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So you have the permission of the landowners to create this project on these trees. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Correct.\xa0 In every case we are invited by private landowners and are given their permission and then we work with them to develop the project. Steve Schindler:\xa0 And do you feel this as the work of visual art or a work of musical composition and does it matter for your purposes? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 I think it matters a great deal but I would rephrase that and say that this is a synsthetic project.\xa0 I’m not a synesthete but this is a cross over between audio, sound, music and the visual and the sculptural.\xa0 It was copyrighted as sonified biogeographic sculpture which would be a new category under the Visual Artists Rights Act, VERA. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Right.\xa0 So the part of the copyright law that you are referring to invoking here is the Visual Artists Rights Act, right? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Correct. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 And that’s different than standard copyright law which just gives you a right to the creative aspects of your work so someone couldn’t make a poster of your work without your permission or something like that, which is also true -- that’s still true if it’s copyrighted.\xa0 But what the Visual Artists Rights Act does -- and tell me, if I’m wrong -- that you think you are invoking is this idea that the work, the physical work not just the image, can’t be destroyed without the involvement of the artists somehow.\xa0 That even though you don’t own the land, you don’t own the trees -- so it’s as if you have sold the painting and you no longer own it -- you still have some rights to that work of art because you created it and that’s what the Visual Artists Rights Act gives you that, that reach as the artist to control work that’s not necessarily located on your property. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Well it becomes a flying wedge into a lot of interesting legal problems. For example, as you know the copyright law was initially created during the French Revolution.\xa0 The phrasing then was to protect the spirit of art.\xa0 That is very operational in Europe but it hasn’t really been tested in the United States.\xa0 So that’s one part. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 The moral rights, yeah. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Yes. Steve Schindler:\xa0 We tend to view copyright more in a sort of property scheme… Aviva Rahmani: \xa0Yes.\xa0 Economically versus the droit morale.\xa0 Correct.\xa0 So that’s one big issue.\xa0 What does the culture value?\xa0 Is it only economic?\xa0 According to the IPCC and the United Nations, no.\xa0 There is the cultural piece.\xa0 The cultural piece is just as important as the economic.\xa0 And then as you also know, there are many suits that are being moved along to the Hague that represent protecting rivers, mountains, other sacred places that all go to the question of Earth Rights.\xa0 In this case because the way the project was developed was specifically to make it integral with the local habitat, it cannot be moved.\xa0 So this would become an entirely different category, which is another interesting point, but also, it immediately comes up against Eminent Domain Law and that’s the part that’s really, really interesting. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So yeah you are predicting or setting up this collision between Eminent Domain and our baby moral rights statute in the United States. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 That’s correct.\xa0 And baby is probably the right way to put it because as people living in the anthropocene if we want to survive we better grow up and get really adult about what we are protecting and why. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So where is this project physically right now? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 It started in Peekskill, New York.\xa0 Each section of the project which I call a measure in the symphony is one-third mile long.\xa0 In Peekskill we sent Spectra Corporation a Cease and Desist law which they promptly ignored.\xa0 Rather they sent me a Dark Money Letter.\xa0 A Dark Money Letter is something that says, “we are going to destroy you if possible.\xa0 Whether it’s possible or not we will destroy you.” Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 This is the company that has plans to build the pipeline and take over this land? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Correct.\xa0 And they are the same company which the present president has heavily invested in that destroyed Standing Rock in North Dakota so they have a long history of ignoring community rights and limits and specifically the water. Steve Schindler:\xa0 You said Eminent Domain has not been exercised yet and that’s really a governmental function.\xa0 What legal right does this private company have to be writing letters and ignoring your Cease and Desist letter? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 This is where it gets more complicated. Steve Schindler:\xa0 I’m sure. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 And even more important and interesting.\xa0 Originally Eminent Domain Law was set up to protect “the scared home” and to support the public good.\xa0 And public good became more and more narrowly defined in the past maybe 20 to 30 years to mean the economic interests of large corporations.\xa0 And actually besides the question of whether the economic interests of large corporations truly serve the public good it’s been the conservative judges like Clarence Thomas who have taken exception to that interpretation and specifically used the term “a perversion” of the intention of Eminent Domain.\xa0 It’s also very interesting because when you talk about the scared home you immediately open the door to the question of Earth Rights and the sacred in general.\xa0 Then you go back to the spirit of art and what is the function of art?\xa0 And again, what is the public good?\xa0 Is it possible that the public good could include a spiritual aspect that is interpreted and expressed in art? Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 You raise an interesting point and there are many areas in the law where politics and legal interpretation don’t neatly align the way I think we think they do on the hot button issues today.\xa0 But you are right.\xa0 There is expansion of Eminent Domain where the government can take more and more land for private purposes and not public purposes.\xa0 We have seen that evolve over time and it is some conservative judges who have said wait that is an expansion of government power.\xa0 I don’t like expansion of government power.\xa0 So they are the ones who are really against that.\xa0 That is an interesting pattern that is something to think about. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 It would be particularly interesting with Kavanaugh because he touts himself as a conservative.\xa0 Will he then come into conflict with some of the other judges like Thomas? Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Or will he agree? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Or will he agree?\xa0 Correct.\xa0 From a political point of view one would anticipate that he couldn’t possibly disagree since he has allied so strongly with this president. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Yeah.\xa0 I don’t know.\xa0 I mean I could see that he would take the Clarence Thomas view that this is an expansion of government power since he likes to say he is an originalist and a literal interpreter but we will see, Aviva, we will see. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 We certainly will. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So in this project are you working with lawyers? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Yes. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 I mean it sounds like part of it is the statement of the project and what the emotional impact of viewing the work and thinking about it.\xa0 But part of it actually has an activist function.\xa0 You are planning to actually do something. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 I’ve been very careful about the term ‘activist’ because if it’s termed activist in the courts, it’s immediately disqualified.\xa0 So I have worked very hard on establishing the evidence that it’s permanent.\xa0 That it has been very carefully thought through as an esthetic project, that I have the support of art professionals.\xa0 For example, in the mock trial, Ben Davis was the person who swayed the judge.\xa0 And he swayed her on the basis of defining what is important art?\xa0 The mock trial came about because although we really wanted to litigate the project and we had several miles by then that we wanted to litigate, and we were hoping that we might have done a test case in Virginia because we had over 200 trees that had been painted as part of the project. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Meaning you would bring claims under the Visual Artists Rights Act to prevent the destruction of that land because it would also have destroyed the art work? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Correct.\xa0 So in Virginia what happened was that FERC, Federal Energy Regulatory Committee in effect ignored all the community input and rubber stamped the corporations to simply go forward.\xa0 When we spoke with the lawyers there what we realized immediately was that we needed local lawyers because of the jurisdictional details.\xa0 The lawyers there were afraid that they didn’t have enough experience with copyright law.\xa0 The copyright lawyers I was already working with like Gale Elston in New York and Patrick Riley who was working out of California didn’t feel that there was enough case law for them to be able to say to the local lawyers, “go forward on this and then we can stand on our advice without being held liable.”\xa0 So in the end we put in letters and testimonials about the importance of the project culturally, locally to the community and so on and so forth but we could not go forward legally. Steve Schindler:\xa0 Right, because isn’t one of the requirements of invoking VERA in the way that you would like to invoke it - and we have discussed this on a prior episode relating to the 5Pointz street art - is that you have to show that the work that you are trying to protect is of a recognized stature. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Exactly. Steve Schindler:\xa0 That’s a very vague term and it’s not specifically defined in the statute.\xa0 But how did you go about trying to make that case? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 That was actually my priority from the beginning.\xa0 Patrick Riley was the lawyer who filed the initial copyright registrations.\xa0 And the advice he gave me then was, “win this in the court of public opinion before you step into the court room.” Steve Schindler:\xa0 That sounds like good advice. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 It was really good advice.\xa0 So I would say the first 2 years of the project my entire focus besides actually expanding the project was to get articles written, to see films made, to do interviews like the one we are doing right now so we could build up a body of evidence to bring to trial.\xa0 The mock trial came about because we had not been able to find a lawyer who was willing to litigate and I was really angsting about this with Deborah Fisher at a Blade of Grass and she said, “why don’t we just a mock trial?”\xa0 And I had thought if we went to trial, that in itself would be a fascinating performance. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Yeah. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 But this was another way of coming at it.\xa0 I know you participated Katie.\xa0 You did a phenomenal job.\xa0 Everybody did a phenomenal job in pulling that off.\xa0 We had April Newbauer, who was the federal judge from Queens.\xa0 We had real jury, we had real lawyers, we had real witnesses.\xa0 There are lots of wonderful photographs we got out of it.\xa0 And the upshot was that we did get an injunction. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So how was it set up?\xa0 Did you know how it was going to go ahead of time?\xa0 How spontaneous was it?\xa0 How scripted? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 It was not scripted at all, but the roles were very clearly defined.\xa0 So, for example, we brought in one of the trees that had been cut down and we had some somebody be a witness translator for the tree.\xa0 And we piped in the sound of part of the symphony and then she translated what that music meant.\xa0 What it meant to the forest to be cut down to the rest of the tree’s family, to the water and so on and so forth. Steve Schindler:\xa0 And did you videotape this?\xa0 Of course. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Of course. Steve Schindler:\xa0 So here’s an interesting at least observation from my point.\xa0 As lawyers, when we get ready to go to trial and have a case we often do mock argument or mock trials.\xa0 The reason that we do them is so that when we go to court we can refine our arguments.\xa0 Sometimes you have a mock jury to understand how jurors are going to relate to the arguments that you have been making to lawyers during the case.\xa0 But do you view the mock trial as part of the work of art or a predictor? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Absolutely.\xa0 A minor detail on the mock trial was I don’t know how to put it in my CV.\xa0 It can’t be categorized as a one person show.\xa0 It was initiated by A Blade of Grass.\xa0 It wasn’t an exhibition in any conventional sense.\xa0 It’s not even part of a group exhibition. Steve Schindler:\xa0 And who was the author? \xa0I mean I guess it’s a group project of some sort. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Yeah. So it goes to copyright questions. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 It’s a performance with many authors. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 It was definitely a performance.\xa0 So all I do in my CV is I have an initial paragraph of narration that says, “and we had a mock trial on April 20 and we got an injunction.” Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So, one interesting thing about your work, Aviva, is how closely you are working with lawyers. \xa0That you are not just sort of using some legal concept as an inspiration to expose an injustice or just draw attention to an issue.\xa0 You are actually working with the law with the idea that you are going to do something within the legal system. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Right. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 And we find we work with people in the art world and artists as well and you know there can be a real difference between how an artist looks at an issue and the way a lawyer looks at an issue.\xa0 And I’m wondering how you feel in your collaborations with lawyers?\xa0 If you have observations about coming to these issues from different places, how easy it has been to work with lawyers or you know what you noticed about the different places you are coming from? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Well as you mentioned at the beginning, I started as a performance artist, and I started in performance art from a conceptual point of view.\xa0 So it’s very easy for me to segue into any other discipline because they are all systemic issues.\xa0 I find the question of what does the law do very parallel and very equivalent to the question of what does art do?\xa0 What does music do?\xa0 What does a forest do?\xa0 It’s all functional questions.\xa0 These are fascinating questions but they all feed into each other.\xa0 I think the great mistake that many of us have made in trying to function in the anthropocene is that we stay in our silos, we stay in our disciplines.\xa0 We think that if it’s a policy issue then it’s just going to be politicians that deal with policy and see how effective that is. Steve Schindler:\xa0 I think lawyers are brilliant in staying within their silos.\xa0 It’s amazing that you can get them to come out.\xa0 One of the interesting things to me just in terms of craft is when you think about the craft of law, you think about writing in a way that tries to narrow and be very specific about meaning.\xa0 You don’t want to draft a contract and have multiple possible interpretations even though sometimes you inadvertently do whereas art is all about multiple meanings and layers.\xa0 And I think it lends itself to be a more flexible way of looking at the world than law can sometime be. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 I’m not sure that’s true. Steve Schindler:\xa0 Okay. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 And one of the things that somebody said to me when I was feeling particularly despairing about this whole process was judges are people.\xa0 They are just as influenced by the media and the conversations they have at dinner as anybody else.\xa0 As far as how specific the details are in the law versus in art there were a lot of ideas I had to think through about exactly where is the permanence of the project? \xa0Exactly where is the art world conversation about the project which was really what swayed the judge.\xa0 But in art you do the same kind of thinking.\xa0 How wide must the mark on the trees be in relation to the trunk?\xa0 Exactly what pigment am I using?\xa0 Exactly how will there be an acoustic ecology that evolves because the paint has buttermilk in it. Steve Schindler:\xa0 That was a question I had speaking of the paint.\xa0 The paint that you are using, I assume that it is friendly to the trees in some way - that just slapping oil paint on trees would probably be inconsistent with what you are trying to do.\xa0 And yet there is a notion in the Visual Artists Rights Act and Copyright in terms of permanence.\xa0 And how does the pigment relate to this sort of notion of permanence? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 From the point of view of being an artist that was one of the most exciting parts of the whole project.\xa0 The slurry that was used to paint is a casein.\xa0 Casein means a pigment that’s mixed with milk.\xa0 In this case we were mixing non-toxic ultramarine blue, which was translucent, with buttermilk.\xa0 And, buttermilk is one of the ways you grow moss in Japanese gardens.\xa0 The mark on these trees we photographed lasted for maybe 2 years, maybe 3 years.\xa0 But because it had the buttermilk it became part of the ecosystem of the tree, of the roots, of the canopy.\xa0 And therefore, in effect, it had a second life that emerged from the tree’s interaction with the art project. Steve Schindler:\xa0 And did you consider, I mean it’s interesting because one of the early cases involved in the Visual Artists Rights Act comes out of Chicago and Kelley Chapman and the case about the gardens.\xa0 And the courts observation in not applying VERA was that these were works that were subject to sort of natural change and evolving and therefore not sufficiently fixed. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Ephemeral. Steve Schindler:\xa0 And so is that something that you considered in selecting the paint? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Absolutely.\xa0 One of the first lawyer that we spoke with after I had spoken to Patrick was Jonathan Richman, and that was one of the first case studies that he brought up and said well that was a ephemeral.\xa0 How are you going to prove that this is permanent?\xa0 That’s when all these issues came in.\xa0 The permanence of the trees themselves, which is the base for the project, the permanence of the relationship to the water shed, to the entire habitat, the permanence of the paint, and how the paint then became integral into a longer term project and how the entire project became the basis for this other much more complex performable piece which is symphonic and operatic. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So what’s next?\xa0 Are you expanding the project physically? \xa0What is on the table for bringing legal action? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Absolutely.\xa0 Well the first task is to continue to expand the project.\xa0 So this interview helps expand the project, because it reaches a wider audience, a wider circle of public opinion.\xa0 The symphonic aspect is very structured conceptually so the very first measure in Peekskill was the overture.\xa0 The first movement of the symphony is the painting and that continues.\xa0 We just did a measure in Canada - Saskatchewan - and there are other inquiries about doing it elsewhere across this continent and some interest outside this continent.\xa0 There is interest in Japan, for example. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Is there a fracking problem in Asia or in Europe in the same way? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 There are fracking problems everywhere one way or another. Steve Schindler:\xa0 And does the fact that the legal system is different require you to sort of start the study anew? Obviously Japan has a different legal system than we do. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 There are different details but the two ideas legally that hold no matter where you are in the world are whether or not the government has the right to take land for private purposes and what protection is there for art and culture in general?\xa0 Then you come up against a lot of big issues.\xa0 For example, someone was interested from China.\xa0 I hate to think what I might come up against there but it would be very interesting. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 There might not be as much process involved, but it would be interesting.\xa0 But you know to Steve’s point you might have a different kind of success in Europe where these moral rights are really engrained in the legal system in a way they are very unfamiliar in the United States even though we have this small protection for visual art. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 On the other hand all these pipelines in this country are going to Europe to compete as a resource with Russia. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 So there may be more material there for you. Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 Yeah.\xa0 So it gets complicated as we go along and it goes deeper and deeper to the question of Earth Rights and the relationship between Earth Rights and art and culture in order to survive this incredibly ominous period in human history. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 Do you think you will actually bring a lawsuit? Aviva Rahmani:\xa0 I would love to.\xa0 I would love to.\xa0 Whether that will happen or not, I don’t know. Katie Wilson-Milne:\xa0 All right.\xa0 We’ll have you back to talk about these other projects. Steve Schindler:\xa0 Thank you so much.\xa0 Thanks for joining us today.

I noticed something was very different about the way Colin ran the business; at times it seemed diametrically opposed to many of the dealers and galleries I was also associated with at the time. Many of the lessons I learned in those early years are still relevant today. He shared many great insights in this conversation, certainly food for thought for emerging artists! | Tom Tischler is a renowned wildlife sculptor specialising in monumental bronze animals.

(2:10:05) | Seventeen years and two reboots ago, Spider-Man took his first swing at the big screen, under the direction of Sam Raimi and supported by a memorable cast including Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe.  Today, with Spidey's cinematic future in question, the Geeks hearken back to that simpler time and spin their own web of praise and deprecation around the original Spider-Movie: the stars, the script, the suits, the sketchy CGI, and so on. Listen today--it's your power AND your responsibility!

(2:27:42) | It was the worst of times for Daredevil; it was the best of times for his readers! It was 1986, and comics auteur Frank Miller was making his second pass at writing Marvel's Daredevil series, accompanied this time by master draftsman David Mazzucchelli as artist. What Miller accomplished over seven revolutionary issues (Daredevil #227-233), collectively titled 'Born Again,' was the total decimation of Matt Murdock's life and Murdock's subsequent triumphant resurgence, in a masterful tale steeped in hardboiled crime fiction and Christian allegory. Join our CGS literary circle (including Doctors of Daredevology Chris Eberle and Kevin Moyer) in an examination of this deft deconstruction and reconstruction of one of Marvel's iconic characters. (2:30:22) | Get set for Saturday-morning sentimentality, as a packed clown-car of six Geeks share fond memories of the cartoon shows they loved most in their younger days (ages 0-18). Best enjoyed with a bowl of cereal or your favorite after-school snack! (WARNING: Discussion gets a little... confessional... at times.) (2:27:32) | Yes, it's one of THOSE episodes--when anything can be discussed, and is!  Topics include the tragic anticlimax of the Vertigo imprint (along with most other imprints at DC); the impending return of the Legion of Super-Heroes, the JSA, and Wally West to active status in the DC Universe; fond reminiscences on Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, plus tons of other televisual tangents; Ian's take on Dark PhoeniX and Toy Story 4, and Shane's on Men in Black International (all sans spoilers); the lengths to which Shane will go to be a good GeekDad; the general enthusiasm of Chris; and more additional asides and random remarks than there are grains of sand on the head of a pin! ...Or something! Just download it! (1:25:20) | We pause now in our ongoing analysis of the Crisis on Infinite Earths maxiseries for a brief intermission following 'Act I' (issues #1-4), during which a variety of Crisis-related short subjects will be presented. From forgotten tie-ins to recent references to vintage fan-press articles to collections and merchandising, Peter and Adam mete out a melange of multiversal morsels to tide you over until the antimatter curtain rises on Crisis #5.

She recently opened up an event space there called Urban Studio, which people can use for parties and classes.

She now teaches online classes, as well as live art retreats, including an upcoming one in Italy. Rae has also published a book of her techniques and projects called Paint Play Explore, and she tells us about the process it took to write and photograph her book. The Show Notes and links for all my episodes can be found at https://suzanneredmond.com/podcast/list-of-artists/ | Susan Lenart is a jewelry artist, silversmith, and designer. Looking for inspiration, she traveled the world to study different cultures and their adornment. Digging even deeper, she studied how things physically connect, not just jewelry pieces but all kinds of things, so she could adapt these connection techniques to her jewelry. She has created a unique style of jewelry, and she shares her techniques through her books, classes, and retreats. The Show Notes and links for all my episodes can be found at https://suzanneredmond.com/podcast/list-of-artists/ | Artist Melissa Partridge is from Massachusetts, and she paints in acrylic with a bold color palette in an abstract manner. It’s very different than traditional New England artists, who often paint scenes of the ocean or the Fall leaves. \xa0Melissa turned to painting as a healing mechanism during some rough times. She’s now created a thriving art business and teaches her intuitive style of painting to others. The Show Notes and links for all my episodes can be found at https://suzanneredmond.com/podcast/list-of-artists/ | Artist Melissa Doty works with watercolors and acryl gouache. She has made an impact with her art through Instagram, and locally, as she was asked to paint a mural and participate in an art initiative in her community. She’s faced some medical challenges, which she does share with us. But despite that, she’s continuing to create new art and put it out into the world. The Show Notes and links for all my episodes can be found at https://suzanneredmond.com/podcast/list-of-artists/ | Ted Vadakan, with his wife Angie Myung, has created a lifestyle brand based in Los Angeles called Poketo. I won’t give away their story of how it started, because Ted covers that so beautifully in our conversation, but I will say that Poketo came from their desire to nourish other creatives in their community. What started as a small brand carrying a few artist-made products is now a thriving creative hub with four storefronts in the LA area. We also talk about their new book called Creative Spaces, which is available now.

No two pieces are the same, and she’s constantly experimenting with different shapes and designs. We talk about how she developed her style, how she finds the different wools, and how she chooses her colors, textures, and patterns. Tammy mostly creates her pieces for commission work, but she is also getting her art into well-known galleries and collaborating with designers and spaces.

She’s a surface designer, and her designs have been printed on walls, shoes, home décor, and even in the rooms of a hotel. Her brightly colored geometric art is well suited for both small and very large items. She’s a go-getter who’s not afraid to cold call someone if she thinks her art would do well there.

You’ll hear from some unsung artists, who are extremely talented and creative, and hopefully you’ll look up their work and be inspired by what they do.

The questions allowed her to see her life from a completely different view allowing all kinds of amazing opportunities to come her way and now she helps other artists do the same. This fascinating conversation continues on with the creative coaches we\'ve been speaking with to dig even deeper and see just how crucial your mindset is to everything you do. If you’ve felt like you’ve been held back, or that everyone else around you is making easier progress your own mind could be the only thing holding you back.\xa0 As you listen to this episode ask yourself where you may have your own mindset blocks that need attention. \xa0 Highlights: 1:07: Rayna\'s Introduction \xa0 2:19: How do you explain mindset and how has changing your own mindset led to better results in your life? 4:38: How long did you stay stuck with a mindset that was holding you back? 10:05: When you switched your mindset after 15 years, did the change stick? 12:58: How to get past the firm belief that anything in life worth doing requires hard work? 17:06: Using your mindset to allow for more time in your life so you can be in flow and allow things to happen naturally 21:28: Moving past judgment of yourself and of others to be creatively free 23:29: Does your mindset allow you to only bring good people and work into your life? 28:20: An example of where mindsets can be created as a child and stick with you for your entire life 30:20: An example of what happens when an artist switches their money mindset issue 33:46: What stops us from moving forward towards our goals even when we know it\'s safe? \xa0 --------- \xa0 Links mentioned in this Episode: The Big Leap Book: https://amzn.to/2U1DfzL \xa0 Check out more of Rayna’s Work at: Web: https://www.flowcoachingforartists.com/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/flow_coaching_for_artists/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Flowcoachingforartists/ \xa0 --------- \xa0 Looking for a fun, easy-going approach to learning art? http://www.pencilkings.com Want to learn artistic mastery? http://www.pencilkings.com/evolve Grab Mitch\'s Book: Digital Artist Career Blueprint Physical Book: https://amzn.to/2VmUybF EBook: https://amzn.to/2Xo4P9g | In this episode, Mitch talks about how you feel about the art that you are making and why if you aren\'t loving it, you could be in for a very rocky road. But even if you don\'t love it and still want to do it there is hope! The reason why it\'s important to realize this is that the people who really love what they are doing are actually quite rare, and this love can take you very far in any direction you want. However, where it gets dangerous is when you are the person who doesn\'t have the love for what you are doing and you are taking advice from someone who does have the love and passion... in this case, no matter what you try to do to follow the advice it\'s going to be very difficult because you\'re missing the key ingredient - LOVE! But what if you don\'t have or can\'t find the love?! Does this mean you should just give up? Not at all! If this is you, then you can use careful selection to find the program that will give you the end result you want or keep trying different creative projects until you find one that lights you up.

Physical Book: https://amzn.to/2VmUybF EBook: https://amzn.to/2Xo4P9g | This interview with Catherine Orer from theArtistEntrepreneur.com was like a rapid-fire Question and Answer session all around the topic of how do you take the next steps to build a viable art career. You\'ll also learn how artists make the process harder than it needs to be so you can get onto the fast track instead of being stuck. If you feel like you aren\'t making progress OR if you\'ve always wondered what your next step should be - listen up because it\'s all covered in this interview! Catherine helps artists all over the world develop their entrepreneurial strategy which goes far beyond just selling their art. She works with artists on their long term vision and then helps them to turn that vision into reality. One idea that has come up several times in past interviews is \'going all-in\' on your art. While that may be the fastest way, it\'s certainly not the only way. Going all-in makes sense when you have a clear vision, a proven plan and the support network to make it all happen. However, without those key pieces it can be a tough road and as you\'ll hear - it\'s completely OK to take it slower. If you\'re just starting out here are your next 3 action steps, it\'s right at 21:38: - Get a consistent body of work - Figure out what your story is - Look at who is around you and start surrounding yourself with the right people who can support your vision and journey Highlights: 2:50 - How artists have a blind spot that is keeping them back from being able to make forward progress 5:00 - How to start challenging everything you do, so you can start getting different results 6:40 - The biggest hurdles that keep artists from growing 9:20 - What roadblocks to we are artists create for ourselves to prevent us from being able to really \'lean in\' to the life that we want 14:45 - Why treating your art like you treat your day job often leads to poor results 15:35 - Why artists are so good at making their journey into a confusing mess 17:40 - The difference between creative and technician work 21:38 - What are the first steps for someone to take who has never sold or shown any of their work, but aspires to grow as an artist 31:20 - How to explain your story as an artist, and what to do if you think you have nothing interesting to say 37:00 - Quick recap of the 3 action items to take the next step with your art career 38:54 - Details on Catherine\'s upcoming workshop on March 14: "How to grow your art business in 2019 without sacrificing your creative practice" ---------  Links mentioned in this Episode: You won\'t be getting a Medal for this:  http://theartistentrepreneur.com/blog/2017/1/21/you-wont-be-getting-a-medal-for-this  Simon Sinek: Start with Why - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA  The Artist\'s Way Julia Cameron: https://amzn.to/2Hf9bKi Check out more of Catherine’s Work at: Web: http://theartistentrepreneur.com  Resources: http://theartistentrepreneur.com/resources-library  Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/catherineorer/  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theartistentrepreneurcoach  Lab: http://theartistentrepreneur.com/lab  ** March 14, 2019 Workshop: http://bit.ly/2ITNC4m --------- Looking for a fun, easy-going approach to learning art? http://www.pencilkings.com Want to learn artistic mastery? http://www.pencilkings.com/evolve Grab my Book: Digital Artist Career Blueprint Physical Book: https://amzn.to/2VmUybF EBook: https://amzn.to/2Xo4P9g | Suzanne Redmond has been interviewing artists for the Left Brain Artist Podcast just like we do with the Pencil Kings show and in this episode of the show she comes on to share a lot of the wisdom she has gained. Formerly being an accountant, Suzanne brings an interesting voice to the creative conversations because she has the business background that when combined with artists can see things in a different light. You\'ll learn from 3 separate stories Suzanne has discovered where artists are using to live more creatively, as well as how she approached the huge project of getting her podcast off the ground and how you can use the same framework for any project you would like to start.

Highlights: 2:00 - What\'s new at DrawingForce.com 4:00 - Thinking forward to using VR in the classroom and teaching his method without being in the same classroom 7:30 - A business idea for the evolution of model photography and reference for artists 10:10 - Where are you seeing students having the most success in the \'new\' virtual format of distance learning 18:18 - The challenge of millennials and motivation 25:00 - The fear of going niche vs trying to do everything 27:35 - Using style to really stand out as an artist 32:00 - The idea of being a world-renowned artist and focusing on just one thing 35:20 - How to accomplish the most important things in your life when you have a big list of things to accomplish 38:30 - Laserbeams vs floodlights in drawing, art, and life Links mentioned in this Episode: Brian Fraud - http://www.worldoffroud.com/  Richard Mcdonald - https://richardmacdonald.com/ Check out more of Mike’s Work at: http://www.DrawingForce.com More Pencil Kings Podcast Episodes: http://www.PencilKings.com/show --------- Looking for a fun, easy-going approach to learning art? http://www.pencilkings.com Want to learn artistic mastery? http://www.pencilkings.com/evolve | Sand is known to the other Evolvers as having a unique ability for keeping the live homework rooms always full of energy and she did not disappoint in this interview! We covered a lot of ground in this episode talking about education, life as a working professional and the passion and drive it takes to make it as a full-time creative. For me, the big insight from Sand was exploring those who choose art as a career vs those who create art for a hobby. I was never able to understand why people who were \'better\' than I was at art would choose what seemed to me like a career path that would be unfulfilling, but Sand helped me to really understand why this is, and it completely makes sense. For some of us the goal is creative expression but that is just our goal, and each person has their own goals an motivations... for example if your goal is safety, security and high pay, then choosing a creative career could seem really scary compared to other options. To put it another way... there are a lot of people who enjoy singing and playing instruments who have no intention of ever being in a band or performing. This doesn\'t mean they can\'t still enjoy music and even be amazingly skilled at it - it\'s just that their goals and priorities aren\'t in alignment with being a professional musician.

Check out: http://www.pencilkings.com | Jan rediscovered her love of art when she found some old paints at a garage sale. The last time she had done any art was when she was 6 years old and took an art class for a month. Those newly acquired paints brought art back into Jan’s life, but even though she was enjoying learning to paint on her own she wanted the mentorship and system to follow to take things to a whole other level to really see how far she could go with her art. That’s when she first heard about the Evolve program, but like many people, she believed that the program was too good to be true. She thought it was silly to think of herself as a more serious artist, and that’s when her husband encouraged her to go for it. Since starting, Jan has been flying through the program and hasn’t looked back. In this interview, you’ll learn: - How she’s able to always find time for her art - Why she was reluctant to show her art to the other students - How painting gives Jan a blissful feeling that keeps her motivated and moving forward Highlights: 1:20 - What did your art study look like before the program? 3:50 - How did you get back into art? 5:20 - Jan heard about Evolve but thought it was too good to be true 6:25 - Why Jan almost didn\'t sign up 8:05 - What does your family think of your work now? 10:27 - Explaining the bliss feeling that comes when making art 12:30 - What Jan is looking forward to painting 14:40 - When you\'re not making art, how are you spending your time? 15:30 - What is your strategy for getting things done? 23:30 - What do to if you think you have no time 24:47 - What would you tell someone who just started with Evolve to inspire them? 29:10 - Why were you reluctant to share your work? Are you interested in learning to paint together with Jan and Mitch?

In fact, he has never taken any art classes before participating in the http://www.EvolveArtist.com program. In this interview, you can see how far he has come in just a few months. What\'s interesting about Daniel\'s journey is that while he is creative; he is first and foremost a musician and had never considered developing the skills to become a visual artist. He will show you how even though art isn\'t the main passion he is still managing to find a place for art in his life, and receiving the calm and relaxing benefits that come with making art. He also stresses the importance of having a system to follow that allows for confidence to be built naturally. Highlights: 3:40 - What\'s your motivation for doing art? 5:22 - How do your skills compare to the other students in the program? 7:20 - What makes Daniel\'s choice of subject matter special, and examples of his work 10:30 - How are you feeling when you sit down to do a painting? 13:20 - Having a system for art takes away the fear 14:30 - What\'s your strategy for time management and getting time to study art? 20:05 - What would you tell someone who started Evolve today to inspire and help them get started? 22:20 - Once your skills are at a professional level, what are you looking forward to creating? To see the entire curriculum Daniel is following and join the program, visit http://www.EvolveArtist.com | Have you always wanted to create art that gets noticed, but not sure if you have the talent to make it happen? If so, you\'ll love Michael\'s story as he is currently working through Block 4 of the Evolve Artist program (http://www.evolveartist.com) where students have learned the skills necessary to create professional level illustrative paintings. In this interview, he will tell you that talent has nothing to do with it because it\'s all about putting in the work which makes even the highest levels of art attainable to anyone with the desire to learn. When Michael started with Evolve Artist just over a year ago, he wasn\'t sure if it would work for him, but he knew that this could be his last real shot at being able to learn the skills that would give him the ability to create the work that he really wanted to make. Throughout his life, he always had a creative calling and had tried a number of different ways to learn and improve but was never quite happy with where he was with his art. He made that fateful decision to join Evolve a year ago and now he couldn\'t be happier. Michael has the same challenges as most other students... there\'s family commitments, work commitments, and even travel commitments, but he\'s prioritized his painting and his results are now clearly on display for anyone to see. This is the third interview we\'ve had with students in the Evolve program and there are patterns starting to emerge: - Every student has had a friend or family member want to hire them to create a piece of art (well before they are finished the program) - Every student made the commitment to do the work - None of the students claim to have any special talent or ability that\'s allowed them to develop the mastery they are showing with their work. So if you\'ve always wanted to learn to create head-turning artwork, and have the willingness to put in the work, there\'s nothing really stopping you from taking the next step to create your own artistic legacy.

Lauren is the mother to two sons and attributes motherhood as the experience that reconnected her to her art and sent her in the direction of making art a full time career. She shares about the collaborative paintings and drawings she makes with her sons Keegan and Dylan. Lauren and her boys have exhibited the work in an effort to bring awareness to Keegan’s journey with autism. We talk a bit about her big life shift- moving from Florida to Cleveland a few years ago.

Natalie’s work playfully pushes controversial issues, creating an accessible entry point for unpacking matters of tension in today’s political and social landscape. We have a great discussion about her journey as an artist- how she happened upon soft sculpture after a career in video and digital media. She met someone on the subway in NYC who taught her to bind a quilt and she spent the next year secretly making 80 soft sculptures of bloated guns in her tiny basement apartment! After an article was released about the sculptures, her work exploded and she hasn’t looked back since.At the time of this interview, Natalie was pregnant with her daughter, Petra. It was fun to discuss what she anticipated her life and career to be like once her daughter came (and I’m sure, now that Petra is several months old, Natalie may have realized a few thing | In this episode I interview Beth Winterburn, an Artist/Mother living in Memphis, TN.

Her work has been featured on HGTV, Crate and Barrell, West Elm, Anthropology and locally in Memphis at River Oaks and Catherine and Mary’s Restaurants.Beth and I discuss her work- how her interest in math, chemistry and architecture shows up in the compositions she paints.

She talks about her journey as a dancer and how it led her a career in performance art, and a wider outreach supporting and working for artists. We dive into the time in her life that caused her to start Procreate Project, when she showed up to London pregnant and ready to engage in an arts community that supported mothers and realized one didn’t exist. This led Diana to found the pioneering arts organization that supports the development of contemporary artists who are also mothers working across art-forms.

She lives in Seattle, Washington with her wife and young son. Her paintings are semi-abstract and explore personal biography and landscape. We dive deep into her painting practice, chatting about the ways she conceptualizes ideas for paintings and how she sets up parameters to create a body work. I ask about the abstracted characters that show up in her paintings and find out their meaning and how she uses them repeatedly. We discuss the many ways her painting practice parallels her life as a parent, the difficulties she experienced during the early years of raising her son. She also explains the current body of work she is making called Red Country, in which she is traveling to the individual states in the US that voted in President Donald Trump. She is making paintings from her visits, reflecting on the landscapes she views and the people she meets.

At the prompting of her sister-in-law, Jill used the #100dayproject to get herself back into her studio practice postpartum and did a series of work that reflected on her experiences breastfeeding and caretaking.Jill is currently a teaching artist at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach. We talk about her role at the museum that includes working for their community outreach programs.  A few other topics we discuss include her past experience teaching visual arts classes to inmates at Homestead Correctional Institution, a women’s prison in South Florida, artist guilt and mom guilt, and how she makes time to create while working a full time job.

Before becoming a mother, Sarah actually believed the idea that it was nearly impossible to be an artist and parent. She decided to dismantle this belief and had a child during her MFA program, dedicating herself to making work about the experience.Today, Sarah Irvin is practically an expert on parent artists!

We talk about life in Brooklyn and how difficult it can be to parent in the city while also trying to find time and finances to support your art. Allison shares about her studio practice, how she avoids concrete or arbitrary goals for the sake of freedom and play and how she structures her week to get in the studio while remaining the primary caretaker for her children. Allison’s work explores the relationship between decoration and function and similarly, how painting operates as both an object and an idea.

Ink, gold leaf, and handmade paint on paper.This painting was inspired by Lucy Mack Smith’s description of the urim and thummim as “2 smooth 3 cornered diamonds.” I imagined this mysterious tool in geometric form as triangles – one striving heavenward, the other reaching earthward – until a bridge of light was formed.\xa0Using compasses and square, I built up a composition of triangles. Gradually a pattern revealed itself. While this design has its roots in a traditional Islamic pattern, as I drew and painted, it became something new. The process of discovering a new pattern feels to me very much like the process of revelation.\xa0I make my own paints – my teachers in London taught that the discipline of preparing one’s materials from the earth was participation refining and purifying matter, elevating it from something base to something spiritual. Preparing my colours becomes a meditation on creativity and Creation. Subtle textures sparkle up and down to make a pillar of light. I chose gold leaf and crushed minerals to reflect and refract the light. Even the glittery black was gathered from the seaside on the island of Hormuz. \xa0At the very centre of the composition, the navel is marked in blood red – the point where heaven and earth meet. Tiny gold triangles at the top and base of the composition echo the shapes Mother Smith described.', 'chan_desc': 'The Zion Art Podcast looks into the most influential art and artists with intimate interviews with leading scholars, artists, and collectors.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/b7/a4/a1/b7a4a17d-2410-6dc0-006e-7c94b9201db8/mza_4218356533280450021.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-04-12'}}

Season is coming, let\'s start getting ready now. So, a few days a week I like to get up early and work out, well, generally, I actually always like getting up early. But usually I don\'t need an alarm clock. My internal clock I\'ve found is usually pretty good and assuming the previous evening\'s beer count is of a reasonable number, I can get up without the alarm. And this morning I almost missed my workout, why? Because it was still dark outside and I thought I had more time. So that tells me summer is winding down. Normally that is a bummer, yes, not for me. It means the English Premier League is about to start, and most importantly, it means Q4 is on the way. So your primary goal, from now until Q4, \'til Black Friday and Cyber Monday and all of the craziness of the holiday sales season, is two-fold. One, you gotta get your digital house in order, which we\'re gonna delve into shortly. And two, is to realize from now \'til then, 55 days to go at this point, \'til the start of Q4, your goal is to be the top of the mind of your buyers and potential buyers. You wanna be in front of their eyeballs. You wanna be aware, or you wanna be noticed, and you wanna have their attention and you need to start planting those seeds now so when the buying frenzy starts you\'re completely in the game. Now let\'s talk about the state of the nation. This show\'s not about politics, nor do I ever want it to be, so nothing political here, but the economic data right now, by most objective reads is really good. Consumer purchases are way up and looking strong. So this year, portends to be, I think, a really, really solid holiday sales period. And I think it\'s gonna be way higher than previous years. So things are looking really good in that department. And if ever there was a time to get after it, the time\'s now. Now the good news here, you know I\'ve been running fourth quarter sales for pretty much my whole marketing career slash life and I\'ve running them specifically for selling art and photography online for the last 10 years or so across two different companies. And I\'ve seen what the results look like when you\'re just getting started. I\'ve seen the results when people are picking up steam. I\'ve seen the results when folks are on fire. In all cases, the results, I know, no big surprise here, they\'re really based on what you put in. The steps you take ahead of time, getting your digital house in order, being top of mind, the roughs and sets, you do those. No matter what stage of the game you are, you can get great results. And moreover, Q4 comes around every year it turns out. Once a year, you do the work, you get better. The knowledge you gain in properly executing these sales will really form the basis of momentum that you can just move into your next sale and your next sale and your next. All you have to do is get in the game. Follow our playbook. We have a fantastic one, and run it. You do the work. It\'s not any more difficult than that. It\'s really just not. So if we do the work, we win. Let\'s do the work. Let\'s do the work. And we\'re gonna make sure that you\'re focused on the right things and running the right playbook that we know gets results. And literally 90% of this is just showing up. It\'s being ahead of time, like we are now. 55 days to go until Q4 starts as of recording. And just not, not, not starting too late. You need to start thinking about all of this now, | 037: Art Merchandising + Additional Revenue SourcesWhy the proper merchandising of your artwork can make all the difference, and thinking outside the box to expand your revenue sources and generate additional income.Show NotesFor an example of awesome merchandising, check out how Mathieu Laca shows off his metal prints in this video.checkRate and Review the Art Marketing Podcast on iTunescheckDownload the PDF of the show notes + transcribeTranscribeRead the transcribeComing up on the Art Marketing Podcast we\'re talking about the three ways you can grow your business, merchandising, and multiple revenue sources, and how properly executed merchandising can be a massive lever for growth in your business. So what are the three ways that you can grow your business? You\'ve likely heard me rant about this in the podcast before. Number one, the number one way, the one most everybody focuses on is for you to get more customers, really, really, to get more customers, to get more customers into the door of your business, that\'s the number one way. The number two way is AOV, which stands for average order value. So you increase the dollar amount of the sale that you do make and there\'s a number of ways to do that. The age-old marketing example, the one in the textbooks, do you want fries with that? Instead of just a burger, they\'re now getting a burger and fries, and so the AOV, the average order value goes up. And by the way, quick throwback from the last episode, what is marketing? A possible definition, anyway, get attention and you have an ask, do you want fries with that? You have their attention, they\'re right there, you make an ask for fries the worst thing that can happen is they say, no, many end up saying, yes. The number three way is repeat business. So you get your customers to come back and purchase from you again.And if you\'re working on growing your business currently whether you are explicitly focused on it, or not, by definition you\'re working on one of these three levers to drive growth and more sales in your business to make more money, and merchandising is a big deal. It\'s a word that encompasses a lot, but brands go to great, great lengths, to properly execute on it, it\'s why all the shops on Fifth Avenue spend so much money on their window displays. It\'s why often times you see the photo of the new Porsche and there\'s a beautiful-looking lady or man driving it, or a beautiful-looking person sitting next to the one that\'s driving it. It\'s why at ArtStoreFronts we spend so much time creating our wall, preview tool, our media-types browser, and the AR feature for the websites. Turns out, we humans are extremely visual creatures. And so if you can help sort things for us visually how cool we might look in the new suit, how we get that car, we\'ll immediately have a beautiful human on our arm sitting right next to us right afterwards. And yes, when a customer can visualize a piece of art on their wall they are certainly one step closer to buying it, and so I love merchandising, it\'s a big deal. And I think the genesis of this episode came from a few different places. Number one, it all dovetails with a huge new project I\'m working on at ArtStoreFronts, but I\'m gonna into that later. But merchandising, and specifically a proper presentation, of an artists or photographers offerings, is a pet peeve of mine, it just is, it\'s more than a pet peeve, it\'s a serious erk, it\'s a frustration it grinds my gears. Why most photographers and artists spend little time thinking about it. Those that do either do a half, you know what job, of doing it, or don\'t do it enough. And dagnabbit, I\'m scratching my own itch here too. I\'m incredibly passionate about merchandising personally. I understand all too well it is such a lever to drive business, it\'s huge.

Why I can afford to lose money on them and you can\'t. And some strategy and perspective on how best to approach your marketing going forward. Hey guys, Patrick with you here and if this is the first time listening to the show you can likely ignore this bit. For you loyal listeners, we, the podcast team and I, we took a trip down to hiatus and it turns out the beaches in hiatus are quite nice. And next thing you know we were supposed to come back and our flight got delayed. A couple of us lost our passports. We were stuck down in hiatus for awhile. But now we\'re back and we\'re fired up to back and fired up to resurrect the art marketing podcast and get it going again. I think the last episode was sometime around December-ish so we\'ve definitely been off of it for a couple of months. Sorry for that. Thank you to everybody for the encouragement. We got lots of emails and got lots of messages in the messenger box saying get it going again, get it going again, get it fired back up. So it\'s nice to be missed. Totally appreciate that. Coming back energized and ready to get into it. So if you\'re an artist or a photographer, you likely have some questions, you\'ll always have some questions about your marketing. Where should I be spending my marketing dollars? What is the hottest venue I can be marketing in right now? Do I need to be on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter or Pinterest? What\'s the best way to grow my email list? Should I have a YouTube channel? Should I start doing the show circuit? How could I get started, right? The same questions constantly, constantly, constantly come up. All great questions. All important questions. All questions that we love delving into in this podcast. And there is no unfortunate one answer to solve all of them. It\'s complicated, right? It depends, right? It\'s different for every situation you\'ll understand. All of that aside, I\'ve come to realize, especially through some work recently, that far too many people are attempting to answer those questions and not ask the next question. And what is the next question? What are you going to do after you\'ve answered those questions? What are you going to do after you\'ve acquired some attention, an email, a lead, a potential customer, even a customer, what are you going to do after the fact?\xa0Because if you have not thought through and you don\'t have a strategy in place for what happens after the fact, you\'re putting yourself in a tough spot. And I think, as I unpack things here, the genesis for this episode really came, it came from a number of different things. And let me set it up, you know we continue to be running a bunch of contests on Facebook Messenger with many chat. The episodes not about that at all, but we\'ve been doing that a bunch lately. And during the course of that, and you know I think we first started running those contests and getting into that as a tactic on like I think the first podcast episode. It would have been January 18 and what are we, we\'re mid April, so it\'s been awhile. And we\'ve leveled up our game quite significantly since then and it\'s not attempting to brag, you know the team and I have had plenty of practice, so inevitably you get much better at running them, right? And I\'ll include some braggadocio show notes, some images for the show notes, so you can see what I mean. | 34: Learning from Black Friday 2018With the hottest eCommerce week of the year behind us, we take a look at the most important lessons we learned and how you can implement them to massively improve your next art promotion.Show NotescheckFor more on validating your work: Episode 13 and Episode 14.For more on doing things that don\'t scale: Episode 22.\xa0checkQ4 is ending soon.

Hope you had a tremendous Thanksgiving holiday. I think it\'s a fair assumption, I think, to say you know we all have so much to be thankful for. I am truly thankful for all of you that listen to this podcast, love you guys. I\'m thankful for you. For our non American listeners, while Thanksgiving was perhaps not a part of your last week, I hope you had a good Black Friday, Cyber Monday. I\'m certainly thankful for you guys, too.Now I\'m not sure if any of you\'ve paid attention to the headlines and articles that have come out since, both of the holidays have been done. I love diving into these pieces every year as I think they\'re just really quite toned about the direction of our world and the corresponding economies. So, what jumped out at me this year as a macro headline I would say, Not In The Black Yet, It is Tough Times for Brick and Mortar Retailers, I think. Brick and Mortar\'s Traffic is Still in the Negative Column, was the headline on Forbes. Black Friday 2018, A Not So Wild Day for American Shoppers, said the New York Times. Brick and Mortar Stores Cling to Life, Put Black Friday Deals Online, said Axios. Black Friday Shoppers Choose Their Screens Over Brick and Mortar Stores, said Reco Daily. And their stat was that Black Friday foot traffic to traditional stores fell between five and nine percent compared to last year. What this tells us, no surprises here, but online shopping continues to be killing brick and mortar. It is literally a death by a thousand cuts, one by one by one, bit by bit, online transaction by online transaction. Sales and their corresponding dollars are certainly moving online. What does that mean for photographers and artists who are trying to sell art online? It means that the party is heading even more online, and if you wanna be a part of it you need to be up and online and running and marketing, and growing that portion, that pillar, that section of your business. To which I get the often hurled retort, "Not for me, Patrick. "I\'m still selling great in my brick and mortar gallery, "so I don\'t need to be online." To which I always respond, that is great, stoked for you, but it\'s not a zero sum game, is it? Online is a different vertical and you ignore it at your peril. Doing well in a gallery, by all means ride until she kicks you, but do not ignore online, it takes time to build up. Also what jumped at me, Amazon Cyber Monday was the biggest shopping day in the company\'s history. I read that on Tech Crunch. What more does one need to read? Everything is going online. No lines, no finding parking spaces, no brawling over who\'s going to get the new 60 inch flat screen before they\'re sold out. So, everything\'s going online. And certainly, you know audience of one here, but not sure about you but the headlines certainly squared with my personal shopping behavior. Did I buy a decent clip of stuff and take advantage of the deals? Yes, I did. Did I go to a bunch of brick and mortar retailers to do it? No, I did not. I found and bought pretty much all of my deals online. I had to go to Home Depot for regular stuff, and they got me on a few things I needed, but other than that 90% of my shopping activity was online.

How to get started when you don\'t have a warm audience to show ads to. Otherwise known as the chicken and egg scenario. So the Arts Storefronts team has been growing a bit as of late. We\'re growing as a company, so we\'ve been hiring. Now an argument can be made that we\'re growing as a company because we\'re getting much better at what we do. And I think to a large portion, that would be true. But also, when the fourth quarter is approaching, artists and photographers out there tend to get real active and rightfully so. Everybody knows this is the time to be selling art online. So we tend to see a flood of new customers and want to get set up and ready to capitalize on Q4. So we\'ve got to staff up to meet the demand. Now over the years of hiring, we sort of evolved our hiring practices quite a bit to the system that we\'re at now. And I think early on, this is a concept I borrowed for hiring from a guy named Matt Mullenweg, who, he\'s the guy who founded WordPress. Just genius kid, unbelievable what this guy\'s achieved. He wrote a piece for the Harvard Business Review a few years back on WordPress\' hiring practices.\xa0And I also heard him kind of detail some aspects of it on a few different podcasts. And I\'ll throw a link to the show notes of his Harvard piece, which I think you should read if it piques your interest. It\'s awesome. Now they run this concept of tryouts for future hires. And so they put their listings out, they screen their candidates like everybody else does, interviews and phone interviews and the like, and they narrow down the list to a few candidates that they basically provincially hire. Provincially. Provisionally hire. And let\'s just say we\'ll use three for our example.\xa0You\'ve got a job, descriptions out, you\'ve been through all that and you hire all three of them to provisionally start doing the job. They start working on the job on some sample projects. They get paid in a provisional fashion. Now they do this so they can formally evaluate any new hires with literally some real on-the-job experience and training to see if they\'re fit, right? You have them doing a real task that would really be part of their job, and you get to see how they work and how they communicate. And it\'s sort of like, it\'s like dating before you get married. And it\'s great because it gives both sides of the equation, the ability to get to know the other person, see whether or not it fits, see whether or not you want to get in bed for a marriage, a career. And it\'s really an amazing, amazing system for a number of different reasons. And at Arts Storefront, we\'ve sort of added a few of our own twist to kind of make the process our own. And why am I telling you this? Yeah, great, Patrick, ASF\'s growing, good for you guys. Can we get back to the art marketing tips now, please? Very much. So stick with me for a moment. I\'m gonna get you there, I\'m gonna get you there. Now two great things about this process, and there are many more, let me tell you. But two great ones are the following. Number one, when you run tryouts, when you hire in this fashion, number one, this process tends to obliterate your cognitive biases towards people. What do I mean? As humans, and especially as humans hiring people, we end up having these biases. We are naturally drawn towards the candidates that we like, | How to Get Your Art NoticedQ4 is coming...How to use email, FB, and FB & IG ads to warm up your audience and how to get your art noticed.Show NotescheckAlyssa\'s Email from MailchimpcheckAlyssa\'s Blog PostcheckEmoji One Chrome ExtensioncheckActual FB post we created from Alyssa\'s emailcheckRelated Episode:\xa0029: Your 4th Quarter Marketing AuditcheckRelated Episode:\xa0030: How to Create LTV Audiences for Facebook/Instagram AdscheckRate and Review the Art Marketing Podcast on iTunes3 Part Video on Post Creation + AdsBrought To You By Art StorefrontsWe help artists & photographers open and run their own art gallery business online.Popular Episodes46ACFEHere are our most listened-to episodesArt Marketing TopicsWhat do you want to learn more about next?#seo#facebook#instagram#email marketing#copywriting#case studiesRecent Episodes“This is do-able, actionable, and well explained.I just finished listening to all the podcasts over the last few days.

What\'s up, guys and gals? Patrick, thank you so much for listening. So on this podcast, we tended to talk a lot about playbooks, right? The concept of marketing, strategies, and tactics for specific events. Call it The Fourth Quarter, like it\'s coming up or Black Friday or Mother\'s Day Playbook. And we\'re constantly updating these playbooks with sort of the latest, greatest marketing tactics that we feel will help photographers and artists move the needle to view the most effective that they can be with their marketing and really to only spend time, energy and effort on what we believe to be the highest leverage activity. So that all comes down to focus. So today\'s podcast is gonna rehash something we\'ve already covered. We\'re gonna update it and we\'re gonna explain how we\'re now sort of recommending it\'s inclusion as part of your overall fourth quarter marketing strategy, which is not something we\'ve done before. This is the first time that we\'ve included it, sort of in this lens.\xa0And really, even if independent of the fourth quarter, it\'s just a fantastic inclusion to your overall marketing strategy anytime all year. So depending on where you are in your marketing efforts, this might be something that is just out of reach currently. It just is. It might be something that you\'ve been thinking about but you haven\'t done yet, or even something that you maybe have already run. But I wanna explain why I think there\'s gonna be some value in this episode for wherever you are in your journey, right? So if it\'s out of reach at this point, running a contest on Facebook just sounds daunting, you\'re like there\'s no way. Patrick, you\'re out of your mind. This is so technical. Don\'t worry, it\'s all good. Even if you missed the fourth quarter, I want this on your radar. I want you to be able to see the inner workings of these things going down. And in the coming weeks, I think if you look at \'em, you touch \'em, you taste \'em, it\'s gonna put you in a great spot to run one, to get started whenever you\'re ready. Even if it\'s the middle of 2019. If you\'re thinking about running one, you\'ve learned a little bit but you haven\'t run one yet, hopefully, this will give you some clarification of the process and hopefully some motivation to get in the game, to give the contest idea a shot. And if you\'ve already run one, then you\'re just gonna absolutely love this because we have some new and creative ways to level up this tactic, to, if this sounds even possible, to get even more ROI out of it, which is just crazy to say. Homework. This episode builds on a few episodes we\'ve already released, as well as the ultimate guide to running contests on Facebook with Messenger and many chat that we put out, which is just a crazy robust source step-by-step. All the videos, every single solitary artists, customer, I think, that\'s run one of these has gone through that process step by step and we look at those videos and it can really walk you through it.

What you need to know to sell more art this year than you did last year. And we cover how to perform an audit of your marketing style. So let me start with a question, where are you at? To which my mother would promptly reply, never end a sentence in a preposition. But it doesn\'t matter. If you\'re just getting started, if you\'re picking up steam, or if you are literally on fire in your art business and especially as it pertains to your marketing acumen. Regardless of where you are, I\'m pretty willing to bet that wherever you are in your journey, making more sales this fourth quarter, the fourth quarter, is probably something you\'re interested in doing, right?So, good. Guess what? We\'re pretty good at selling photography and art in the fourth quarter. We have playbooks, I mean step by step guides, on how to do just about everything. And last year our customers sold more art in the fourth quarter in the complete history of our company by far. And you wanna venture a guess why? They worked on their marketing, specifically that they ran whatever version of our playbooks they were comfortable running and that they had the acumen at that point in time to pull off. Guess what else? I bet we more than double, maybe even triple that figure this year, and that\'s not just because we have more customers. And the answer to that, why is that gonna be the case, and it\'s because our customers ran the playbook last year.\xa0And again, in whatever truncated, pared-down version they were comfortable doing, and they picked up that level of experience. That level of experience with the ads and the copy and emailing and all the various different aspects of running the playbooks. They leveled up, they got that experience, they\'re gonna be able to build on that experience and run a more advanced version of the playbook this year. And that very same level of experience, that\'s what I want. I want you, all the loyal podcast listeners, no matter where you are in your business, to get a level, some level, take some steps in the right direction this fourth quarter. I mean, you guys are going to be photographers and artists for the rest of your lives. There is no better time to get started in that, in that marketing and running the playbook for these types of deal situations than today. Take your first step and you get going on.So, all right, fine, we\'re done with the rah rah. The good news, in this episode we\'re gonna cover some advice regardless of where you are in your business journey. And again, just getting started, picking up steam, on fire, right? More good news is the advice is largely the same regardless of where you are with some nuance, some trade crafts and extra bells and whistles thrown in here or there. Even more good news is you can get the majority of this set up for completely free if needs be, up to investing a very small amount up to those that are spending big bucks on their marketing stacks as well as their ad stacks. And finally, there\'s still time to get this done. It\'s August, and so this will probably get released sometime this week, August 23rd, August 24th, something like that. We still have some time, right? Summer\'s over, it\'s winding down, kids are going back to school, it\'s time to get serious. We have September in front of us, which is a great month to get everything prepped and then October\'s here. The end of the year\'s coming and it\'s game time.

My question is about blogs. I would like to start one on my webpage. Do I start with current photos/events, or go back to the beginning of the year\xa0Boden Eanes 1. As someone just starting, what’s your advice on contracts. As starting we don’t often have the client base to cover costs of lawyers fees to write one or should that just be a personal investment into ur business. General contract advice 🙂 \xa02. When setting up a styled shoot to build/add to your portfolio, what’s the expected cost for a beginner? Personally I am willing to invest some money to get my business off the ground, which is required in some areas, but should this be something we try at the beginning or should this be something once business is up and can support the costs? \xa03. At what point should I set up a website? I don’t have a client base yet so I don’t know if I should try to get my portfolio built more and after I have clients set it up, or set it up right from the start, or somewhere in between? \xa04. If you do in person sales and not a shoot/burn style - do you still deliver digitals or are you a shoot/burn photographer who also does in person sales to deliver more product? I understand this could vary a little bit depending on wedding vs portrait photography. \xa0Steven Morrow When starting to transition from just taking photos as a hobby, to starting the business; should I have paying clients first, a web presence, or business license?

After David shares with us his three favorite Landscape Photography areas and tips for newbs on how to take the most advantage of these areas, we learn from David a great perspective on light. How to work with it, anticipate it and he names several situations that should be considered "epic light" even though it isn\'t the classic blown up sky.Then David completely turns 180-Degrees and shares with us one of the most envious tales I have ever heard about epic light out at Factory Butte! His image actually has a Rainbow perfectly symmetrical arching over Factory Butte with a sky crazy pink! Instagram link to that Factory Butte Image: https://www.instagram.com/p/BllUKc9Dgic/What an amazing shot! Dang we really are jealous! Beyond the amazing image, David shares with us the juggling act he was going through while trying to capture this shot and the endurance and optimism required of him and his friend Paul Rojas to even STAY in the Factory Butte area; especially after what happened to them the night leading up to this sunrise! Lastly, I share the Instagram message attached to that image from David that talks about a principle that what we know as "epic light" is completely relative and will change as you gain more experience in Landscape Photography.

And not just Fine Art, but actual families come to her from all over to get a spectacular and candid family portrait! Jenna shares the challenges, the gear, the dedication of her models and her crazy determination to experience exactly what her models are experiencing! If they don\'t get a wetsuit, she doesn\'t get a wetsuit. Whether it is a freezing cold lake or a chlorine picture ruining pool, Jenna is dressed in the same comforts or lack thereof that her models are. In the second half, Jenna shares a story about a mystery figure in the water next to her model and it is in the picture here over on her instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BHREyfwhlmA/ Jenna also shares her experience giving a Ted talk, one of my personal goals in life, and the details behind the scenes on what Ted Talks require of you is way off what I expected!We had a blast hearing about her experiences and crazy admired her tenacity going for a type of photography that has so many quirks about it that there are unpredictable challenges like what makeup her models have to wear underwater! It really is a fascinating story and we think whether you would actually someday consider doing underwater photography yourself or not, you will love to hear about Jenna\'s work!

It was a true blast being a part of it and I can\'t wait for 2020!Join us at the Create Photography Retreat in 2020! https://createphotographyretreat.com/ | Today we are joined by Enrico Fossati all the way from Italia! A land I have a true love for and feel myself longing to return all the time! In this episode we are also joined by my father acting as my co-host who also helps me with any Italian translation.We begin the episode hearing Enrico\'s bucket list locations and to no surprise he ALSO can\'t wait until he can get out to New Zealand! A bucket list location for seemingly ALL photographers! :D Enrico recommends to us the Val d\'Aosta area of the Italian and French Alps for a location that we all add to OUR bucket lists if we are interested in a dynamic, more wild version of the Dolomites in Italy. And he describes many locations in Italy that we all should practice our hand at landscape photography on even though they can be certainly over photographed by all tourists who go there. In the second half of this shorter episode, Enrico shares with us a story of a crazy weather day that he must seek refuge from the thunder and lightning and finds himself in a position to capture his most famous image. A shot inspired by his love of the Lord of the Rings city of Rivendell.Throughout the podcast, Enrico  recommends to us two artists that inspire his work: John Howe who did the Conceptual Design for Lord of the Rings. You can see some of his work here. And Albert Bierstadt who is famous for paintings of famous landscapes from the United States. His final recommendation to us, is to know the area and learn the times when the light is best. Not everywhere is "best" to capture around sunrise or sunset so that can\'t be an automatic thought as a Landscape Photographer. You need to come back often and experience the area. If you are in a location you don\'t have more than a day or two there come early so you have 6+ hours to experience the area and you might just find that the harsher mid-day light is the best light for that landscape and offers you wondrous opportunities to create a composition you will never forget!Follow Enrico Fossati\'s work here:Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enrico.fossati/?hl=it500PX: https://500px.com/efossatiFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/enricofossatiphotography/Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/efossati/ | My Milky Way Hero, Royce Bair, joins me on the podcast to share his thoughts on the recent Nightscaper Conference & the changes coming to the 2020 Nightscaper Conference in Kanab, Utah!

The audio quality from Josh gets better as the podcast goes along as he gets closer to his mic on his end. Less little echo and much louder. Best in segment two starting at 36:26.So after an intro and admittedly a little too much joking around we get into Josh\'s travels, workshops and all the world traveling he has done. 8:31We ask him where he would consider his top three favorite Landscape Photography locations. One of them quickly becomes one of our top five bucket list locations! In order of his mentioning them, China, New Zealand\'s Fiordland National Park area & the High Sierras of California. Follow Kyle Oberman here the instagrammer that is living in China and has some great images of not oft traveled locations in China: https://www.instagram.com/kyleobermann/28:30Then we get the What Would Joshua Cripps Do method of Composing an image where you consider the compositional balance and then you consider the emotion you are feeling. Then you convey that emotion with your shutter choice. Josh gets to an awesome location, gets his camera out and thinks "What am I trying to convey? What is speaking to me? Is there motion in the scene? How Do I feel?" and with all this he gets his portfolio worthy shot.36:26In the second segment, Josh shares with us the craziest world travel story I may have ever heard! Let\'s just say that there are tiny ponies involved in a decision only 20-year-olds would think to do. Oh to be 20-something again!

If you have never heard of his podcast or have been considering listening to it, this is your chance to hear from the creator yourself what makes his podcast different interesting and why I definitely recommend it as a way to feel like you are hanging out with some of your favorite Landscape Photographers. Listen to F-Stop Collaborate & Listen here:https://www.mattpaynephotography.com/f-stop-collaborate-and-listenAs we start getting into the Mountaineering Photography discussion I check whether he made the leap to a smaller camera body mirrorless system and he has as expected from someone paying attention to every pound in his bag. I am able to play the devil\'s advocate and get some really candid feedback from a guy who switched from Nikon to Sony and what the cons are if any to the Sony mirrorless options out there. Matt\'s Why he chose Sony article & weight spreadsheet: https://www.mattpaynephotography.com/choosing-sony-full-frame-camera-equipment-for-backpacking-and-weight-calculation-toolIt should be noted, Matt doesn\'t have a Sony A7R3 and so he was not able to comment specifically on that model. Then we hear about Matt\'s Photography process, how he approaches his compositions as well as some inspiring advice on how we all can benefit from changing our perspective and expectations when going out to do photography so that we can get the most out of the experience. And keep the motivation to keep on keeping on!To round out the podcast, Matt shares with us some mountaineering adventures and words of caution for those of you considering more hiking and mountaineering photography in your future!The awesome Zeiss Loxia 21mm f2.8 lens he was gushing about:https://amzn.to/2ELyyTmCamera Lens Sleeve similar to the one he talked about:https://amzn.to/2GAzHim Freedom of the Hills Book: https://amzn.to/2LtcygALaowa 15mm F2:https://amzn.to/2LwqXJdSimilar Portable Anker PowerCore 20100:https://amzn.to/2BEJvlIGaia GPS:https://www.gaiagps.com/Lists of John website with all the mountain peaks of the US:https://listsofjohn.com/ Follow Matt Payne at: https://www.mattpaynephotography.com/ & http://www.100summits.com/', 'chan_desc': "Photog Adventures is about chronicling and sharing the stories of Aaron King's adventures getting out there with his camera.

Join our hosts as they digest this influential--if short-lived--movement and its embrace of the death of the artist and deskilling of the art object. | Wassily Kandinksy was a major aesthetic innovator--he saw spiritual symbolism in color, sought to translate musical sounds into painterly shapes, and is credited for painting the first entirely abstract canvas in 1913.

The public space becomes his painterly surface and nontraditional materials, ranging from water, fans, air currents, color dye, fog, ice and moss, become his tools for mark-making.

When I’m shooting images that include the sky, or anything significant that’s sky related, I usually like some good clouds to add interest. Of course, there’s some types of clouds that totally get socked in and that just stinks when you want that overview, the vista or what-not. When that happens I know I have to shift my expectations and what I’m looking for in order to get good images.For all the photos, please check out the Latitude Photography Facebook group, or my website here: https://brentbergherm.com/all-about-clouds/ | Links mentioned in episode:LensRentals refer a friend link:\xa0https://share.lensrentals.com/x/hrt2mHIf 10 people use this I’ll put a poll in the facebook groups to ask what I should rent next.https://brentbergherm.com/workshops/palouse-shoot-n-print-workshop/Come to the Palouse and learn to print!Trip ReportWorkshop basic info.

They are Exposure Averaging, Segmentation, a series I started several years ago, and expectations about color and a calibrated system for our printing process.Topic:\xa0This is the 50thepisode. Wow, what a milestone. Just a brief history about the show in case you’re a newer listener and you are interested in these things. This show actually started as part of the Improve Photography Network. In April 2018 the founder of Improve Photography gave the other contributing podcasters the various shows. The main show is now Master Photography Podcast and is owned by five of us. Each “side show” as it were, was given to the primary host. This show was my baby from its inception and was originally co-hosted with my friend Brian McGuckin. With the changes that happened I assumed full control of this show and he decided to one day resurrect Thoughts on Photography. So, I relaunched this show with the first episode publishing on May 4, 2018. So that’s where the count “50” is coming from. If I were to count the shows I did with Brian we’d be at over 60 or something like that. But this is a count from when I rebooted the show. In this timeframe I think I’ve only relied on one Latitude Replay where I republished a show with Brian.\xa0I put a question out in the facebook group on what I should do, if anything, for episode 50. One suggestion was to give an account of what I’ve learned/gotten/achieved in this timeframe. The biggest thing really, is the friendships, relationships and connections I’ve been able to make. I’m sure you can probably tell, but I can talk about photography until I’m blue in the face, and that’s just getting started. I can’t do that with most of my friends, if I did they probably wouldn’t be my friends anymore. To actually have people who are just as interested in this field as I am and to hang out with them and talk shop with is just amazing. I’m loving every minute of it.I’ve also gotten to talk with a lot of great photographers. I think of the episode where I talked with Ashley Tinker about photographing Provence, Dan Bailey came on twice to talk Fujifilm gear with me, Brian Pex talked with me about photographing the Palouse which is just a couple hours north of me, but he’s from Boston so it was good to get on outsider’s perspective there.Quite possibly the most moving and sobering episode was with Randy Narkir when we talked about the March of the Living which is an educational program bringing individuals from around the world to Poland and Isreal to study the history of the Holocaust and to examine the roots of prejudice, intolerance and hatred.\xa0I even had Ted Meister on from ThinkTank Photo, maker of some fine camera bags and then there’s David duChemin who took over a year to schedule. But it was worth the effort!Fellow teacher Mary Malinconico has been on a few times to talk about workshop expectations and we also discussed the book by Ibarionex Perello called Making Photographs. Oh, and I had Ibarionex on too! And I can’t forget Chris Marquardt, host of Tips from the Top Floor, the longest running photography podcast. There was also Timothy Allen, photographer for the BBC series called The Human Planet.\xa0OK, I think that’s enough, I just have to bring back a few of these top episodes and replay a bit of them for you here.\xa0The first one comes from Ibarionex. If you haven’t listened to this episode please do so. He’s got some amazing insights. I asked him what advice he would give someone who wants to try street photography but is feeling intimidated. Let’s listen to his response: | SummaryA road trip is awesome, but when I can combine work into the mix as well, that’s just awesome.Links this episode:https://brentbergherm.com/info/resources/https://brentbergherm.com/course-info/https://brentbergherm.com/workshops/oregon-coast-2019/Exposure Averaging video:\xa0https://youtu.be/zcEV6hqe16MSegmentation process video:\xa0https://youtu.be/DhlHh4O0LxIOnline print related videos:\xa0https://youtu.be/Qjzs_TfNCyIhttps://youtu.be/7R3ye0gDzAgTopic:Today we’ll be focusing mostly on my recent family road trip. We spent 3.5 weeks on the road and drove over 5,500 miles, my wife drove about 15 of those. It’s all good, I do like to drive.Basic Itinerary: Boise, ID; Salt Lake City, UT; Denver, CO; Lincoln, NE; Hannibal, MO; Chicagoland, IL; Council Bluffs, IA; Kimball, NE; Salt Lake City, UT; Boise, ID; HOME!Boise area: my folks live in the area so we spent a few days there. This is also where I had one of my print workshops for the Boise Camera club. More on that in a bit.Utah: We then drove to the Salt Lake City area and just spent a night there. We wanted to have a place to spend the evening on the way to Denver so we drove to Layton, stayed the night, swam in the hotel pool and moved on the following day. The drive to Denver was about 8 hours so we started early and just pushed forward.I was rather busy in Denver. This was a family vacation after all, but, I worked with photo clubs in the Boise area and Denver to host a print workshop. I brought my printer to both locations and club members supplemented with their own printers too which was great. I’d hoped to get even more printing done, but with 18 attendees at the Boise workshop and 12 at the Denver workshop printing was slightly crowded. It was an absolute blast though. Being able to share and teach one of the great things I love about photography is just so cool. And I should probably put a call out there, if you have a photo club and you’re interested in either a lecture at your club meeting or a workshop for your members please reach out. I’d love to make this happen again and again.In Boise the extra printers were the Pixma Pro 100, and I have the 10. They’re virtually the same printer, but the 10 uses pigment ink and the 100 uses Dye ink. So I went through the lecture and discussion part where we talked all about color spaces, proper file setup and challenges we face when we try to get “perfect” color out of our prints. Then we had a short break for lunch and then we spent the rest of the time answering questions and trying to keep things moving forward. Things were a bit more manageable in Denver since we had six less people but it was still busy.Additionally, in Denver, one printer we had was using a different inkset. It was very interesting to me to see the results of that inkset. I’ve had a lot of inquiries about third-party inks and I usually have to say that long ago I tried it, it failed and I never looked back. But third-party providers have gotten a lot better but I have not had any recent experience with any of them until now.First off, I noticed a phenomena called metamerism that was very evident to me when I looked at the print. It’s something that you notice on pigment inks if the print is held in the light a certain way because the color is a particle and not part of the ink liquid itself . In the Canon inks it’s hardly noticeable at all unless you use the photo black ink on matte paper. But this was visible for all papers. And, we had a fella that experienced a few challenges with the processing of the images and then when it came to print it looked nothing like what was on screen. I was like, “hmmm, OH, you’re using a printer that doesn’t have Canon inks, but you’re using the profile that is made for Canon inks.” He moved to my printer and it came out looking perfect. That was cool, to see how far off things were, and to see the smile on that fella’s face once it looked l... | Links: See the images and read the full Fuji conclusion here. https://brentbergherm.com/shooting-xt3/Announcements.My Oregon coast workshop is coming up, just a few days away now. If you have been on the fence about this I encourage you to jump in and allow me to challenge you and encourage you in your growth as a photographer. David duChemin said in the last episode that the print “is a powerful evaluative tool.” In fact, I’m going to turn it over to him once again.And I invite you to come out to the Oregon Coast with me and take the plunge into the world of shooting the beautiful coast and getting excellent prints from those images right there onsite as we dive deep into printing your photography.Topic:\xa0There’s actually a few topics today. I’ll start out by wrapping up the story about my Fujifilm experiment, Mark Morris joins us with a drone safety concern and then I end the show with a listener chiming in on the love of photography. Here we go.I wrote a blog post about my experience trying to switch to the Fujifilm X-T3 camera. The shooting experience was so wonderful. And I’ve talked about it a bit here on this podcast as well as on the Master Photography Podcast too. It’s time to wrap this up.\xa0In short, I sent the camera back. Please do read the post on my website, the link is in the show notes.The reason I sent it back is both complex and simple at the same time. It really hurts to send it back because I just loved shooting it so much. It was amazing. But I couldn’t get over a few details with regards to the types of images the camera struggled with.Most notably the sand image that not even the Fujifilm processing in camera could make look like sand, and an edge issue when shooting silhouetted objects. The processing in multiple programs just didn’t come out right so I lost faith in my ability to achieve my creative vision in post-production.I owe many thanks to Ibarionex Perello, Dan Bailey and David duChemin for coming on the show and talking with me about creativity and shooting Fujifilm cameras. But in the end it just wasn’t for me.For my photography, the ultimate purpose of a quality image is to make a gallery quality print out of it. I did a lot of printing comparing results from my Canon camera and the Fuji camera, and then I did a lot of further printing with just the Fuji files. I got a lot of very good and excellent prints. But a few subjects had too many challenges and I just can’t get passed it.Dan Bailey was also suggesting that I skip the raw processing and go with the in-camera JPG files. I tried that and on the flower subject I photographed in open shade the results were stunning. I literally took the file from camera, resized it, applied minimal output sharpening and it was excellent. However, I did the same with the raw image, also using the Fujifilm color profile, and it was even better, not by much, maybe 2%, but still, it was better. So I think I’ll keep my flexibility of the raw processing for now. But, when you’re in a pinch it’s good to know that usually you’ll have such awesome quality images coming out of the camera’s JPG processor.I also shot some star trails with the camera. My technique is to take multiple images over a period of time and blend them in Photoshop. I should have shot JPG for this process because in the raw as I switched from image to image the stars were not white. They were very distinctly blue, red or green, and they changed color depending on which frame you were looking at. This, of course, represents the rendering pixels but for the stars to not be recognized as white, it would just look too psychedelic. My Milky Way shot came out really great. But the star trails, not so much.The main reason behind sending it back is that I know my shooting experience would be affected by these issues. Most scenes turned out really well with this camera. But a few scenes just didn’t work out. | Links mentioned in this episode:https://davidduchemin.comhttps://craftandvision.comhttp://mycontactsheet.comhttps://brentbergherm.com/course-infoBook mentioned in this episode: Art and fear\xa0https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=art+and+fear&qid=1563289912&s=gateway&sr=8-2I have another very special guest with me today. His name is David duChemin and I’ve been following his work for pretty much as long as I can remember. David, Welcome to the show!Topic:\xa0Tell us a brief history of your career as a photographer.You recently sent out an email to those on your list and I’d like to use that to start our conversation. The first one talks about your rules for photography. In it you talk about:ConstraintsI teach design and photography at a university, so I love this one. When my students don’t like an assignment I give them the “excuse that this is their “design challenge” i.e. constraints.Tell us about some of the recent constraints you put yourself under and how that has affected your creativity.Trust your gutHelp us understand how this works out for youSounds like your bottom line is these ideals help you make images that are truly your own.\xa0When should a photographer be taking these steps of constraints and trusting their gut. From the very beginning? After some experience?You then mentioned another comment, “Creativity is a work ethic more than it is a talent.”\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Wow, I want to put this in all my syllabi at the university…\xa0Help us understand the meaning behind this though. I think in one sense we get caught up with the notion that “I’m not as creative as so and so…” and what not. It seems that what you’re getting at here is that this comparison misses the mark. So… “creativity is a work ethic more than it is a talent.” Let’s unpack this a little bit more.One last thing before we wrap it up, I recently switched to Fujifilm X-T3 and I love the change in the shooting experience. But I’m struggling a bit with getting my vision executed in post-production. You made that switch a little while ago, what changes in post-production did you experience, in any, or do you have any advice for someone like myself?My biggest problem is a subject I shot on the Oregon Coast. A backlit sand dune. The results didn’t even look like sand. And it’s all about the processing for sure, but it’s really thrown me off a bit and I’m trying to do a good job to test things out and see if I can make it work for me. I’ve talked with Ibarionex Perello and Dan Bailey and now yourself, all Fujifilm shooters, and you’re all, and many others, are producing great work with it. I’ve just hit a bump in the road and I’m trying to overcome it…Where can people find you online?Tell me about your online courses, and where can listeners go to sign up for them?https://davidduchemin.comhttps://craftandvision.comhttp://mycontactsheet.com | I have two guests with me today. They are Mary Malinconico and George VanBuren. Mary, Welcome to the show.\xa0George, Welcome to the show.Mary, you too are a teacher. When do you start up again, or is it too early to think about that?George, this is your first time on the show, tell us a bit about yourself.Topic:\xa0Today’s topic is to have a different perspective of Ibarionex Perello’s book, Making Photographs. I say different because just today, as this is recorded, my interview with Ibarionex is released. That was episode 42, released on July 7, 2019.But I put a call out several months ago asking for volunteers to grab the book themselves and to then come on the show and talk about it. So here we are.I asked each of you to come up with some talking points and we’ll just go back and forth with those.\xa0George, I thought we’d start with you today. The first item you wanted to talk about is the idea of “Making vs. Taking” photographs.\xa0Mary: Book AssignmentsGeorge and Mary: Being PatientMary and George: Knowing your gear, ability to change settings without thinking.Mary: Journaling | New Workshop for December 2020 just announced.

David, welcome to the show.Listeners may remember you from a while back when we talked about winter photography in New England. That was from November 2018.Topic:\xa0Today wanted to talk about Composition, and in reality, I maybe should call it “thought processes” on making images, or “thought processes on composition.” We’re also going to weave in some stories from the road. David, you’ve been a busy traveler lately. Tell us a bit about that first.St. Augustine, FL.\xa0Beach photography, FL landscape, birds, moon rises, Milky Way items too.Holland, tulips, canals, windmills. There during third week of April.10 days on CA coast.\xa0Northern NH. Waterfalls and Wildflowers workshop.Going to Iceland soon. Going with 5 people.“Composition,” to me, almost seems like an overused word. Yet it’s so important to keep these things in mind as we head out to make great photographs.What compositional idea would you like to start us out with today?(David’s first item to talk about, does not have to be part of the list below)Focal point of the scene.Available elements found in the scene.Other compositional points to ponder in no particular order: (would love to weave in some of your recent images as examples of how you approach these following items, I’ll do the same where possible)Emphasis of the idea you’re trying to convey, how does this idea inform your compositional decisions?Understanding visual weightUnderstanding balance, symmetrical and/or asymmetrical\xa0Different ways to control eye movement of the viewerSeeing like the camera, reconciling the differences in the way a camera records a scene with how we experience it, and being able to convey that in the final image, screen or print.Telling the story, an image should tell a story and if it does, it will finish the goal. No tried and true tricks, just something to practice.Where can they find you online:http://davelongphoto.comhttps://www.instagram.com/davidlong3653https://www.bluehourboston.com | Links mentioned in this episodehttps://danbaileyphoto.comhttp://www.latitudephotographypodcast.comhttps://brentbergherm.com/course-info/In this episode Dan Bailey and I talk at length about what we expect when we photograph and what’s important to us.

Who doesn’t love music? You’re not going to believe this, but we actually found someone. JoAnna Wendel experiences musical anhedonia, a condition in which songs read as an over-stimulating pile of melodies and beats — think of the feeling most of us experience when listening to noise. But Wendel notwithstanding, music remains — for most of us — one of the most intuitive tools to work out our feelings. This a music heavy ride but even if you do have anhedonia, we have some pretty great stories for you. | The producer who brought so many classics of queer cinema to life is coming to BendFilm Festival this fall. We talk with Christine Vachon about working with Todd Haynes and other breakout '90s auteurs. Also, Christopher Marley talks about creating astonishing compositions using preserved insect specimens. And we get a PDX Book Fest preview: Mitchell Jackson and Karen Russell on their critically-acclaimed books. | What gets us through those uncertain moments? The speculative story? The daring album concept? The strenuous film shoot? The risky venture? RESOLVE. This week: square-jawed stories from tenacious creators. | This episode is as American as it gets. We got country music, women skateboarding, indigenous youth reconnecting with their land, immigrant and refugee children learning to play music. All we're missing is a recipe for apple pie. | Innovators and icons tend to have something in common, they do things differently. This week we hear stories from a few people changing the game one costume, festival, or ASL gesture at a time. | This week we're going back to a favorite guest curated episode from 2014. Husband and wife Kelly Sue DeConnick and Matt Fraction have each racked up top awards for their comic books. DeConnick has written a run of Captain Marvel that was the basis for last year's big film adaptation that starred Brie Larson. And Fraction has worked on very popular storylines of X-Men, Thor, Iron Man, Fantastic Four… and, we’ll say it, the best dang Hawkeye ever. They walk us through their creative process and introduce us to some cool folks along the way. We even staged readings of some of their work! Comic books on the radio? You betcha. | As much as we may try, we can never leave our younger selves in the dust. This week, three writers mine from their own childhoods to create some powerful storytelling. | Yearning for voices to steer you through the darkness this week? We’ve found stories from places of devastation and salvation: from an artist whose voice harnesses a wild range of human emotion, to a film project that suggests new perspective on gun violence, to an Oregon writer who brings deep understanding in writing about grief. | This week we lost two giants in the arts community, Pulitzer- and Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison and poet and musician David Berman.

Turnarounds consists of the film installation Hometown (2018), a new series of textile pieces, and an essay in e-flux journal. Hometown focuses its ultra-wide, hypnotic gaze on two cities—Beirut and Kyiv—that merge into a fictional home for the film’s protagonists, Ghina Abboud and Lera Luchenko. Fluorescent, lava-like animations alternate between images of industrial estates and overgrown gardens as Ghina and Lera lyrically describe the town. A caterpillar gets killed, but while mourning the loss, both evade responsibility for the crime. With their monologue in Russian and Arabic colorfully subtitled in English and Ukrainian, they eat ice cream. Their laughter solves puzzles, and there is a sunken city inhabited by adults who forgot what children taught them. The script of Hometown draws on a genre of Russian children poems called perevortyshi (“turnarounds,” or “twisters”). In perevortyshi, positive statements are provisionally joined with their opposites to the great joy of both narrator and listener. These poems are, in their playfulness, also fundamentally questioning our reliance on verbal statements in order to approach reality. In "Sleep walks the street," an essay for e-flux journal no. 102 that will go live when the exhibition opens, Metahaven interrogate our current tendency to aestheticize politics by relying on the cognitive guidance of metaphorical and allegorical construction. Examining figures of speech that normalize not just words but also entire semantic contexts and cognitive patterns, they reference the work of the German-Polish linguist Victor Klemperer (1881–1960) who studied the language of the Nazis. In searching for potential antidotes, Metahaven focus on the work of the Russian poets Alexander Vvedensky (1904–1941) and Daniil Kharms (1905–1942), as well as the contemporary poets Eugene Ostashevsky, Jackie Wang, and Galina Rymbu. In addition to the film installation and the essay, a new series of digitally created textile pieces is installed throughout the public and private spaces at e-flux. Bearing titles like Mise-en-Anthroposcene, Skyrofoam, and Now You Know You Now, Metahaven’s recent textile works draw on the thematic and affective tropes they have embraced since their documentary The Sprawl: Propaganda About Propaganda from 2015. The work of Metahaven consists of filmmaking, writing, and design. Hometown will be on view at e-flux through November 2, 2019. | Erin talks to\xa0Interference Archive volunteers Louise Barry and Rob Smith about the archive, and the exhibition Resistance Radio: The People’s Airwaves, on view through September 29, 2019.\xa0 Resistance Radio: The People’s Airwaves focuses on the people, stations, and organizations that have battled to bring their defiant programming onto the airwaves, and particularly when these actions were in service of grassroots movements and/or community organizing. The mission of Interference Archive is to explore the relationship between cultural production and social movements—through an open stacks archival collection, publications, a study center, and public programs.\xa0 The archive consists of posters, flyers, zines, books, t-shirts, buttons, moving images, audio recordings, and more. You can listen to Interference Archive’s podcast, Audio Interference,\xa0here.\xa0 | e-flux journal editorial assistant Andreas Petrossiants speaks to Franco “Bifo” Berardi following his recent texts “(Sensitive) Consciousness and Time: Against the Transhumanist Utopia” in issue 98, and “Game Over” in issue 100. Franco Berardi, aka “Bifo,” founder of the famous Radio Alice in Bologna and an important figure in the Italian Autonomia movement, is a writer, media theorist, and social activist. His most recent books are Breathing: Chaos and Poetry (Semiotexte, 2018) and The Second Coming (Polity, 2019). | Sanna Almajedi talks to composer and trombonist Peter Zummo, and Eve Essex, a musician who performs with alto saxophone, piccolo, voice and electronics. The music heard in this episode was recorded live during the fifth edition of  Satellite at Bar Laika on March 12, 2019, featuring Zummo and Essex.\xa0 Peter Zummo is a composer and trombonist whose music encompasses both the contemporary-classical and vernacular genres. His work is informed by five decades of realizing the work of other composers, poets, bandleaders, choreographers, directors, and filmmakers. The way in which he maneuvers the contemporary trombone is genre non-conforming, and still finds a place in any genre.\xa0 Zummo worked closely with Arthur Russell, appearing on many of his recordings. He has also collaborated with Pauline Oliveros, Phil Niblock, and Yasunao Tone. His music has been released by Foom, Optimo Music, and Experimental Intermedia Foundation. Eve Essex is a Brooklyn-based musician who performs with alto saxophone, piccolo, voice and electronics, harnessing elements of classical, drone, free jazz, and distorted pop. She has performed as Das Audit (with guitarist Craig Kalpakjian), as well as in trios Hesper (with James K and Via App), and HEVM (with MV Carbon and Hunter Hunt-Hendrix). She has also collaborated extensively with Juan Antonio Olivares as installation/performance-art duo Essex Olivares. Her first solo album, Here Appear, was released by Soap Library (cassette) and Sky Walking (LP) in 2018. She also appears on Pan’s compilation Mono No Aware. Select solo performances include Artists Space, Outpost Artists Resources, Safe Gallery, and Meakusma Festival. Satellite is a monthly experimental music series curated by Sanna Almajedi. | Andreas Petrossiants, Editorial Assistant for e-flux journal, speaks to artist Fiona Connor starting from her exhibition at SculptureCenter,\xa0Closed for installation, Fiona Connor, SculptureCenter, #4.\xa0 As the show\'s\xa0press release describes: "Los Angeles-based artist Fiona Connor remakes overlooked everyday objects, including bulletin boards, park benches, community noticeboards, doors of closed down clubs, real estate signs, municipal water fountains, and so on. She is interested in where these objects come from, what they are made out of, who makes them and for whom, as well as the relationships that the artist initiates and maintains in order to reproduce and re-present the objects as works of art. For her new commission at SculptureCenter, Connor is producing a set of intersecting works that bring together the artist’s investment in the various operations of sculpture in an expansive field of production, maintenance, and display. In the gallery, she shows a number of bronze pieces that replicate tools required to install an exhibition, such as a measuring tape, a paint tray, a dolly, and scraps of cardboard. Nearby in an apartment in Long Island City, the artist arranges for an annual window cleaning, in perpetuity. Later in the course of the exhibition, Connor convenes a series of workshops, using pulped institutional printed material to make a set of catalog-sized blocks that will function as the exhibition’s publication." Read the full text  here.\xa0 Closed for installation, Fiona Connor, SculptureCenter, #4 is on view through July 29, 2019. | Artist Karl Holmqvist reads “ANOTHER WAR IS POSSIBLE” and “NUMBERS,” and speaks with artist and e-flux founder Anton Vidokle. Karl Holmqvist is known for using a wide range of formats—poetry readings, installation, and sculpture–to bring out the primal qualities of language. He is one of a current generation of artists working with language and text as sculptural or performative material. Holmqvist says his work is meant to spark the creative process in the viewer, seeing his art and poetry as a translation of the complexities of contemporary life. He blends poetry with pop music and his texts, composed of anecdotes as famous as they are diverse, explore the themes of communication and language. Together, the works unpack the many operations of language, how it can occupy space and provoke “invisible images” within memory and imagination. In February 2019, e-flux’s Bar Laika presented a new work by Karl Holmqvist: #FLU$$CH (29 minutes, 2017), with an introduction by and Q&A with Pati Hertling. You can read “GORILLAZ GRRLZ,”\xa0Holmqvist’s contribution to e-flux journal’s SUPERCOMMUNITY project at the 56th Venice Biennale, here. | e-flux journal editor Brian Kuan Wood speaks to Kader Attia, artist and founder of\xa0La Colonie,\xa0a space in Paris for sharing ideas and discussion. Focussing on decolonialisation not only of people but also of knowledge, attitudes and practices, it aspires to de-compartmentalise knowledge by a trans-cultural, trans-disciplinary and trans-generational approach. Driven by the urgency of social and cultural reparations, it aims to reunite which has been shattered, or drift apart. Kader Attia\xa0(b. 1970, France), grew up in Paris and in Algeria. Preceding his studies at the École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré and the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and at Escola Massana, Centre d’Art i Disseny in Barcelona, he spent several years in Congo and in South America. The experience with these different cultures, the histories of which over centuries have been characterised by rich trading traditions, colonialism and multi-ethnic societies, has fostered Kader Attia’s intercultural and interdisciplinary approach of research. For many years, he has been exploring the perspective that societies have on their history, especially as regards experiences of deprivation and suppression, violence and loss, and how this affects the evolving of nations and individuals—each of them being connected to collective memory. His socio-cultural research has led Kader Attia to the notion of\xa0Repair, a concept he has been developing philosophically in his writings and symbolically in his oeuvre as a visual artist. With the principle of\xa0Repair\xa0being a constant in nature—thus also in humanity—, any system, social institution or cultural tradition can be considered as an infinite process of\xa0Repair, which is closely linked to loss and wounds, to recuperation and re-appropriation.\xa0Repair\xa0reaches far beyond the subject and connects the individual to gender, philosophy, science, and architecture, and also involves it in evolutionary processes in nature, culture, myth and history. Attia\'s solo exhibition\xa0The Museum of Emotion\xa0at\xa0The Hayward Gallery, London recently closed. Upcoming 2019 exhibitions include a solo show opening in September at Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, and group shows at Rubin Museum of Art, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, and The Phillips Collection. | Following a recently published\xa0text\xa0in\xa0e-flux journal\xa0issue 98 (March 2019), Tyler Coburn joins Contributing Editor Elvia Wilk to discuss the project Ergonomic Futures.     Coburn\'s Ergonomic Futures\xa0asks questions about contemporary “fitness” through the lens of speculative evolution. The multi-part project\xa0includes furniture designed with Bureau V and a\xa0website\xa0of stories designed with Luke Gould and Afonso Martins.      Tyler Coburn\xa0is an artist and writer based in New York.

Lucie Vítková is a composer, improviser, and performer (accordion, hichiriki, synthesizer, voice, and tap dance) from the Czech Republic. She recently organized a performance with OPERA Ensemble on climate change. For Satellite, Vítková performed two pieces, one from “Music Domestic,” and another from her “Post-Apocalyptic” series. In 2017 Vítková was nominated to the Herb Alpert Awards in Arts in the category of Music, and was a resident artist at Roulette in 2018. She has put together two ensembles—the NYC Constellation Ensemble (focused on music behavior) and the OPERA Ensemble (for singing instrumentalists). During her 2017 Mentor/Protégé Residency in Tokyo, she studied hichiriki with Hitomi Nakamura and has been a member of the Columbia University Gagaku Ensemble. As an accordion player, she collaborated with the New York-based TAK Ensemble, S.E.M. ensemble, String Noise, Du.0, Argento Ensemble, CU Raaga, Ghost Ensemble, and Wet. Satellite is a monthly experimental music series organized by Sanna Almajedi at Bar Laika by e-flux. \xa0 Music clips in order heard: (1) Lucie Vítková, “Music Domestic” (excerpt).

The text examines three science-fiction scenarios that for Tony illustrate three collapses of orders of magnitude or scale—Samuel R. Delany’s Dhalgren, written in the US in the 1970s; Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker, filmed in the USSR in the same decade; and Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy, published in the US in the 2010s. Tony Wood lives in New York and writes about Latin America and Russia.

Her company, LEDs Control is a very prolific LED feature design firm and has a lot in common with Digital Ambiance.\xa0 She’s a Mexican native, Barcelona-based entrepreneur who started in the lighting industry in 2001 as a self-taught student of lighting control software. She performed as a light jockey in entertainment venues and events across Mexico.\xa0 In 2005 she moved to Barcelona and studied architectural lighting Design in the IED (Instituto Europe de Diseño) and UPC (Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña). She positioned herself as an architainment content creator (programmer). Her curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit drove her to found LEDSCONTROL in 2009.\xa0 Her main goal was to provide lighting control services for LED installations in public spaces, buildings, and entertainment venues. Over the past 14 years, the team has grown as well as the kinds of projects that the company works on. Nowadays LEDSCONTROL is led by Rebeca Sanchez and her partner Miquel Clot. The company has become one of the leading providers of lighting solutions for premier night clubs, music festivals, light art festivals & architectural icons across the globe. The team is formed by a group of technical/creative consultants, content creators, designers & builders of custom pieces that communicate with light and new media technologies. | Hey everybody, today Matthew Ragan joins me for a beer here at the Lumen Labs and we talk all about his life and career in the world of projection mapping.\xa0 He’s a Touch Designer Wizard who started out doing live performance art at Keen State back in the early 2000’s, then during his masters program at Arizona State he hosted a popular Touch Designer Tutorial vlog.\xa0 Working closely with Derivative Software he developed a host of teaching materials geared at educating a new generation of users in\xa0 advanced techniques. His vlog and expertise ended up catching the attention of the guys over at Obscura Digital who scooped him up right out of school.\xa0 He’s worked with them for the past few years, recently taking on the role of their lead software developer. Anyone who’s paying attention to the world of projection mapping knows how important Obscura is to the scene and how they’ve raised the bar for new media installations in places all around the world.\xa0 Matt takes us through his time working there and we talk about how the makers of a tool help to define the art that gets made and how that cycle defines our industry. It’s a great episode with a legend in the scene, I think you’ll like it! | My friendship with Scott goes back to before I moved to the West Coast. \xa0He’s an artist & programmer that made his name coding phenomenal generative artwork. \xa0His most well-known piece, titled “Electric Sheep”, started as a self-evolving algorithm, gaining traction in the Motion Graphics community before becoming a phenomenon unto itself. \xa0Seeing the potential in crowdsourcing the processing that created the generative patterns, he created a system allowing users to vote on the visual characteristics of each pattern and allowed the most successful art pieces to “mate” with each other, creating offspring with similar traits based on that of its parent patterns. \xa0In this way, Scott's art evolves and progresses with a life of its own.Today I sat down with Scott in the offices of his new employer, CTRL-Labs, a company working to bridge the human-computer divide with a new type of user input device that taps directly into the nerve impulses in a user’s wrist. \xa0Doesn’t get much more trans-human that that... Enjoy the episode! | In this episode I sit down with Christopher Schardt, creator of the Firmament LED installation and a prominent light artist. \xa0He’s spent much of his artistic career making pieces for display at the Burning Man Festival and we ended up spending much of this episode discussing the intricacies of making light-art installations for that venue. \xa0Our discussion moves from the politics of creating art on the Playa, how he fits into the overall Burning Man scene, and where we see Burning Man Art headed in the future. It was an interesting conversation with a true veteran and we had a lot of fun drinking beer and talking about our respective experiences. \xa0Hope you enjoy! | Welcome to episode 2 of the Luminous podcast. \xa0We just finished up the Smode master classes here at the Lumen Labs. \xa0There were so many cool people here from all over the country to learn all about this amazing new platform. \xa0Tonight I got to hang out with Cynthia Cardenas, a performing visual artist based out of Nashville Tennessee. \xa0She tells me about the Nashville new media arts scene and her ongoing collaboration with one of the composers and instrumentalists with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. \xa0With a background in music herself, she walks me through the VJ scene in the south and we talk about her background as an artist, the challenges that she’s dealing with as a woman in the scene, and the artistic process as it applies to live performing visual artists. | Brian is a brilliant LED programmer who uses microcontrollers to create embedded systems that drive light patterns across the light-art installations he builds. \xa0He’s had his work displayed at festival installations around the world including Galactic Jungle at Burning Man, Carrie Thompson’s Portal, and Helianthus Enormae with Fez Gaetz.", 'chan_desc': "The Luminous Podcast is a discussion series featuring artists, designers, and engineers active in the new media art scenes.

We put this test to an article from  Atheist Alliance International proclaiming 8 reasons Christianity is false. After that, the Jonah Goldberg rule of amoral dog crap eating is discussed. What\'s the least amount of money you would eat dog poo for? What other amoral things would you do, and for how much money? All this and more in another riveting episode. | Progress, tribalism, open-mindedness... these terms often imply a moral, but in and of themselves they are amoral. Ethan and Doug discuss some of the most commonly used amoral words and phrases used by culture today. After that, we talk about fast food - our must-haves and can\'t-stands. | Doug and Ethan don\'t even acknowledge the absence of Mike. Instead, they answer three topic requests from Twitter. We talk about going to church and how it\'s hard to find good teaching. We also talk about cynicism and sarcasm and when does it go too far? Lastly, we talk about writing characters. All answers are answered in a scattered and non-concise manner. Also, there is no Taylor Swift or Area 51 in this episode. We just added that to get clicks! | In this episode of Audio Mullet, Doug TenNapel (Earthworm Jim) and Ethan Nicolle (Axe Cop) talk about their unlikely career paths from two guys living in tiny towns drawing in their bedrooms, to working in Hollywood and getting paid to make stuff up. We do our best not to skip steps so that listeners can get an A to B to C to D snapshot of what two different paths look like. We include in this journey our faith and its impact on these steps. We hope that our stories are interesting to anyone climbing a similarly steep hill and looking for some inspiration, but also if you\'re not, we hope you are at least entertained. | In this episode, Doug TenNapel and Ethan Nicolle discuss not getting offended and outraged at everything with special guest Jon Gabriel. Jon is the editor in chief at Ricochet and hosts the podcast The Conseratarians with Stephen Miller. He is also a writer and a great follow on Twitter. Also, he has a website. | In this episode, Doug TenNapel and Ethan Nicolle discuss seeking out true masculinity in a world that either says it is toxic or a lie. Later, they talk about some of the books and movies that had the biggest impact on their lives. Mike is in France. We miss you, Mike. | With Mike still on Hiatus, Doug and Ethan decide to crack open some old emails. The first email Audio Mullet received was from a man named Bryant Hains, who sent a full list of potential topics. We go through them one by one, answering Bryant\'s entire email. While we know Bryant will love this episode, we are confident many others will too because Bryant had some great questions on a variety of topics. Here are the questions we answer in this episode: \xa0 Art/creativity topics -What do you do once you’ve accomplished your dream or career goal, especially if it’s sooner than you thought? Now what? -Discipline vs inspiration. Do you get up and work at it every day or do you do other things and wait for the bolt of inspiration to come? -How do you get past the “what’s the point” or “I’m wasting my time” feeling when you run into it while working on a project? -History of Christian art vs Christian art today. Are we victims of our own success after creating some of the best visual art (Michaelangelo, etc) and music (Bach, etc) in history? What happened to the greatness? Anything left to do? -Your opinions on the church being a patron of the arts in history vs now? \xa0 Family topics -Keeping the fire alive with the wife even after many years and/or kids -Work life balance: does it exist and tactics to maintain it -Opinions and tactics for how to prevent work burnout/when to go on vacation -Wife/husband roles and responsibilities in each of your families. Suggestions for others.\xa0 -Balancing guy time vs family time -You all (and I) love tobacco and alcohol in moderation. Where is the line? Difference between those things and other drugs? \xa0 Silly topics -Each of your Kevin bacon scores -dumb hobbies you each have -Home diy failures/successes -getting kids to eat tricks -getting kids to sleep tricks -Embarrassing work or something that you hope doesn’t crop up on YouTube/internet | With Mike still on hiatus, Ethan does his best to grill Doug on his faith, his loud mouth, his certainty on the unprovable and more. We covered homosexuality last week so this week it\'s other stuff.\xa0 After that, we talk about our stupidest obsessions of the past, which are mostly videogames. | Mike is on hiatus, but we press forth!\xa0 Imagine you share a cool piece of Earthworm Jim art and suddenly there on your feed pop up a few comments from gamers telling you that you just supported a homophobe. Is it true? Instead of listening to random people on the internet, let\'s hear it straight from Doug\'s mouth. Ethan and Doug discuss the common charge against Christians and especially against Doug TenNapel that they are all homophobes who hate gay people. It\'s a sticky, tricky topic and we were brave to get into it without calm, mild-mannered Mike to keep us in order. We miss you, Mike. Later we talk about Doug\'s pet peeve that people demand ideological purity from stupid things like movies and TV shows. \xa0 \xa0 | In this special episode of Audio Mullet, Mike Nelson (Rifftrax), Doug TenNapel (Earthworm Jim) and Ethan Nicolle (Axe Cop) are joined by one of their personal heroes, the president and founder of the American Chesterton Society, Mr. Dale Ahlquist.\xa0 Ever wondered what is up with the Chesterton obsession?

میکنیم.یکی از شاخه های عکاسی که بسته به محل زندگی تون درآمد خوبی میشه ازش داشت همین عکاسی املاک و عکاسی برای هتل هاست. دلیلش هم اینه که وقتی ما میخوایم یه خونه یا اتاق هتلی رو از اینترنت اجاره کنیم، مثل سایت Airbnb یا booking.com بعد از قیمت اون واحد، دومین چیز اینه که ایا عکس های اون اتاق ویژگی هاش رو به خوبی نشون میدن یا نه؟ چون طبیعتا امکان این رو نداریم که به صورت حضوری اون واحد رو بررسی کنیم و برای همین اهمیت عکس ها دوچندان میشه و هتل دار ها هم از اهمیت این موضوع باخبرن.مثلا موسسین سایت Airbnb\xa0وقتی کارش رو شروع کرد، به این نتیجه رسید که خونه هایی که عکس های حرفه ای داشتن، زودتر از بقیه خونه ها اجاره میرفتن و برای همین خودشون یه دوربین اجاره کردن و شروع کردن به عکاسی کردن از خونه هایی که توی سایتشون قرار داشتن. این یکی از عوامل تاثیرگذار در موفقیت این سایت بود. | توی قسمت چهلم پادکست

ماندنی راجع به تجربش در دنیای شبکه های مجازی صحبت کردیم. محمدرضا خودش رو یک بلاگر معرفی میکنه که از مدیوم عکاسی برای نشون دادن انچه که میخواد مطرح بکنه، استفاده میکنه. این به نظرم تمایز خیلی مهمیه چون خیلی ها فکر میکنن هر عکسی که لایک میخوره در اینستاگرام حتما عکس خوبی بوده که لایک خورده که ما میدونیم لزوما اینطور نیست. اتفاقا جالبه بدونید که اینستاگرام از همین یکی دو روز پیش به صورت امتحانی آپشن دیدن تعداد لایک هارو از زیر بعضی از پست ها حذف کرده، چراکه خیلی ها معتقدن این مقوله لایک روی کیفیت اینستاگرام تاثیر منفی گذاشته.\xa0ماندنی بالای صدهزار فالوور داره در اینستاگرام و به همین دلیل شنیدن نظراتش درباره ی شبکه های اجتماعی خالی از لطف نیست. خیلی ها راجع به بلاگرها نظرات منفی دارن و این گفت و گو به نظرم فرصت خوبیه برای اینکه با یکی از این بلاگرها بیشتر آشنا بشیم. احتمال میدم بعد از شنیدن

Editors at Random House set out to complete the book and hired Australian illustrator Andrew Joyner to provide the art. A true love letter to museums and a wonderful primer on art history, “Dr. Seuss’ Horse Museum” was released a few weeks ago. On this episode we speak with Andrew Joyner from his small town home in southern Australia.\xa0       | Spoiler: Adam Lerner isn’t your average museum director. For the past 10 years, Adam ran the show at MCA Denver. His impact on the institution, the city, and in many ways, the industry, is undeniable. Adam recently stepped down to explore new adventures. We were asked to do an exit interview of sorts. Recorded live in Denver.\xa0 | During our summer break, we headed down to Atlanta to interview hip-hop artist and activist, Killer Mike. He’s known widely for his work with Run The Jewels, but this trip was to talk about museums. Specifically, Atlanta’s High Museum of Art. A little over a year ago, Mike became a board member at The High. We wanted to check in and see how it’s going. What follows is a chat with Mike and High Museum Director Rand Suffolk. Recorded in the studios of public radio WABE in Atlanta. | For our 2019 Summer Special we chat with photographer, actor, and legendary skateboarder, Jason Lee (Mallrats, Almost Famous).

On view at Philbrook Downtown until November 10. \xa0 | For our Season 2 finale we headed down to the Big Easy for a live show to kick off the annual conference of the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). We set up shop inside the beautiful and mouthwatering Southern Food and Beverage Museum for a chat with Don Wildman, host of the long running Travel Channel show, “Mysteries at the Museum.” | There are many examples of writers using paintings and other visual art as inspiration to create an entirely new work. Think The Girl with a Pearl Earring or even The Da Vinci Code. That’s exactly what award-winning writer Donna Baier Stein did when she decided to write a new collection of short stories based on works by iconic American artist, Thomas Hart Benton. The issues Benton dealt with through the height of the Great Depression and on still resonate and echo today. We recently sat down with Stein to talk about her new book (Scenes from the Heartland), how she landed on Thomas Hart Benton, and the one piece that inspired the whole project. \xa0 | In our first show recorded in front of a live audience, we explore what it means to be a curator with Philbrook Museum of Art Chief Curator Catherine Whitney and Gilcrease Museum Senior Curator, Laura Fry. Your grandmother probably went her whole life without saying she “curated” something. And while so many people these days claim to curate this or that, the only ones that can truly own the title are actual curators. Featuring cameos by comedian Pete Holmes, exit signs, and the National Mustard Museum. | We recently stumbled upon a fascinating blog post written last year by Graham Boettcher, Director of the Birmingham Museum of Art in Birmingham, Alabama. The headline read, “DIRECTOR RECKONS WITH ART MUSEUM’S UGLY PAST” and looks at the museum’s troubling Jim Crow-era policies in the first dozen years of its existence. We sat down with Graham to discuss this and much more. | Museums have a problem. Too much stuff. But whereas you can take a few carloads to Goodwill or set up a yard sale, museums don’t have that luxury. Sometimes they end up building costly expansions just to contain the overflow. New York Times reporter Robin Pogrebin visited museums of various budgets and sizes to see just how big a problem museum storage has become. | Time for our annual round table chat with three experts from different parts of the art world.

This week our guest is pattern and fabric designer Jessica VanDenburgh of Sew Many Creations. I\'ve known Jessica for a few years from meeting her at various quilting industry events, and I spoke with her at Quilt Market in Portland about her brand-new fabric line, Gypsy, for Windham Fabrics, which is due out in shops in October, including ours at shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com.Before we get to the interview, I wanted to let you all know what\'s been going on at Quilt Addicts Anonymous. We\'ve been pumping out tons of great content in 2018, and the latest is our Hillside and Jelly Roll Rug video tutorials which have been big hits with the quilting community so far on YouTube. And if you missed it, be sure to check out my Free Online Beginner Quilting course which is great for first-timers as well as quilting veterans looking for a refresher course.We\'ve also been added a fun new Crafting With Kids video series in which myself and my cute little Future Quilter have fun with crafts in hopes of inspiring you and your little ones to get crafty!

The idea of her own fabric line was always in the back of her mind, "but I didn’t think that it would ever actually happen because I don’t consider myself super artistic. I don’t think that I draw that well and I don’t have those computer skills either."Nonetheless, she spoke with Windham about doing her own line and started sketching and coming up with concepts.“It was an exciting process," Jessica said. "I got to pick all of the colors and make it what I wanted but they polished it up and made it even better than I could have imagined.”A lot of fabric designers are not sewers, and they don\'t always understand how their art translates into cutting it up and using it in projects. That\'s what I love about Jessica\'s line. As a sewer and pattern designer, she really thought about her her line would be used when creating it and the end product is just beautiful. I just loved how her booth looked at quilt market, and her fabric looked great on large and small-scale projects.In addition to her new fabric line, Jessica discusses her obsession with Cork fabric and more in our interview. Check out Jessica\'s website at sewmanycreationsny.com. | Welcome to Episode 47 of Sit & Sew Radio, a Quilt Addicts Anonymous podcast! We\'re so excited to be back with another episode after a break.

The brand that is home to some of the most well-known fabric designers in the industry was purchased by Jaftex, a family-owned company that also owns Henry Glass, Studioe, Blank Quilting and many more popular sewing industry brands.Scott Fortunoff, one of the fourth-generation owners of Jaftex came on the show to talk about the acquisition, how they plan to make FreeSpirit profitable and how this was the deal of a lifetime.The Kaffe Fassett Collective, Tula Pink, Anna Maria Horner and many other big designers are staying on with FreeSpirit under the new owners, and much of the support staff will remain in place as well.Scott Fortunoff, fourth generation owner JaftexScott and I also talk about the history of Jaftex, how it has evolved over its 88-year-history from Scott’s grandfather selling imperfect goods and leftover fabric lots to creating women’s sleepwear to acquiring fabric manufacturers that sell to retail chains and quilt shops. And with the acquisition of FreeSpirit, Scott is hopeful this means Jaftex will be around for his sons and nephews to be the fifth generations of Fortunoffs to run the company.You can learn more about Scott on his blog, Tales of a Fourth Generation Textile Executive.

On Monday the quilt industry was rocked by news that North American Crafts has decided to close its Lifestyle Fabrics business, which includes fabrics produced by Free Spirit and Westminister Fabrics/Fibers. The news was made public when the Craft Industry Alliance shared a copy of the email sent to fabric designers informing them of the imminent closure.The reasoning given was that, “Despite our best efforts, we have continued to struggle with an inherent weakness in the business model and have not be able to demonstrate a profit.”There was no warning that this was coming. Designers were actively working on new collections and promoting ones to be released in June and later after the company will cease its operations. My fabric rep was hundreds of miles from home, meeting with shops and taking orders. The Free Spirit Marketing team sent an email to shop owners promoting a social media marketing webinar scheduled for later in the week.The internet quilting community came out in force to speculate why and how such a prominent name in the quilting industry and home to some of the top designers in the world could close. There also was an outpouring of support for the employees who will be losing their jobs and designers such as Tula Pink, Kaffe Fassett, Amy Butler and more encouraging them to keep creating.Then on Tuesday more information started to come out. A similar email was sent to shop owners, using the same inherent weakness line to explain the reasons for closing up. I was on this list and have shared the content of the email I received below.Free Spirit is not sharing much information. Even designers I have spoke to off the record were still waiting as late as yesterday for phone calls from Westminister and Free Spirit before deciding what to do next. Many have taken to social media to thank their fans for supporting them, assuring them that they will keep designing, just with a new company and expressing a positive attitude that this change will ultimately be a good thing for them creatively.I have learned from my Free Spirit fabric rep that collections slated to be shipped through May 2018 will come out. That includes Tula Pink All Stars, which is already in the Westminister’s US-based warehouse and is being prepped for shipment. However, decisions are still being made to determine whether the much promoted Kaffe Mystery Block of the Month will be fulfilled or if Tula Pink’s De La Luna fabric line, originally slated for June, will be printed.But as a business woman in the quilting industry, what had me most concerned was the line North American Crafts kept using in its carefully crafted communications, that there was an inherent weakness in the business model. So I invited two presidents of fabric companies to come on this week and talk about the closing of Free Spirit and what it means for the industry.In our conversations we talk about: • The state of the quilting industry • What is necessary for a fabric company to run well and profitably • How the size of fabric lines and release frequency can impact cash flow - the life line of a business • How new technology is changing the industry • The inherent differences of running an independently owned fabric company, verses being a division of a larger corporation as Westminister Fibers and Free Spirit was • What business expenses are covered when you buy a yard of fabric • And how disruption is everywhere in every industry, so challenges like internet fabric sales just means there needs to be some creative problem solving and innovation to meet the needs of today’s consumerKen Gamache, President of QT FabricsFirst up we have the president of QT Fabrics Ken Gamache. Ken started at QT Fabrics in 1978 as a print machine set up man. It was his job to clean the ink from the copper rollers and he worked the midnight shift.Throughout his 40 year career with the company, he has worked his way up from production, to supply chain management, distribution, sales, general manager and now president. Since he has worked in just about every aspect of the business, he has first-hand knowledge of what it takes to keep the company running efficiently and profitably.We talk about the state of the quilting industry, how the size of a fabric line can impact profitability and inventory management, how digital printing can lead to future profitability and the four areas of a company that need to run smoothly, in Ken’s opinion, for a fabric manufacturer to succeed.Ted Hoffman, President of ClothworksNext up with have the President of Clothworks, Ted Hoffman. Ted and his wife Candice purchased Clothworks when Ted wanted to go in a different direction after working in corporate high tech life in Seattle. After about a year and a half of searching for the right company, Clothworks came up which held interests for Ted, the business guy and Candice, the company’s Creative Director.The numbers looked good and they bought the company, saw it through the Great Recession and the many challenges that came with it.We also talk about the state of the quilting industry, the cyclical nature of business, Clothworks’ model of selecting designers based on their distinct artistic styles as a way to diversify the business, what is covered (and it is a lot) when a consumer purchases one yard of fabric, and how disruption is everywhere, in every industry and it just provides a creative challenge for businesses to meet the needs of today’s consumer.A big thank you to Ken Gamache from QT Fabrics and Ted Hoffman from Clothworks for taking some time out of their busy schedules to talk with me and react to the big news of Free Spirit closing its doors.Click here to read the Craft Industry Alliance article that broke the news of the closing to the quilting industry and scroll down to see the full text of the email I received as a shop owner explaining the closing.You can also click here to read a blog I wrote that details what lines Quilt Addicts Anonymous will be receiving before Free Spirit closes. We have already had a few customers who have started buying up our current Free Spirit lines, knowing that they may not be reprinted when the designers find a new home. We have fabrics from Tula Pink, Kaffe Fassett, Amy Butler, Shell Rummel, Anna Maria Horner and Free Spirit Solids at shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com.Here is the full text of the email sent to quilt shop owners:Dear Retailer,As you may have heard, we will be exiting our fabrics business, which includes our Westminster Fabrics/ Fibers, FreeSpirit brand, and designers.We have worked diligently for the past few years to make this a successful part of the Coats and Clark, Inc. craft business here in North America. I am sorry to say that, despite our best efforts, we have continued to struggle with an inherent weakness in the business model.We will work with you and have ongoing communication regarding availability of fabric selection and current programs within the next several weeks.It also means, at a future date, we will be moving invoicing and customer service functions supporting the fabric, thread, and yarn businesses from Greer, South Carolina to our Albany, Georgia, and Charlotte, North Carolina offices. For now, your current contacts will remain the same.It is our intent to support you and our talented and dedicated artists during this transition. These decisions have been difficult and we thank our employees, our designers, and you for your enthusiasm for FreeSpirit and your continued support.Yours sincerely,Stephanie Leichtweis | Welcome to Episode 41 of Sit & Sew Radio, a Quilt Addicts Anonymous podcast. This week we have Natalia Bonner back on the show talking about her latest book, "Visual Guide to Free-Motion Quilting Feathers."Natalia was one of the first guests on this podcast and since that first appearance I have sent her several of my tops to be quilted. She is very talented and almost always includes fabulous feathers on everything I send her.Real quick before we get into the meat of the interview, we\'ve got some new goodies over at shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com. We have a boatload of new pre-cuts from Anna Maria Horner, Carolyn Friedlander, Amy Butler and Maywood Studio. Plus, Dimensions Block of the Month books are now available for purchase and we\'ve got a bunch of new patterns to inspire you including the super popular Lisa the Unicorn by Elizabeth Hartman, the creator of Fancy Forest. So click here to check out all the new goodies and get inspired for your next project.Natalia Bonner, Professional Quilter, AuthorIt is no secret that I am a big fan of Natalia Bonner. Whenever I have a quilt that I don\'t feel I can do justice on the longarm, I send it to her, including the quilt I hope will be on the cover of my first book. Her 4-in-1 ruler is my most used template when I am doing ruler work on the longarm.Natalia\'s talents have been recognized by others as well. She won Best Machine Quilting at QuiltCon in 2017, and she has written five books including,\xa0"Visual Guide to Free-Motion Quilting Feathers" that we are talking about in today\'s episode.As you will hear in the interview, feathers are the quilting design I have yet to master. I have attempted them, but the results were pretty disastrous ... the quilt is still in time out.But I think I am ready to try again with Natalia\'s Book. She includes 68 modern feather designs in it, each with step-by-step instructions, with easy to understand photos, on how to recreate the feathers on your own quilt. It is a must have for anyone who wants to tackle this classic quilting stitch.You can listen to Natalia\'s previous appearances on the podcast in Episode 28, the QuiltCon 2017 edition, and Episode 4. You can learn more about her and purchase her book on her website\xa0piecenquilt.com. | Welcome to Episode 40 of Sit & Sew Radio, a Quilt Addicts Anonymous podcast.This week we have Shell Rummel on, and I couldn’t be more excited to introduce her to you all. Shell is a fine artist whose watercolor designs are licensed by the Free Spirit/Coats team to bring fabulous modern coastal quilting fabric to all of us.But Shell is far more than just a fabric designer. Her designs are also available as bedding and bath sets, rugs, silk pillows, wall paper and even house paint.And between now and February 9, 2018 you can save 25 percent on all Shell Rummel fabric we have in stock over at shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com using the coupon code SEWSHELL.Real quick before we get to the episode, make sure you head over to shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com to sign up for the Dimensions Block of the Month by January 31, 2018 when sign ups close!I just love this Block of the Month design because each month we are just using two fabrics, one solid and one Kinkame Shades ombre fabric available through Clothworks. I have always wanted to design a quilt with ombre fabrics that really shows off the color changes that happen across the width of fabric, and Dimensions is that quilt.Check out the video we made above to get a preview of this quilt and click here to sign up.Shell Rummel, Fine Artist & DesignerI fell in love with Shell Rummel’s fabric long before I met Shell.I am normally all for the bright and vibrant fabrics, but I just can’t get enough of Shell’s fabric. The soft color palette is just gorgeous and it challenges me in my fabric placement to create drama with the ranges of color, rather than relying on a bright focus print to do the work for me. The results are fabulous.I used two of her fabric lines in quilts for my book, “Simple Quilts for the Modern Home” that is due out later this year, and tagged her on Instagram with a few sneak peaks. I had no expectations and just wanted to show other Shell Rummel fans what I was up to.But Shell replied and before I knew it we were talking on the phone discussing future collaborations. None of those projects are out in the world yet, but stay tuned, they are coming later this summer.I just love everything about Shell and I hope you do to. You can see more of her home décor creations at www.shellrummel.com. | Welcome to Episode 39 of Sit & Sew Radio, a Quilt Addicts Anonymous podcast.This week we are excited to have Darlene and Andy Girton of Featherweightdoctor.com.

Click here to check it out.Darlene & Andy Girton, the Featherweight DoctorsDarlene\'s love affair with the Featherweight 221 began about 15 years ago with Esther.Darlene was a self-taught quilter who was lugging around a "big, boat anchor sewing machine" to local classes in Washington state. One day the handle snapped off, and she decided she needed a change. Darlene, who eventually would become a professional long-arm quilter and machine quilt educator, needed something lighter. Something portable. She was starting to teach her own classes, and her old "boat anchor" wasn\'t cutting it any longer.Her husband, Andy found her a classic 1953 black Featherweight that weighed about 8 pounds. She called her Esther, the name of the original owner that was engraved all over the machine."And that is where the love affair started," Darlene said.Esther became Darlene\'s traveling companion on retreats and classes. Soon Andy and Darlene began collecting the machines, picking them up at garage sales, antique shops, wherever they could find them. A few years ago the couple moved to the Phoenix area and things really took off.Andy would clean the old machines up, and Darlene would take them to classes and sell them. That\'s when they decided to make a family business out of the venture with featherweightdoctor.com. Andy does a lot of the restoration, with the help of their 18-year-old son as well as Andy\'s dad. Darlene finds the machines and tests them to make sure they are working as they should. Their daughter pitches in as well, with the official title of design assistant and queen of fun.In the podcast interview Darlene and Andy tell more about their story and the restoration process.Darlene says that while many prefer to restore the machines to their original glory, there is an up-and-coming group of ladies from the younger generation of sewers who prefer a fresh and fun look for their antique machines.Visit Featherweightdoctor.com to learn more about Andy and Darlene and to see their work.', 'chan_desc': 'Welcome to Sit & Sew Radio, a Quilt Addicts Anonymous podcast with Stephanie Soebbing.

I interviewed the three founding members of Brooklyn Research; Alex Dodge, Ezer Longinus, and Johnny Lu, on starting a fabrication company that specializes in interactive systems, prototypes and technological experiences. We discuss the conservation concerns that come with digital art, working with corporate clients vs. fine art clients and how Brooklyn Research has transitioned into an nonprofit serving its community with membership space and programming. | August 19th, 2019Allyson Vieira is an artist, educator and author of the book “On the Rock” (Soberscove, 2019), an oral history project documenting the experiences of the marble carvers working on the restoration of the Acropolis in Athens. Allyson talks about the physical and political history of the site and walks us through the step-by-step process of repairing a broken block of marble. She details tool, technique and material continuity on the project and tracks how many of the skills span huge and complicated histories. Her favorite tool is her Dewalt angle grinder and from the book, the specificity of the marble carving chisels. | March 31st, 2019Jamie is an artist and fabricator who has worked on extensive sculptural projects with artists such as Banks Violet and Robert Gober. He reminisces about how he got into fabrication, being a young artist trying to make ends meet in the pre-2008 New York art world and what he wishes he could go back tell himself now he has a little more experience. We discuss how technical skills can highlight class distinctions in MFA programs and the relationship labor has within the art world. We admit to making art for a chorus of voices in our heads and what it would mean to quit. Jamie’s favorite tool is a pre-drill counter sink drill bit. | May 24th, 2019Jason talks about learning the craft of spray coating technology and paint science from his early career as a painter at Jeff Koons’s Studio. Now the owner of the renowned shop Alchemy Paint Works, he discusses the language choices used with clients, the process of filing a patent for a specific coating he invented, the gap between an industrial process and a contemporary art application and being flown around the world. His favorite tools is a German engineered spray gun called a Sata. | May 16th, 2019Matt Dilling, the owner of Lite Brite Neon Studios, talks about the history of neon and how it’s entered the contemporary art visual language. He describes working with both commercial and art clients and how to tackle and learn from positive problem solving with such an exacting material. | April 20th, 2019Matt discusses being the Estate Manager for the artist/photographer Sarah Charlesworth which involves overseeing the continued printing of unfulfilled editions, the replacement of damaged artworks and the translation from defunct and non-archival printing processes into more stable, digital techniques and materials. His favorite tools are the slide carousel and the Nikon FMZ camera. | March 11th, 2019Anders talks about being a fabricator that specializes in glassblowing and how a handful of legal cases involving intellectual property have raised interesting question within his glass and art communities. His favorite tool is the New York Times. | February 21st, 2019Matt talks about the tension between being both an artist and a fabricator in the contemporary art world and the different dynamic when working for a fabrication company vs. working closely with only one artist. His favorite tool is an angle grinder.', 'chan_desc': "Harriet Salmon interviews fabricators and craftspeople who assist in the production of contemporary artworks. This podcast will document fabricator’s experiences to shine a light on the amazing breadth of talent in the field and to capture this particular moment in the art world.

Far from it! The War of the Worlds by HG Wells was written more than a century ago and went on to become an iconic work in the science fiction genre, spawning a whole new genre of literature featuring alien invaders. It was in fact the first book to present the idea of conflict between inhabitants of different planets. The story begins in an observatory in Ottershaw, when scientists note a series of mysterious explosions taking place on Mars. Some days later, the narrator who is on a walk on the Surrey Downs notices a weird cylindrical vehicle that suddenly opens to release a horde of hideous creatures who are later discovered to be Martians. The creatures are unable to breathe Earth's air and swiftly return to their vehicle. A peace delegation of humans tries to make contact but they're ruthlessly scorched to death by Martian heat-ray weapons. Thus begins the War of the Worlds. The British military swings into action, but their arms and ammunition are defenseless against sophisticated chemical weapons and heat-rays. Events race towards calamity as the nations of the earth unite to combat these fearful invaders to no avail. Survivors are reduced to scavenging for food with the cities of the world reduced to mere rubble. Can the human race survive? Will the narrator and his family escape destruction? The author, HG Wells was a science teacher in a small village in Somerset, England. However, he was also a gifted writer who wrote in several genres – science fiction, literary novels, short stories, history, politics and social sciences. A keen student of war and combat, he created a set of rules for playing war games with toy soldiers, which provides an interesting glimpse of logistics, strategy and close combat techniques. Wells' contribution to our ideas of science fiction remains unparalleled and the book has been widely filmed, staged and televised. The War of the Worlds was immortalized as a Halloween prank in a radio show that aired on CBS on October 30, 1938, causing widespread panic and chaos as listeners across the United States tuned in and began fleeing from their homes! The enduring appeal of this book makes it a must read classic for readers of all ages.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/3d/3b/b2/3d3bb246-b87d-2ac1-6b3a-428012f77ab7/mza_4951212249826424799.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-09-09'}}

The first conversation of season two is with LaShawn Wiltz: a wife, mother, blogger and photographer from Atlanta, Georgia. LaShawn comes from family who is dedicated to keeping memories and giving them to the next generation with photographs. And, she is absolutely keeping her family’s tradition alive while also encouraging her community to do the same for their own families. In this conversation, we talk about why parent-photographers hesitate to get into photos (perfectionism!) and why we need to do get over ourselves and do it more. LaShawn and I also talk about our love of daily photo projects and the group projects she does with her Instagram community. LaShawn tells us about the work she does for brands and also why she doesn’t photograph other people’s families. This season’s theme is how photography helps. When I asked LaShawn, she talked about making macro photos when her father was dying. She doesn’t take many macro photos these days but making them helped her through those hard days.

Boyd lives in the small rural town of Newnan, Georgia–located several miles south-east of Atlanta. Not only is Boyd a fine art painter, he helps run his family-owned and operated art gallery located in the beautiful, old downtown square of Newnan. A very young David Boyd decided early on that he wanted to be a hired assassin, and if that did not work out–a race car driver. Fortunately, Boyd came from a family who provided him a rich, nurturing environment that steered him towards the visual arts rather than become the next James Bond. His father–David Boyd-is a renowned illustrator known for his work for comedian Jeff Foxworthy. His mother, a school teacher, has a love for music and dance. With their loving influence, his life of crime was averted and now Boyd is one of the finest painters in the South. He’s a signature member of Oil Painters of America as well as the American Impressionist Society. Boyd paints outdoors and is also an avid photographer. He uses plein air painting to capture a feeling, and he uses photography to capture a moment. He then takes his plein air paintings and photos to his studio and combines these into larger works. Boyd says: “I was fortunate to spend many weekends with my grandparents in rural Georgia, where the woods and old rusty cars and tractors were my playground. Today, when I see the rusting memorabilia of the rural south, I feel a deep sense of nostalgia.” Boyd is compelled to paint the remnants of a different time that has long since given way to the modern world. Old cars, decaying buildings, old store front and road signs, rusting trucks and tractors become the focus of his beautiful paintings. Boyd seeks to preserve Southern American life in its current state of decay–in what he characterizes as “landscapes of rust.” I want to acknowledge the role that the Booth Museum had in introducing me to David Boyd, Jr. and his art. In previous episodes of the Artful Painter you’ve heard me gush about the Booth Museum in Cartersville, Georgia. I’ve enjoyed many of the exhibits there, and attended workshops, demonstrations and lectures. While doing so I’ve gotten to know the Booth Art Academy Manager - Kent Mullinax. A few weeks ago he reached out to me and asked: “Do you know David Boyd, Jr.? He would be a good guest for your podcast… he’s the best in the business… you will love David. He’s a great artist and even better person." Well, how could I possibly pass that recommendation up? And so, in this episode of the Artful Painter, I’m happy to share with you this delightful conversation with David Boyd, Jr. Links: David Boyd, Jr. Website: https://davidboydjr.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/compelledtopaint/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/davidboydjrfineart/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theboydgallery/ Searching Goodwill for art book deals: https://youtu.be/9yelWldYRZ8 Amazing art book from 1839: https://youtu.be/fuRwv9WgzC0 About the Artful Painter: Artful Painter website: https://theartfulpainter.com Subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIo1YmQXnMm21b-Slkr69Tg Send me an email: https://carlolson.tv/contact My Artful Painter Sketchbooks: https://carlolson.tv/artful-painter-sketchbooks Carl Olson on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/artful.creative/ \xa0 | Len Chmiel’s evocative paintings push the boundaries of realism, while preserving the beauty of the landscape and infusing it with palpable emotion. Chmiel makes his home in Hotchkiss, Colorado, where he not only paints, but also gardens, tends his vineyard and makes wine. Gardening profoundly affects his art. He has a strong yearning to get his fingers into the dirt. Nurturing a living thing from a tiny seed and watch it grow into a beautiful plant stirs such a deep emotional response within him. To Chmiel, gardening encourages optimism. If a plant fails this season, then perhaps in the next season he can do better. He finds the same is true with painting. At first a concept for a painting may not work. However, seeing it through may reward the painter with a painting that captures the essence of his subject and move him to tears. In this episode of the Artful Painter, Chmiel explains that successful paintings start with a clear concept and good design. He talks about the importance of painting on the spot and how doing so forms a connection with the place and subject - connections and memories that still inform larger works completed in the studio years later. Len Chmiel does not like to call himself an artist - he prefers to call himself a painter. Many artists who I have spoken with agree that Len Chmiel is one of the finest painters – yes, one of the finest artists – in America today. I’m glad to be able to share with you this conversation.

He describes himself as a “Southern landscape painter living in New York.” Layers and details of the southern landscape have been peeled back in his paintings, leaving us with the dancing lines and shimmering pools of colors of the Carolina coastal wetlands. As I’ve gotten to know Brian through his Studio Visit videos on YouTube, and his book, Clear Seeing Place, I’ve come to expect the unexpected. What you won\'t hear from Brian are glib, often repeated “feel-good” sound bites we’ve come to expect from motivational books and videos for artists. What you do hear from Brian is his thought provoking unconventional wisdom–a wisdom that has been formulated and brewed in the depths of his mind from experience because day after day, year after year he has simply shown up to do the work of a painter. In this episode, Brian explains what abstraction is. Essentially “all art is abstraction,” according to Brian. However, most of us view it as a style. Brian argues abstraction is not a noun, but instead is a verb. Abstraction is not a style, but, rather, is a process. Using the tools of abstraction Brian seeks out the essence of the Southern landscape. The result are beautiful paintings full movement, color, and atmosphere. Brian Rutenberg is an internationally exhibited painter based in New York City. He was born and raised in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Brian received his bachelor’s degree in fine arts from the College of Charleston in 1987 and his master’s degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1989. He received an Honorary Doctorate from the College of Charleston in 2018 and delivered the commencement address. Brian is a Fulbright Scholar, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellow, a Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation studio grant recipient, a Basil Alkazzi USA Award recipient, and an Irish Museum of Modern Art Residency Programme participant. He has had over 250 exhibitions throughout North America and in Europe. His popular Telly Award winning YouTube series, “Brian Rutenberg Studio Visits,” is viewed daily by people all over the world. Brian’s paintings are included in numerous museum collections including Yale University Gallery of Art, Bronx Museum of Art, The Butler Institute of American Art, Provincetown Art Association and Museum, Greenville County Museum of Art, The Johnson Museum at Cornell, Mattatuck Art Museum, Peabody Essex Museum of Art, and many others. Brian’s 2017 book Clear Seeing Place is an Amazon #1 bestseller and was named one of the Best Books of 2017 by Kirkus Reviews. His new monograph A Little Long Time is due out in spring 2020. Brian is represented by Forum Gallery, New York; Jerald Melberg Gallery, Charlotte; LewAllen Gallery, Santa Fe; Nancy Toomey Fine Art, San Francisco; and Tew Galleries, Atlanta.

One such award she received is the 2018 Best Light in the Landscape Award at Olmsted Plein Air Invitational based here in Atlanta. The co-founder of Olmsted Plein Air - Lillian Ansley - recently introduced me to Christine and invited me to attend one of her demonstrations. That experience led to Christine graciously taking the time to talk with me in this episode. Christine’s love of all things in nature is poetically expressed in her paintings. Plein air painting is an important part of her work. Collecting memories outdoors among nature including light, atmosphere, and geology, influence her work in the studio. The ideas she captures outdoors inspires the creating of stunning paintings that capture the beauty of a moment held in memory.

Carlson\xa0(affiliate link): https://amzn.to/2FSHvtt About the Artful Painter: Artful Painter website: https://theartfulpainter.com | Gregory Packard is an American impressionist painter. His paintings celebrate both the medium - colorful, richly textured oil paint - and the subject. He likens impressionistic painting to capturing a fleeting moment in time. The emotion of that moment and the scene are lyrically and poetically frozen in time with Gregory\'s expressive brushwork. His work invokes an involuntary, visceral response from viewers. Gregory is drawn to impressionistic painting in part because of the extraordinary range of colors that can be used to represent the subject of the painting. He believes people are drawn to impressionistic paintings because they allow the viewer to inject their own meaning. The quality of oil paint draws Gregory into a painting. He loves thick paint and the textures that can be created. Gregory loves the duality of a beautiful impressionistic painting - the intriguing abstract quality of paint viewed up close and the and the joy of seeing the subject of the painting resolve itself when you pull back. Gregory’s journey into art began with drawing. He says his tightly rendered, realistic drawing skills that he developed early now contributes to his ability to paint very loosely. To paint a subject matter well, Gregory first tries to feel it. His approach to painting is intuitive. He paints from life, but also uses photographic references – with thoughtful awareness of their limitations and pitfalls. Greg is not to a slave to the photograph nor to the subject itself. These merely suggest what could be in a painting. His intuition and emotional response to the subject is key to the development of a painting. Though he had dabbled with oil painting in the past - including taking a few painting classes in college - it wasn’t until later that Gregory would pursue art as a career. As improbably as it may seem, the turning point was a chance encounter of entering a gallery in Boise, Idaho, to kill time while waiting for a work meeting. Gregory saw the stunning artwork of artist Robert Moore and fell in love with his work. He immediately signed up to attend a workshop conducted by Robert Moore. On the heals of that workshop, he attended yet another workshop - this time conducted by Delbert Gish. There was no turning back. At that moment Gregory decided he was going to be a professional fine art painter. It took about five years or so of hard work and dedication to accomplish his dream of finally making a living as an artist. I was introduced to Greg by artist Ralph Oberg who I had met up when my wife and I visited our daughter and son-in-law in Montrose, Colorado. Ralph told me about Greg and suggested that I invite him to be a guest on the Artful Painter podcast because “he’s really good.” Ralph invited me and my family to visit an annual show at a small gallery in Montrose called the Cimarron Song Gallery. The gallery is owned and operated by Gregory. Gregory and his wife bought a 100 year old building that was lying derelict, gutted it, and transformed it into a warm, inviting place to showcase his art. Cimarron Song Gallery also displays the works of other artists currently including Ralph Oberg, Shirley Novak, and Julee Hutchison. We loved the gallery and it was there that I met Gregory and his wife. We were blown away by his beautiful paintings. Ralph was right when he declared, “he is really good.” This episode of the Artful Painter is Gregory Packard’s inspiring story.

She paints in order to know the land. Many painters focus on epic, sweeping vistas, stopping short of moving in closer to the subject as if they were held back by an invisible force field. Jill, on the other hand, breaks through that force field and moves the viewer in for a closer, intimate look at what others may pass by without ever noticing. By zooming into the scene, she captures the essence of the place. Up close her paintings take on an abstract quality with rich colors, beautiful brush strokes and textures. As you pull back, her paintings resolve into a scene of contemplative beauty and thoughtfulness. Jill\'s paintings are a poetic expression of her deep reverence for nature and the landscape.

Before Dan became a fine art artist, like a lot painters, he got his start in commercial illustration. His career in illustration taught him two things: 1) he drew everyday and as a result he learned to draw really well, and 2) he developed good business sense while working as a freelance illustrator. Those lessons have served him well as a fine art painter. When selecting what to paint, Dan is keen on painting something more than just a pretty picture. He wants to evoke feelings and emotions in the viewers of his paintings. He wants the viewer to not just see the hay stacks in a Colorado field, but smell them. Not just see a snow ladened tree, but feel how cold the air is around it. Not just see a river at sunset, but feel the motion of the water. To that end, he looks for concepts and shapes and endeavors to look beyond the obvious. It’s a never ending quest, one where Dan says he is always a student.

Currently residing in New Zealand, Andrew was born in Texas. Later, his family immigrated to Australia when he was a young child. The son of sculpturer, Andrew loved to look at his father’s art books. He became enthralled with American wildlife painter Carl Rungius. Moved by the paintings he saw, Andrew began painting at a young age, and quickly progressed to become a professional, full-time artist by the time he was 21 years of age. Early in his career, Andrew strove to create quality paintings. In order to do that, he felt the need to work out a methodology to produce consistent quality. He became obsessed with the process of painting. Andrew likens his obsession to surfers who go around the world searching to catch the perfect wave. He is addicted to the search and the chase of an idea for a painting, and he is addicted to the feeling of making the best painting possible. This episode clocks in at over two hours long. Andrew does not hold back! He explains where his ideas for a painting comes from and how he develops that idea. Andrews shares three questions all artists should ask when developing an idea. He says these questions have transformed his career as an artist. Though Andrew achieve early financial success as a professional artist - like a lot of artists he was affected by the global downturn in the economy. That downturn taught him the importance of diversifying his sources of income and in this episode he explains how he has accomplished that.

Coming from a creative family of professional artists, he was always interested in drawing and imagining ideas visually. After working as an illustrator full time from 2004-2015 he shifted focus to more personal work using oils and watercolor. As a portrait/figurative painter, Nick works from life as well as photography, describing his art as something close to “abstracted realism”, with an objective of expressing as much of the realistic human element of life as possible through a limited and often simplified approach to his rendering or brushwork, giving an illusion of realism while, at the same time, breaking shapes and form down enough to have a close balance with abstraction. Full shownotes: http://yourcreativepush.com/335 In this episode, Nick discusses: -Why he came back to drawing and painting. -Balancing personal work vs. client/commission work. -Finding a love for painting with oils and watercolor. -The experience of making the movie poster for “The Death of Superman Lives.” -His advice to become obsessed with things that you enjoy doing. -His advice for selling your work on social media without feeling slimey. -What a typical day looks like for him. -The fear of showing old work or failures. -Getting past ruts. -The power of secret sketchbooks. -Putting aside your five favorite pieces of art to open your mind to making new “favorites.” -Dealing with shyness.

(Link->  https://www.photopodcasts.com/podcasts/photography-and-gear-24-ppn-color-management-is-easy-with-ross-grieve)\xa0  Though I love the results I get with my Colorchecker Passport, I\'ve found it can be a bit cumbersome managing all of the profiles in LightRoom. Does Ross recommend keeping them all, or does he delete some of the more specific or odd ones after he\'s finished with the images from that shoot? If he does delete them, does he have an easy way to do it? Because all of the tutorials I read online were a bit involved. \xa0 He commented that he used the grey/white card part of the Colorchecker and also the part with all the colored squares. But the colored square part has a white square on it. Why do both? \xa0 Do either of you have any recommendations for the types of light bulbs and lamps used in the room where you do your post-processing? And where should the lamp be in the room, relative to the monitor? \xa0 Also, he commented on doing images on way home from a trip once, which was interesting because the light would continuously change conditions in the car. Did he feel confident in post-processing on the move because he had previously calibrated his device via the color management systems and therefore trusted that the device had it right even if it looked different to his eyes? Thank you so much for your time and expertise.

Ibarionex is a photographer, writer, educator, and podcast host. He has been working in the photo industry for more than 25 years and has written and photographed for publications including Outdoor Photographer, Rangefinder, Shutterbug and he is also the author of 6 photography books so far. Besides that, he is an Adjunct Professor at the Art Center College of Design and he’s a real celebrity in the photography podcast universe. He is the host and producer of “The Candid Frame Photography podcast” that he started in 2006. Since then he has interviewed hundreds of inspiring photographers, including some really famous ones, that are discussed in the episode. Currently, he has published more than 480 episodes! On this episode, Ibarionex shares some of the most interesting and memorable interviews with photographers that he has done in all those years and how it has influenced his view on photography? \xa0 This episode is sponsored by: Skylum Luminar - Simple and fast photo editing software http://bit.ly/PPN-Luminar3\xa0 \xa0 COSYSPEED - The fastest camera bags in the world. http://bit.ly/STREETOMATIC   Inspirational photographer of the month: Ibarionex picks American photographer Mary Ellen Mark (1940 - 2015) known for her photojournalism/documentary photography. She photographed people who were away from mainstream society and toward its more interesting, often troubled edges of society. Her photography went on to address such social issues such as homelessness, loneliness, drug addiction, and prostitution. Children are a recurring subject throughout much of her work. She was very good with people so that they would trust her and open up their soul without acting or pretending to be part of the socially accepted mainstream.\xa0 “When Photographing I want to reach out and touch something that I feel is at the core of people.” - Mary Ellen Mark http://www.maryellenmark.com\xa0 \xa0 Inspiring photographers that Ibarionex has interviewed and talked about in this episode: Mary Ellen Mark http://www.maryellenmark.com/\xa0 \xa0 Joel Meyerowitz https://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/ \xa0 Dan Winters https://danwintersphoto.com/ \xa0 Safi Alia Shabiak https://flashbulbfloozy.com/ \xa0 The Candid Frame episode with Safi Alia Shabiak:  http://www.ibarionex.net/thecandidframe/2019/4/28/the-candid-frame-464-safi-alia-shabaik   Links to Ibarionex Perello’s work and social media accounts: Website:www.thecandidframe.com\xa0\xa0 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/Ibarionex/\xa0\xa0 Twitter: https://twitter.com/Ibarionex\xa0\xa0 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ibarionex\xa0 Japan Workshop with Ibarionex:  https://www.nobechicreative.com/workshops#/tokyo-explorations-in-the-metropolis-with-ibarionex-perello-and-george-nobechi/ \xa0  Inspirational Photo Book Pick of the Month: “Making Photographs - Developing a Personal Visual Workflow” by Ibarionex Perello. “In Making Photographs, photographer Ibarionex Perello teaches you how to face and conquer two of the greatest challenges for a photographer: to consistently make good images and to see the photographic possibilities all around you.” \xa0 Published by Rocky Nook (and in Germany by dPunkt Verlag) - 320 Pages \xa0 English version:  http://www.ibarionex.net/thecandidframe/2018/9/26/40-off-making-photographs-developing-a-personal-visual-workflow\xa0\xa0 \xa0 German version at Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/34E90Bu    Marco Larousse Street Photography Workshop October 2019:\xa0https://www.marcolarousse.com/street-photography-workshops   Links to Marco Larousse: Web: www.MarcoLarousse.com\xa0 Twitter: @HamburgCam Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/marco.larousse/\xa0 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarcoLarousse1 \xa0 Links to PPN: Web: www.PhotoPodcasts.com or PPN.fm\xa0 Twitter: @Photopodcasts Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/photopodcasts/ YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ppnphotopodcastnetwork Apple Podcasts: http://bit.ly/ppn-apple-podcasts\xa0   Please support our show by using our B&H affiliate link (click here) or Amazon Germany link (click here) that will not cost you a penny more than when you are buying at B&H or Amazon without our link. \xa0 Check out the Skylum LUMINAR software: Link: http://bit.ly/PPN-Luminar3 (use the discount code “PHOTOPODCASTS” at checkout for extra savings) And please share this podcast with your friends and subscribe via Apple podcasts, Google Podcasts, or search for “PPN” in your favorite podcast app. We would also love to get your feedback.

Determining the “why” before the “how” in photography is essential to understanding your subject better and create stronger images. In each episode, they introduce you to an inspirational photographer of the month and also share an inspirational photo book of the month. | PPN listeners have requested a show on Color Management and Workflow as this is an important step in your photography workflow in order to get consistent looking image results. But some photographers leave this step out because it seems to be too complicated or they just go with their gut feeling. But thanks to modern technology, things are not that hard anymore as it used to be and on this show, we’ll explain the why and the how of a color-managed workflow in an easy to understand way. Because one of the biggest secrets of a color-managed workflow is that it’s pretty easy to do once you use the right tools. \xa0 We’ve invited pro photographer and color management expert, Ross Grieve to the show to take us step by step through a good color management process. Ross is a qualified member of the Master Photography Association, a Panasonic LUMIX Ambassador and an X-Rite Coloratti Master. \xa0 This show is sponsored by: COSYSPEED - The fastest camera bags in the world. http://bit.ly/STREETOMATIC (use the discount code “ppn10” at checkout for extra savings) \xa0 \xa0 Skylum Luminar3 - The cutting edge photo editor http://bit.ly/PPN-Luminar3\xa0 (use the discount code “PHOTOPODCASTS” at checkout for extra savings)   These are some of the relevant color management accessories that Marco and Ross cover on this episode: \xa0 X-Rite ColorChecker Passport Photo: B&H: https://bhpho.to/30Gou5A\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2LbtVmn\xa0 \xa0 X-Rite ColorMunki Photographer Kit (Standard Display Calibration & ColorChecker): B&H: https://bhpho.to/30HYjLU\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2zqel0L\xa0 \xa0 X-Rite ColorMunki Smile (Very Basic Display Calibration): B&H: https://bhpho.to/30DEJQY\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2LbjvU1\xa0 \xa0 X-Rite ColorMunki Display (Standard Display Calibration): B&H: https://bhpho.to/2oKEKkE\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2KZ40zs\xa0 \xa0 X-Rite i1 Display Pro (Display and Projector Calibration): B&H: https://bhpho.to/30Q24z3\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2PjYdJe\xa0 \xa0 X-Rite i1 Studio Spectrophotometer (Display, Projector, Scanner, and Printer Calibration): B&H: https://bhpho.to/30JOHAc\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2Zr6EqQ\xa0 \xa0 Printing and color management PPN More Gear Show #16 with Travis Mc Connaghy from Hahnemuehle paper:  https://www.photopodcasts.com/podcasts/more-gear-show-16-ppn-how-to-print-better-photos-with-travis-mc-connaghy-from-hahnemuehle\xa0   Demystifying color management for your printing with Ross Grieve (YouTube): https://youtu.be/WkQQbbYrzlg \xa0 Getting Perfect Color in Any Light with the ColorChecker Passport Photo 2: https://youtu.be/TEzP8AynPos \xa0  Links to Ross Grieve: Web: http://www.rossgrieve.com\xa0 Twitter: @RossGrievePhoto Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rossagrieve/\xa0 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ross.grieve\xa0 Podcast: http://www.talkingshot.co.uk   Links to Marco Larousse: Web: www.MarcoLarousse.com\xa0 Twitter: @HamburgCam Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rossagrieve/\xa0 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarcoLarousse1 \xa0 Links to PPN: Web: www.PhotoPodcasts.com Twitter: @Photopodcasts Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/photopodcasts/ YouTube: http://youtube.com/c/ppnphotopodcastnetwork\xa0   Please support our show by using our B&H affiliate link (click here) or Amazon Germany link (click here) that will not cost you a penny more than when you are buying at B&H or Amazon without our link.

Marco invited Scott Bourne back on the show to step on their virtual soapbox and discuss some of the claims about the demise of the M4/3 system now that so many new Full-Frame mirrorless camera systems have entered the market. And in the second half of the show, they cover some mirrorless news, a mirrorless listener question, and pick the mirrorless photographer and photo of the month. \xa0 This show is sponsored by: COSYSPEED - The fastest camera bags in the world. http://bit.ly/STREETOMATIC\xa0 \xa0 Skylum Luminar3 - The cutting edge photo editor http://bit.ly/PPN-Luminar3\xa0  The claim “Micro Four-Thirds is dead, ranks pretty high on the clickbait charts these days, but there are plenty of facts and arguments that contradict these claims. For example, some people may see the introduction of the Full-Frame S1 camera system by Panasonic LUMIX as proof, that Panasonic will abandon their M4/3 camera system. While looking at Fuji and Sony who run two complete camera systems with different sensor sizes successfully next to each other, such a move can simply be seen as a move to grow market share catering to more photographers. Besides that, different sensor sizes do have certain advantages over the other and some of these are covered in this episode. Some cameras and lenses matching this conversation are: Olympus OM-D E-M1X B&H: https://bhpho.to/2CEmWhH\xa0 \xa0 Panasonic LUMIX G9 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2Jy9B0u\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2KxmzJy\xa0 \xa0 Panasonic GH5 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2JQLhr1\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/31t1AP4\xa0 \xa0 Olympus ED 300mm f4 IS PRO lens B&H: https://bhpho.to/2JQ4kBB\xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2yOsSTB\xa0 \xa0 Panasonic Leica DG Vario-Elmarit 50-200mm f2.8-4 ASPH O.I.S.

The upgraded second version of this camera has improved in especially in the speed and usability department. A huge rear LCD and higher resolution EVF next to quicker start-up time and less blackout time between shots. Marco was also really impressed by the new USB-C option to tether the camera directly to your iPad Pro and run Hasselblad’s Phocus 2 app as an instant preview and editing extension to your workflow. And another nice fact about the camera is that the price has been reduced considerably compared to the release price of the previous version. B&H: https://bhpho.to/2ZLIOlG\xa0 \xa0 Hasselblad CFV II Scott and Marco have fond memories of working with their analog V500 Hasselblad systems. And now Hasselblad revives the system with the CFV II 50C digital back. It attaches to old analog V500 cameras and turns them into a digital medium format camera system. But with the addition of the new tiny 907X body, the CFV II tunes into a very compact medium format camera for the new Hasselblad XCD lens system. And conveniently, that setup allows for autofocus, too. \xa0 Hasselblad 907X Special Edition B&H: https://bhpho.to/2ZPYrZ4\xa0   Olympus Tough TG-6 Camera SSummertimeis rugged camera time and Olympus added some improved features to this latest iteration of the TG-system that Marco and Scott discuss.

I shoot in color and often with a flash. Most of the time the color and white balance on the subject is pretty spot on, but the background with artificial room light is sometimes completely off and looks distracting.

For example, the Fujifilm wide-angle lenses go down to f/22. However, I\'ve heard of a quality impairing effect called diffraction which sets in at small apertures. What is this? Should I use f/22 at all? If not, what is your recommendation for landscapes and what is the purpose of f/22 on a lens?  Question from: Peter, near Koblenz, Germany Links for this question: Lens Diffraction & Photography explained by Cambridge Color:  https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/diffraction-photography.htm What is Lens Diffraction by Expert Photography: https://expertphotography.com/lens-diffraction/\xa0  Update regarding PPN Q&A #14 - Topic: Photomechanic Hi Marco. I very much enjoyed this episode, which was full of good, real-life advice on interesting topics. I have an additional suggestion for the question on workflow from Victor, in Dayton, Ohio. I do a lot of amateur wildlife and sports event photography, and even a full day’s street shooting can generate hundreds of images to review. I have tried Photo Mechanic on a month’s free offer, but I also tried the Faststone Image Viewer, which is free for amateur or educational use. Photo Mechanic does a range of extra things as you described in the show, but Faststone works in the same way by showing just the embedded jpeg extremely quickly and letting you move or copy the good images for later ingestion by your raw processor, and for my purposes this meant I could save the £170 cost of Photo Mechanic. One tip common to both programs: the embedded jpegs aren’t very large files, so although they are both great for a quick scan to weed out poorly composed and exposed shots, I find critical sharpness needs checking in the full raw file, so only use them to chuck out obviously unsharp images. I hope that’s useful, especially for non-professional listeners.

Siegfried was born in Northern Germany and picked up a camera to become a street photographer 20 years ago after visiting a photo exhibition by André Kertész. He developed a unique photography style that leads to many publications and exhibitions of his work all over the world. He has solo published two books and has contributed to at least 13 more book publications. He is also a member of the prestigious In-Public (now called UP Photographers) street photography collective and some may have seen him appear in the Sky Arte TV Show “Master of Photography” in 2017. He is also one of the co-founders of the German Street Photography site and the German Street Photography Festival. \xa0 On this episode, Marco and Siegfried discuss how you can improve your street photography by working with a system and how going back to the same places over and over again increases your chances of getting a great shot. Siegfried established the catchy P.I.L.O.T. system to help you structure your street photography approach: P = Place I = Inspiration L = Layers O = Objects T = Theme \xa0 Inspirational photographer of the month: Siegfried picks Ernst Haas (born 1921 in Vienna, Austria - died 1986 in New York) an early adopter of Kodachrome color film at a time where most photographers were still using B&W film. His unique style of capturing graphic scenes and reflections in cities quickly attracted the attention of magazines and publishers. He was invited to join Magnum and even became Mangum\'s president in 1960. Ernst Haas photo books are very popular up to today and are often sold out. In September 2019 a new book of his will be published by Magnum and his estate. http://ernst-haas.com\xa0   Links to Siegfried Hansesn’s work and social media accounts: Website: https://siegfried-hansen.de\xa0 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/siegfried_hansen/\xa0 Twitter: https://twitter.com/siegfried1961\xa0 Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/streetphotography/\xa0 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/siegfried.hansen.1\xa0\xa0\xa0   Inspirational Photo Book Pick of the Month: \xa0 Siegfried picks: “Ernst Haas: Color Correction”\xa0 Hardback, 232 pages, Published by: Steidl \xa0 Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2jNm98T\xa0 Publishers Website:https://steidl.de/Books/Color-Correction-0318264155.html\xa0\xa0 The book shows complex, clever and vibrant color images that were never exhibited during Haas’s lifetime. \xa0 Marco picks: “Hold the Line” by Siegfried Hansen \xa0 Link: https://www.verlag-kettler.de/programm/hold-line#/\xa0 \xa0 Hold the Line is a beautiful and clever street photo book with a collection of lines, symmetry, and color in public space. It has 56 pages and was published by Kettler in May 2015. The book is sold out and now fetches quite high prices on the used photography book market.

Determining the “why” before the “how” in photography is essential to understanding your subject better and create stronger images. In each episode, they introduce you to an inspirational photographer of the month and also share an inspirational photo book of the month. | For the “On Talking Creativity” episode, Marco invited Jeffery Saddoris to the show. Jeffery was born in California and became a technical theater major in college. After working on scenery and costume design at different theaters in the US, he changed directions and became an instructor for HTML and Photoshop - which eventually led him to become an Art Director at Universal Studios. Since High-School, he has always explored photography and painting as a hobby and merged both passions together in mixed media art. After many years of practicing and teaching photography, he wanted to share and discuss the creative process in photography and art with the world. He started the website Faded & Blurred, which was a leading source of photographic inspiration from 2009-2015, and still is a great resource today. Jeffery joined NY photographer Bill Wadman in 2012 to co-host the popular weekly photography podcast “OTP - On Taking Pictures” which ran for 6 years and 326 episodes. Now Jeffery runs his own series of podcasts on creativity like “Process Driven”, Iterations”, or “In Between”. He’s also the author of a great photography guide “Photography by the Letter” (link:  https://jefferysaddoris.com/photography-by-the-letter/). Jeffery’s current short bio states: Serial Conversationalist, Podcaster, Author, Photographer, Painter. And on this episode, Marco and Jeffery discuss the creative struggles and sources of inspiration that artists and non-artists constantly encounter in their lives. \xa0 This episode is sponsored by: Skylum Luminar 3 - Simple and fast photo editing software http://bit.ly/PPN-Luminar3 \xa0 and \xa0 Marco Larousse Photography Workshops http://bit.ly/StreetPhotographyWorkshops   Jeffery picks Alexey Brodovitch (1898-1971) as his inspirational photographer/artist of the month. http://www.iconofgraphics.com/Alexey-Brodovitch/  Links to Jeffery Saddoris work and social media accounts: \xa0 Website: https://jefferysaddoris.com Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jefferysaddoris/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/jefferysaddoris Podcast: https://jefferysaddoris.com/everything/ \xa0\xa0    Inspirational Photo Book Pick of the Month: \xa0 Marco picks: “Photography by the Letter” by Jeffery Saddoris Link:  https://jefferysaddoris.com/photography-by-the-letter/ \xa0 Jeffery’s book is a comprehensive A-Z field guide for photographers. It’s visually a joy to look at and you can tell that he has spent a long time on composing the drawings and charts to explain the subject matter in a very organized and visual way. The book is structured in a way that you can look up a subject by the letter - for example, “A” like Angle of View or Aspect Ratio and read and look at the explanation and the accompanying drawings. And the subject matter ranges from old analog terms to modern digital photography terms. \xa0For example, you’ll find out how a bellow is used and how it relates to our modern macro extension tubes and Tilt-Shift lenses. And this makes this book a fun resource to explore for a photography beginner as well as a seasoned pro. This book will simply make you a more educated photographer. And it also inspires you to take action with photo exercises. \xa0The eBook is $20 and the hard copy is $30. Or you can currently pick up both in a digital bundle special for $40.  https://jefferysaddoris.com/photography-by-the-letter/  Jeffery picks: “Avedon’s France: Old World, New Look” \xa0 Hardback, 792 pages, Published by: Abrams & Chronicle Books Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2VAcHqh Publishers Website:\xa0https://www.abramsandchronicle.co.uk/book/9781419726002-avedons-france-old-world-new-look/ \xa0 Richard Avedon was fascinated with France.

For this show, Marco has invited back his friend, journalist, and reviewer of cameras and photographic equipment Angela Nicholson.  This show is sponsored by: \xa0 Skylum Luminar3 - The cutting edge photo editor http://bit.ly/PPN-Luminar3 \xa0 and \xa0 COSYSPEED - The fastest camera bags in the world. http://bit.ly/STREETOMATIC   Angela flew all the way to Rome to test out the new Fuji X-T30 camera. The new X-T30 replaced the X-T30 and gains some features of the top of the line X-T3, like the 26.1 MP BSI sensor, the AF-joystick, and a faster AF. But some features as lacking from the big brother like the second SD-card slot, the high res EVF, and the dedicated ISO dial. Angela has used the camera and shares her experience with it and how it compares to the X-T3. Just after we were done recording, Fuji issued a FW 1.01 update to lessen the effect of the X-T30 “accidental Q-button engagement.” After installing and testing the Q-button update, Angela has added her findings at the bottom of the X-T30 review at CameraJabber.com: https://camerajabber.com/fujifilm-x-t30-review/ \xa0 Fuji X-T30 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2IpXtPa Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2NnJPLr   Fuji released FW update 3.0 for the X-T3. The main improvements cover face and eye detect AF accuracy. Face AF priority has also been added - you can now select the face to focus and meter for when there are multiple people in the frame. And another improvement enables faster AF speed for subjects at a distance. X-T3 FW update on Fuji’s website: Fuji website:  https://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/software/firmware/x/xt3/index.html   Fuji Camera Remote App for iOS update. With this update to App V4.0 Marco thinks that the software has finally been improved from “painful to use” to “somewhat usable.” Marco discusses in the show what he thinks is still lacking from the program and urges all camera manufacturers to invest more effort in the features and usability of their smartphone apps. “If they want to compete with the constantly improving cameras on smartphones, they need to make their apps to be desirable to use and easy to pair to multiple devices.   Panasonic has released the Lumix G95/G90. Angela has had a hands-on with the camera and shares if this Lumix camera is more for the photographer, the videographer, or a truly 50-50 usable hybrid camera. Panasonic Lumix G95/G90 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2GuOg3T \xa0 Angela also had a longer hands-on with the Panasonic Lumix S1 and S1R cameras and chimes in with her experience and opinion of those cameras in comparison to other FF mirrorless cameras on the market. And she also shares if she would prefer the S1 or S1R in her camera bag. Panasonic Lumix S1 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2Ip0pLK \xa0 Panasonic Lumix S1R B&H: https://bhpho.to/2IoT9zJ   Ricoh introduced the new GR III camera. Both, Angela and Marco have tested the new compact mirrorless camera from Ricoh with its new 24MP APS-C sensor and newly rendered 28mm EFV lens. The rear LCD now is touch-enabled but there are a few things that Marco would have liked to see improved in this latest update to match this camera better to the target audience of street and travel photographers. Ricoh GR III B&H: https://bhpho.to/2GwfHdw Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2IEkOvN    Leica has introduced the Q2. The updated Q still has the fantastic fixed 28mm f1.7 lens but gained an almost 100% bump in resolution with the new full-frame sensor moving up from 24MP to 47MP! With this higher resolution, Leica implemented a third native crop mode to the camera. Next to the 35mm (30MP) and 50mm (14.7MP) in-camera crop modes the added 75mm crop still produces a 6.6MP image. The electronic viewfinder was also updated from LCD to OLED and the capacity of the battery was also improved. But the update did not implement two of Marco’s “like to have seen” features of a tilt-LCD and dedicated ISO dial. Leica Q2 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2Gv1pdl   Sigma will make 11 of their Art lenses available for L-mount in 2019. This should make Lumix and Leica SL owners very happy because Sigma’s Art lenses are high quality at reasonable prices. The L-mount availability will include the 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 40mm, 50mm, 85mm, and 105mm f1.4 DG HSM lenses as well as the 14mm and 135mm f1.8 and the 70mm f2.8 macro ART lenses. And Sigma is also introducing the MC-21 mount converter that will allow some of their SA and EF-mount lenses to adapt to the L-mount system. Sigma L-Mount lenses and MC-21 adapter: B&H: https://bhpho.to/2GuR5Sx \xa0 \xa0 Sony FW updates for a7 III and a9 cameras. The FW 3.0 for a7III and a7R III adds real-time Eye AF, Animal Eye AF plus interval shooting of 1-9999 exposures in 1 to 60 seconds intervals. The a9 FW 5.0 offers a new AI driven AF for better object recognition and real-time eye tracking plus some changes to the menu settings based on user requests. \xa0 Sony FW update website a7 III:  https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/e-mount-body-ilce-7-series/ilce-7m3#downloads \xa0 a7R III:  https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/e-mount-body-ilce-7-series/ilce-7rm3#downloads \xa0 a9:  https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/e-mount-body-ilce-9-series/ilce-9#downloads    Huawei P30 introduction. Angela has tried the new Huawei P30 smartphone with 4 built-in cameras and lenses. This smartphone offers a lot of versatility and features for photographers. The low-light quality is very good and even the computational DOF simulation of an up to f 0.95 lens does an impressive job of rendering fine detail and correctly applying it sharply to the subject or blurred to the background. But the P30 does seem to have some color issues in 4K video mode due to the new RYYB vs. the traditional RGGB pixel layout. But this should be fixable in a future FW update. Huawei P30 B&H: https://bhpho.to/2GuSJnb Amazon Germany: https://amzn.to/2Vm5729    Mirrorless question of the month: \xa0 Hi! One question about RAW converter and workflow with Fuji.

But would you consider to work for free for a charitable non-profit organization? I have been approached by a local organization and would like to hear your opinion if I should make an exception here? Love the shows! Regards, Soeren  Question from: Soeren, Stockholm, Sweden     Hi Marco, I enjoy your Podcast very much. I am considering the Fuji XT3, but you mentioned on your recent podcast that you would consider a full frame camera for large prints. So just how big can you print with the Fuji APS-C ( XT-2 or XT-3) cameras that you would consider museum quality? Especially, with the new algorithm in Photoshop to up-Res your pictures or even using On1 Software "Resize".

Book description from the publishers\' website: (The book contains) ...unique images from a photographic master that will make you smile but also think One of the all-time greats, Elliott Erwitt is a master whose photographs have defined the visual history of the 20th century - and the 21st. Although his work spans decades, continents and diverse subjects, it is always instantly recognizable. Spontaneous and original, Erwitt’s visions are imbued with true artistry and no trace of artifice. In this definitive collection, the master shares those works he considers his personal best.

In this regard, I believe historians will judge Scott Parsons’ work as being authentic, original, and (most importantly) a contribution to the historical trajectory of stained glass in architecture.”\xa0Kenneth von Roenn \xa0Scott Parsons: Sacramental Imagination Applying his graphic arts talent to the world of stained glass,\xa0Scott Parsons designed 26 stained glass windows created in three series for Our Lady of Loreto Parish in Foxfield, Colorado. Fabricated by Derix\xa0Glasstudio, Taunusstein, Gemany, these windows redefined the roles of both the artisans making the work as well as the new technologies and materials used in their creation. Through imagery not from stained glass tradition but rather a contemporary sensitivity and visual language common to our time, Parsons expresses what he calls sacramental imagination -\xa0a dimension beyond our perceived reality. \xa0“I am inspired by the idea of place, of defining a space with a sensitivity that can transform, celebrate, and engage the redemptive qualities of metaphor for the profoundly personal and communal in people’s lives.” An international award-winning artist, Parsons\xa0earned his MFA\xa0in Studio Art,\xa0magna cum laude, from the University of Colorado, Boulder in\xa01990. In addition to teaching printmaking and drawing as a professor of art at Augustana\xa0University\xa0in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, he has completed numerous public art commissions across the United States and Canada.\xa0His work, which has been\xa0reviewed in\xa0Architectural Record, Sculpture, Art in America, Stained Glass Quarterly, Public Art Review, and\xa0Faith & Form,\xa0includes Percent for Art and private commissions for churches, museums, research facilities, university buildings and transportation centers. Parsons has received five Faith & Form Awards for Liturgical Art and three CoD+A (Collaboration of Design and Art) Top 100 Projects Awards.In 2002, his terrazzo floor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, titled Algorithmic Tapestry, was recognized by Art in America as one of the most significant works of public art in the United States. In 2014, Parsons received two Honor Awards in Religious Arts: Visual Arts from the Interfaith Forum on Religion, Art, and Architecture (IFRAA) for his Our Lady of Loreto windows.\xa0The artist\xa0has also received\xa0multiple National Terrazzo and Mosaic Association Honor Awards for his designs in those mediums.\xa0 After serving on the Faith & Form jury this summer in Charlotte, North Carolina, Parsons currently\xa0is at work\xa0on new windows for La Casa, in Paradise Valley, Arizona, which will be installed next month. His list of upcoming commissions includes 15 Stations of the Cross mosaic panels for Saint Michaels in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; glass designs for a church in Kentucky; mosaics for a church in Missouri; and terrazzo for the airports in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  \xa0 | At first glance, the work of Evelyn Gottschall Baker could have been unearthed in an archeological dig outside of Buena Vista, Colorado, where the artist lives and works from her studio, Glass Fractions. But a closer look will reveal these perfectly colored and shaped skeletal remains are actually pâte de verreglass castings. Using her unique mold-free process, Gottschall Baker is putting her work on the map at events such as Bullseye Glass Co.’s 2018 Emerge/Evolve competition and exhibition. \xa0 On view now at the Belleview Art Museum, Belleview, Washington, Gottschall Baker’s series of animal bone replicas garnered her an Honorable Mention in Emerge/ Evolve 2018. The artist spent over a year developing her own technique for sculpting glass paste into forms that can be fired without a mold. Her experience and discipline as a test engineer proved invaluable in the methodical, detailed testing required to create the complex firing schedules for this kilnworking method, which must account for shrinkage, varying thicknesses, and the way in which heat affects individual components. \xa0 Beginning her career as a graphic artist and illustrator, Gottschall Baker eventually became an advertising manager and senior illustrator for the Department of the Army, for whom she created highly detailed, exacting paintings and drawings. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree, she became a test engineer for a large U.S. defense contractor. During this time, Gottschall Baker studied watercolor and oil painting, and took classes in stained glass, which allowed her to pursue a part-time career as a stained glass artist. \xa0 Gottschall Baker enrolled in her first fused glass class in 2011, primarily to create components to incorporate into stained glass pieces. But her interest in fused glass grew into a passion, which was eagerly pursued through a number of classes, many of which were offered by D&L Art Glass in Denver. \xa0 \xa0“Living in Colorado,” says Gottschall Baker, “I find it natural to try to capture the beauty of our local landscape into works of art using glass. My initial desire to simplify my style was well suited for stained glass, but as soon as I discovered glass fusing, I began re-introducing detail and realism into my art. During the several past years, I have embraced this realistic style, and have begun to use both traditional and non-traditional casting and mold techniques to create sculptures that depict the beauty around me.” In 2018, Gottschall Baker began teaching her techniques in workshops in various studios throughout the US, Canada, and Scotland. She’ll be teaching at Bullseye in Portland at the end of March 2020 and at Bullseye in Santa Fe in November 2020. \xa0 \xa0 | Eusheen Goines: The Fillacello King \xa0 Born in a small village known as Takima, Oregon, Eusheen Goines\xa0comes from a family of artists and musicians. At a young age, he learned to live off of creating art and travelling like a nomad. By the age of 18, this lifestyle took\xa0the artist on solo journey working for Renaissance Fairs throughout the country. \xa0 In 2000 Goines discovered flameworking glass while working at a smoke shop and began spending the majority of his free time behind the torch. For years, he\xa0worked with the some of the best artists in functional glass including Mike Luna and Darby Holm.\xa0Now residing in Evergreen, Colorado, Goines is a part of the\xa0Everdream Studio. \xa0 With a free-flowing style Goines creates functional art pieces that can be instantly recognized as his by their intricate, controlled detail and color. His aesthetic signature, the fillacello, is created much the same as reticello but is painstakingly laid out on tubing then filled with color before it is condensed. One would be hard pressed to find better examples of line work manipulation than that of Goines. \xa0 In addition to flameworking glass, Goines spends his time “skateboarding, snowboarding, traveling, rocking shows, and relaxing\xa0with friends and family.\xa0Everything you see in my portfolio,” he says, \xa0“is a direct influence from my Mom (Libby Goines) and Dad (Patrick Farley), my brother (Shen Goines),Warren and Wanda Goines (my grandparents), Gilbert Velasco, Darby Holm, Banjo Matt, Natey Biskind, Mike Luna, Chaz Pyle, Micah Blatt, Clinton Roman, Cowboy, Jarred Betty, The Dome School, and many many others.” \xa0 In 2006, Goines discovered the joy of teaching and began sharing his techniques in Japan and the U.S., including the Corning Museum of Glass, where he will teach a workshop in January 2020. The artist has now demonstrated worldwide in Australia, Japan, Germany, Costa Rica, and the U.S. \xa0 This Saturday, September 14, 2019, Goines and his fellow Everdream artists will be exhibiting work at HEATERZ 90210, a private high-class soiree in the heart of Beverly Hillz, featuring all new artwork and experiences curated by the collective. \xa0 For more information, stay tuned to the Everdream Instagram accounts: \xa0 Everdream Studio  AdamG\xa0@sweaterkingpin  N8 Miers\xa0@nathan_miers WJC\xa0@wjcglass Eusheen\xa0@eusheen Elbo\xa0@elboglass JoeP\xa0@joepglass &\xa0#Lazercat\xa0⛰www.heaterz90210.com \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Geometry and the projection of light have always been key components of Debora Coombs’ artwork. In 2013 she began exploring mathematical projections as a way to understand shifts between dimensions of space. Working from Penrose tiling (a two-dimensional shadowof a five-dimensional lattice), 3D sculptures in glass and paper were built using her classic design skills to explore various aspects of mathematics. A number of high-profile residencies have allowed Coombs to explore these new concepts. In the spring of 2016, she did a month-long collaborative residency with computer scientist Duane Bailey, and in October, a 2-week residency at Assets for Artists: The Studiosat MASS MoCAat the Massachusetts Museum for Contemporary Art, North Adams, Massachusetts. In 2017, a 3-week residency at Carroll College, Helena, Montana, allowed the artist to focus on the theological symbolism of geometry, which resulted in a commission for 85 square feet of hand painted geometric stained glass windows for All Saints, the new chapel on campus. That same year, Coombs spent a month at Jentel Artist Residencyin Banner, Wyoming, making a series of math-based drawings that led to the discovery of a new geometric figure. In February 2018, Coombs was invited by artist Lauren Bon of the Metabolic Studiosin Los Angeles, California, to spend two weeks collaborating and contributing to a landscape project for redirecting LA’s river water for the irrigation of city parks. In April, she presented this and other recent work at the 13th Biennial Gathering for Gardnerin Atlanta, Georgia, an international conference for mathematicians and artists. Then in May 2018, longtime New Yorker staff-writer Lawrence Weschler invited Coombs to speak at the Tamarind Institutein Albuquerque, New Mexico, as part of his Wonder Cabinet, a gathering of artists who work in close association with scientists. Coombs’ award-winning stained glass has been exhibited, commissioned and collected internationally for over 30 years. A Fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters, the artist studied stained glass at Edinburgh College of Art, Scotland; University of Wales, Swansea; and received her Master’s degree from the Royal College of Art in London, England, 1985. An experienced educator, Coombs directed the glass department at Chelsea College of Art in London from 1994 to 1996. She has lectured and taught stained glass for professional associations and colleges including Pilchuck Glass School, Stained Glass Association of America, American Glass Guild, and the British Society of Master Glass Painters. Her religious commissions include two 25-foot-tall figurative windows for Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, 20 stained glass windows for St. Mary’s Cathedral in Portland, Oregon, and 4 windows for St. Henry’s Catholic Church in Nashville, Tennessee. \xa0 Rare in the stained glass world, Coombs has successfully extended her devotion to content and story-telling to her non-commissioned work. Her piece, “Ornithologist,” from her 2009 Menfolk series, was included in New Glass Review 31, The Corning Museum of Glass publication dedicated to presenting cutting edge works of glass art. Her solo exhibition titled Menfolk, opened at the Jeanetta Cochrane Theater Gallery in London, England, before traveling to the Stained Glass Museum at Ely Cathedral, Cambridgeshire, England, in the spring of 2010. That same year, Coombs completed a collaborative work with artist Michael Oatman as part of his mixed-media installation “All Utopias Fell,” which remains permanently on exhibit at MASS MoCA. In June 2018 Coombs ran a hands-on pilot project for children and community members at the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and contributed to a panel discussion chaired by Margaret Wertheim from the Institute For Figuring about the connections between art and mathematics. The focus of this one-day conference was STEM to STEAM; practical ways to bring the A for Art into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs in education. In November 2018, Coombs completed two stained glass windows with geometric themes for Carroll College, Helena, Montana. Work continues on three more windows, scheduled for completion in February 2021. The artist’s sculptures are currently on exhibition at the Schow Science Library in Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts. \xa0 \xa0 | \xa0 Jane Bruce is an independent artist and educator based in New York City. She teaches and exhibits internationally and her dual\xa0careers of artist and maker\xa0have taken her around the world, from Europe to the USA, to Australia and back again. Bruce works in a range of techniques to create objects and mini installations, primarily through the processes of kiln forming, blowing and coldworking glass. \xa0 Born in England, Bruce received a Master of Arts from the Royal College of Art, London, and undertook further postgraduate study at the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred. She has been the recipient of a range of fellowships, visiting artist awards and grants, including fellowships from the Creative Glass Center of America and the New York Foundation for the Arts; artist-in-residence at The Studio of The Corning Museum of Glass, visiting artist at Museum of Glass, Tacoma, and a New Work Grant from the Australia Council. Exhibiting internationally, her work can be found in many major museum collections worldwide, including those of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; European Museum of Modern Glass (Europaisches Museum fur Modernes Glas, Kunstsammlunger der Veste Coburg) Germany; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Corning Museum of Glass, New York; Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio; and The Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia. \xa0 As an educator, Bruce served as senior lecturer in the Glass Workshop of\xa0 the Australian National University Canberra School of Art (1994 - 2001) and was Head of Workshop (2001-2003). She was artistic and technical director for Northlands Creative Glass, Caithness, Scotland (2003-2007) and continues to organize annual symposiums there for British and international artists and students. She has also taught workshops in the US at UrbanGlass in Brooklyn, New York, Bullseye Glass Co., in Portland, Oregon, and Pilchuck Glass School, Stanwood, Washington. \xa0 Bruce’s Vase, Bottle, Bowl\xa0series furthered the artist’s exploration of the vessel, which is deeply rooted in the history of the decorative or applied arts. Interested in the essential\xa0object, she reduces the vessel to its central and fundamental parts and attributes. She says: “If I were to pick an adjective to describe this work, it might be formal. As well as abstracting the vessel and presenting its elemental nature, it is also important as to how composition, color, light, proportion, and the juxtaposition of positive and negative space work within the object, and how a group of objects form a resolved statement.” \xa0 On the other hand, Bruce’s Houseseries explored a more personal concern related to landscape and loss in a particular place. In what became known as The Clearances, (1760-1830), the Highlands of Scotland were emptied and became a wilderness. Even today, with many ruined crofts still dotting the Caithness landscape, there continues to be a strong sense of loss and desolation in that place. “Inspired by this history and what remains, the current house forms seek to evoke thoughts of loss, the past and what might have been.” \xa0 Bruce is working on two related series currently categorized as Indefinite Objectsand Deep Space Panels, both addressing deep and never-ending space. As the viewer moves around the works they seem to change and reconfigure as the viewer’s viewpoint changes. These new series will be on view in an exhibition titled Constructs: The Thing About Space Is That It Just Keeps Going,\xa0at River House Arts, Toledo, Ohio, from October 4 – November 16, 2019. Although these new works contain very little glass, and the Deep Space panels contain none at all, they are about space and light, which Bruce considers to be inherent qualities of glass. \xa0 From November 5 through December 10, 2019, Bruce will teach her workshop, Color, Light, Glass: An Introduction to Kilnformed Glass\xa0at UrbanGlass. In June 2020, the artist will travel to North Lands Creative Glass for an international artist symposium that will look at issues of home and place and which she founded and has coordinated since 2010. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Whether a chameleon, a crested kingfisher or a Cristo Rhinoceros hornbill, Devin Somerville’s high-end art pipes begin with custom millies that are stacked and assembled into mind-blowing and unforgettable creatures. Also known as Crunklestein, the artist’s take on the ancient Italian technique of millefiore has become his aesthetic signature. Once a process amongst many used by Crunklestein, when friends, fans, and fellow artists came face to face with his colorful, ornate millie pipes, the artist was encouraged to make all of his work using the chip stack technique he developed. \xa0 Somerville,aka Cap’n Crunk Glass, resides in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and produces a variety of dab rig styles, specializing in the mini or tiny tube design. His small dab rigs usually include mini encased millies throughout the neck and body of the piece, while his full sized incredibly detailed and realistic sculpted oil rigs showcase his unlimited range of talent and creativity.\xa0 Blowing glass since before the year 2000, Crunklestein currently creates the largest work of his career for an exhibition and workshop to be presented at Level 42 Gallery in Asheville, North Carolina. On Friday, August 16, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., Somerville will teach his millie making techniques, and on Saturday, August 18, his stacking and sculpting processes. Later Saturday evening, an exhibition of new Crunklestein functional glass and collabs opens at Level 42 Gallery. Amongst other career highlights, Somerville is the only two-time champion of The Bern Gallery’s Pipe Classic, held in Burlington, Vermont, each of the last 14 years.The Pipe Classic is the world’s first and longest running pipe-making competition, bringing together 12 of the world’s most prolific pipe-makers for an annual event that forever changed competitive pipe-making as we know it. Names are made, heroes are born, and champions are crowned. This year’s field features three past champions, and a who’s-who of the medium’s masters. Twelve artists, 12 hours, 12 pipes, one champion!\xa0Be there at Pipe Classic 14, held September 23 – 29, 2019. \xa0 \xa0 | The Permission of the Mind Howard Ben Tré Using methods learned in his metal-foundry class at Brooklyn Technical High School, Howard Ben Tré pioneered the art of casting molten glass long before YouTube tutorials and Facebook casting groups existed. His hands-on technical innovations changed what was possible in cast glass and allowed Ben Tré to create career defining monumental sculptures that could survive the rigors of outdoor installation. Among Ben Tré’s public commissions are the award-winning installation of fountains and seating created for Post Office Square Park in Boston; the plaza and sculpture for BankBoston’s headquarters in downtown Providence; an interactive fountain for the hall of the renovated Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston; the pedestrianization and street scheme redesign of Warrington Town Center in England; and plazas with sculpture/fountains and landscaping for Target Corporation Headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Whether casting glass for public spaces or personal series, Ben Tré found inspiration in the geometry of ancient ritual objects and historical architecture. His\xa0Wrapped Forms\xa0(1998 - 2000) evoke the relics and customs of Asian ritual while Lightness of Being\xa0(2008) juxtaposes fragility and strength, masculine and feminine. As light is transmitted, diffused, and refracted through the dense glass mass, Ben Tré’s sculpture takes on a mysterious life of its own. Sections of the glass were treated with gold leaf either on the surface or by installing gold leaf covered lead bars within the glass matrix, adding to the magic. \xa0 Public and personal work plays off one another, sparking new ideas and forms. In fact, they emanate from the same source— Ben Tré’s desire to use art to bring people together in our collective humanity. Whether viewed in a public square or a private gallery, his cast glass returns us to the realm where utopian visions and social ideals don’t seem so foolish. Ben Tréreminds us that if we give our minds permission, anything is possible. \xa0 \xa0 Ben Tré’s work is included in numerous private collections in the US, Europe and Asiaand in more than 101 museum and public collections worldwide, among them the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto; and the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Nice. He has been featured in 54 solo exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad, including a ten-year retrospective organized by the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, that traveled nationally, and a retrospective exhibition at the Glass Art Museum in Toyama, Japan. Other one-person exhibitions of sculptures and drawings include those organized by the Musée d’Art Moderne et d’Art Contemporain in Nice; the David Winton Bell Gallery at Brown University; the Toledo Museum of Art; and the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art. Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1949, Ben Tré received a B.S.A. from Portland State University, Portland, Oregon,\xa0in 1978 and a M.F.A from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1980. He is a three-time recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and a three-time recipient of the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts Fellowship. His achievements in the visual arts were recognized by the First Annual Pell Awards for Excellence in the Arts (1996), the Artist Award of Distinction by the National Council of Art Administrators (2005), and the Aileen Osborn Webb Award (2006). His public art has been recognized with awards by the Providence Preservation Society for Urban Design (1998), the British Council for Shopping Centres for Town Centre Environment (2002), and the Royal Town Planning Institute for Best Urban Design Project (2002). Currently 40 years of drawings, works on paper, lecture notes and a number of sculptures in the Ben Tre’ collection dating back to 1977 are being assembled and archived for research purposes. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Viewing the hot sculpted work of Prague’s Martin Janecký inspires a sensation akin to gazing upon precious and antique art treasures from around the globe. His glass busts in white or black glass remind us that the human form speaks volumes about beauty, history, hope and art in a way that no other object could. Born in the Czech Republic in 1980, Janecký\xa0began working with glass at the age of 13 at his father’s factory. His secondary school training at Novy Bor concentrated on the creation of glass art and introduced him to artists and designers from around the world that hired him to execute their ideas. In 2003, the young artist made his first trip to the United States where he studied at the Pilchuck Glass School under Richard Royal and William Morris. Among Janecký’s most recognized strengths was his mastering of blowing and sculpting “inside the bubble,” the technique used in the creation of his startling original works. Before long, Janecký\xa0became a highly sought teacher in his field. He has taught, demonstrated and exhibited in Europe, America, Australia, Africa and Asia, to include the Corning Museum of Glass, Pilchuck Glass School, Chrysler Museum of Art, UrbanGlass, the Rietveld Academy in Holland, Bornholm Design School in Denmark, the Australian National University in Canberra, and the Toyama City Institute of Glass Art in Japan, among many. Following a 2013 visit to Mexico, Janecký embarked on an exploration of the human skull in a tribute to Dia de Muertos, an outgrowth of his passion for the culture and people of Mexico. He says: “The willingness of the Mexican people to share this occasion with an outsider like me, someone from a totally different environment, was a humbling experience that inspired me to want to create a body of work that honors and celebrates this amazing event. My plan was to recreate iconic examples of this culture in glass, which had never been done on this scale. I did so with humility and a huge respect for Mexico’s history and culture.” \xa0 Janecký’s homeland,The Czech Republic, is rightfully proud of its own globally recognized tradition of glassmaking. Writes Dr. Petr Nový,\xa0Head Curator, Museum of Glass Jablonec nad Nisou, Czech\xa0Republic: “Martin Janecký’s expressive realism is somewhat alien to the Czech art scene, meaning it isn’t always met with a clear sense of comprehension. It is as if non-abstract works should primarily be viewed as handicraft instead of art. But in Janecký’s case, superb handicraft serves as a springboard for this unique artist to be able to capture emotions in his glass works. And such power is something we find only very rarely in the contemporary world of studio glass art. … “Janecký has earned a rightful place among the greatest not just Czech, but also global, stars of the glass art scene. His original works are generating great enthusiasm among galleries and collectors, including from global celebrities. His successes are not just the result of talent, creativity, and artistic boldness, but chiefly a considerable amount of hard work. Expertise in the field of glass art requires constant application and searching out new limits – and that is only possible with an all-encompassing day-to-day dedication. Although Janecký’s confidence as an artist has undoubtedly grown, he nonetheless remains humble with regards to his chosen material, knowing there is still so much to discover. And this approach is evidently one of the key reasons why Martin Janecký’s glass works are so remarkably distinct.” | The Corning Museum of Glass is a proud collaborator on an exciting, new competition series,\xa0Blown Away—created by producers marblemediaand a co-production of Netflix andBlue Ant Media\xa0of Toronto. The 10-episode show, which will bring the art of glassblowing to a global audience through the Netflix streaming platform, will launch on July 12, 2019. \u2028\u2028 \xa0 The show follows a group of 10 highly skilled glassmakers from North America who have a limited time to fabricate beautiful works of art that are assessed by a panel of expert judges. One artist is eliminated in each 30-minute episode until a winner is announced in the 10th and final episode. YouTube star Nick Uhas, best known for his popular science show Nickipedia, hosts Blown Awayand renowned artist Katherine Gray serves as the “resident evaluator.” \xa0 The series was filmed in the largest glassblowing studio ever built in North America, designed specifically for the scope and scale of the competition. The space allows 10 artists to work simultaneously, using two large glass-melting furnaces, 10 reheating furnaces and 10 individual work stations. The Craft and Design Glass Studio at Sheridan College in Toronto consulted on the studio design and aided the competitors for the first nine episodes. \xa0 The Corning Museum of Glass, which houses the world’s most comprehensive collection of glass, the library of record on glass, and one of the top glassmaking schools in the world, served as a key consulting partner on the series.\xa0Eric Meek, Senior Manager of Hot Glass Programs at CMoG also served as a “guest evaluator” for the series finale, helping to select the winner of the competition. \xa0 The winner of Blown Awayis awarded the title of “Best in Blow” and a prize package valued at $60,000, which includes a week-long Guest Artist appearance at CMoG. The winner will complete two working sessions this summer, July 17-18 and August 28-29, in preparation for the “Blown AwayResidency,” October 14-18. During these times, the winner will participate in glassmaking demonstrations for the public in CMoG’s Amphitheater Hot Shop. \xa0 This summer, CMoG is displaying the exhibit Blown Away:Glassblowing Comes to Netflix, which tells the story of how the Museum found its way into the global spotlight. Visitors can see work created on the show by each competitor, and watch a behind-the-scenes documentary with interviews conducted on the set and footage captured of the Museum’s Hot Glass Demo Team taking part in the finale. \xa0 “The Corning Museum of Glass inspires people to see glass in a new light,” said Eric Meek. “Blown Away\xa0is a global platform, and it’s exciting to think about how this will broaden glassmaking’s level of exposure.” \xa0 \xa0For a complete list of contestants and judges visiting talking our your glass.com, click on Season 4, click on Blown Away. Or visit www.cmog.organd search for Blown Away. \xa0 Thanks to our sponsors His Glassworks, Inc, Sunshine Glassworks Ltd., Bullseye Glass company and the Corning Museum of Glass. \xa0 I’ll begin the show asking Donna Luke, Blue Marble’s vice president of production, about the behind the scenes story of Blown Away. Then I visit with Eric Meek about the Corning Museum of Glass’ role in the program, and finish up by interviewing one of the judges, Katherine Gray. \xa0 \xa0 Blown Away contestants include  Deborah Czeresko – Veteran glass artist based in New York City Kevin Kiff – California-based glass artist Benjamin Kikkert – Vancouver-based glass artist Leah Kudel – Canadian glass artist Janusz Poźniak – British born, Seattle-based glass artist Patrick Proimeau – Canadian glass artist and glass studio operator Alexander Rosenberg – Philadelphia-based artist, educator, and writer Momoko “Momo” Schafer – Recent graduate of MassArt Annette Sheppard – Former CMoG glass artist and current management consultant Edgar Valentine – Tacoma-based glass artist  \xa0 Guest evaluators include  Chris Taylor – Pilchuck Glass School Marc Lepine – Gastronomy chef Jay MacDonell – Lighting designer Jesse Hirsch – Futurist Emily Pearce-Bibona – International wine judge and sommelier Perry Tung – Bonhams Auction House Catherine Osborne – Architecture & design expert Janet Morrison – Sheridan College Greta Hodgkinson – National Ballet of Canada Eric Meek – The Corning Museum of Glass  \xa0 \xa0 | The functional glass community is defined, in part, by the technical mastery and mind-blowing aesthetic of high-end art pipes. But in equal measure, philanthropy defines this growing segment of the glass art community. One key player in organizing charitable events within the pipe community is Allison Key, founder and director of the well-known Michigan Glass Project (MGP), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\xa0 The 2019 MGP will be held July 19 - 21 at the Russell Industrial Center, Detroit, Michigan. MGP’s mission is to unite artists through charitable events that create and foster positive change in the community.Artwork created on site at the yearly happening is sold, auctioned, or raffled to raise money for a philanthropic cause. A large silent auction is held during MGP with artwork continually being added throughout the weekend. Profits generated above expenses to hold the event are donated to the yearly charity. Since its inception in 2012, MGP has donated $36,000 to The Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit, the nation’s oldest operating aquarium. In 2015, MGP began working with Art Road Nonprofit, an organization dedicated to returning art classes to Detroit area public schools, donating $40,000 to the cause. MGP’s 2016 event double that donation to $80,000. Previously Art Road was only able to provide art to grades K-5 at Spain Elementary, but the increased funds allowed middle schoolers at that school to be added to the roster. MGP’S 2017 donation marked a milestone in giving as the organization hit its $100,000 goal. Art Road used the additional money to add art class to a fourth school. The following year’s $125,000 resulted in the addition of art classes at two Ecorse schools. Thanks in part to MGP, Art Road now provides complete art class curriculum including instructors and supplies to over 2,200 Metro Detroit students at six schools. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 To document this unique and highly successful project, Dan Collins, filmmaker who worked on Marble Slinger’s 2012 Degenerate Artmovie and his own documentary about Marcel Braun’s Project 33, will produce a documentary film on Key and MGP. A Kickstarter to raise funds for Collins’ film will be launched next week some time, around the first of July 2019. \xa0 Key is co-owner of Urban Pheasant Glass Studio, the Crystal Dragon at the Michigan Renaissance Festival, a wholesale glass business called Key Glass Co. and a retail location in Detroit called Motown Shakedown. In 2018, Key also became co-owner of Glassroots Art Show, a fixture in the industry as a multi-faceted event bringing together suppliers, toolmakers, high-end artists, production blowers, distribution companies, galleries, and head shops. After celebrating a decade in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2019 Glassroots is moving to Asheville, North Carolina, where the trade show will be held October 7 through 9. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Former editor of Glass Art magazine Shawn Waggoner interviews internationally respected artists and experts in hot, warm and cold glass.

Cassie provides advice and strategy suggestions in addition to sharing some of her own experiences related to building development in the San Francisco Bay Area, including a writer whom she sees as invaluable resource, and an artist, the German Sibylle Peters, as an ideal role model. She describes art institutions as ideal access points – highways, even - to people in finance or real estate, particularly board members; and ultimately describes this type of (socially engaged) work as the opportunity to both make a difference and at the same time to create an ambitious practical – even grandiose – joke. | Artist and co-director of London’s Furtherfield (London’s longest-running arts organization dedicated to de-centralized network culture) talks about: Her experience being a sculptor in London just as the YBA (Young British Artist) scene began to emerge, and the troubling effects she saw it having on the city as a livable community for artists; the early internet art projects she made and curated; the first trans-humanist project (that she knows of), produced by a Finnish artist she worked with, in which he recorded everything happening in his life to the point that his consciousness could be uploaded to the net; the origins of her gallery Furtherfield, which is London’s longest-running arts organization dedicated to de-centralized network culture; and her work with blockchain and cryptocurrency- how they work in relation to art and artists, and how in her (web-based) community, blockchain is a way to re-think the world’s social order – including live-action role play -\xa0 as opposed to just being leveraged as another capital-focused tool (Bitcoin etc.). | It's mid-August of 2019, and while The Conversation takes a week off, we are re-releasing this Blast from the Past, Lisa Schiff from episode #99, which was originally released on Jan. 3rd, 2015. She is the president and founder of SFA Advisory. We selected this episode both because it's one many listeners may not be familiar with (since it's too old to show up in podcast platform queues), and because we feel it's a nice counterpoint to the recent programming we've been doing that's tended toward way outside the mainstream art market...whereas Ms. Schiff generally operates very much inside of it. Here are the original notes included with that episode: The Conversation, Episode 99:\xa0 Lisa Schiff of Schiff Fine Art in New York talks about: what she does as an art advisor; the art market, vis-a-vis the Miami fairs, being bullish and the biosphere; why she’s an advisor and not a dealer; and the artists she’s visited and is passionate about. | Thunder Bay, Ontario and Bay Area artist Cassie Thornton talks about: Her origins in northern Illinois, where she mainly grew up with a mom who struggled financially and was at the cutting edge of the downside of the financial crash, which planted an early seed for Cassie to eventually make artwork about debt; how she applied to CCA’s (California College of the Arts) Social P-Word program 3 months after the deadline, in a fever dream, and went on to have a seminal experience there, including attempting to start an artist-in-residence in the school’s finance department, and other feats of radical imagination; the genesis of her seminal artwork, “Give Me Cred!,” which started with her and a colleague deciding to not pay their credit card bills, and eventually led to her creating alternative credit reports for people based on their wherewithal to survive ‘a financial system that’s trying to eat them alive,’ and then become a way for them to get jobs and apartments; exactly why she advertises on her website, thefeministeconomicsdepartment.com, that “if you steal my idea, tell me how it goes;” why she moved to Thunder Bay, Ontario (primarily to co-run the ‘Reimagining Value Action Lab’ with Max Haiven at Thunder Bay University, but also for other reasons); why she finally gave up living in the Bay Area, after having lived in a succession of \xa06 places over a very short period; her Oakland pop-up real estate project ‘Desperate Holdings,’ which was part spa, part faux real estate agency and \xa0total social engagement project, in which she got to know many of the residents, including becoming friends with a woman who was nearly a daily presence there; and her video “I trusted you I trusted you I trusted you,” a marginalized yet epic piece which is representative of the out-of-the-box work that has led to a very bizarre fan base, including a feminist hedge fund that reached out to her to be their artist-in-residence. \xa0 | In the final episode with Art After Money author Max Haiven, we talk about: The history of and the current fate of artist collectives, as prompted by a listener’s thoughtful question; Le Freeport, the ultimate art storage facility, a crypt-like structure which Max visited in Singapore, and describes his experience of being there, and subsequently we discuss what a Freeport, a crypt for rich people’s art and antiques, means for the greater world of financialization; the structural violence (systemic violence) committed by the global capitalist elite, and their tendency to morally insulate themselves from their actions, up to and including building escape hatches and bunkers from New Zealand to Mars; Debtfair and Strike Debt, collectives that formed out of Occupy Museums, which itself was spawned through Occupy Wall Street; the art world politics that led to the creation of Art Prize, and how its populist response to the secretive and collusion-oriented market art world has been a problematic response; how Debt Fair, which was included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial, operates by calling out the institutions and sometimes even individuals whom participants are literally indebted to; what the future of debt in the U.S. and beyond looks like, vis-à-vis mainstream political support for eliminating debt; the Commons, as seen in collectives formed during the Occupy movement and also how they manifest in relation to art and the history of art; Max’s call for the abolition of art as borne out of the abolition of prisons, and in asking the question “what if were to abolish art?,” including museums, galleries and other institutions, what would creativity then look like?; and how everyone, not just billionaires, but even artists, create structures of avoidance to carry on with our work and not get into too dark of a place. | New York (and sometimes Europe)-based artist, internet activist and hacker Paolo Cirio talks about: How he makes a living as an artist, mainly through commissions, workshops and guest appearances (and the occasional sale), and spread through several European cities as well as New York, and also how he keeps his expenses (including his rent in NY) low; his near future as an artist, as far as how sustainable his career is financially, should he choose to start a family; his activist roots growing up in Turin, Italy, which he describes as very working class and a lot of consciousness around politics, as well as early interest in computers and eventually the internet; his epic artwork, Loophole for All, in which he hacked into the General Registry of the Cayman Islands and published over 200,000 entities (many of them anonymous shell companies), then offered a certificate of ownership of those companies for $.99, and subsequently what it was like for him dealing with the fallout from that grand action, and how the piece tapped into complex logistics around how legislations are exploited by big global companies; why he chose the Cayman Islands for his project, as opposed to Delaware, which has a similar culture of offshore money laundering, according to Cirio; his contention that the art market is highly censored due to conflicts of interest on museum boards, including board members from tech giants like Google, in addition to his work not being ‘financially exploitable,’ thereby making it very difficult if not impossible for Cirio to exhibit his work in the U.S.; and why he isn’t going to be making an artwork that takes on Trump in conjunction wtih the upcoming election. | Samuel Harvey, Aspen-based artist and gallerist (Harvey Preston gallery) talks about: How he initially settled in Aspen, through his various times working and teaching at the Anderson Ranch Art Center, as a ceramic artist; the many kinds of Aspen, including the 1%-ers and the regulars, and how he makes his way among them both, through his gallery, which he describes as a satisfying operation, but also very unpredictable in terms of what it provides to his income, in addition to the fact that he’s in a tenuous situation with the gallery’s commercial space lease; the “happy disaster” of his studio, which is a three-car garage just below his apartment, where the work that he makes as an artist brings him “endless joy,” something that we joke about because of our contrasting in-the-studio experiences; why his gallery is open seven days a week, which is an Aspen thing that has to do with the short on-seasons of sales activity; what he’s doing with his U.S Artist Assembly grant money; and the types of clients he has (people who really love the work, not speculative buyers). | Renny Pritikin, godfather of the Bay Area art community, veteran curator and author of the manifesto “Prescription for a Healthy Art Scene,” talks about: Being a young poet who got into contemporary art via New Langton Arts, the pioneering San Francisco art non-profit that started back in the ‘70s; his close relationship with art critic, and poet, Peter Schjeldahl, who did a residency back in the early days of New Langston; his “Prescription for a Healthy Art Scene,” a document which he wrote back in the ‘90s, but his students starting putting out in the world a decade later, and then it got printed by galleries and he was finding it on the walls of artists he did studio visits with…; in ticking through the list of Prescriptions (there are 23 total), we discuss a few in particular, which lead to questions around: how realistic some of these points (such as there being plenty of teaching jobs at local art schools/universities) are now….whether graduate education has become something of a Ponzi scheme…why villains are important in an art scene, and more; some very practical things that he taught his curatorial students while at California College of the Arts, including assigning them to write wall texts directed at several different audience types, and how to collaborate as a group; his own experience as a curator, dealing with artists, embracing and coping with varying degrees of reception and critical feedback (including having his shows savaged by one local critic on more than one occasion), and the challenges and pleasures of working with varying artists; putting on the populist and the hit, first American museum show featuring Star Wars, which brought in 120,000 visitors; and the particular satisfaction of having viewers to your show read the wall text you wrote for your show. | In part 3 with Max Haiven, author of Art after Money, Money After Art, we talk about: The influence (or lack thereof) of academia on the art market; the concept of writer Lauren Berlant’s ‘cruel optimism,’ which is something akin to a false sense of hope (Max uses the examples of using better light bulbs or taking shorter showers as being bogus solutions to climate change, which need to be addressed by the big corporations), and how it relates to art and artists, particularly young artists in anticipation of the type of career they envision; the importance of hype and confidence, not only in the art world but in the world at large (Max’s cites Uber’s fairly disastrous IPO); how confidence is performed, either tactically or non-tactically, which leads to a tangent previewing Max’s current book project about ‘Revenge,’ which features various far-right men’s groups (this conversation is in a bonus episode); \xa0artist/activist Paolo Cirio’s astounding 2014 piece, “Loophole for All,” in which he hacked the Cayman Islands’ Registry and published the names of over 200,000 firms, in turn selling forged certificates citing ownership of each of those companies for as low as $0.99; the distinction of an action or intervention being art, as opposed to just activism, and how that plays out in Cirio’s work in particular; Valentina Karga and Pieterjan Grandry’s “Valentina and Pieter Invest in Themselves,” a gold coin which is owned be a changing group of shareholders at different investment points, and how the piece sheds light on the exploitability of artists and their artworks in the market, and, how in their case, the ‘market’ is a proxy for community; Bay Area artist Cassie Thornton’s surprisingly effective “Give me Cred,” a project creating custom, alternative credit reports for housing and job applicants, an adaptation to a corrupt credit-scoring market; the artist in the book who inspired Max’s interest in financialization and in turn “Art After Money…” and how their relationship evolved; and finally, recommendations for learning more about Artivism.", 'chan_desc': 'A podcast featuring both one-on-one and three-way roundtable conversations with contemporary artists, dealers, curators, and collectors--based in Los Angeles, but reaching nationally and internationally.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/d5/a2/94/d5a294f5-afcb-0235-ea29-7b9d5b4fead8/mza_9093026168284169980.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2012-06-26'}}

The Staffordshire Hoard is the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver ever discovered. Heavily damaged before it was buried, the 7th century treasure contains more than 4,000 precious fragments, approximately a third of which are now known to come from a single, very high-status helmet.\xa0From 2014 to 2017, the helmet was studied as part of the major research project on the treasure funded by Historic England and the museums which care for the collection. This extensive research enabled experts to identify the fragments which belonged to the helmet, believed to have been made around AD 600-650.Helmets of this period are incredibly rare - there are only five other Anglo-Saxon helmets known. The detail and bold crested design means the Staffordshire Helmet is likely to have had an important owner.It will never be possible to reassemble the original physically. Instead, the project explored how the original may have been made and what it looked like, enabling archaeologists to understand its construction better and test theories about its structure and assembly.The reconstructions were created over an 18-month period by a team of specialist makers bringing together ancient craft techniques and cutting-edge technology.View photos of the Hoard Helmet here.Producer: Dan Morelle-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Instagram: https://instagram.com/DrJaninaRamirezTwitter: https://twitter.com/ArtDetectivePod\xa0Twitter: https://twitter.com/DrJaninaRamirez\xa0Facebook: https://facebook.com/DrJaninaRamirezFacebook Group: https://facebook.com/groups/ArtDetective\xa0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Art Detective Patreon Supporterspatreon.com/ArtDetectiveAmanda CookeAndrew RobesonAndrew WestBecky HeadBernard FildesbrittaCatherine Rowley-WilliamsChloe GuttridgeChris ChattertonChris DouglassColin BeebyDaniel Ramirez\xa0David ParkerFi CooperGeorge GreenIldi PelikanJanet LeeJennyJoanne Benjamin Dzho MckeownJoseph MaleczekKanidra McGillKeiran LancasterKevin CannellKevin Valdes ParraKirstyMargaret SzedenitsMargy Mayell\xa0Mark StackMCMatzMeg JonesMichele OlenderNeil HolmesNicola CaponNina RamirezPatricia McLeanPaul FlattPete BiggsPhilip CorlisQuoc VoRoger LittleStephen LawrenceTammy MillerTanchira ArjinkitVanessa RowlandsWayne Quigg  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Since Tracy Chevalier’s 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' was published in 1999, it has sold more than 5 million copies, has been translated into 39 languages and was made into an Oscar-nominated film.

A few weeks ago I attended The Artful Business Conference in Adelaide here in Australia.\xa0 I love this conference … it is for people with creative businesses, and at any given time you can be sitting next to a writer, a jewellery maker, a yoga instructor, an accountant, a business coach, a graphic designer, a bridal accessory designer, a virtual assistant … it’s just amazing! While I was there, surrounded by so many incredibly creative people, I thought I’d ask a few of them three simple questions. I had an idea of how this episode would go, but the answers that these incredible women gave me were not at all what I was expecting.\xa0 In hindsight, I don’t know why I was expecting run-of-the-mill answers … I should know by now that creative people are going to give me creative answers.\xa0 They did not disappoint … they actually knocked me back on my heels, and this episode is going to be different, and so much deeper than I had intended! Craft is seen to be this frivolous thing that women do, faffing about with fabric, yarn and thread.\xa0 But that’s far from true. First of all, craft is not exclusively for women, and what crafters do is so much more than making pretty things to pass the time. Absolutely we make tangible things.\xa0 We can give them as gifts, use them to keep warm, decorate our homes, sell them for some extra cash … and those are all fine reasons to engage in crafting activities.\xa0 But the real reason we craft goes so much deeper than that. Today I want to introduce you to five wonderful ladies who were feeling game enough to answer my three quick questions.\xa0 You’ll hear me ask each of them … 1. What’s your day job? 2. What is your craft / creative pursuit of choice? 3. What do you get from this? Some of them I have known for a few years, some for a few months, others I just met. Some are older than me, some younger, some about the same. Some enjoy the same crafts as me, others are into things that aren’t quite my scene, or that are still on my to-do list. All of them are amazing at what they do professionally, and having seen some of their work in person, it’s not surprising that they are great at what they do creatively as well. There will be a little bit of background noise … it’s always buzzing with conversations during break times. I can honestly say that it was worth sacrificing my afternoon cup of tea to chat briefly to these wonderful ladies, and after each mini interview I’ll go deeper into my takeaways from these conversations.  I would like to introduce you to Miranda.  1. What is your day job? I work in social media and marketing  What is your craft / creative pursuit of choice? I do crochet, weaving and mixed media. What do you get from this? I’ve always been crafty, but especially in last couple of years it helps with my mental health. It’s my relaxing time, and it’s just fun. But it’s a creative way that when people look at you and think you’re one thing, and then you show them a quilt you’ve made or a crochet blanket, and they look at you differently … like OMG!\xa0 I like putting colours together.  Summary I absolutely loved Miranda’s answer.\xa0 Yes … science is catching up and starting to prove that craft and creativity is excellent for our mental health.\xa0 We did talk about that in episode 8, which I’ll link to in the show notes. Sometimes we can cruise along and just craft to keep our hands busy, to create a quick gift, or try something new. But sometimes our creative pursuits do more than just keep us occupied … they can seriously support our mental health. It may be that we work diligently on a project to pass the time whilst under stress or going through an unpleasant life event.\xa0 It can help pass time quickly and serve as a great distraction to stop us obsessing over waiting for test results, to stop our mind wandering to dark thoughts or inject something beautiful into our lives when things may otherwise be bleak.\xa0 I understand what she means about people looking at you differently.\xa0 I used to work in a very corporate type job, and when my co-workers would catch me cross-stitching on the train, or would compliment me on my outfit and I would tell them that I made it … it absolutely changed the way they looked at me.\xa0 It helped them get to know me, see there was more to me than a great voice on the phone and fast typing fingers. You think you have a person pegged, you think you know what they’re like, then you find out they knit jumpers for penguins … whoah … your mind is blown! You question yourself … do I really know them at all?\xa0 Have I made assumptions? What else do they do that I don’t know about? It sparks conversations and deeper connections with people. And I’m not going to gloss over Miranda’s joy of putting colours together.\xa0 This is one of the most wonderful things about craft … colour.\xa0 It’s not just choosing colours, but considering the mood that they convey, the reactions that people will have to them, how they will suit an individual, and how the light will play off them at different times of day and in different seasons. There’s an element of challenge to colour choices, and absolutely it’s the colours that make craft fun.  Click here to hear the podcast EPISODE 8  If you are looking for Miranda in her day job, you can FIND HER HERE. I would like to introduce you to Ashleigh. 1. What’s your day job? I am a VA and podcast manager  What is your craft / creative pursuit of choice? I’m a doodler. What do you get from this? I’m a massive scatterbrain, and it helps me focus on everything and anything. It unleashes some creativity. It fills me up … a little spillage over of the cup.  Summary I think my favourite thing that Ashleigh mentioned was that her favourite creative pastime fills her cup.\xa0 Wow … that is something we sometimes forget about.\xa0 We are so busy giving and giving to others, that we forget that we need to fill that cup!\xa0 I know that self-care is a buzz-phrase, but I don’t care … because it’s important. There is a saying that you can’t pour from an empty cup … in other words, you can’t help others when you’re running on empty.\xa0 Sure, sometimes others can fill your cup, but a lot of the time we need to remember to refill that things ourselves, because we know better than anyone what is going to do the job best. When you give and give and give, and don’t refill, that leads to burnout, and when you’re in burnout, that isn’t just an empty cup, you’re at risk of getting a crack in it.\xa0 Trust me … I know … I’ve experienced that bone dry burnout, and there is a lot more effort required to bounce back from that, because you need to repair the crack before you can refill the cup and be able to give again.\xa0 Best to find that thing which fills your cup and enjoy it regularly so you don’t burn out. I also know quite a few people who draw to help with focus. Doodling is one of those things I’m terrible at, and it does nothing for me … but that’s me.\xa0 I do other things to focus, which is why I say this to you … it’s not what you do, but what it does for you that is important.\xa0 A lot of times we think we have to become an expert at our craft or hobby, so we can make it into a job or a business, but that’s not necessarily true.\xa0 Sometimes we just need to be creative to fill a need, not make a buck.  If you are looking for Ashleigh in her day job, you can FIND HER HERE. I would like to introduce you to Doone.  1. What’s your day job? I’m a bookkeeper.  What is your craft / creative pursuit of choice? I knit, crochet and sew, but I’m also a printmaker and a book-maker / bookbinder. What do you get from this? Being physically present. I recently realised that I’m ADHD, and sitting, unless I’m really in the flow with bookkeeping, if I’m watching something or taking in new information, it’s not enough to keep my brain occupied. So, I need to be doing something physical to stay here, to not be off with the fairies.  Summary I saw one of Doone’s gorgeous hand-bound books at Artful BizCon, and it was absolutely gorgeous! I have to admit, it’s not something I ever thought I would try, but seeing the gorgeous stitching and the beautiful papers she used, it’s now on my list. Again, here we have an instance of creativity and the act of using your hands to create something beautiful and practical that is giving more than that to the maker.\xa0 It’s no coincidence that many crafters are known to work in front of a movie, or whilst chatting with family or friends. For some it’s hard to sit still and let your hands be idle, for others it’s non-optional, and with ADHD it can absolutely help you focus on the task at hand, even if to the casual observer it looks like you aren’t paying attention. I’ve often said that crochet and cross-stitch are like meditation to me … the rhythm, the repetition. I can totally understand how these qualities assist those with ADD and ADHD to focus and be present.  If you are looking for Doone in her day job, you can FIND HER HERE. I would like to introduce you to Shilpa.  1. What’s your day job? I’m a book writing and marketing mentor for coaches, consultants and experts who want to put their message out there.  What is your craft / creative pursuit of choice? I really enjoy quilling, and punching (paper crafts). There’s a lot of beautiful stonework with acrylic sheets and making beautiful patterns. What do you get from this? I haven’t been able to decide, I’m a shiny object kind of person, and I can’t just be content with one craft. I have need of a lot of colour in my life, and a lot of variety, so that’s how I’m meeting the need … through lots of craft.  Summary As I was talking to Shilpa I could see some beautiful jewellery that she had made, and I cannot go without saying that her chai tea is absolutely amazing! I have been forever spoiled after tasting the real deal. Shilpa and I have a lot in common … a need for colour and variety, and craft is such a wonderful place to meet that need.\xa0 There is always a new craft to try, and a new challenge to conquer. Sure, some people pick up one craft and stick with it forever or at least for a very long time. I am not one of those people, and I am obviously not alone.\xa0 Years ago I read a wonderful book by the author Barbara Sher called ‘Refuse to Choose’, subtitled ‘What do I do when I want to do everything?’ If you are like myself and Shilpa … craving variety and not sure what to settle on, this book is an excellent read.\xa0 I knew I wasn’t a specialist, and I found myself in this book. I also meet my need for variety and challenge and colour through craft. I will link to the book in the show notes for my fellow crafty bowerbirds. Looking for \'Refuse to Choose\' by Barbara Sher?

All things to do with writing, selling courses, teaching, etc.  What is your craft / creative pursuit of choice? At the moment it’s mosaic. I’ve always liked mosaic and I make them at home. I make little signs and little flower pots and art for the garden. What do you get from this? I’m quite a right brained person, but my old craft of choice was crafting words, but now that’s become my day job. I like that my brain has slipped sideways and it’s not intellectual, it’s purely visual, and I’m doing something with my hands. I find that really relaxing. It destresses me.  Summary Crafting as an escape from your day job, to slip out of your logical, analytical, sensible mind and slip into something more fun as you play with colour and texture … it’s yin and yang really. Kate is incredibly creative with words … far more emotive and descriptive than I could ever hope to be … seriously, I would read her shopping list for fun, and her Instagram posts are often a highlight of my day.\xa0 She raises a valid point here, and I almost blinked and missed it.\xa0 When your hobby becomes your job … you need to find a new hobby. I’ve head that said many times, and there’s a reason it’s repeated … why I’m repeating it now … because it’s true!\xa0 If you write stories or poetry or lark about with words for fun, there’s a lot of joy and escape in that.\xa0 But when it becomes your day job, writing clever words for clients, and to promote your own business, it might still be joyful, but it’s also work … and traditionally we do need an escape from work.\xa0 The saying ‘Love what you do and you’ll never work a day in your life’ … I feel like it’s kind of misleading.\xa0 I absolutely love what I do, but in those moments when you need to meet deadlines, and you find yourself embroidering your 3,487th backstitch in a verigated yarn unicorn head at 4:30am … that very much feels like work, and you do need a break from it. That is why I have reserved quilting just for me, as my hobby … my escape. It’s why I enjoy singing in the car … because I work with my hands and talk all day long … sometimes it’s nice to escape from that and sing along to the Wicked soundtrack as I drive along the motorway.\xa0 I absolutely understand the appeal of mosaic … you can make it neat and orderly if that’s what you’re feeling, or you can take some crockery you found at the op shop, or tiles you found in the bargain bin at the tiling store, by donning some goggles and gloves, and\xa0 letting out your frustrations with a hammer! You can create order from chaos, a thing of beauty from tiny pieces, and each time you see it, it’s a reminder of those peaceful moments of escape and the fun you had in the making process.  If you are looking for Kate in her day job, you can FIND HER HERE\xa0 So … now it’s over to you.\xa0 I would love to ask you the same three questions. What is your day job? What is your craft of choice? What do you get out of it?  If you’re up to it, I would love to know your answers.\xa0 You can comment on the blog at https://www.dawnlewis.com.au/podcast13, or maybe you’d prefer to email me or send me a message via Facebook or Instagram. If not, well, that’s ok too … but have a think?\xa0 What does craft do for you? I love that we can contribute to our craft, but it is also giving so much to us … sometimes it’s deep and meaningful, sometimes it’s light and fluffy, usually it’s exactly what we need. | Hello … welcome to The Craft Room where we are going to be talking about some clever craft storage solutions.\xa0 In Episode 11 we talked about crafting in a small space, and we did discuss craft storage ideas. There is no denying that in order to work efficiently in a small space, you need to have some clever storage solutions.\xa0 But there was so much more I wanted to tell you, so this episode is kind of a sequel. For starters, did you know that I have a craft storage Pinterest Board with over 900 ideas for clever craft storage?\xa0 Sometimes it’s when we see what others are doing in their space, with their supplies, that we find a solution for ourselves. Some ideas are for small things, like sewing threads, and others are for full walls or rooms.\xa0 I have found a lot of inspiration in there for myself, and I hope you find something on that Pinterest board that sparks an idea for you.  https://www.pinterest.com.au/dawnlewis/craft-organisation/ In episode 11 I mentioned that I store my papercrafting embellishments by colour, and I wanted to talk about how my colour storage system came about … but I didn’t want that episode to run any longer that it already did.  These days I store pretty much all of my craft supplies by colour.\xa0 I work by colour, and so it makes perfect sense to store my supplies by colour. It makes them easier to find, which saves me time on so many levels.\xa0 But it wasn’t always like this.\xa0 In my last house, I had the luxury of a long narrow room where I kept my craft supplies. The beauty of it was that I could leave a project half finished, stuff all over my desks (yes, I had the luxury of 2 desks), and just shut the door.\xa0 However, when we moved to the home where we live currently, there was no hideaway room for me, as this house is very open plan! I had a small folding desk and a couple of kids bookshelves, and all of my papercrafting stuff had to fit on, under and next to the desk out in the open where all sorts of inquisitive little people, kitties and anybody visiting could see it.\xa0 It was incredibly difficult to keep the space tidy, and I couldn’t just close the door on it. Eventually we did put an extension onto our home, which is where my new craft cupboards are located, but while it was still out in the open, I was coming up against the same issue all the time. My embellishment stash was really a scrapbookers’ dream come true.\xa0 I had little storage containers full of all sorts of fascinating bits & pieces.\xa0 But when I wanted to create a layout using, let’s say, purple and green, I would pull out the ribbon box to find purple and green ribbon, then the button box to find purple and green buttons, the eyelet box, the fibres box, the sticker box … you get the picture! It took up heaps of desk space, and if I put them away after pulling out what I thought I wanted to use (so I had enough space on the desk to work), then I would need to get them all out again to put away the pieces I didn’t use.\xa0 It was a hassle, and it was actually stopping me from crafting. I can’t remember exactly what sparked the idea, but one day I’d had enough, and decided I needed a better system.\xa0 Clearly, I was choosing embellishments based on colour, because I work by colour.\xa0 I would look at the photos I wanted to use, choose my colour scheme, then create chaos on my desk.\xa0 So I decided it was time for a change … I was going to switch to storing my embellishments by colour. I had limited space, and my only option was to go up.\xa0 I went looking for tubs, and hit the jackpot in The Reject Shop kitchen aisle. I found small 5L rectangular clear tubs with lids that allowed them to stack. They were perfectly sized, inexpensive, and readily available.\xa0 I put this system into place about 9 years ago, and those tubs are still available today.\xa0 I bought ten 5L tubs at $2.50 each, and I grabbed a 10L tub for my pink embellishments (because girls + scrapbooking = lots of pink stuff!). I also bought 100 small zip lock bags and a pack of sandwich size zip lock bags.\xa0 That was all I needed to start. There were some colours that could share. I had very little yellow and orange supplies, so they would share a tub, as would cream & brown, black & grey, and green & teal.\xa0 Gold, silver and other metal pieces also had their own box. I laid out all the empty tubs on the floor with the lids under them. I grabbed the little clear caddy that had all my buttons in it, each in their own little section, sorted by colour. I opened a small zip lock bag … and just started bagging buttons by colour.\xa0 I bagged all the red ones and tossed that bag of buttons in the first tub.\xa0 The I bagged the orange buttons and threw them in the next tub, along with the baggie of yellow buttons.\xa0 I kept going like that until the button caddy was empty, and there was a bag of buttons in every box … in colour order … of course. Then I tackled the eyelets box, bagging each by colour and adding them to the appropriate box.\xa0 When that caddy was empty, I moved on to the brads, the ribbons, the fibres, and all those funny random little bits and pieces I’d been collecting for years. By the time I had a tower of empty caddies on my desk, I was starting to realise that I did NOT want to rummage through baggies, constantly opening and closing them to get what I wanted.\xa0 As luck would have it, I had the same number of empty caddies as I did colour tubs.\xa0 It was extra work, and definitely double handling … I seriously wrestled with this decision … but I knew it would save me time in the long run … I emptied each of the baggies of tiny pieces into each of the compartments of the clear sectioned caddy. In most cases I was able to split out large buttons from medium buttons, large eyelets from small eyelets, round brads from shaped brads, and there was plenty of room to keep everything separate, yet see it all at a glance, and never need to rummage for those tiny pieces ever again. I left the ribbon, paper flowers and fibres in their baggies.\xa0 Flat packaging, like stickers, skeleton leaves, adhesive gems, etc went on the bottom of the tub, keeping them flat.\xa0 The caddy full of tiny monochromatic goodness went on top, small bulky items like washi tape and coloured glue sticks went around the edges, and the squishy baggies went beside or on top of the caddy. I do have 4 other slimline cardboard boxes that live beside the colour tubs, sorted by theme (school, zoo, Christmas and favourite swap pieces). I kept these separate because when I want Christmas stuff, I don’t want to look through every colour box to find it.\xa0 I can choose the Christmas embellishment, then go looking for colour matches if I need more. The process took me about a week, and I did it in small bites of time, at times it was a bit boring, until I found lots of cool stuff I forgot I had, but I loved the process and the result. I don’t remember how much I must have talked about this new system online, but I know myself … and when I’m excited about something I really do go on about it pretty much non stop. But this system was working so well for me, I was sure it would work well for anybody else who worked by colour. It was so much faster to create that purple and green layout now.\xa0 I just grabbed the purple box and the green box, chose my embellishments, created the project, put the unused items back in the boxes, put the lids on and put them back on the stack. Everything was at arms length, and I was just venturing into the world of Copic markers, back to making cards as well as scrapbooking.\xa0 I was so pleased with my new system, and happy in my tiny creative space, which was much faster to pack up and easier to keep tidy. But while I was feeling very happy with my new found storage solution, my friend Linda was struggling with hers. The day she mentioned that she had just walked into her little craft room, despaired at the mess, and just walked right back out … that made me very sad.\xa0 She was an amazing crafter. It truly was her happy place, especially while she was going through some pretty serious stuff.\xa0 I couldn’t push it out of my mind, and I really started to wonder whether my new storage system could be replicated in her workspace.\xa0 So, in the name of craft science, I drove 5 hours out to Cowra with 13 tubs, colour labels and all those zip lock bags from my own embellishment makeover. I spent the weekend with my friend, drinking tea, catching up, and sorting through her craft room. We not only sorted things into colour tubs, but I put her through a full declultter as we went along.\xa0 There was no way I was leaving until the job was done, and even though she ran out of steam before I did, I was still able to hold things up and have her make some decisions. Boy did we find some interesting things! Linda had some clever storage solutions of her own that we were able to tweak just a little to get them humming again. For her 12x12 cardstock and papers, she had hit up the local pizza shop for some new pizza boxes (at a very low cost). She stacked them, secured the lids, but cut out the front section … thereby turning them into clever lightweight inexpensive paper storage.\xa0 She also had a unit full of tiny little drawers that she used to store her chipboard letters and numbers. I’ve never really used them very much, but she used them all the time.\xa0 It was a clever system, and it came from the hardware store! Remember in Episode 11 I suggested looking outside the craft box for storage solutions? She had done that with great success, and I remember using a similar mini drawer unit many many years ago.\xa0 So don’t forget to check out the storage solutions at your local hardware or auto store … you may be pleasantly surprised. When we were done, Linda was delighted, and I was thrilled that I was able to help her reclaim her happy place.\xa0 Linda used that storage system, even after she moved house twice, right up until her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer craft. I am absolutely humbled that I was able to do that for her. It cost very little, but it was worth SO much. As far as craft science experiments go, I call this one a success. So … having done this makeover on my own, and with a friend, I have to say that it is MUCH faster and more fun with a friend. If this is a storage system you think would work for you, find your favourite series on Netflix and get stuck into it!\xa0 Even better, if you have a crafty friend, and you both love this idea, take turns helping each other … crank up some tunes, put the kettle on, and have some fun sorting out those fab stashes. Now … I haven’t forgotten the fabric peeps!\xa0 I use the same tubs and storage system for my fabric. As I mentioned in episode 11, I store my fabric in one of two ways. Fabric purchased to make a specific quilt project is bagged together in a large tub under my sewing desk. All other fabric is sorted in colour tubs … in fact the exact same tubs that I use for my papercraft embellishment storage. I admit that I have purchased way more fabric than will fit into those tubs, and the entire cupboard is in desperate need of a cull and tidy up, but the system works. There are some exceptions to the rule, though. I do have tubs for specific types of fabric, and that’s because when I had my doll-making business, I needed to keep them separate.\xa0 I have tubs for tulle (for dolly tutus), flannelette (for dolly pyjamas), yarn (for dolly hair), as well as trims and notions. When I do my fabric cupboard makeover, though, I will be sorting tulle and flannelette into the appropriate coloured boxes, the yarn will be added to my acrylic yarn storage in the hall IKEA cube unit … but trims and notions will keep their own boxes. I store my paint in colour wheel order, each different brand has its own storage unit.\xa0 I keep my Jo Sonja tubes of paint and mediums in a basket. It’s just the right size so that they stay standing up, and I can see the colours at a glance from the top.\xa0 I keep my Semco acrylic paints in drawer units I bought at Kmart (kitchen department for the win again!), as they fit perfectly, and I can stack 2 units on the shelf to save space.\xa0 It’s like a high rise apartment for my paints … which live in colour order so I can find what I need quickly and easily. But … when it comes to my embroidery threads, I actually don’t store them in colour order!\xa0 You may be wondering why this is so … and I will tell you.\xa0 When working through a cross-stitch pattern thread key, they are listed by number.\xa0 So all of my DMC threads are wound onto cardboard bobbins, and placed lovingly into proper embroidery thread caddies in numeric order. I tried keeping them in their natural state, but I got to a point where I had so many that it was impossible to keep them organised, and the tangled mess took a very long time to sort out! Winding them onto bobbins took time, so I did that in front of the TV at night. I must admit, that while it’s an investment of time, it really does make it easier to find the threads I am looking for.\xa0 When I start a new pattern, I pull the cards out of the caddy, and I store them in a zip pouch with small scissors, my pattern, aida fabric and tapestry needle. I try really hard to only work on one cross-stitch pattern at a time, and when I’m done, all of the thread bobbins go back into the caddies.\xa0 The advantage to this method of storage is that there are blocks of colours that work perfectly together in numeric order.\xa0 I recently found this to be very handy when working on a new class design that I’ll be teaching at the shop, which features ombre painting on fabric, as well as simple hand-quilting as one of the finishing options).\xa0 I’ll pop a link to the class in the show notes for those who are local and curious to check it out. Also, when I’m doing some free-hand embroidery, I like to open the caddies and just see which colours take my fancy at the time. It’s the same with my Copic markers.\xa0 I keep those in order by code.\xa0 Sure … that does follow the colour wheel, which makes me happy, but if I kept all the light blue together, then mid blues then dark blues, it would take me forever to find the marker I was looking for.\xa0 I work entirely by codes when it comes to Copic colour choices.\xa0 I use the Sandy Allnock hex chart to keep track of my colours, and to help me choose colour combinations.\xa0 I’ll link to the chart in the show notes … it’s an excellent resource for serious Copic colourists.  https://sandyallnock.com/product/hex-chart/  Finding the ideal storage solution for you may take time, and it may change over time, especially if you change the way that you approach your craft of choice.\xa0 But when you get it right, it can save you so much time and mental bandwidth, that it’s worth the time and effort taken to get it set up. I encourage you to ask yourself … is my current craft storage working for me?\xa0 If not, why not? What would make this whole process easier?\xa0 And if your current system does work for you, that is so awesome, and I hope you will get in there this week and make something just for fun. | I thought today we could tackle the subject matter that is also the name of this podcast … the craft room.\xa0 More specifically … small crafting spaces.\xa0 Because, let’s be honest, as much as would all probably love one of those Pinterest worth, fully decked out and coordinated craft rooms, the reality for most of us is that we have a relatively small space to dedicate to craft.\xa0 Unless you have a spare bedroom,\xa0 home office or rumpus room going unused, chances are that you craft at a desk tucked into a corner, the dining table, a tray table, on the lounge or in a cupboard like me.\xa0 Working in a small space … let’s face it … is limiting. \xa0We may have to share our space with others. We might have to pack up after every single crafting session (when we’d much rather leave everything out until the project is done).\xa0 Maybe inquisitive mini people get into your supplies and use all of your stickers, unravel your yarn or create a “masterpiece”\xa0 on the layout, card or canvas you’ve been working on all day.\xa0 We are limited in how much we can keep on hand by the space we have available, and if you’re renting, even more limitations are in place.\xa0 You can put up shelves or place hanging solutions on walls. So what can we do about this?\xa0 I say, we do what we do best … think creatively! Today I want to share my top 10 tips for maximising your crafting space and small space efficiency. ONE – Stack It Baskets are very pretty, so if you’re going for a Pinterest vibe, then baskets are great.\xa0 But they don’t stack, and when you’re short on space, that’s a problem.\xa0 This is why I prefer tubs with lids that allow me to stack them, making the most of the space available.\xa0 I know that baskets look pretty filled with yarn, but every time I’ve tried this as a storage option it has been a disaster.\xa0 Non-yarn things find their way into baskets.\xa0 Some interesting things I’ve found in my yarn basket include a dead cockroach, a half eaten apple, a sticky lollypop, and most devastating\xa0 of all … the cat! None of these have been good for my yarn! I was lucky and had a couple of lovely lined baskets, but if you are storing yarn in a basket, chances are it may not be lined, and your lovely yarn can catch on the wicker or texture, which also doesn’t keep it in good condition.\xa0 The other thing is … I’m a sporadic crocheter, so dust actually became a problem (it’s quite difficult to dust yarn!). Lastly … I accumulated way too much yarn for baskets to be a viable storage solution … they were taking up way too much floor space, and the yarn was unprotected.\xa0 I had to find a solution that wasn’t going to take up any extra floor space in my home.\xa0 I now store my Milford cotton yarn in an old suitcase under my bed (which was empty … now it serves a purpose).\xa0 I like it because I can slide it partially out, unzip it, retrieve the yarn I want, then slide it back in.\xa0 Too easy!\xa0 I store my other yarn in tub drawers that fit snugly in cube units. I used empty space that was already available, and easy to access, and made one inexpensive purchase. I store my fabric in tubs, not because I’m against storing it on shelves, but because the shelves I use for my fabric are so deep that when I tried having it all folded nicely on display.\xa0 I couldn’t reach what was at the back, and it was total chaos, and made it difficult to find what I needed quickly.\xa0 The fabric became wrinkled and I spent a lot more time ironing than I wanted to. Tubs were the solution. I am also fond of small stacking tubs for my papercrafting supplies.\xa0 Scrapbooking and cardmaking has a LOT of tiny pieces, so I find tubs best to corall them by colour, and help me find things quickly.\xa0 I am definitely overdue for a craft cupboard cleaning session, and look forward to taking some time to restore order to the cupboards, so I waste less time looking for things behind other things. Tubs don’t have to be boring and functional.\xa0 I have some very nice tubs with lids that help them stack, with a nice basket weave texture on the outside.\xa0 They’re available in all sorts of shapes, sizes and styles, so you should be able to find something that suits your supplies as well as your space. TWO – Maximise your real estate Stacking tubs with lids will absolutely do this for you, but there are other ways to take a small footprint, and go up.\xa0 For example, let’s go back to my yarn storage.\xa0 After I outgrew the baskets, I switched to 50L tubs while I was working on a large number of projects for DMC.\xa0 I needed to store a lot of yarn in a small space, and the tubs were a great solution.\xa0 It only took up the floor space of one tub, but I was able to stack them 5 high in that space. The problem I faced here, though, was that I was constantly unstacking and opening tubs to find particular colours for specific projects, and it was becoming bothersome. I needed a better solution that would fit in the same floor space. I desperately wanted an IKEA kallax unit, but it didn’t fit my budget or the space.\xa0 I measured up, and went hunting, and hit the jackpot in Kmart straight away.\xa0 I found a great little 2x4 cube unit that fit the same floor space as the tubs I was using, and it didn’t break the bank.\xa0 It had 8 cube spaces and I was able to buy simple lightweight inexpensive storage cubes with handles on the front. I knew that the yarn would fit (I don’t know how I know these things … I think it’s my very mild superpower), and while it may not be a spectacular piece of furniture, it’s neat and functional. I could store yarn by colour, with a simple label on the handle, and when I needed something I could go straight to the drawer to retrieve it then pack it away later. The only time a cube unit will backfire on you is if you stack junk in front of it (naturally I learned that the hard way). The other benefit was that I could still place a couple of tubs on top, which was great for holding the finished pieces, patterns, works in progress, UFO’s or lesser used supplies. If you’ve ever watched one of my Facebook or Instagram live unboxing videos, you’ll see it in the background in my office, with my Copic stand on top. Another way you can build upwards is with a little shelf on your desk. If you’re a card maker you could keep essentials in small caddies, baskets or buckets both below the mini shelf and above.\xa0 Take a really good look at your work space.\xa0 Is there a way you can take that small desk or corner of the room, and build up? THREE – Declutter Yes … I know … we discussed it at length in Episode 7 (which I’ll link to in the show notes for anyone who missed it).\xa0 And yes, I know I harp on about this a lot, but it really is helpful.\xa0 By selling or donating unwanted supplies, it’s going to free up space for the things you actually use and love.\xa0 Also, going through your supplies regularly helps remind you of what you have, so you’re more likely to use it.\xa0 I know we like to have a stash, but the point of having those items is for them to be used. I do understand the agony of loving something so much that we just want to keep it … I really do.\xa0 If that’s you, then it’s time to use that gorgeous fabric, yarn, embellishment or whatever it is, on something that you can keep and enjoy.\xa0 If you’re a scrapbooker, create a layout with that special paper or embellishment.\xa0 That way it is in an album that will be looked at and loved, rather than in a box where it goes unseen and could even get damaged. If it’s a special fabric, create something gorgeous from it that you can use and love.\xa0 If you are buying fabric to create something that you plan on selling or giving as a gift, why not purchase an extra 15 or 20cm and make yourself a zipper pouch.\xa0 If you want to keep it in good shape, be sure to scotchguard it … simple! I actually have a lot of gorgeous fabrics that I keep because they remind me of my doll making business.\xa0 My plan is to create a quilt … with my logo in the middle panel, surrounded by all the pretty fabrics I used to make dolly clothes.\xa0 It will be a practical keepsake, and make it so much easier to let those fabrics go, either donated or used up for other projects. FOUR – Think outside the craft storage box When you look at specialty craft storage, it is usually quite pricey, and due to its bulky nature, expensive to ship.\xa0 Most of the best stuff seems to be in the USA, and international shipping puts most of these gorgeous storage solutions out of our grasp.\xa0 So it’s time to look outside of the craft storage arena. Try looking at kitchen storage options.\xa0 I store my stamps in a clear fridge bin that I found in the kitchen department at Kmart.\xa0 I store my papercrafting embellishmetns and fabric in 5L and 10L tubs meant for kitchen storage that I found in The Reject Shop. Kitchen storage offers so much these days, so check out those tubs and shelves and containers next time you’re wandering through the kitchen department.\xa0 Start thinking about ways you can use them to store your craft supplies … bonus points if they stack! Another department worth investigating is bathroom storage solutions.\xa0 Clear makeup caddies can be great for tiny pieces or tools you use a lot and need to keep close to hand.\xa0 They’re usually transparent so you can find what you want quickly and easily. Nearby you will likely find laundry storage.\xa0 This can be a great place to source a portable caddy with a handle, which is great for couch crafting.\xa0 It’s easy to keep everything together for a single project, and if you need to put it away between crafting sessions, you can quickly move the entire caddy. Lastly, let’s not forget about office storage. I use A4 paper drawer units to store slimline things like ink pads, wood block stamps, cutting tools, cardstock and other bits and pieces.\xa0 They fit nicely under my desk, are surprisingly sturdy and hold a pretty decent amount of stuff. I will link to a video tour of my papercrafting cupboard in the show notes so you can see how I use non-craft specific storage. If you are looking for todays show notes, you can find them on your app, or on the blog at dawnlewis.com.au/podcast11. FIVE – Hang It There are some very clever ways that you can use vertical wall or door space without adding shelves or tubs, that keep your desk space free as well.\xa0 One clever product I’ve seen is a below-shelf basket.\xa0 You just slide these prongs onto the shelf and instantly there is a basket suspended below.\xa0 These are great for those really tall shelves, where the very top is just wasted space, though they are best used for lightweight contents. The downside to them is that the prongs that sit on the top of the shelf above can make tubs a little uneven, but if you’re storing fabric or yarn up there, that’s not even an issue. The next option is something I saw in the kitchen department of IKEA – a rail that you can secure to the wall. There are a few different styles, but they all have cool add-ons like baskets, hooks, shelves, even paper towel and cook book holders that just hook onto the rail. So you have your tools and most often used items hanging on the wall instead of taking space on your desk. A very popular hanging system is making its way out of the garage and into craft areas … and that is pegboard. You do need to have it sitting out from the wall so that there’s space for the hooks to be hung in the little holes without damaging your wall. You can hang your tools in front of you instead of having caddies on your desk taking up precious real estate. Hang scissors, rolls of adhesive, stamp sets … anything with a hole or a loop is fair game. And if you don’t like the look of boring white pegboard, why not paint it.\xa0 Turn it into an accent by painting it a bright colour, or make it blend in by painting it the same colour as the wall. I have seen a unique style of pegboard at IKEA, which has long narrow gaps rather than small holes, which looks really cool. If you are a papercrafter who loves their dies, then why not use some magnetic sheets to store them on the wall or the back of a door.\xa0 I’ve seen adhesive backed magnetic sheets applied directly to a door, but if you are renting, and need a less permanent or damaging solution, I’ve seen people take a large frame (often from an op shop), remove the glass, and add magnetic sheets to the backing board.\xa0 You can just hang the frame like a normal picture, or prop it up against the wall or on a shelf, and you have pretty vertical die storage space. Don’t forget some of the amazing over-the-door hanging solutions that are available now. If you are going to hang something inside a door, be it a room or a cupboard, choose something slim-line so that the doors still close properly and the items inside it don’t get damaged from being squished up.\xa0 Seriously … insides of doors are golden space! Now it’s time to shift gear a little and talk about the practicalities of crafting in a small space, and a few ways to be efficient whilst working out your ideal set up. SIX – Be budget conscious As much as I would love to have that perfect Pinterest storage, it’s just not budget friendly.\xa0 I would love everything to match, but it doesn’t.\xa0 What it does do is … do it’s job.\xa0 I bought most of my storage pieces on sale, on clearance, and a bit at a time. If I had a space to fill, I made do with what I could find around the house (like the suitcase under the bed) before going shopping. There are some things that didn’t work the way I wanted, or I outgrew them. I’m really glad I didn’t spend too much, because I’ve changed my storage a lot over the years, and it would have been really hard to get rid of expensive pieces, just because they cost so much. I recommend measuring the space you have to work with, keep those measurements on your phone or in a notebook, and keep a tape measure in your bag or car ass well.\xa0 Know what is going to go in the storage unit, and take your time buying the right piece to do the job. SEVEN – Keep an eye on your accumulation Habits If you are buying supplies faster than you can use them, you’re going to fill what little space you have very quickly. There is a popular meme that I see someone posting in a craft group\xa0 at least once a week.\xa0 “I believe that buying craft supplies and using craft supplies are two different hobbies”. Don’t let that be you. Use that gorgeous alpaca yarn, add those embellishments to a layout, make something from that stunning fabric. Just as toys are made to be played with, craft supplies are made to be used. So use them! EIGHT -\xa0 Shop with purpose There is nothing wrong with having a stash. It lets us craft late at night when stores are closed and we’re on a roll. The point of a stash is that the items be used. If you’re buying more than you can physically use, then I recommend shopping from your stash for your next project. Here’s the thing … when you shop with a particular project in mind, you won’t need to find a place to store those items, because you already know what you’re going to do with it. You probably also have a deadline for that project to be done. I have my next few quilt projects already figured out, and I’ve bought everything I need for them. While I haven’t gotten to them straight away, I have kept everything together for that project, so when I am ready to start it, I can just grab the bag or the tub and go for it. I have been working on a very large quilt project … a pixel Mario quilt … for about 5 years, on and off (mostly off). I am really excited to finish it at the sewing retreat I’m attending later this year. For this project, I figured out exactly what I needed, bought only that, and keep the fabric, binding, pattern and finished sections all in one tub, and there will be nothing left over for my craft stash when it’s done. NINE – Stash Busting Look for clever ways to use your stash, especially older supplies.\xa0 I am a shameless collector of paper pads, and have enough pattern paper to last several lifetimes, and make more cards than a girl could ever use! When the urge strikes to purchase more paper, I challenge myself to make a dent in that stash before I’m allowed to add to it. A few things happen when I do this.\xa0 I will usually go back to my One Sheet Wonder template, which allow me to make 10 cards from a single sheet of 12x12 pattern paper, plus a few other bits and bobs. I get a lot of cards made, I boost my ready-to-post card stash, I have fun crafting. One weekend I made 100 cards using this method … and that’s when I usually realise … I have made 100 cards, which took me 2 days … and I only removed 10 sheets of pattern paper from my stash.\xa0 If I buy another paper pad with 100 sheets in it … where will I put it, and will I really, really have the time to use it?\xa0 If the paper pad that is calling my name at the store is seriously beautiful (or seriously on sale), sometimes I will cave and buy it.\xa0 But more often than not, I realise that I already have tons of gorgeous paper, and I really don’t need anymore. So if that sounds like any of you cardmakers out there, I’ll link to my One Sheet Wonder template in the show notes, and as a special bonus for podcast listeners, if you use the code ‘podcast’ at checkout, you will receive a discount on your downloadable One Sheet Wonder PDF in the store. TEN – Batching When you have a small work space, and can’t have everything out for a project at once, consider batching. For this big pixel quilt I’m working on, there was no way I would have been able to cut, then sew one block at a time.\xa0 The cutting process took my entire dining table, and it was tedious. I would have given up, and ended up with 3 cushions instead of a 12 panel quilt! So … I batched it. I used a free pattern graph I found online (I’ll link to it in the show notes for those who want to see the insanity I dived headfirst into), and calculated exactly how many colours I needed, and how many squares of each colour I would need. I figured out how many squares I could get from a strip, and then purchased the exact amount of fabric I would need and bought enough for the whole quilt. I’m really glad I did, because I’m pretty confident that the dye lots and popular colours would have changed over the years, and there’s no way I could get the exact same colours now. So did the math, I bought the fabric, and then I cut all the strips, as well as the sashing, in one marathon cutting session. I took a break, then came back to each fabric strip stack, and cut them down into\xa0 squares. Thousands and thousands of squares. I packed them into baggies as I went, and put them in the tub. My brain was happy, even if my hands and back were not. Most importantly, I was able to pack away my cutting gear, which freed up the dining table AND was very happy that the hard cutting part was 100% complete. I batch when I’m using my One Sheet Wonder templates as well … I prep the card bases, then I cut all the pattern paper and put the pieces inside the relevant card base, cut all the cardstock and place those pieces inside the card base … and then I can go on and assemble the card. I do this with the stamping & colouring as well.\xa0 I’ll stamp out all the sentiments and mat them, stamp all the images, then colour them (in front of the tv, or in a waiting room), and it’s so much easier to put together 10 cards without doing every step every time. Batching saves time, and it saves space, so I love to batch. For most crafts, it doesn’t matter if your space is small.\xa0 What matters is that you have fun with it and make that space work for you. \xa0The size of your craft space will change a lot over the years. I’ve crafted in some crazy spaces … a closed-in long narrow verandah, a computer desk in a corner, a tray table in front of the tv, commuting to work on the train, on the couch and in a cupboard. By being flexible, thinking smart, and watching my accumulation habits, I’ve been able to craft in all sorts of spaces. If you craft in an unusual space, head over to the blog and let me know … what is your space like, and what craft do you do there? I love hearing about how other people make their space work for them, and I hope that some of my tips today help you get even more from your crafting space, no matter it’s size.  LINKS Episode 7 - Should you Kondo your Craft? My papercrafting cupboard tour video  One Sheet Wonder Template (use the code \'Podcast\' for a discount)  The Mario pixel quilt | Today I’ve been thinking about one of the most common questions I see in Facebook cardmaking groups … “I’m new to cardmaking, what should I buy?”. \xa0The answers always intrigue me. Everyone is so passionate about what they think is the best tool or most useful thing to have, and I really love seeing everyone being so helpful to those who are new to the craft.\xa0 However, while the answers come from a place of pure enthusiasm, they’re not always going to be what the person who has asked the question actually needs.\xa0 I think, when we’ve been cardmaking or scrapbooking for a long time, we forget how we started, and so the recommendations are often items that aren’t quite appropriate for a beginner.\xa0 Also, we are all really different, with different budgets, different size spaces and storage capacity, different tastes and different needs.\xa0 One person’s essentials may be another person’s waste of money. In one cardmaking group I belong to, there is a running thread in an album that is an excellent resource for members.\xa0 When I considered the question, and thought about what I would recommend, I realised that I started with the basics. Over the years I have levelled up as I discovered new products and techniques, my needs and space and tastes changed and I figured out what I liked. My contribution to that thread was pretty comprehensive, so I thought I would share it here on the podcast (in a LOT more detail), as it might come in handy for those of you who are just starting in the fun world of papercraft.\xa0 For those of you who aren’t papercrafters, feel free to stick around, as I’ll be discussing some of the reasons when, how and why we level up, which is appropriate to a bunch of other crafts.  I started where everyone starts … Level 1 – Absolute Beginner Back in Episode 2, I talked about the top 6 things you need to begin cardmaking, and in Episode 3, I talked about the top 5 things you need to begin stamping.\xa0 Here\'s a link ...  LINK – The Craft Room Podcast Episode 2 – https://www.dawnlewis.com.au/podcast2 LINK – The Craft Room Podcast Episode 3 – https://www.dawnlewis.com.au/podcast3 And … for the quilters … Marni Franks from Frankensteins Fabrics joined me in Episode 5 to discuss her top 10 must-have items to begin making a quilt top.\xa0 Here\'s that link ...  LINK – The Craft Room Podcast Episode 5 – https://dawnlewis.com.au/podcast5  When you’re starting out, there’s really not very much you NEED to start making cards, scrapbooking, art journals, quilts, or whatever it is that you’re into.\xa0 I don’t know anybody who starts with ALL the tools, because, honestly, the cost is prohibitive, and who has space for all that stuff when you don’t even know what you’re doing yet? So here’s me .. back when I started, about 30 years ago, at level one as a cardmaker.\xa0 I sourced most of my supplies at the big Stitches & Craft Show, which I would attend religiously twice a year after saving my craft pennies for six months.\xa0 I was into stamps pretty much straight away, and I was super careful about what I spent my money on.\xa0 In my cardmaking box (yes, everything fit into one box … incredible!) I had … Cardstock – white, black, coloured Speciality papers Cutting Tools – craft knife, ruler, self healing cutting mat Stamps Ink pads – black and coloured Adhesive Scissors Punches  We are talking very late 80’s / early 90’s, and there was nowhere near the range available then as there is now.\xa0 No clear stamps, so no need for an acrylic block.\xa0 This is actually quite close to the list that I recommend for now, so I wasn’t far off the ideal set-up.\xa0 I rarely use punches now, but back then I used them all the time.\xa0 It was the trend of the time, punches were readily available, and nobody had die-cutting machines … I’m not even sure if they were on the scene at all yet.\xa0 I was able to create cute cards, quickly and easily.\xa0 I chose items that I felt I would get a lot of use out of, and I was happy creating cards in my spare time.\xa0 Until the inevitable happened. \xa0I started getting bored with my supplies.\xa0 I was so sick of using the same few punches and stamps over and over … and then new products started being shown at the craft shows.\xa0  That’s when I got the itch and took the leap into … Level 2 – Heat Embossing I already had stamps and ink pads, so heat embossing was a natural next step for me.\xa0 Do you remember the first time you saw heat embossing in action?\xa0 I do!\xa0 It was like magic, and my brain was full of ideas, entranced by the possibilities that this magical powder presented! I started with a basic kit … it had a clear embossing ink pad, and a few embossing powders (I think I started with clear, gold, silver and copper). The problem was that heat guns were really expensive, and a bit hard to find back then.\xa0 I was determined to find a solution that wasn’t going to take half a weeks pay, and can tell you that even though a hairdryer might seem like a good solution … it is not! What I ended up using was the toaster!\xa0 It worked really well, and I made do with a toaster for a very long time … seriously … over a decade!\xa0 If you are on a tight budget, and a heat gun isn’t in your future, then I recommend giving the toaster heat embossing method a try. I did learn some important tips that you need to know before you start, and I will endeavour to make a video showing how this works very soon (and when I do, I’ll come back here and add the link to the show notes).\xa0 If you are going to use a toaster, there are some things you should know.  First you need to empty all the crumbs out of the toaster.\xa0 You don’t want to set off the smoke alarm or make your house smell like burnt toast. Second, take note of where the toast level setting is before you start.\xa0 Mark it with tape or photograph it.\xa0 It took a long time to decide on that perfect level of toastiness, and if you don’t put it back, someone is going to be cross. Thirdly, you’re going to need long tweezers or secure tongs to hold your piece of cardstock, because it is going to get really hot really fast, and you do not want your fingers that close to that much heat.\xa0 Bonus points if the tongs or tweezers have some silicone, because metal will get super hot as well, and you’ll still possibly burn your fingers. Stamp your image with clear embossing ink, sprinkle over the powder, tap off the excess onto a piece of paper (so you can pour it back into the jar), and brush off any loose powder that’s sticking where it shouldn’t be.\xa0 We will talk about that I a minute. Put your stamped & powdered piece of cardstock to the side, pour the excess powder back into the jar and put the lid on!\xa0 We don’t want to accidentally knock the whole thing over when the toaster pops up and gives us a fright! You’ve prepped your piece, you’ve prepped your toaster.\xa0 Turn the toaster heat setting up to full, and press the lever down … obviously without any bread in your toaster.\xa0 Hold the cardstock over the toaster, at least 5cm above, with the stamped & powdered side up.\xa0 Constantly move it around so that you don’t set your cardstock on fire or scorch it.\xa0 It will take a little while, but soon you will see the embossing powder begin to melt.\xa0 When you’re done, if the toaster hasn’t already timed out, pop the lever back up.\xa0 And when you’re completely finished, put the setting back to the way it was, lest you incur the wrath of someone who is unhappy with burnt toast!  I mentioned before about embossing powder being where it shouldn’t be, and this is where I will add 2 items to this level list.\xa0 An anti-static powder tool is an excellent thing to have, as it stops powder sticking where it shouldn’t.\xa0 You can purchase one or make your own.\xa0 The last item would be a fine paintbrush.\xa0 I have one that I keep in my papercraft tool caddy, which I only use for embossing powder.  Now, of course the next question is … what colour embossing powders should I buy?\xa0 It depends very much on what you like.\xa0 If you really don’t like silver, then don’t get silver.\xa0 If you don’t like gold, then don’t get gold.\xa0 Get the colours you like!\xa0 However, here’s a handy tip … if you already have coloured ink pads (especially if they are pigment ink pads), then you don’t need to buy a bunch of coloured embossing powder.\xa0 One of my favourite things to do in those early days was to stamp with coloured pigment ink, sprinkle over clear embossing powder, and heat set that.\xa0 I had the colour, I had the dimension and the gloss, but I didn’t have to spend my limited craft funds on lots of bottles of embossing powder.\xa0 To this day, I mostly use silver, gold, copper, clear and clear with sparkles.  I was well and truly hooked, and started Scrapbooking, which lead to … Level 3 – Embellishments Ooooooh my goodness.\xa0 This is where it is tempting to go absolutely crazy.\xa0 These days I rarely use embellishments on my cards, but I used to use them a lot when I was scrapbooking, so I have a very generous collection in my stash.\xa0 I started small, with brass split-pins which my dad smuggled home from work for me once.\xa0 Some embellishments you might be tempted by are … Coloured & metallic brads / splitpins Eyelets Buttons Twine Ribbon Paper doilies Paper and silk flowers Fancy mesh ribbons Adhesive gems Adhesive pearls Sequins Beads Shaped paper clips Mini tags Coloured hot glue sticks … and I’m sure there are a lot more that I haven’t covered. It’s when you’re on this level that you are 100% sure that this is a craft you want to do for a long time … you’re all in!\xa0 You’re also likely in a phase where you’re crafting late at night, and if you’re making a big project, you want to be able to finish it without doing any online shopping (and the waiting that goes along with that), or stall because your local craft store is closed.\xa0 This is when you really start stash-building. For me, this was the phase when I was also on a really tight budget, and so I discovered that I could get some basics at the dollar shops that were popping up everywhere.\xa0 Some things I bought were great prices, and great value for those prices.\xa0 This was the level when I learned (the hard way) the difference between cheap and cheerful, and cheap and nasty.\xa0 There’s nothing wrong with grabbing a bargain, but if it’s something you never use, it’s not a bargain at all … it’s a waste of money.\xa0 So be discerning when you purchase dollar store items. When you have a reaction like “How is this a whole $2? Ewwwww”… that’s cheap and nasty.\xa0 When your reaction is more like “How is this only $2? It’s so gorgeous! Maybe it’s a mistake and they received a box from Lincraft by accident” … then that is cheap and cheerful.\xa0 I have a whole video that showcases 10 cards I created, which I’ve linked below ...  LINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqyqcVcd_Ao  My last pro tip would be … don’t go overboard buying embellishments.\xa0 Trends change, your tastes change, there will always be something new.\xa0 If you buy a bag of 52 printed die-cuts, but only use one or two, the rest are just going to sit in your stash, which is a waste of space and money.\xa0 If you really must have that 52 die-cut pack, plan to use all or most of them straight away, and finish that project before you go and buy more.  This leads us very nicely into Level 4 – Die-cutting & raised embossing  I had been papercrafting for a VERY long time before I was finally convinced that it would be good value to buy my own die-cutting machine. I had moved into scrapbooking, and specialty scrapbooking stores were opening up all over the place. I had started teaching at my local scrapbooking store (this would be about 16 years ago), and met one of my most awesome friends.\xa0 Through her I was introduced to the wonderful world of papercrafting swaps.\xa0 Oh boy! I became a hard-core serial swapper, which gave me so many wonderful excuses to pop into the scrapbooking store and make oh so many purchases.\xa0 Another friend had invited me along to a weekend crop, and it was tons of fun.\xa0 Around this time, Sizzix came out with a home diecutting machine. There was a big commercial one at the local store that anyone could pay to spend time on, which was great.\xa0 Why would I need my own at home when I could use the one at the store AND use their dies for such a tiny price?\xa0 But it was at one of those weekend crops that someone had their Sizzix machine with them … and when they let me have a go, I realised that I could actually get a lot of use out of one of these.\xa0 It still took over a year for me to take the plunge and invest in such an extravagant purchase, but I’m very glad that I did. I was at a stage where I preferred to make my own embellishments from scratch, and was starting to see that if I invested in tools with multiple uses, I could get better value than purchasing ready-made items that were single use. It was a pretty exciting day when I bought my first Sizzix machine.\xa0 It was the old school pull-down handle one, which took thick dies and Sizzlets, the thinner dies that preceded the wafer thin metal dies that are most common today.\xa0 The bonus was that I could use embossing folders in the machine, so it really pulled double duty, and helped me really get my moneys worth from it. There is something, though, that you kind of don’t realise when you purchase your first die-cutting machine … you have to feed it! As with everything, you get bored with using the same old alphabet die over and over again … you want variety!\xa0 So you are constantly adding new dies to your collection.\xa0 I figured out I could create handmade embellishments to sell on ebay in the early days of the internet.\xa0 It was great, because I was getting maximum use out of my tools, and was able to boost my Paypal account, and use my earnings to fund my next round of die purchases. I did upgrade to a Sizzix Big Shot about 6 years ago, just because all of my new dies were wafer thin metal dies, and my old Sizzix just wasn’t up to the job, even with the converters … it was just too hard to make it work. So … what do I recommend someone entering Level 4 now should buy in the die-cutting / raised embossing arena?\xa0 Well … that depends very much on the individual, and I have some tips to help you decide … * Take your budget into consideration, as there are a lot of choices to fit most budgets. * How much space do you have for a die-cutting machine?\xa0 They can take up a lot of space, so if your workspace is small, look for one that folds up. * What exactly do you want to die-cut?\xa0 Do you really need dies for every stamp set?\xa0 Because that can be very expensive.\xa0 If you like to fussy cut your stamps without the hassle of scissors, perhaps a Brother Scan N Cut would be a better option.\xa0 Sure, it’s a bigger outlay, but if you add up the cost of coordinating dies over the years, it may be better value. * Perhaps start with some basic, yet versatile dies, like rectangles, circles or ovals.\xa0 Do you prefer the look of a plain cut circle, or one with faux stitching or tiny pierced holes? * Do you prefer to stamp your sentiments, or would you get use from some commonly used word dies, like Happy Birthday, Get Well or Congratulations. * Which embossing folders should you get? How about starting with one that’s simple, like tiny dots or stripes, seeing if you enjoy using it, and going from there.  Whatever you choose, make sure it’s something you will use over and over again.\xa0 There are lots of ways to use your dies.\xa0 Naturally you can cut them out, but if you add an embossing mat, you can just make an impression with them, which opens up a whole new world of techniques!  LINK – embossing mat  https://dawnlewis.com.au/product/universal-embossing-mat-couture-creations/ All too soon I hit Level 5 – MUST HAVE MORE STAMPS  It all started with a Stampin’ Up demonstration at a friends house.\xa0 As we all sat round admiring our gorgeous work and these incredible products, I remember saying … “One of us needs to sign up”.\xa0 And one of us did (and no, it wasn’t me). This was when I started collecting stamps with much more ferver.\xa0 I mean … I was supporting my friend in her new business, my kids were older, so I had more time to craft, and not only were the designs getting better and better, but I was finding that stamps were becoming more and more affordable.\xa0 Acrylic stamps were hitting the shops, and while I’m not a big fan of acrylic because of the work you need to put in to get a decent impression from them, I was a fan of the price point! I did give a lot of stamping advice back in episode 3, but I feel some of it bears repeating.\xa0 These days, when you add stamping to your repertoire in a big way, there are some things to keep in mind.  * Really think about the occasions that you make cards for, and buy sets that you can use for those. * When you look at a stamp set, can you immediately think of at least 3 different ways you could use it? * Versatility is everything.\xa0 Go for stamps you can use for a variety of ages and occasions as well as with a variety of techniques. * Are you falling in love with Christmas stamps and buying them all, only to realise that you don’t actually make Christmas cards? \xa0You have two options here … stop buying Christmas stamps or start making and sending Christmas cards! * Consider quality.\xa0 If you are going to be stamping a lot, go for quality.\xa0 I always steer clear of acrylic and silicone these days because the quality just isn’t there, and they are entering into the realm of cheap and nasty.\xa0 A lot of cheap silicone stamps are counterfeit as well, which is devastating the many amazing stamp companies.\xa0 I have torn many an acrylic stamp trying to remove it from the acetate, and had silicone stamps deteriorate so badly after a year or two that they just don’t stamp a good image.\xa0 What a waste of money!\xa0 Give me polymer or rubber stamps any day! * Look at smaller sets.\xa0 They’re a great price point, and you can often get a lot of use out of them.\xa0 I have some video series on YouTube where I show you different techniques you can use with one stamps set.\xa0 I’ve linked a few below.  This was also the point where I purchased my first stamp positioner … the Stamp-A-Ma-Jig.\xa0 I still use it for my rubber stamps, and it did the trick for over a decade, helping me improve my stamp placement, and even double stamp if I needed to.

To prepare all the kits for the workshop, I used part of my budget to purchase a Cricut machine.\xa0 I had been playing with the original little Cricut at the store where I was teaching, and I was really impressed with it.\xa0 By now I was savvy enough to know I would need to purchase more cartridges, but given the impressive variety and volume of designs I could cut from one cartridge, I realised I would really get a lot of use out of it.\xa0 And I did!\xa0 I used it to cut out all the pieces needed for the workshop, which was a paper flower topiary showcasing a new paper range and embellishments. I was allowed to keep the Cricut as part of my payment package, and I still have it today.\xa0 I rarely use it now, just because, sadly, I don’t have a space where I can have it set up ready to use when the mood strikes.\xa0 I know there are much more up to date versions, but I really love my pink 12x12 Cricut machine. If you are considering an electronic die-cutting machine, there are a few different kinds, and it seems like there are always more coming out.\xa0 I honestly can’t keep up! What I do know is that they fall into a few different categories. * Electronic versions of a hand-crank machine, like the Big Shot or Vagabond. * Cartridge-based machines. * Computer-based machines. * Scan N Cut … which literally scans a page full of stamped images, then cuts them out. I confess … if I was going to invest in a new one, it would be the Brother Scan N Cut, just because it does the fussy cutting really quickly by literally scanning your stamped images, then cutting them out super fast!\xa0 And right now, that’s pretty much all I want.  As I mentioned, I moved onto Level 7 very quickly – I must colour ALL THE THINGS After being introduced to Copic markers 10 years ago, I very quickly realised that I wanted stamps I could colour in!\xa0 For me, Copic markers are like painting with a marker, where I could achieve shadow and highlight, but with much less mess and faster drying times.\xa0 I was instantly hooked, and was very fortunate to be introduced to Copics by an amazing Aussie colourist as well as Copic royalty, Marianne Walker and Lori Craig. I had already been doing some watercolour with my Stampin’ Up ink pads, but this took it to a whole new level.\xa0 Before long I did the certification course to become a Copic Certified Instructor, and convinced the owner of the store I was working in to add Copic markers to the shop.\xa0 I was teaching classes within a couple of months, and Copics became a serious obsession. There was a lot to love about them … they were refillable, the nibs were replaceable … the fact that they were designed to last me a lifetime really appealed to me.\xa0 Plus they blend like a dream. I can colour embellishments to coordinate with my images … Maybe I need to do a Copic episode one day!\xa0 Yes … let’s do that, or I’ll be stuck in a Copic loop for hours! There are other mediums I like to use to colour my stamped images and figuring out how to colour with one led me to experiment and colour with others. * Distress Inks (regular and oxide) * Zig Clean Color Real Brush Markers * Prismacolor Pencils * I’ve been known to use Acrylic paint for some digital stamps that I’ve transferred onto canvases … but I always come back to Copics. By the time I was presenting segments on Scrap It TV, I was firmly into Level 8 – Stamping is my life now!  Stamping is not only fun, relaxing and creative, I also consider it to be an incredibly practical craft.\xa0 I love making cards, I love sending cards, I love the communities around stamping and cardmaking, and I love the sense of accomplishment that comes from taking cardstock and ink and markers, and turning them into a mini piece of art that can help turn someone’s day around. I love making videos to help people get the most from their stamps, and learn how to use all those fun supplies that jumped into their shopping basket and came home with them. With stamping very firmly in my life, I have allowed myself to make some tool upgrades. *Misti stamping tool. This is an expensive piece of kit, but given I was now working in the stamping industry, making lots of videos, making lots of cards, I needed to be more efficient, and the Misti did that for me.\xa0 I was sick of throwing away cardstock because I’d mis-stamped it, and I wanted to be able to batch stamp. There are lots of different stamping platforms on the market now, so choose the one that fits your needs and your budget.\xa0 I love that these tools make it possible for people with hand mobility issues to be able to stamp, whereas an acrylic block may have been difficult, frustrating or even impossible to use. * Trimmers. I cycle between 3 different types of trimmers.\xa0 I have an old Martha Stewart sliding blade trimmer, which I use when I need to cut a section out of a piece of card or paper, and it also doubles as a scoring tool.\xa0 I use a Fiskars rotary blade trimmer for when I need to cut lots of paper or cardstock … it’s a really solid workhorse.\xa0 And I use the Tonic Tim Holtz 8.5” Guillotine for trimming small bits and pieces. * I recently upgraded my work surface to a Tonic Tim Holtz Glass Media Mat … and I love it!\xa0 I can ink, and glue, and heat, and paint and cut on that surface and it takes all the punishment I can throw at it.\xa0 It had become a bit of a pain swapping out my work surface constantly, switching out self healing mats, chopping boards and non-stick sheets. \xa0As you can tell, I was all in … then I discovered a new level … Level 9 – Design Team member I found blog challenges to be a great way to stretch myself, see what others were creating, and to discover new techniques.\xa0 In my travels around the many blog challenges that were on offer, I came across a Design Team call-out.\xa0 I had no idea there was such a thing!\xa0 I applied to a few, with no luck, but one day a little shop in Canada took a chance on me, accepting me onto their Design Team. I have always enjoyed the challenge of working with limited supplies and within a theme or colour scheme boundary, so I took to Design Team work pretty quickly.\xa0 It was a short term, and when I was done with that team, I was hooked!\xa0 I went looking for other DT calls, and before long I was was a member of the KennyK Krafty Krew, a digital stamp company with a difference.\xa0 I LOVED being on that team, and I ended up doing 2 DT stints for them.\xa0 I have also been on Design Teams for Tiddly Inks and Little Miss Muffett Stamps, also digital stamp companies. Earlier this year I was on the Kindred Stamps Video Design Team, which is a brand I stock in my store.\xa0 They make incredible fandom stamps … I’ll link to them in the shownotes because they are really cool!\xa0 I met some wonderful people in my time on design teams, I was able to promote brands I truly loved, and try things I might never have tried before. It is a lot of work to be on a DT … there are deadlines to meet and guidelines to follow, so you need to be very organised and able to follow instructions. I know a lot of people aspire to be on a Design Team, and I have a few tips if that’s something you’d like to do. * Be sure to read the DT requirements thoroughly. If you don’t think you can meet the deadlines, best apply later when you have more time. * Don’t be too disappointed if you aren’t accepted onto a DT first time around. They get hundreds of applications and usually only have a small number of places. * Make a lot of stuff!\xa0 If you post photos of your creations all the time to Instagram, then you’re building a great online gallery for stamp brands to view and get an idea of your style. * Take great photos.\xa0 Invest some time into learning how to take great photographs of your cards, as that can make a world of difference when applying to a DT. * You don’t always have to have a blog, but it helps. You can start a blog for free, and there are loads of tutorials on YouTube to help you do that. * If you aspire to be on the DT of one particular stamp company, use their products often, and tag them in every photo you post on Instagram.\xa0 It makes your name familiar when DT application time rolls around.  LINK – Kindred Stamps in Australia https://dawnlewis.com.au/product-category/kindred-stamps/\xa0  It was during the final season of Scrap It TV that I moved, kind of accidentally into Level 10 – Stamp shop owner! Honestly, this wasn’t something I had really ever thought about before, but I was such a hard-core stamper by now that I was looking at obscure brands in the USA that we just couldn’t get here in Australia. I asked a question, expecting a no … but got a yes, and before I knew it, I was a stockist for Sweet Stamp Shop.\xa0 I had a background in selling handmade, and figured I’d just sell these stamps for a little while and see if anyone else was interested in them.\xa0 Um … well … that was a few years ago, and I am still selling stamps today! This is a pretty extreme level, and definitely not for the faint of heart, but it’s where I ended up, and I have to say … I’m really happy here.  So … what can we learn from all of this?\xa0 Let’s go back to where I started, in the cardmaking Facebook group, where I see the same things come up over and over again. * Wanting to be an instant expert.\xa0 Sure … some people pick things up quickly, but for the grand majority, it takes time to build your skills.\xa0 It’s just not possible to have all the supplies, and all the tools and know all the techniques straight away.\xa0 Everyone wants to be an instant expert, but we all need to start at level 1, and just like in a video game, as you travel through each level, you become more dexterous, learn new skills, become better at them, and then you level up.\xa0 It’s what I did.\xa0 It’s what everybody does.\xa0 It’s going to take time, and if you want to hear my thoughts on that whole journey from beginner to expert, then check out last weeks Podcast, episode 9, which I will also link to in the show notes.  LINK https://dawnlewis.com.au/podcast9 * Comparisonitis.\xa0 If you start comparing yourself to other people, I would gently recommend that you stop doing that.\xa0 You could be comparing the cards you’re making only 6 months into this new hobby to the cards someone else is making who has been doing this for 5 or 10 years (or more).\xa0 It’s like comparing apples to oranges … it just can’t be done … there are way too many variables.  What it boils down to is this … it’s craft, and it’s meant to be fun.\xa0 You will figure out your favourite techniques, your preferred style and tools that help you get the job done as you go along and level up.\xa0 Maybe you will level up in a different order to me, maybe you will level up faster or slower than those around you, maybe you will hit a level you’re happy with and stay there forever … you do you, and make sure you’re having fun in the process! LINK – my craft cupboard tour https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIqGC5jF6c8 |  As you may have guessed by the title, today we’re going to chat about those frustrating early days of crafting.\xa0 Whenever we pick up a new craft, or pursue any new creative endeavour, there is inevitably frustration because you have a firm idea in your head about what you want your finished piece to look like, but it’s just not up to your ideal standard straight away.\xa0 I honestly don’t know a single creative person who hasn’t been through this exact scenario … and I’ll start with a little story.   A few years ago, a friend asked me for some advice.\xa0 She’d started creating gorgeous handmade things for the first time in her life, and wanted to know how she could go about turning her new-found hobby into a little business.\xa0 Handmade and business are two things I could talk about all day long … and we did just that!\xa0 We talked about pricing, and materials, and batching, social media, how to choose the right market and so much more.\xa0 But something was bothering her … she kept bringing up the same issue over and over again.\xa0 She had a really clear picture in her head of the thing she wanted to make, but the things she was actually making were falling short of her ideal vision.\xa0 She was frustrated by it, and I understood (because I had experienced the exact same thing), but I couldn’t quite explain properly what it would take to get from where she was now, to where she wanted to be with her handmade items.\xa0 Some years later I came across this quote by Ira Glass (best known for his radio show ‘This American Life’), and it said everything I wish I’d been able to say to her on that day.   It’s usually referred to as ‘The Gap’, and I’ve seen it worked into beautiful memes, printables and videos by creative people who must also agree … this is what we wish every creative person knew from day 1! You can find links below to the video and print versions, as well as the original audio recording of Ira Glass speaking these life-changing words.    "Nobody tells people who are beginners — and I really wish somebody had told this to me — is that all of us who do creative work … we get into it because we have good taste. But it’s like there’s a gap, that for the first couple years that you’re making stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good, OK? It’s not that great. It’s really not that great. It’s trying\xa0to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not quite that good. But your\xa0taste\xa0— the thing that got you into the game — your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you, you know what I mean?     A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people at that point, they quit. And the thing I would just like say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of\xa0years\xa0where they had really good taste and they could tell what they were making wasn’t as good as they wanted it to be — they knew it fell short, it didn’t have the special thing that we wanted it to have.     And the thing I would say to you is\xa0everybody goes through that. And for you to go through it, if you’re going through it right now, if you’re just getting out of that phase — you gotta know it’s totally normal.     And the most important possible thing you can do is do a lot of work — do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week, or every month, you know you’re going to finish one story. Because it’s only by actually going through a volume of work that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you’re making will be as good as your ambitions. It takes a while, it’s gonna take\xa0you\xa0a while — it’s normal to take a while. And you just have to\xa0fight your way through that, okay?"    OK … so, while I feel like he’s talking mostly about writers here, and lots of people would apply this to artists as well, I believe this is 100% applicable to us as crafters.\xa0 We are creative people, doing creative things.\xa0 I have experienced this every time I have picked up a new craft, starting from scratch.\xa0 I always have a vision for how I want the process to be effortless, the result to be stunning, the workmanship to be flawless … but at the beginning I make paint blobs, and create uneven stitches, use my seam ripper a thousand times and mutter swear words under my breath at my tools (ok, sometimes there’s shouting and tears).  There is honestly only one way to bring your current skills up to the level that will create the ultimate finished piece … and that is practice.\xa0 I’m not going to say that practice makes perfect … mostly because I am a recovering perfectionist, and perfection really is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.\xa0 What I will say is that practice makes better.\xa0 Here is another story that I feel illustrates this point best of all.\xa0 It is from a book called Art & Fear by David Bayles & Ted Orland … I will link to my source below.    The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.     His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.     Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.    In all my years of crafting, I have found this to be true.\xa0 If I am designing a crochet pattern, and I really, really want to get it right, I don’t just make it once, then send it off to the magazine.\xa0 No. Like any good science experiment I will try to recreate the results by using my original notes to replicate the finished piece. Every single time, without fail, I will find mistakes and flaws in my original design, and the more I work it and make adjustments to the pattern, the better the piece becomes.\xa0 There is a crochet owl pattern I made in my very early pattern writing days, and I know I made it at least a dozen times before I was happy with the end result.\xa0 Even when I was learning to crochet, it took a really long time to get it right.\xa0 I had no idea how little I knew about crochet, and just when I thought I knew it all, along would come some new stitch, or the bombshell that there are THREE different ways to describe one stitch, and they were all different and therefore confusing. I couldn’t turn out the incredible pieces I wanted to make, because I was still learning. I had to learn how different plys of yarn worked, how different hook sizes effected the yarn, how to splice in a new colour seamlessly, and even just become comfortable with the yarn and hook in my hand.\xa0 It took a long time!   So, if you’re wondering why your cards aren’t as good as you want them to be, or why the corners aren’t lining up on your quilt tops, why your embroidery stitches are uneven or your knitted hat is entirely the wrong size … there is only one thing for it.\xa0 You just need to make a LOT of things, because it is in the hands-on making experience that you learn.\xa0 It is by making mistakes that you really learn, and by repetition that you really really learn your personal preferences, how to tweak a pattern, how to create on the fly, how to get the best results from your materials.   It might take a long time, it might not … but hands down, the best way to bring your skills up to meet your vision is to get hands-on.   Now, it’s all very well and good for me to tell you to just make lots and lots of things, but that leaves you with a little problem that I’d also like to address.\xa0 What do you do with all those things you’re making while you’re building your skills?\xa0 I promise not to leave you up to your elbows in dolls or quilt tops or cards or knitted jumpers without suggesting some things you can do with the pieces that you are making in the pursuit of excellence   1 Donate them   There are so many amazing charities that you can craft for. Do a Google search, and don’t forget to add your country, for your craft.\xa0 For example … crochet for charity in Australia. \xa0A whole bunch of websites will come up, and you can surely find a charity that needs something that you can make at your current skill level.\xa0 Often there is a pattern provided, and guidelines, and these days you’ll also likely find a Facebook group full of people who are making the same thing for the same organisation, and they will have lots of hints and tips to help you out.\xa0 Perhaps you can crochet octopuses for NICU units, booties & bonnets for an angel gowns association, pouches for orphaned wildlife or vests for penguins who need help after an oil spill. So, go search for your particular craft and see if you can create pieces to donate.\xa0 It’s great skill building, it makes you feel good, it can fill in empty time, and the best bonus is that you aren’t filling your house with whatever it is you’re working on, and wondering where on earth you’re going to put another crocheted blanket!\xa0 You can also look at donating locally, perhaps to a charity looking for prizes to raffle off for their fundraiser, the school mothers day stall, the local nursing home to give to residents, Ronald McDonald House, hospitals, hospice units … so many places that would be delighted to receive your handmade donation.   2 Gift them   Giving handmade items as gifts is a wonderful thing to do.\xa0 A lot of loves goes into a handmade gift, but this is where I offer a word of warning.\xa0 Not everybody appreciates a handmade gift, so test the waters with something small, and see how it is received.\xa0 It’s not a personal slight on you, it’s just that not everybody understands, appreciates or even likes handmade items.\xa0 It is heart breaking when you’ve put hours and hours of effort, not to mention a very large amount of money, into a handmade gift, only to have the recipient turn their nose up at it, not use it, bin it or give it away.\xa0 I have been there, and it’s soul crushing!\xa0 So test it out with a handmade card first.\xa0 Some people love them, but some people think you’re being cheap … those are the people for whom I recommend purchasing a gift rather than making one. Save yourself the distress, and the inner rage as well as your time and effort and money … and save your beautiful handmade creations for somebody who will truly appreciate them.   3 Sell them   We’ve all had that moment, just like my friend, when we think to ourselves “Hey, maybe I could sell this”.\xa0 Or perhaps a friend or work-mate sees what you’re making and suggests that you could sell them.\xa0 This is why I had a handmade doll business for several years.\xa0 I was absolutely obsessed with a new raggedy ann style pattern I had bought on Etsy, and I’d never made dolls like that before.\xa0 At first they weren’t coming out quite like I wanted them to (mostly because I suck at satin stitch embroidery) … so I made a lot!\xa0 And then when I was happy with my workmanship, I just kept having ideas for different ways I could dress them and embellish the clothing.\xa0 I could start adding in other crafts, like painting and smocking and even more embroidery stitches to create really unique dolls. Before I knew it, I had dozens of dolls in the house.\xa0 I couldn’t find anywhere to donate them because of their yarn hair, and my kids had enough dolls, and I had no nieces or nephews back then … so I opened an Etsy shop!\xa0 And then when I found myself bored with the Raggedy Ann dolls, plus I wanted to make a more practical doll that could be machine washed, I found another pattern, worked up a dozen or so to perfect it, and then started selling those.\xa0 That one doll style kept me busy for about 4 years, and were loved by many little girls and boys all over the country.   4 Reuse them   This one depends a little on what it is you’re making, and what your materials are.\xa0 If you are learning how to sculpt with clay, make something, photograph it, then smash it down and reuse the clay.\xa0 This gives you experience without being left with dozens and dozens of sculptures that you don’t know what to do with. Yarn is another good one for this.\xa0 When I was learning to crochet, I would sit with a YouTube video and create the piece, then unpull the whole thing, restart the video and do it again.\xa0 Sure, the yarn eventually became too matted to use, but I was able to learn the method and stitches without being left with a pile of finished pieces.\xa0 Part of a ball of yarn was a sacrifice I was willing to make to hone my skills without filling my home. You can paint over a used canvas, so if you’re a painter, that’s a great option down the track. For some crafts you will be able to repurpose the materials form your early attempts.\xa0 It saves money as well as space.   Lastly … a great way to build your skills a little faster is to take a class or do a course.\xa0 When you are working with a teacher who is experienced in the craft you are learning, they already know all the tips and tricks, shortcuts and ways to get great results.\xa0 It’s kind of like paying for a shortcut.\xa0 Sure, you still need to put in the work, but instead of sitting at home, muddling it out for yourself, you will have a guide.\xa0 Your teacher will be able to correct your brush stroke, help you fix the thing that’s making your seams bunch up and explain it to you at the same time, show you the difference between US and UK crochet terminology … and that is something that happens instantly on the spot, because they’ve already been through that process, and can help you find the answers quickly so that you can get on with the making.\xa0 Craft teachers are a great resource, and I have to say, whenever a student goes past my skill level it is one of the proudest days of my life.\xa0 I am delighted to pass them on to a specialist teacher and watch them blossom in their chosen medium.  So, if you are in that phase of frustration, remember … it’s just a gap, and you can bridge it at your own pace.\xa0 Make the beautiful things, practice, seek help and enjoy the journey.

We then get into the nitty gritty of who is Super-Curator HUO (Hans Ulrich Obrist) and his insane work ethic and distaste for sleep. We ponder if creatives are now expected to be working to such extreme levels of productivity, and what do we lose because of this? Our September artist focus is the queen of the line, Bridget Riley. Now in her 88th year, this British artist hasn't stopped teasing our optic nerves since the 1960s.

We have 4 physical events, and everyone of them could be a flagship workshop any other year. In other words, we have four all stars on the same team. Get your calendars out and join me for a very special podcast. | New York Times photographer Lynsey Addario once said, “With photography, I always think that it’s not good enough.” And she’s not alone in this belief. But there’s a wide chasm between good and good enough. And understanding the difference between the two is the top story of today’s TDS Photography Podcast. Plus, we’ve finally got a date for the release of the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III. I hope you enjoy the show. | Sometimes you open up the closet, peruse your options, and mumble to yourself, “I just don’t have anything to wear.” In this case, I’m talking about camera bags. I have all of these great adventures lined up, and none of my existing carrying solutions feel right. So I did something about it. Also this week, I take a peek at the new triple camera trend in smartphones. Maybe we don’t need a bag after all? Today, on the TDS Photography Podcast. | In the early days of digital photography, the medium seemed almost too good to be true. You didn’t have to buy film, there was no processing lab, and you could shoot as long as your batteries lasted. And the cameras along the way have been equally remarkable. And over the last 20 years, 6 in particular stand out for me. I’ll tell you which ones, and why, on today’s TDS Photography Podcast. | How often can you say that you scored a true bargain on a brand new piece of photo equipment? Well, I did, with the Kamlan 50mm f/1.1 lens. And I’m going to tell you why today. Plus, I spent some time on Sunday studying portraits painted by Peter Paul Rubens, and as a result, I have a few insights to share. All of that, and more, on today’s TDS Photography Podcast. | I packed my carry-on bag with three cameras, a couple changes of clothes, and a water bottle and flew to Las Vegas for the week. My goal was to explore The Strip, not as an afterthought as I normally do while there for a conference, but as a primary goal. Four days later I returned home with a collection of images and a bit wiser than when I had left. The latter is the focus of today’s TDS Photography Podcast. | Mistakes are sometimes in the eye of the beholder. An off-center subject may be viewed by one person as poor composition and seen as dynamic by another. After visiting the exhibition, “Don’t! Photography and the Art of Mistakes” at SF MOMA, I have 5 techniques that can be dazzling to some folks and head-scratching to others. Tune in and see which camp you fall in to. | The Canon G5X Mark II is compact enough to fit in your pants pocket, but it pairs a 24-120mm zoom lens with a 20.2 MP 1” Stacked CMOS Sensor. That’s a lot of imaging potential in a small package. And it seemed to me worthy of serious street photography. So I headed off to South San Francisco to see what it could do. I share my findings on today’s TDS Photography Podcast. | My favorite definition of routine is by Merriam-Webster, which says “habitual or mechanical performance of an established procedure.” As we do something over and over, our brains can take shortcuts because we’re familiar with the sequence of steps, such as taking a picture. And this certainly can dampen our creativity. But today we will restore vitality to our photography in 5 easy steps. | I have a Ring Video Doorbell mounted by the front door of my studio. 24 hours a day it watches and listens for activity within its 180 degree field of view. It’s like a mini-Truman Show for my neighborhood. And it’s far and away the most unique form of photography that I currently use.

During all those years of touring, Clay started doing graphic design work to supplement his income, which led him to finally picking up a camera in an attempt to create his own stock imagery for design purposes. \xa0Before long he became more and more fascinated by figuring out photography and his band began to realize that it might be time to move on with their lives. \xa0Clay began to put more of his focus on becoming a better shooter and finding clients and the rest is history. \xa0During our conversion Clay talks about the personal project and book that helped launch his career, why he\'s chosen to keep his studio in a smaller market like Louisville, KY when he is shooting national work, what motivates him to keep creating, some of the positive and negative aspects of getting involved in the online education world of photography, and the advice he gives to others coming up. \xa0 To Learn More About Clay Cook Visit: https://www.claycookphoto.com And Follow Him on Instagram At: https://www.instagram.com/claycookphoto/ To Learn More About Visual Revolutionary Visit: http://www.visualrevolutionary.com And Follow on Instagram At: https://www.instagram.com/visualrevolutionary/ \xa0 | Action Sports and Commercial Filmmaker, and one of the co-founders of Anthill Films, Darren McCullough joins the podcast to talk about the crew\'s latest film "Return to Earth" and how he went from being a kid growing up in the small town of Lions Bay BC to becoming part of a filmmaking team making some of the most cutting edge mountain bike films available. As a kid growing up in a small town with access to both the mountain lifestyle and the ocean, Darren had an early love for skiing and outdoor adventures. \xa0So it was only natural that after his older brother started getting him involved in photography and filmmaking in High School, that he had created his first ski film before he even thought about the prospect of college or the future. \xa0Because of those early tastes of creative success, and with his older brother\'s mentorship and encouragement, Darren began to pursue what else could come from what seemed to be a fairly natural eye for shooting. \xa0After years of working for others in the commercial realm and continuing his education through a short stint in film school and multiple professional mentorships, Darren realized that he missed being a part of the mountain lifestyle that his first ski film had afforded him. \xa0During that time he met a crew of like minded creatives working on a mountain bike film that would soon become the foundation of The Collective, and would go on to produce three full length feature films and after that would form the basis of what makes up Anthill Films and a very impressive list of film titles that are helping to revolutionize what a mountain bike video looks like in today\'s standards. \xa0During our conversation we discuss the amount of time and schedule that goes into making a full length film like "Return to Earth", how they go about juggling commercial work with their passion of making mountain bike movies, how he deals with burnout when it sets in, the democracy of working with a big crew, and the advice he gives to those who dream of one day making their own sports action movies. \xa0 To Learn More About Anthill Films or buy the movie Visit:

\xa0 | On this episode of the podcast Matt Porteous drops in to talk about how he went from creating a successful business as a stone mason to becoming one of the go to portrait photographers for the Royal Family, building his own successful commercial studio, and creating a staggering amount of personal photography and film projects as well as multiple outlets to showcase them in. \xa0Matt grew up on the small island of Jersey in the U.K. \xa0It was there that he fell in love with the ocean and the culture that surrounded it. \xa0He spent most of his days surfing and dreaming of one day traveling the world in search of better waves. \xa0At an early age his mother remarried and Matt found himself not only introduced to more disciple in his life, but also to the many new adventures that his stepfather began taking him on that would shape a lot of his adventurous attitude for years to come. \xa0Matt had also become fascinated with photography during his younger years thanks to a small underwater camera that he constantly carried around with him, but it would be in his early 20s as he set out to travel through Indonesia, Australia, and other surf locations that the camera became a more important tool that he understood could tell a story. \xa0After returning home from his travels he felt it would be a better career move to continue to pursue work in the trades, and formed what would become a fairly successful stone masonry company. \xa0As he worked at that business he continued to constantly try and hone his skills in photography, until one day he finally made the decision to chase his dreams of becoming a professional. \xa0He walked away from his business and the rest is history. \xa0During our conversation Matt talks about how he first began building the portfolio that would help him create a successful wedding photography business, the way he ended up first working with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, how he created enough time to constantly continue to pursue his love of adventure photography, and the advice he gives to those coming up in the creative world trying to decide the right path to take. \xa0 To Learn More About Matt Porteous

automotive and lifestyle photographer and commercial director Jeff Stockwell to talk about how he turned a professional career as a rollerblader into becoming a sought after photographer working with some of the biggest car companies in the world. \xa0Growing up in San Clemente Jeff always felt like an outsider because the things he was most passionate about seemed to be outside the norm of those around him. \xa0Although he lived in a beach town, he had little interest in the ocean, and while surrounded by skateboarding, he gravitated more towards rollerblading and quickly began to gain recognition in what was then an exploding sport. \xa0Through competing, video parts, and team sponsorships Jeff traveled the world and began to form the foundation of what would later become a visual aesthetic that would serve him well. \xa0Although he was one of the top pros in the county, roller blading wasn\'t quite cutting it for paying the bills and so Jeff stayed close to the industry of his other passion....cars. \xa0He worked in a machine shop and continued to learn more and more about the mechanical world and figured that would most likely represent his future. \xa0It wasn\'t until years later when an opportunity arose to assist a busy automotive photographer that Jeff started to realize that he could combine his love of cars with his creative side and became fascinated with the world of photography. \xa0Jeff put in his time working his way up in the assisting world, but before long he began to attract the attention of other art directors and decided to set out on his own. \xa0The rest is history, and Jeff has proven he has his own vision as an artist and the drive it takes to succeed in a very competitive industry. \xa0During our conversation we talk about constantly shooting test work and how that helps you to not only stay sharp, but to remain relevant in the midst of so may other shooters, what it was like making the decision to go out on his own after years of steady work as an assistant, how his love of vintage clothing, architecture, and cars influences his photography, and the advice he gives to others coming up in the creative world. \xa0 To Learn More

popular show "Off Camera", and man of many creative pursuits Sam Jones joins the podcast to talk about how he went from a kid growing up in Fullerton, CA with a focus on skateboarding and punk rock, to creating a very successful career as a photographer and filmmaker. \xa0During his younger years Sam always had a lot of outlets for creativity. \xa0Whether he was playing music in many of the bands he was in, drawing cartoons for his school newspaper, or riding his skateboard, Sam was beginning to shape the way he viewed the world around him. During his third year of college he decided to take a photography class, and with the encouragement of his good friend Neil Blender, start creating images of what was around him. \xa0Although music was still the main goal, Sam began to work as a photojournalist for his school paper, which quickly lead him to becoming a stringer for national news outlets. \xa0Before long he found himself on a plane to New York to chase the growing dream of creating a life for himself in the world of photography. \xa0During our conversation Sam tells me the story of how he created the image of Chris Rock for Vanity Fair that would help launch his career to another level, what it was like learning how to become a documentary filmmaker while actually in the midst of making a film about Wilco, how he juggles all of his creative pursuits and how he feels that keeps him from ever burning out, and the advice he gives to others who want to make a life for themselves in the creative world. \xa0Given his background in the DIY world of punk rock and skateboarding, and all is creative pursuits, it\'s no wonder that Sam is just as comfortable having a long conversation with someone like Robert Downey Jr, as he is taking his portrait. \xa0 To Learn More About Sam Jones Visit: https://www.samjonespictures.com To Watch or Listen to Off Camera Visit: https://offcamera.com To Learn More About Visual Revolutionary Visit: http://www.visualrevolutionary.com And Follow on Instagram At: https://www.instagram.com/visualrevolutionary/ \xa0 | Adventure photographer, director, filmmaker, Canon ambassador, and all around bad ass Krystle Wright returns to the podcast to talk about her three most current short films "Chasing Monsters", "In Perpetual Motion", and "A Restless Peace" (Links Below). \xa0Make sure to check out Krystle\'s original appearance on the show back on episode #52 to hear the story of how she got started. \xa0During this conversation we discuss what it was like trying to create three new films for Canon over the course of three years, putting together creative teams and knowing how to let them help guide her in expressing her own vision, what it was like chasing storms through "Tornado Ally" with the most recent guest of the show Nick Moir, trying to create films that have more space to breathe and interpret the imagery instead of always needing to let the audience know what you are saying, her thoughts on the current state of "like driven" content on social media, and what\'s next for her as she continues to evolve as an artist. \xa0  To Learn More About Krystle Wright Visit: https://krystlewright.com And Follow Her on Instagram At: https://www.instagram.com/krystlejwright/ **Links to all Three Films** Chasing Mosters https://youtu.be/6cCBfClDGxo In Perpetual Motion https://youtu.be/4tyqnA4Bo5I A Restless Peace\xa0 https://youtu.be/uy5XHBqEAIQ | Award winning photojournalist and renowned storm chaser Nick Moir joins the show to talk about what it\'s like facing down every type of severe weather you could imagine and how he has continued to evolve as a photographer, journalist, and creative after years in the field working with the Sydney Morning Herald. \xa0You can get a brief glimpse into what the fast paced world of storm chasing looks like in Krystle Wright\'s new film "Chasing Monsters" which features Nick and his work. \xa0Growing up in Sydney\'s Blue Mountains, Nick was inspired at an early age by the natural beauty and power of the storms and bushfires that were part of existence in that landscape. \xa0As the son of a political cartoonist, art and creative expression were also a part of his young life and soon he would find his voice through the lens of a camera. \xa0He became fascinated by the lifestyle of the newspaper photojournalist and began working his way up the ranks. \xa0During the early 2000s, he set out with another photographer to document a devastating bushfire and after two years of coverage they had both brought home the prestigious World Press Photo Award. \xa0Although he works as a daily news photojournalist, his continued fascination of storms has sent him all over the world from covering devastating tornadoes in America, to the Tsunami in Indonesia, to raging bushfires in his own backyard. During our conversation we talk about what it\'s like to mentally recover from the power and tragedy that can be involved in what he shoots, how he prepares for shooting in places like the infamous Tornado Ally, and the advice he gives to other out there wanting to brave the severity of mother nature. \xa0 To Learn More About Nick Moir Visit: http://www.nickmoirphoto.com And Follow Him on Instagram At: https://www.instagram.com/nampix/ To Watch Nick in Krystle Wright\'s New Film Visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cCBfClDGxo To Learn More About Visual Revolutionary Visit: http://www.visualrevolutionary.com And Follow On Instagram At: https://www.instagram.com/visualrevolutionary/ \xa0 | On this episode I sit down with Jonathan Mehring to talk about how he went from a kid growing up in a holler in Virginia in a log home his "return to the land" parents built with no concrete in sight, to a skateboard enthusiast and one of the most well traveled skateboard photographers in the world, and finally the way that would lead him to working with National Geographic on his book "Skate the World" to help spread the global message of skateboard culture. \xa0As a kid growing up in a rural town with pretty adventurous and outdoor enthusiastic parents, skateboarding wasn\'t necessarily the first thing that you would assume would become the driving force of Jonathan\'s life, but while driving around one day, he got a glimpse of a skater airing it out over a privacy fence of a backyard ramp and that scene would stick with him and alter the direction of his life. \xa0Once that passion was paired with a high school photography class, his future was suddenly becoming more clear. \xa0He would go on to study photography in college and try to ignore the advice his professors gave him to give up on the idea of photographing something like skateboarding. Before long he proved them wrong by signing on as a photographer with slap magazine. \xa0After a long run there, and several trips to Europe, he got the travel bug and an opportunity to work with Skateboarder. \xa0It would be at that publication that he would soon birth a mission to go to the most remote skate locals he could imagine and create editorial skate trips like no one else had ever seen. \xa0During our conversion we talk about what it was like to ride motorcycles from Hanoi to Saigon looking for skateable terrain, how he convinced a magazine to let him spend months on the Trans Siberian Railroad, what it was like to realize that he had helped get National Geographic interested in skate culture, and the advice he gives to others with big dreams of travel and photography. \xa0

talk about growing up in former Czechoslovakia and watching the fall of communist leadership and repression, and how that led him to chasing his dreams not only for himself, but for his parents that never had the same opportunity. \xa0At an early age Jussi\'s parents always encouraged him and his sister to let themselves be influenced by travel, music, and whatever other culture they could absorb. \xa0At age 10, when communism fell, Jussi remembers starting to finally get his hands on skateboard and snowboarding magazines, and hear some of the music that had not been allowed before. \xa0It would become the spark of a dream that would eventually lead him to North America and through a ton of random jobs before finally picking up a camera to document the mountain lifestyle he had fallen in love with. \xa0While living in Whistler and attending the pro photography showdown, Jussi told his close friend that one day he would stand on that stage. \xa0It would be a prophetic statement that would give Jussi a goal that he would chase for years before making it come true and winning best in show and the people\'s choice at the same competition. \xa0During our conversation we discuss the trials and tribulations Jussi dealt with not only getting to Canada, but figuring out how to survive there and get his foot in the door of the competitive world of action sports photography, what it is was like to accomplish his goal of winning at Whistler\'s renowned pro photographer showdown after putting in years of work, how he made the transition from action sports photographer to commercial lifestyle shooter, and the advice he give to others coming up. \xa0 To Learn More About Jussi Grznar Visit: https://www.jussigrznar.com And Follow Him on Instagram At:

Mike Lewis, aka @mike2swim, joins the show to talk about how he went from being a collegiate swimmer, to working at the executive level for the Olympic Canoe/Kayak and Water Polo teams, to finally deciding to focus on photography and find himself back in the pool with the athletes he knew best. \xa0Growing up in southern California, Mike gravitated towards the water at an early age and quickly became an accomplished swimmer. \xa0It would become a sport that would help him have a drive and focus throughout his high school years. \xa0During that time, like so many others that have been on this show, he found photography and fell in love with the process. \xa0Throughout his years as a swimmer, and then later on in his professional life working with olympic athletes, the camera was always close by and gave Mike a meditative and creative outlet that he became more and more focused on becoming proficient at. \xa0When one of his close friends started \xa0Swim Swam, which would become one of the biggest swimming media outlets in the world, Mike found a way to be able to focus on two of his biggest passions, swimming and photography. \xa0Before long Mike created some images that would help launch his career to a new level and provide him opportunities to work with the biggest name swimmers and brands around. \xa0During our conversation Mike talks about how he created a niche portfolio and career dedicated to one of his life\'s biggest passions, the specific challenges photographers face when photographing aquatic sports, how he tries to bring mindfulness into his daily life and work, and the advice he gives to others coming up in this world. \xa0 To Learn More About Mike Lewis Visit: https://olavistaphotography.com And Follow Him on Instagram At:

Along with co-hosting, he handles all of the behind the scenes operations which make it possible for you to find and listen to us. \xa0Outside of VantagePoint however Tom, better know as AUTO64, is a man of many other talents. From music video production, to sculpture, to fine art video installation pieces and a wide range of music production in many different styles, Tom really is a Swiss-army knife of talent. After tons of requests from listeners to know more about the quiet co-host we decided to flip the mics around and dive deep into Tom’s history in the arts, how and why he got involved with VantagePoint, all the different things he does to keep the show alive and growing, how VantagePoint has changed over the years, and what he does with himself outside of the show.The post EP 107 – AUTO64 appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | SMUG is, and has been for many years, one of the leaders in the clubhouse when it comes to realistic portrait\xa0murals. \xa0His output is beyond \xa0impressive and the number of murals he paints in a year is almost unbelievable, but to him... "it’s just what I do.” \xa0His massive portraits can span anywhere from one story to 14 stories high but the detail and crispness of the image is the same every time. \xa0Over decades of painting walls, SMUG has developed a distinctive and immediately recognizable style which is not always easy for someone who paints realistically. \xa0His selection of slightly unconventional models and more importantly his very specific use of light and shadow are undeniably SMUG and exquisitely executed every time.It has been a hope of this podcast for a long time to have SMUG join us for an interview and as luck would have it we recently found ourselves locked in a hotel room in rural Sweden with a couple of microphones and a bunch of beers. \xa0Big thanks to the cast and crew of the Artscape SAGA festival for bringing us all together.The post EP 106 – SMUG appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | Captain Kris is a New Zealand born London based character artists and designer.\xa0 Best known in the streets for his iconic Captain character, Kris balances his time between traveling and painting walls with commercial design work and illustration.\xa0 We sat down with him in Sweden during ‘Artscape Festival’ to discuss the positive and negative aspects of maintaining two separate artistic identities, how to maintain a livelihood as a freelance artists in one of the worlds most expensive cities, and how he seems to be at a transitional phase of his artistic career.The post EP 105 – CAPTAIN KRIS appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | Daniel Wakeham and Tor Hedendahl are the creative minds and driving forces behind Artscape Festival,.\xa0 Swedens largest and most visible mural festival has been running for 5 years and is one of the rare festivals that travels from city to city every year rather than continuing operations in the same place every time which would certainly make things far easier.\xa0 We discuss the highlights and pitfalls that come with putting on such a massive project and what the local communities, organizers and artists get out all the hard work that they put in. Daniel and Tor explain, among other things, where the money for such a massive project comes from as well as how they approach curating just 10 or 20 artists from a pool of thousands of talented and capable painters from around the world and how each project has it’s own personality which helps narrow down the field.\xa0 Our interview took place in Gothenburg Sweden during Artscape SAGA, the most recent iteration of the festival, and we were very happy to be invited and bring VantagePoint to scandinavia for the first time.The post EP 104 – ARTSCAPE appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | Herr Von Bias is possibly the most talented, most original, and most prolific painter you’ve never heard of. \xa0A full on legend in Berlin and throughout certain circles in Europe, HRVB has developed a style completely his own in which his totally tripped out characters and environments morph effortlessly into seemingly impossible shapes and contortions. \xa0The level of detail and cleanliness in his work is somehow inconceivable and his bold yet elegant use of color will stop you in your tracks and force you to come in for a closer look. \xa0All of this however, is just the icing on the cake because it’s the imagery that he creates that really sucks you in. \xa0His murals and illustrations feel like they come straight out of the mind of a cartoon character on a bad LSD trip and will have you staring for much longer than you’d expect trying to decipher the scene and figure out whats gong on… all while drooling and giggling like a school kid. A member of the famous WEIRD Crew, HRVB keeps mostly to himself in terms of painting walls, preferring to paint with friends or on projects he develops himself rather than chasing down the fame and notoriety most seem to be after in the international mural festival circuit. \xa0It took JB and Tom over 5 years of asking before he finally agreed to come on VantagePoint but it was a massive pleasure to finally get to sit down with the man himself and pick his brain.The post EP 103 – HRVB appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | Jason Parker is a portrait painter from New Zealand who’s work is more about capturing the individual inside the skin rather than their appearance on the outside. \xa0His exceptionally stylized portraits display brilliant technical skill as well as an understanding of his subjects and a tuned in sensitivity to the human condition. \xa0His models, although often blanketed in foliage or other elements of the natural world, seem to live in a fantasy space where nothing else exists beyond the thoughts immediately I their head that that very moment. \xa0\xa0In todays ever shrinking global community, travel and relocation seem to be an increasingly important aspect of the artist experience and growth. \xa0Jason has embraced this tradition and talks to JB and Tom about his motivation for moving from New Zealand to Australia and then from Australia to Berlin as well as how his work has evolved over time and his personal thoughts behind what he makes and how he makes it.The post EP 102 – JASON PARKER appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | The German duo \'Various and Gould\' are some of the most thoughtful street artists on the scene with their very own particular blend of conceptual street art.\xa0 Active collectively for nearly two decades, they began working on the streets of Berlin in the early 2000’s, a time when the city was exploding with creativity and artists were afforded (for multiple reasons) an abundance of freedom to experiment in the streets and cultivate their voices. Their street education paired with their formal art training at the Berlin Weissensee School has afforded them a perspective unlike many others in the urban contemporary world.\xa0 Their ongoing projects cantered on social issues and their ever changing use of materials and techniques keeps their work fresh and meaningful and a favourite among street art enthusiasts as well as galleries and the wider art world.The post EP 101 – VARIOUS & GOULD appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | BUST discovered his love of art much like a backpacker tracking through the African jungle ‘discovers\' West Nile Virus. \xa0Graffiti bit into him in his early teens and it instantly took over his life. \xa0Growing up in Basel Switzerland, painting trains and writing graffiti was all that mattered to the young artists, but it wasn’t until many years later that he recognized what he was doing as making art. He quickly began experimenting with every method of putting art in the streets from posters to stencils, installations and fake campaigns, and anything else he could come up with. \xa0The work that BUST makes today is visual history lesson of all the things he has done in his past. \xa0A mash-up of styles and media all constructed with the precision and craftmanship only a Swiss guy is capable of.The post EP 100 – BUST appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | Aaron “Woes” Martin is a man of many talents.\xa0 Best known globally for his paintings, sculptures and murals of cuddly yet ferocious pandas Woes has carved out a life for himself that pretty much anyone would be envious of.\xa0 He travels the world creating art that people universally love, He lives in both southern California and Hawaii where he was born and raised, and he maintaining an active roll in the hip hop and dj scene that he credits for having a massive influence on the man he is today.\xa0 On top of all that, or maybe because of all that, he’s also one of the nicest guys you’ll ever meet and definitely one of the most fun to talk to. We were fortunate to sit down with Woes in his home city of Honolulu during Pow Wow Hawaii 2018 to discuss a bit of art in-between a heavy discussion of Hip Hop.The post EP 99 – WOES MARTIN appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO . | Royyal Dog is a mysterious and complexed dude. \xa0With his humble art beginnings as a graffiti writer in Seoul South Korea and a cultivated love of all things hip hop, Royyal Dog spends nearly all of his time these days traveling and painting intensely realistic portrait murals that mix hip hop imagery with his traditional Korean roots and a splash of Christian messaging... a combination unlike anything anyone else on the scene is doing and which sets him apart from the rest of the pack. \xa0His skill with a spray can is incredibly impressive but it’s his strong Christian faith that he feels makes him special. \xa0We were very pleased to have the chance to sit down with an artists as interesting as Royyal Dog while in Honolulu for Pow Wow Hawaii 2018.The post EP 98 – ROYYAL DOG appeared first on VANTAGE POINT RADIO .', 'chan_desc': 'Vantage Point is a Mostly show hosted by James ‘JB’ Bullough and Tom Auto64.

Kristi found that she had a creative force rising from her core, so she picked up a brush and began painting. In a month, her studio was filled with canvases from wall to wall and she knew she was onto something. After honing her craft for several years, Kristi was ready to market her work. But the typical artist\'s path and exclusive representation didn\'t feel like a fit — she wanted to connect one-on-one with potential buyers. Bucking the norm at the time, Kristi sold her art online and began sharing her story on Instagram. In one click, someone could become a collector and own a first edition, and in one message a person could have a conversation with Kristi. The direct-to-consumer approach was not only personally fulfilling for her, it was also a strategic decision. Kristi was out to build a true business and prove that fine art could be sold and scaled online. And so she did. Today, Kristi\'s work has been featured in over 70 publications, including\xa0Architectural Digest,\xa0Elle Decor,\xa0Forbes\xa0and\xa0World of Interiors, and purchased by entrepreneurs, Hall of Fame athletes and magazine editors across four continents. www.createmagazine.com/read/kristi-kohut | On this episode, Kat learns all about creative business management from Ilana Griffo!

As some of his most important buildings turn sixty, O’Neil Ford on Architecture demonstrates that this Texas modernist deserves to be ranked among the leading midcentury American architects.Kathryn E.

With a history that extends back to ancient times, melancholy has hovered at the edges of the appreciation of landscape, including the aesthetic exertions of the 18th century. Implicated in the more formal categories of the sublime and the picturesque, melancholy captures the subtle condition of beautiful sadness....Jacky Bowring is a professor of Landscape Architecture at Lincoln University, Christchurch, New Zealand.Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | In The Meanings of Landscape: Essays on Place, Space, Nature and Justice (Routledge, 2019), Kenneth Olwig presents explorations in landscape geography and architecture from an environmental humanities perspective. With influence from art, literature, theatre staging, architecture, and garden design, landscape has now come to be viewed as a form of spatial scenery, but this reading captures only a narrow representation of landscape meaning today. This book positions landscape as a concept shaped through the centuries, evolving from place to place to provide nuanced interpretations of landscape meaning. The essays are woven together to gather an international approach to understanding the past and present importance of landscape as place and polity, as designed space, as nature, and as an influential factor in the shaping of ideas in a just social and physical environment.Olwig is an American-born landscape geographer, specializing in the study of the Scandinavian landscape. He is best known for advocating a "substantive" understanding landscape, one that incorporates legal and other lived significances of landscape, rather than viewing it in a more purely aesthetic way. His writings include Landscape, Nature and the Body Politic (2002) and Nature\'s Ideological Landscape (1984). Olwig is Professor Emeritus of Landscape Architecture Planning and Management at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Alnarp, Sweden.Learn more about your ad choices.

Her biography, The Empress of Art: Catherine the Great and the Transformation of Russia explores the tsarina’s bold, unprecedented use of art and architecture to legitimize her reign and transform Russia into a European superpower.\xa0 Her new cultural history, The Caesar of Paris: Napoleon Bonaparte, Rome, and the Artistic Obsession that Shaped an Empire examines Napoleon’s fascination with antiquity and its impact on the urban landscape of Paris (Pegasus Books, April 2016 & December 2018).Susan’s articles, profiles, and reviews have appeared in such publications as Fine Arts Connoisseur, The Huffington Post, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Toronto Globe and Mail, and NY Review of Books.Susan holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Stanford University and an MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles.

It\'s the Winner of the Environmental Design Research Association\'s 2018 Achievement Award. South Asian architecture and landscapes are not as well known in the western design schools. This book adds to our body of knowledge about “how to” design spaces with culturally sensitivity for projects in South Asia but also what we can learn from them. It\'s about how their multi-faceted cultural appreciation of the land that derives from their religion, food, and way of living with ecologies affects their designs and placemaking. It’s a fascinating book to view western cultures in a new light and also our current struggles with sea level rise and ecological challenges.Learn more about your ad choices.

Public health concerns under the Old Regime prompted reforms in how the French buried their dead, with millions of bones carted away from church graveyards to the deserted mining tunnels underneath the city. After the Revolution, the Catacombs, as well as newly established cemeteries such as Père Lachaise, became more than simply places for the disposal of the deceased. Amidst the turmoil and upheaval wrought by the Revolution, these burial sites became public spaces for Parisians to, as Dr. Legacey writes, “assert and assess their radical break with the past, to reconsider a new set of moeurs in the wake of that break, to reconnect with their fellow Parisians, both alive and dead, and to reimagine their past and its relationship to the present.”Beth Mauldin is an Associate Professor of French at Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

From grants to residencies to gallery representation in Los Angeles and London, it has been a will ride. But don’t think she is an overnight success. Her work ethic and passion have carried her though over four decades of pursing art to where she is now. As they say, luck is when opportunity meets preparation. Deborah shares how her work has been evolving and where it is headed, her studio practice, as well as giving us a peek into some ideas for her upcoming one women show at The Contemporary Austin a year from now. I think Deborah proves that hard work, integrity, and persistence can change your life and the lives of others in a positive way. She is even planning to start a foundation to help other artists get the help that she so dearly needed to grow her career early on. If you haven heard our first conversation that covers the history of her life and career before last year, have a listen to Episode 19.Artist statment and Bio courtesy of Deborah\'s website.ARTIST STATEMENTWhether I was aware of it or not, otherness has been at the center of my consciousness since the beginning of my artistic career. My early ideals of race and beauty were shaped by and linked through paintings of renaissance artists and photographs in fashion magazines. Those images were mythical, heroic, beautiful, and powerful and embodied a particular status that was not afforded equally to anyone I knew. Those images influenced the way I viewed myself and other African Americans, which led me to investigate the way our identities have been imagined and shaped by societal interpretations of beauty. Having one’s identity dismantled, marginalized and regulated to non-human status demands action. This led me to critically engage image-making in art history and pop-culture, and ultimately grapple with whatever power and authority these images have over the female figure.My art practice takes on social commentary, critiquing perceptions of ideal beauty. Stereotypes and myths are challenged in my work; I create a dialogue between the ideas of inclusion, dignity, consumption, and subjectivity by addressing beauty in the form of the ideal woman, the Venus. By challenging Venus, my work challenges the notion of universal beauty—making room for women of color who are not included in this definition.Wading through my work, you must look through multiple layers, double meanings and symbols. My process combines found and manipulated images with hand drawn and painted details to create hybrid figures. These figures often take the form of young girls. I’m interested in the way young girls symbolize vulnerability but also a naïve strength. The girls who populate my work, while subject to societal pressures and projected images, are still unfixed in their identity. Each girl has character and agency to find their own way amidst the complicated narratives of American, African American and art history. BIODeborah Roberts (American, b. 1962) is a mixed media artist whose work challenges the notion of ideal beauty. Her work has been exhibited internationally across the USA and Europe. Her work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York; Brooklyn Museum, New York, New York; The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California; The Block Museum of Art, Evanston, Illinois; Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, Texas; Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, Atlanta, Georgia; Montclair Art Museum, Montclair, New Jersey; and The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, Saratoga Springs, New York. Roberts is the recipient of the Anonymous Was a Woman Grant (2018), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2016) and a Ginsberg-Klaus Award Fellowship (2014). She received her MFA from Syracuse University, New York. She lives and works in Austin, Texas. Roberts is represented by Stephen Friedman Gallery, London and Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects.

(http://www.austinarttalk.com/supportpodcast) | "There are all these pressures and talks about how do you make your career. How do you make a living? How do you make it sustainable? How do you be an entrepreneur as an artist. And they are all great sounding, very trendy. But at the same time I want to come back and say, why did you want to be an artist? And what makes you want to wake up in the morning and run to the studio and make that thing. At the very beginning it was never for money, it was never for fame. It was something that’s driving you, that’s eating you inside. You have to get it out.How do we hold ourselves accountable? How do we know we are doing something that’s meaningful to ourselves first? And therefore it is meaningful for our viewers. If I am spending hours and weeks and months to make this thing, why am I making it. And what does it mean to people when they are seeing it. It has to be beyond, wow this is beautiful, or this is really cool. It has to mean something. To me and to them."Beili Liu is an installation artist who for most of her practice has focused on the use of space to create transformative experiences for herself and the viewer. She experiments with and puts a lot of emphasis on the exploration of materials, process, and time. Drawing from her life and cultural memory the works often explore issues that she relates to on a personal level and often highlight the importance of feminine strength through the use of meaningful repetition, mending, healing and resilience. And as a teacher who is a working artist she is also able to guide and inspire her students with the wisdom she has gained doing installations and exhibiting her work all over the world.https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/BBLiRoC1.jpgBeili installing AMASS at University Gallery, Texas State University, San Marcos  in 2013  Photo by Scott David Gordon (http://www.beililiu.com/Amass)https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/fbMq47hZ.jpgLure/Rise, Chinese Culture Foundation, San Francisco, photo by Frank Jang (http://www.beililiu.com/Lure)Bio courtesy of Beili\'s websiteBeili Liu is a visual artist who creates material and process-driven, site‑responsive installations. Oftentimes embodying transience, fragility, and the passage of time, Liu’s immersive installations are engaged with multifaceted dichotomies: lightness contrasted with heft, fierceness countered by resilience, and chaos balanced by quiet order. Working with commonplace materials and elements such as thread, scissors, paper, stone, fire, and water, Liu manipulates their intrinsic qualities to extrapolate complex cultural narratives.Liu’s work has been exhibited in Asia, Europe and across the United States. She has held solo exhibitions at venues such as the Hå Gamle Prestegard, Norwegian National Art and Culture Center (2016, 2011), Hua Gallery, London, UK (2012), Galerie An Der Pinakothek Der Moderne, Munich, Germany (2011), Elisabeth de Brabant Art Center, Shanghai (2009), and the Chinese Culture Foundation, San Francisco (2015, 2008). Liu’s work has been showcased in group exhibitions at the National Museum for Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C. (2012), Hamburg Art Week, Germany (2012), the Kaunas Biennale, Lithuania (2011), and the 23rd and 25th Miniartextil International Contemporary Fiber Art exhibitions in Como, Italy (2015, 2013), among many others.

You need a lot of mental discipline to continue to affirm the role of creativity and your voice in the conversation. That’s why I think artists are so important because it\'s just a really important point of view and perception in this cacophony that we hear. Especially now it\'s really good to bend your ear towards maybe more nuanced, more complicated, more complex murmurings and conversations about issues that artists are giving us."Chris Cowden is the executive director of Women & Their Work, which for over 40 years has pioneered elevating and exhibiting the work of women artists from all over Texas. They have presented over 1900 artists in all disciplines (dance, theater, music, film and visual art) since they started, and have produced over 130 color catalogs with commissioned essays about the artists they have shown. They have programs to educate the public and especially children about art, through various commissioned performances and many other exhibitions and events. They also provide fiscal sponsorship and technical support to artists in creating their work. Chris has to be one of the biggest champions of artists I have spoken with. She is really passionate about her job and getting people to experience, understand, and collect art. I love this conversation. I had been so curious to learn more about Women & Their Work and about Chris and her job and this interview does not disappoint.Text courtesy of the Women & Their Work website.Women & Their Work is a visual and performing arts organization located in Central Austin that serves as a catalyst for contemporary art created by women living and working in Texas and beyond.

I think there is a part of me that could have gone that direction and you would have been able to see it in my work. I have done some small pieces where they do look angry. But as far as the larger pieces, I would always feel like if I was working on something that gave that message that it didn’t really calm me. It didn’t really work for me as art therapy which is at the time what I wanted it to do. I wanted it to be able to take me to a quiet place. A thoughtful place. I wanted it to be about love and community, not anger or separation.”Watercolor artist and teacher Jan Heaton is this weeks guest. We met seven years ago when I was working on a photo project capturing artists in their spaces. That experience enhanced my desire to spend more time with creative people and explore their lives and work. Our conversation covers her creative childhood and her art and teaching career through until present day, which is typical of my interviews. But the main impetus for this episode is to share her late daughter Kristin’s story and the upcoming Davis Gallery group exhibition and fundraiser that celebrates her life.https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/ybvMByuv.jpgPink - 60" x 40" - Watercolor on paperBig Pink Blanket of LoveWork by Jan Heaton & FriendsOpening reception: Saturday, September 14th | 7-9 pmSeptember 14 – October 12Davis Gallery & Framing837 W. 12th StreetAustin, TX78701Hours: Mon-Fri 10am-6pm | Sat 10am-4pm512-477-4929In partnership with the Peabody Fund and Dell Children’s Medical Center, Davis Gallery is honored to announce a unique group show in support of Davis’ own Jan Heaton, one of Austin’s premier watercolorists. In February of 2019 Jan’s daughter, Kristin Peabody, was taken by an aggressive cancer she had battled for ten years. In place of the solo exhibition that was scheduled for Jan, Davis Gallery and Austin’s artistic community are banding together in solidarity to fight cancer and find strength. Over sixty artists have contributed 4x4 inch squares of their own original artwork in an overall pink palette that will be hand-stitched together to create a pink quilt, symbolizing the community’s compassion, strength, and friendship.  The idea for the pink quilt is derived directly from Kristin\'s feeling that the love she had been shown over the course of her treatments felt like a "big, warm, pink blanket of love". In addition to this collaborative quilt, an extended group show focused on love, gratitude, and family will feature original artwork by Jan Heaton and over twenty other artists.Ten percent of the proceeds raised during this four weeklong exhibit will be donated to the Peabody Fund, a project set up in direct response to Kristin Peabody’s ambition to help develop innovative work in cancer research through the San Diego Center for Personalized Immunotherapy. The “big pink blanket of love” collaborative quilt will be donated to the Dell Children’s Medical Center’s fundraiser, “The Art of Giving”, an annual fundraiser dedicated to providing art and music therapy for thousands of young cancer patients.https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/7jt4o45Q.jpgPanorama of Jan from 2013 when we met.Artist statment courtesy of Jan\'s websiteMy paintings are personal observations of color, movement, relationships and forms in nature. I prefer the watercolor medium, as I love paper, and the tactile manner in which the pigment integrates with the paper. Painting on cold pressed 100% cotton paper I patiently build translucent, veiled layers of color, allowing the forms and values to evolve in a detailed and orchestrated manner. I normally work in a series, which permits the wet color to dry thoroughly between layers. The images are not restricted by the paper’s edges. Every random mark is there because it needs to be there. The reputed “happy mistakes” (that watercolor legend reports often occur in this medium) are planned and controlled.The circular orbs in my current work are simple, bold, direct, sensual, playful and often mysterious. The sphere recalls harmony, rhythm, movement, patterns, and boundless symbolic metaphors. In my work the circle exists independently and in groups, referencing water patterns on a shore, or a rising moon, rounded fruits, or the shape of a flower. The circle reminds me of family and friends, who are very important to my creative process. The times spent in a circle, talking, eating, dancing, playing, telling stories and solving the problems of everyday life. The memories of this connection to the circle are important to me.My intention is not to impose a specific message to the viewer. I often hesitate to title my paintings, for fear that they will be translated only according to my vision and close a door to the viewer’s interpretations. I hope my paintings will allow the viewer to observe a familiar object in a new way.https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/pM0JVI7r.jpgPanorama with Jan at Boggy creek farmstand in 2014.Some of the subjects we discuss:How we metPanorama projectFarmers market seriesIdeas & editing inspirationMary Oliver poetryDetroit childhoodJan’s parentsArtistic familyCalligraphyThank you notesVarious jobsDeadlinesPainting/websiteLosing job/new pathApproaching galleriesJace Graf portfolioWally WorkmanGallery representationHiatus Spa/calming workMorning walk/lookingBoundaries/introversionValidation/feedbackDiscipline/scheduleThe Art of GivingElizabeth HendleyArt TherapyBeing a teacherWhat is watercolor?Opportunities/learningAdvertising experienceBusiness of artKristin’s storyThe Peabody FundDavis Gallery exhibitionPersonalized cancer vaccineThis interview2nd/3rd opinionsMedical advocacySupportive friends & familyWhat’s differentGratitudeThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Intro music generously provided by Stan Killian (http://stankillian.com/main/)Support this podcast.

They seem now to be more a part of each other. That’s a mystery to me."Sydney Yeager is an artist who describes her current painting style as gestural abstraction. She also teaches drawing and painting at Austin Community College. Teaching has been a part of her life from early on, but it wasn’t until after she had kids and decided to go back to school that she committed to studying art in a serious way. We talk about her history and what motivated her early work and how that has evolved over the years. We also touch on materials, teaching, being a huge art history fan, the Austin art scene and more.Statement courtesy of Sydney\'s websiteI keep returning to a beautiful quotation which has become something of a touchstone for me. The quotation is from Italo Calvino’s book, Mr. Palomar, and is a description of a flock of blackbirds flying over Rome. The narrator describes the flock as a “…moving body composed of hundreds and hundreds of bodies, detached, but together forming a single object…something…that even in fluidity achieves a formal solidity of its own.”This idea of independent parts coalescing into a whole, only to collapse again into singular units, is one that has interested me for many years. Inherent in this idea is a sense of continuity, but a continuity constantly threatened with disintegration. It also suggests a state of suspension, where hierarchy yields to endless associations and connections.In addition to these conceptual interests are more concrete references. Some are from the world around me: geologic formations (specifically the unstable limestone walls so common in Central Texas), pixels, and atoms. Some are artistic references, including Italian mosaic, pointillism, process painting, and pattern and decoration.These diverse influences hold in common the theme of fragmentation. The question is whether these fragments are nostalgic reminders of a past presence, or conversely, the beginnings of a new form. The answer is never clear, which is why I remain interested in the question.https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/SCAswB-Y.jpgswimmer | oil on linen | 60x72 | 2019https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/eC2xAfcM.jpgnaiad #2 | oil on linen | 72x60 | 2019Some of the subjects we discuss:IntroductionGalleriesPhoto usePainter?Early historyBack to schoolGrowing upGang mentalityNarrative workLimited art worldInformal classElisabet NeySupportive friendsImposter syndromeArt schoolTransgressive workFeminism/angerChanging directionLife & death workInterior view/mortalityTowards abstractArabesqueDisintegrationPeople seeing workBeing openMaterials Figure groundThe blank canvasJumping inFlow stateStoppingLove of paintStyle evolutionTeachingArt historyWomen & Their WorkTeaching in overseasStudio in ElginWhat’s nextAustin art sceneGenerational gapBeing an artistThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Intro music generously provided by Stan Killian (http://stankillian.com/main/)Support this podcast.

I work to achieve this by creating a heightened tension in the interaction of two systems, defined as rigid and fluid. Steel structures, once assembled into a specific form, are fixed and unchanging. The fluid systems they contain introduce a temporal element in which there is no longer a definite object, but a shifting one. The use of a steel mold elicits the feeling of an unchanging model, yet the bulbous forms interact with this foundation in abstract, organic, and often unexpected ways. I draw inspiration from larger systems found in nature and society, which represent the push and pull of containment and expansion, strength and fragility, and change and inertia. This interplay creates a push and pull that is dynamic, as perception of the work becomes reliant on the individuals own deep emotive response as they perceive it.I began this body of work by capturing air, water, and soft pliable materials within my rigid structures to really focus in on the change and enertia that couldn’t be stopped in their interaction. This created a movement in the work I really loved. As sculptures would melt from within, deflate, or slowly wither away, I found the audience would interact with them in interesting and dynamic ways. The work was never static. During the next phase of this work’s evolution I transitioned into glass as my mode of movement in the hopes that the pieces would represent a more fixed object and potentially increase their ability to be collected. During this next phase within my studies I aim to employ my more developed skill set and experience with creating high end craft to realize them in a new and even more dynamic way. I plan to use materials such as castable resins, fiberglass, and maybe even concrete, to increase the scale of these works as I work my way to the monumental. I have done the experiments, now I need the funding to make them big. I would like to produce three to five, 6’-12’ works this year, as well as an installation built from the culmination of several smaller pieces that could wrap and move around the gallery space.Some of the subjects we discuss:IntroductionBubble cage guyComplex craftFitting into shapesCages/mirrorsUpbringingCollege/art classesPunishment/repairsObject vs CraftDeadlinesWorking with waterBeginnings in OaklandWorking with glassDesire to teachAnything is possiblePeople around youProjects/business partner Bus conversionGreater impactFacebookMove to AustinGhost ship fireAustin so farCI grant/HS studentsArt collectorsCultural arts divisionDiversifying incomeHelping artistsBeing a dadBurning manThe temple and lossSacrificing for othersDimension galleryMessage to artistsThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Intro music generously provided by Stan Killian (http://stankillian.com/main/)Support this podcast.

You are not defined by the person that you spend your life with. You’re a creation that’s meant for more than just being an accountant, or a photographer, or a painter, or a carpenter. You’re meant for much more than just that. You are meant to use that as a place to help people.”Dallas based artist Matthew Brinston (https://brinston.co) categorizes his very distinctive painting style as something like descriptive realism that leans toward the abstract. The characters in his works come confidently right out of his imagination with each decisive brush stroke and seem especially unique and attractive in an odd way. Over the last 6 years since he was involved in an almost fatal motorcycle accident that changed his life, he has been painting in earnest and feels that his purpose is to create art to make the world a better place and to help others, primarily directed by his faith in God. Be sure to check out the work and also his very distinctive self branding, social media approach, and marketing style that as he states in the interview is aimed at getting people to take a pause.About text courtesty of brinston.co (https://brinston.co/about/)When death leads to life, art is inevitable. And art, as creation, is a reflection of its creator. Brinston and his work consistently grapple with the revolution of death and life and death again. The cacophonous symphony of color and shape, rhythm and structure that compose his work is all at once chaotic and calm. Just as the artist himself is an amalgam of mania and peace. The composition of art and artist is indistinguishable… just as his art is an extension of himself, the artist has become an extension of his art. For the artist, art is valuable in its making life worth living. Art has given him purpose and meaning, the people he loves, the places he’s been, literal survival, a future. Art is everything. And now with everything, the artist seeks to share this existential gift through collaboration and demonstration. Impact the world through connection. Inform himself and those around him through interaction. Art is the universal teacher. And the artist’s goal is to help people find little bits of themselves through personal synergy with the art. The artist’s path from life to death and back to life again has not been without pain. But the vision of Christ plus the inevitable clarity of death have afforded him balance amidst chaos and a wealth of generosity through selfless invention. The artist creates not for glory, fame or control… but because he is an artist. And an artist creates.https://files.fireside.fm/file/fireside-uploads/images/4/41335247-836c-4f4a-8a8b-aeca55f3227a/3pN1deR8.jpegPhoto courtesy of brinston.co.

I felt just through a couple situations that had occurred, where I had not intended to do something, that the art had taken a life of its own separate from me. And I had seen the positive aspects associated with it, so it encouraged and motivated me to work hard to stay out of the way and to allow the inspiration to take place. And then once I acted on it the next piece was available to me. I think that’s one of the reasons I have been so prolific is because I was open and receptive to the inspiration and I didn’t question it and I acted on it."Werrick Armstong (https://www.instagram.com/werrickarmstrong/) is somewhat of an outsider artist who spent most of his life in business, but then retired and shifted his focus to art for the last 20 years.

In 2007 she received her B.A. from New York University’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study where she designed her own major, concentrating in public policy and knowledge production with a focus on health and women of color.Lindley is a memory worker, healer and an activist. Through iterative and interdisciplinary practices, she creates socially engaged artwork that reflects and transforms audiences, shifts culture and moves people to action. She uses movement, text, installation, ritual, burlesque, and multi-media to create immersive works that are concerned with freedom, healing and pleasure. She is currently developing a body of work recycling and repurposing discarded materials.Her artwork has been featured at Spring/Break Art Show, Brooklyn Museum, Hammer Museum, Philbrook Museum, New York Live Arts, the American Repertory Theater at Harvard University, Brooklyn Arts Exchange (BAX), the Gallatin Arts Festival at New York University, WOW Café Theater, La Mama Theater, in living rooms, classrooms, conferences and public spaces. She has received coverage in the New York Times, VICE, ELLE, Blouin Art Info, Art Zealous and Artnet News, and ARTSY. In 2014 she was a Create Change Fellow with the Laundromat Project and selected to participate in EMERGENYC - an artist activist program of New York University’s Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. In 2015 she was a Fall space grantee at BAX. Her 2017 residency at Dixon Place Theater culminated in the world premiere of her one-woman show "The Bag Lady Manifesta" in September 2017. This work is currently on a nationwide tour in the United States.In addition to being an artist, Lindley is actively engaged in social movements as a writer, consultant, and facilitator. For over a decade she has worked with non-profits, research institutes and government on policies and programming that impact women and girls, communities of color, low/no/fixed-income families, queer people, youth and immigrants.

Her mixed media installation, "Re-Membering is the Responsibility of the Living," will be on view from March 7, 2019, to July 31, 2019. Moved by the non-indictments of the police officers responsible for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, Lindley draws parallels between discarded refuse and the violent treatment of Black people in the United States. The artist uses re-purposed trash bags to re-member, honor and value the Black lives that have been lost due to state-sanctioned violence. In this post-Ferguson moment, Lindley is imagining how to recycle the energy of protest, rage, and grief into creating a world where, indeed, Black Lives Matter.Image and text courtesy of The Carver MuseumThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Intro music generously provided by Stan Killian (http://stankillian.com/main/)Support this podcast.

These items are often taken out of their context in their original environments and placed in formal display settings. This fascination has resulted in creation of objects that could be interpreted as functional devices, ritual objects, architectural models or as decorative items.There is an additional series I refer to as portable objects -– self-contained, collapsible pieces designed for easy transport and setup. Some of the portables are fairly simple hinged devices and others are more complex. Pink Portable has hand-milled articulated hinges that allow the piece to be collapsed or extended in multiple configurations.Recently I showed the newly completed Pink Portable to Lauren Jaben. She immediately suggested we display it in the window at Agave Print. The title of the current show “One Plus Eleven” refers to this initial selection and the eleven additional pieces she selected, including several objects that have not been previously shown.I have long wanted to present a sculpture show with a variety of work and I am grateful to Lauren Jabens and Peter Williams for the opportunity to show my objects in their beautiful space at Agave Print.Some of the subjects we discuss:IntroductionThree chaptersChildhood in MinnesotaObserving the landscapeEarly art creationRobert IrwinThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.SubliminalMystery/layersEpiphany momentsDioramasTransitionsMove to BostonExperimental musicCreative collaborationMadison HotelDrawings/documentation Move to AustinMedia developmentSculpture/object originsCraftsmanshipColor/visualsArtistic practicestoplightanalyticsCuero Hotel storyThe last three yearsTurning pointsReactions to workWhy make art?Agave exhibitionThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Intro music generously provided by Stan Killian (http://stankillian.com/main/)Support this podcast.
