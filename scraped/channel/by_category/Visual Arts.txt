They were SO FAR behind Canon and Nikon that it seemed impossible for them to catch up... but, they did catch up around 2018, and in 2019 Sony solidly surpassed the Canon and Nikon mirrorless cameras.

What do those artists look for when they sketch? How do they remember the right colors or where the light was coming from? Hoping to get some answers to these questions and a whole lot more, I was pleased to sit down with the artist, Tom Hughes. In our conversation, Tom opens up about how he found his path as an artist, what it was like working for the Christian Science Monitor, and more. I can’t wait for you all to get a peek into the world of Tom Hughes!\xa0 Hearing the call Can you remember that moment when you decided you wanted to pursue your career as an artist? Or maybe for you, the draw to an art career was more of a gradual revelation. Slow or sudden, each artist has their own version of realizing their unique path as an artist. For Tom Hughes, the decision to embrace life as an artist was more along the lines of answering a “Calling.” If you are religious, spiritual, something in between, or nothing at all, I’m sure you can relate to what Tom talks about when he describes his draw to art as a “Calling.” For some reason, I’ve found that language to resonate with many artists, does it resonate with you?\xa0 Picking up skills along the way\xa0 As you’ve grown as an artist over the years, do you attribute it to practice or learning new skills along the way? While some artists love to explore new methods and push the limits, others like to hunker down and become proficient at one particular approach. Tom Hughes did not receive formal art training at a university for college; he took the route that included self-education. As you can imagine, Tom’s journey hasn’t always been easy. He has had significant moments of confidence, like his time at the Christian Science Monitor, and he’s had periods where he had to take a break and step away.\xa0 Finding the right process Through all of the highs and lows of Tom’s career, the one constant that gets to the heart of Tom’s career is his willingness to adapt and discover the right process. Rarely do artists get described as process-oriented. We artists often get painted with a broad stroke and labelled as flighty, inconsistent, and emotional, just to name a few! Tom worked hard for years to hone in on the process that would work best for him. One of the ways Tom likes to work is by sketching his subjects before he goes to the canvas. Are you drawn to a more process-focused approach in your art?\xa0 It’s OK to change over time I am still blown away when I look back to the start of this fledgeling little podcast and the few friends I knew who would listen to see the massive following we enjoy today - it’s incredible! There are a few elements from those early episodes that you’ll still notice as part of the podcast today, but there have been many changes. If you don’t learn and adapt over time, what is the point? Too often, I find my fellow artists are more adverse to change and evolution then I had expected. We are the ones who get the opportunity to push the envelope and help the public look deeper - it’s OK to change over time! Outline of This Episode  [0:50] I introduce my guest, Tom Hughes.\xa0 [2:20] How Tom got started as an artist.\xa0 [9:00] Skills that Tom picked up and learned along the way.\xa0 [14:00] Tom’s studio process.\xa0 [19:00] Diving into the details of Tom’s sketching sessions.\xa0 [26:40] Tom’s process when it comes to plein air painting.\xa0 [34:15] What is Tom’s color pallet like?\xa0 [40:00] How we change as artists over time.\xa0 [46:20] Tom’s struggle with watercolours.\xa0 [50:20] Why I love watercolours and life as an artist.\xa0 [1:00:00] Have tolerance for your bad paintings!\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Winslow Homer Rembrandt  Resources Mentioned on this episode  Tom’s website  Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | When was the last time you really took a moment to slow down and notice your surroundings? Do you find that you are easily distracted by your cell phone notifications or the million other things demanding your attention? You aren’t alone! I’ve struggled with managing my distractions for years, so I was thrilled to hear my guest, Michelle Dunaway address this critical topic. In our conversation, we also discuss Michelle’s oil painting, her recent arm injury, how to be honest with yourself, and much more. I know that artists like you will get a ton of value from Michelle’s thoughtful perspective, enjoy!\xa0 Space to daydream and wonder What was your childhood like? Did you have a ton of expectations placed on you from an early age or were you free to find your own path? While many parents have nothing but the best of intentions - the truth is - a carefree childhood can quickly get pushed to the wayside. Thankfully, Michelle was given permission and encouragement to explore her creativity. Looking back, she is especially fond of the moments where she would get lost in a daydream or playing in a field. Michelle also points to a critical influence in her life, Richard Schmidt - he also took time to invest in Michelle and encourage her abilities both professionally and as a peer. An unexpected injury\xa0 Don’t you hate it when life throws you a huge curveball that you never saw coming? Maybe for you, it was an unexpected expense like a car repair or the illness of a loved one, or maybe your story is a lot like Michelle’s and you’ve experienced a personal injury that you have to overcome. After recovering from a misstep that caused an injury to her arm, Michelle started to get back into the swing of things. Before long, she realized that she wasn’t able to put in the hours painting as she had before the accident. It turns out that Michelle had re-injured her arm and now has to undergo surgery and an extensive recovery process.\xa0 Managing distractions\xa0 The experience with her arm injury highlighted an important aspect that Michelle had been working to focus on for years - managing distractions. From her cellphone to the news and everything in between - Michelle’s life felt like it was full of distractions. As a spiritual person, Michelle looks to prayer and meditation to help her find her center. Cutting through all the noise of daily life is no easy task! The injury to her arm has forced Michelle to become more aware and present - she still struggles with the distraction of her cell phone, but she’s making progress. What can you take away from Michelle’s story?\xa0 The moments that make you smile\xa0 Have you had a moment in your art career that made you pause in gratitude? Let’s face it; gratitude is not an easy attitude to cultivate. We can get so focused and caught up in what we don’t have or what isn’t going right that we fail to reflect on the good things in life. Michelle will be the first person to tell you that her life is filled with things to be grateful for. Looking back on her career - Michelle points out one person’s reaction to her oil painting of Richard Schmidt as a particularly remarkable experience. The man that was viewing her painting was moved to tears and explained that Michelle’s painting made him feel like he had met Richard Schmidt. What a compliment! Outline of This Episode  [1:00] I introduce my guest, Michelle Dunaway.\xa0 [2:30] Michelle talks about her influences and why she started a career in art.\xa0 [5:30] How has Michelle’s arm injury impacted her journey?\xa0 [19:20] Michelle and I discuss the “Artist’s eye.”\xa0 [21:00] Learning to be honest with yourself.\xa0 [29:30] What does Michelle look for in a subject?\xa0 [39:00] Michelle talks about her experience working with Faso.\xa0 [42:00] A typical day in Michelle’s studio. [50:00] Removing distractions.\xa0 [54:40] Proud moments from Michelle’s career.\xa0 [1:04:00] Michelle shares a story about a painting that moved her.\xa0 [1:13:30] What is Michelle’s dream project?\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Richard Schmidt John Singer Sargent\xa0 Monet Cecilia Beaux Jeremy Lipking Mary Oliver Stephanie Paige Thomson\xa0  Resources Mentioned on this episode  Michelle\'s website  Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | Have you found artists who paint Americana inspiring? Are you drawn to the romanticism and grandeur of the genre? How do artists who focus on painting Americana feel about their genre of work? I was thrilled to sit down with the talented and generous artist, Susan Lyon. In our conversation, Susan opened up about what led her to her career as an artist, why she decides to change things up, her dream of mentoring young artists, and much more. I can\'t wait for you to get to know Susan\'s inspiring story!\xa0 A captured imagination\xa0 When you look back at your start as an artist, who do you point to for inspiration? Was your imagination captured by the likes of Georgia O\'Keeffe and N. C. Wyeth? Susan Lyon\'s imagination was ignited by a whole range of artists, including O\'Keeffe and Wyeth. Today, Susan finds herself encouraged and inspired by her peers who paint Americana. Susan also enjoys studying and painting the faces of people she loves. Listening to Susan, you really get the sense that her heart is poured out into her artwork.\xa0 Practicing meditation\xa0 How do you deal with all the stress and challenges of life as an artist? What practices help you focus and unlock your creativity? For years Susan Lyon would practice meditation, but it wasn\'t until the last couple of years when everything started to "Click." By practicing meditation, Susan has learned how to calm her nervous system and ask open-ended questions. Meditation has given Susan the gift of perspective and peace - key elements for a healthy career as an artist! What can you learn from Susan\'s story? What practices have helped you in your career?\xa0 Don\'t chase perfection!\xa0 Have you been caught up in the perfection game? Some artists learn quickly how detrimental the pursuit of perfection can be - for others, it can take years. We\'ve all been there - you have a particular idea of how you want your artwork to turn out but reality jumps in and messes everything up. It\'s at that point where you need to decide if you are going to keep pouring in your time and energy or cut your losses and start something new. Susan recalls how challenging it can be to realize that you\'ve sunk way too much time into a project that needs to end. I hope you find her advice and insights as helpful as I did!\xa0 The power of group energy When was the last time you got so caught up in the electric energy and positive influence of your fellow artists? Some artists love to get alone with their canvas and explore the depths of their creativity while others feed off of and thrive in a more communal environment. Beyond personal preferences - Susan makes an excellent point about the power of group energy, especially when it comes to artists. In her experience, when like-minded artists gather and encourage one another - powerful energy is unlocked. Have you experienced that time group energy? Outline of This Episode  [0:53] I introduce my guest, Susan Lyon.\xa0 [3:05] What led Susan to her career as an artist.\xa0 [12:00] Susan talks about changing things up.\xa0 [17:15] Reverting back to a safety zone.\xa0 [19:50] Susan shares the benefit of practicing meditation.\xa0 [29:30] Why Susan enjoys painting the image of people she loves. [35:00] The challenge of chasing perfection.\xa0 [40:10] What is Susan’s process like in the studio?\xa0 [45:30] Susan’s dream of mentoring younger artists.\xa0 [50:10] The power of group energy.\xa0 [53:30] Branching out with a one-person show and teaching.\xa0 [1:06:00] The power of vulnerability.\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Richard Schmid\xa0 Georgia O\'Keeffe Bettina Steinke Howard Terpning N.

Can you make a living off of an Etsy business? What should you look out for? Good news! I put all these questions and more to my returning guest, Jenni Waldrop.\xa0 In our conversation, Jenni opens up about realistic expectations, why it’s not enough to just build a shop on Etsy, how to plan for seasonal changes, and much more. If you’ve ever wanted to know how to build a presence on a platform like Etsy - this is the episode for you!\xa0 Addressing Criticism The last time I had Jenni on as a guest, we had an excellent discussion that resonated with a lot of Savvy Painter listeners. Just recently, I received a message that had some pointed criticism for Jenni and the numbers she shared regarding her Etsy earnings. In our conversation, Jenni breaks down why she shared the numbers that she shared and why she had to split up her shops to increase her earning potential. After our conversation, I’m confident that you’ll have a greater understanding of what to expect when it comes to building a presence on Etsy.\xa0 Don’t be afraid to test What is the best product to sell on Etsy? For each artist and seller, the answer to this question will change - especially depending on the season! While small prints will sell well for one artist - large prints will sell better for another. The key is to give yourself permission to test the market and find out what works. When it comes to selling your art - there is no one size fits all solution you’ve got to be willing to make adjustments and learn as you go. Jenni encourages artists to look around at what is selling, especially given the season.\xa0 If you build it - will they come?\xa0 Remember that old Kevin Costner movie, “Field of Dreams?” Wouldn’t it be nice if your business were as simple as setting it up and waiting for the customers to flock to your doorstep? Unfortunately - as many of you know - selling your art isn’t easy. Just like nurturing relationships with a gallery - you’ve got to nurture a relationship with your audience on platforms like Etsy. Consider sharing part of your story or starting a blog to feature artwork and projects you’ve worked on in the past.\xa0 One step at a time How do you feel about starting your Etsy store? Does it sound daunting and overwhelming? If so - you aren’t alone. There are so many artists out there who want to begin selling on Etsy and other platforms, but they don’t know where to start. I get it - I’ve been there! Don’t think that you need to have everything up and running right away - you don’t! Listen to Jenni’s advice and start one step at a time - break it down into manageable steps that you can accomplish at your own pace.

Back when I first started, there were hardly any podcasts about, by, or for artists. Today, there are a ton of options out there, and I’m happy to call many of them friends! On this episode - I decided to do something different - I sat down with a handful of fellow podcasters to answer three questions.\xa0  \xa0What is one common thread you noticed from speaking to so many artists?\xa0 What advice would you give to an emerging artist who sometimes questions their resolve?\xa0 What is the worst advice you hear given to artists?\xa0  Not surprisingly, each of my guests had varied answers that kept me engaged and curious. I can’t wait for artists like you to dig in and hear from their unique and fascinating perspectives! A common thread What would you say is the common thread that ties artists together? As I asked this question to my guests, I was encouraged by their answers. Again and again, the common thread that binds many artists’ seems to be freedom and autonomy. Each person that chooses the path of an artist will follow the call to creativity by creating their own path. I love the boldness that each of my guests tapped into when they answered this question - they weren’t afraid to get it wrong! I hope you get a lot of helpful insights from their unique perspectives and make sure to check out their podcasts. Advice for emerging artists\xa0 There are so many things that I wish I would have heard when I first started out as an artist. What are some of the tips and insights you wish you could have heard? Many of my guests stressed the value of putting in the work - and hard work at that! Too often artists get portrayed as struggling and starving or esoteric and whimsical - but what about the hard-working artist? At the end of the day - if you aren’t working hard and creating - do you really want to be an artist? Another one of my guests encouraged their peers to give yourself permission to call yourself an artist - yes, you can wear that title.\xa0 Terrible advice to avoid\xa0 Sometimes the best advice is to avoid bad advice. What are some terrible pieces of advice that people have given you over the course of your career? I can think of one person who decided that it was their calling to make sure I knew how unbelievably hard it would be to make it as an artist. Yes, it is hard to succeed as an artist, but it’s also hard to succeed as a doctor or a business leader, but we don’t go out of the way to highlight the difficulties of those professions! My guests have a ton of bad advice that you should avoid - let me know which ones resonated with you.

Have you explored the joy of painting animals and pets? Most of you know how excited I am about Trekell’s new Pet Portrait Competition. Guess what? I’ve got the judge for that competition joining me for this episode of the podcast!\xa0 Jennifer Gennari is a classically trained figurative artist. She graduated in 2005 from Ringling College of Art and Design and in 2008 left for Italy to study at the Florence Academy of Art where she spent three years abroad studying classical realism. In our conversation, Jennifer opens up about her time at the Florence Academy, how she trained herself to see colors differently, how she views commissioned paintings, and much more.\xa0 Florence Academy I don’t know about you, but for years I dreamt of attending the Florence Academy - so I jumped at the chance to get Jennifer’s insights from her time there. While she was overwhelmed by many aspects of her time at the Florence Academy - drawing was not one of them. Jennifer was able to pull from her rich childhood memory of obsessively drawing the same Disney characters over and over again. When the time came to drawing with charcoal - Jennifer was out of her element - but thankfully that didn’t last long. Looking at color differently\xa0 How did you develop your feel for using color? Did it come easy for you, or did you find the work challenging? I remember one torturous assignment I was given in school where I had to match the color of this massive collage that I had created - the result? I can now match just about any color I encounter! Jennifer’s story is a little bit different - but she also struggled with finding the right way to incorporate color into her artwork. Looking back - Jennifer notices that while the Florence Academy was great for many valuable lessons - color development wasn’t one of them. Painting animals\xa0 Some of you love painting animals and pets in particular - if that is you - you’ve got to check out Trekell’s new Pet Portrait Competition. Jennifer got started painting animals when she got tired of painting people. Still wanting to improve her skill at painting skin - Jennifer came up with a great solution - painting hairless cats! From there - Jennifer branched out and starting painting animals with fur and then she started dabbling in commissioned paintings of animals and pets. If you are interested in entering Trekell’s Pet Portrait Competition, make sure to check out the link in the resources section!\xa0 Are you a “Sell out” if you create commissioned paintings?\xa0 Speaking of commissioned paintings - what is your take? Have you created a commissioned painting? Do you feel like creating commissioned paintings is selling out? I know that many of you have strong feelings about commissioned paintings - but I’d love for you to hear Jennifer out. In her view - commissioned paintings are only as good as the joy and fulfilment you experience creating them. Creating a commissioned painting for someone who has a special connection to animal or pet is what makes the endeavour worth it. Jennifer only sees creating commissioned paintings as a “Sell out” when the artist is in it exclusively for the money.\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [1:05] I introduce my guest, Jennifer Gennari.\xa0 [3:10] Jennifer shares her early artistic influences and her first career moves.\xa0 [9:20] What was it like at the Florence Academy?\xa0 [16:00] How did Jennifer train herself to see color differently?\xa0 [30:30] Jennifer talks about why she loves painting animals.\xa0 [38:00] What is Jennifer’s studio process like?\xa0 [44:40] Jennifer talks about her color pallet.\xa0 [51:20] Why does Jen always start off with warm colors?\xa0 [56:00] Commissioned paintings - is it “Selling out?” [1:04:00] What is Jennifer currently obsessed with? What is she working on?\xa0  Other artists mentioned on this episode  Alicia Rius Photography  Resources Mentioned on this episode  Jen\'s website Jen on Instagram Trekell Pet Portrait Competition Bargue Drawings Florence Academy  Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | If you are anything like me - you’ve struggled with how to deal with your inner critic over the years. There are a few things that have helped me deal with my inner critic, but I am always excited to hear what my peers have done to address this common issue in the art community. Here to share his unique and valuable perspective is the artist - Danny Gregory.\xa0 Danny is an artist, and he has written nearly a dozen internationally best-selling books on art and creativity. He is also the co-founder of Sketchbook Skool with tens of thousands of students worldwide. In our conversation, Danny opens up about how he got started as an artist, why he loves working on “Zines,” how he deals with his inner critic, what it takes to stay creative, and much more. I know you’ll get a ton of benefit from Danny’s thoughtful perspective.\xa0 Find your people! If you’ve been around the Savvy Painter community for any stretch of time, you know that I am passionate about encouraging artists like you to find your people. Let’s face it - life as an artist can be a lonely existence - but it doesn’t have to be! Even back in the ’90s, artists like Danny Gregory found a way to connect with peers who would encourage and challenge them in their creative pursuits. Discovering an artist from eastern Oregon by flipping through a “Zine” at Tower Records in New York City changed Danny’s life. He quickly befriended this artist via correspondence, and the two went on many trips together. Have you found your people yet?\xa0 Why “Zines” are so appealing Speaking of “Zines,” have you ever encountered one before? When Danny mentioned reading zines in Tower Records back in the 90’s I had a total flashback to my college years. For my millennial followers - zines or fanzines are publications produced by enthusiasts of a particular niche interest. Traditionally, zines are circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. There are so many amazing things you can do with the zine medium - and according to Danny, they are starting to make a comeback! Nurturing a creative focus\xa0 A few years ago, Danny wrote a book called “Art Before Breakfast.” I love that title by the way! His book explored several small ways he incorporated his drive for creativity each day. From keeping a sketchbook next to the kettle in the kitchen to sketching an image while waiting for his wife to finish shopping - there are a ton of helpful ideas that artists like you can use. At the heart of Danny’s message is this - you can fit creativity and art making throughout your day if you just redefine what that means. For many of you - Danny’s approach will be a bit of stretch - after all, we are conditioned to think of “Art-making” as a structured and specific time we set aside.\xa0 Dealing with the inner critic\xa0 Another book Danny wrote is called, “Shut Your Monkey: How to Control Your Inner Critic.” In this book, Danny explains how he’s dealt with and learned to live with his inner critic. Do you still struggle with silencing your inner critic? If so - I can’t recommend Danny’s book enough! He dove deep into where the inner critic comes from in our minds and how to better understand it. Danny discovered that the voice of the inner critic actually is there to protect us from making risky decisions - which is great when it comes to danger - not so great when it comes to creating art. Make sure to check out the links to Danny’s website and his books in the resources section - I know that many of you will find them helpful!\xa0 Outline of This Episode  [1:15] I introduce my guest, Danny Gregory.

Is it a sustainable model or has Facebook’s acquisition taken all fun and profitability out the platform? I put all of these questions and a lot more to my guest, Kate Zambrano.\xa0 Kate is a fine artist based in California specializing in realistic portrait art and figurative art, made up mostly of females. Sometimes described as dark art, her work is a personal study of human psychology and complexity. Kate creates melancholic body languages and expressions, capturing the nuanced truth.\xa0 I can’t wait for you to learn from Kate’s unique perspective - I know you’ll find what she has to say is knowledgeable and entertaining! Putting in the hours\xa0 Sometimes it can take a while to find that medium that you love and there are some artists like Kate who fall head over heels in love with their medium quickly. While Kate enjoys painting, she really comes alive when she uses charcoal. Kate says that charcoal fits her because of her very “Black and white” way of viewing the world. She also loves color and vibrancy, and she loves to express that when she paints but at the end of the day - charcoal is Kate’s one true love. Kate has incorporated some of the skills she developed as a painter into her work with charcoal, and you can tell!

Kate has incorporated some of the skills she developed as a painter into her work with charcoal and you can tell! Navigating Instagram\xa0 Instagram - do you love it or hate it as an artist? Have been able to grow your audience and deepen your connection to your followers? Kate enjoyed a huge boon to her business and her career as an artist once she began posting on Instagram. Quickly, Kate became quite the force as a popular artist on Instagram - then the bottom fell out. A year and a half ago, everything changed with Instagram’s algorithm - small businesses that were thriving on the platform started shutting down left and right. Since they reworked the platform, artists like Kate have noticed that their content hasn’t been getting nearly as many likes or engagement as years past. Instagram’s change has had a huge negative impact on Kate and her business. She thought the decline in support was attributed to her skill and ability as an artist. Today, Kate is doing a lot better - she found a new way forward and shifted her view of success.\xa0 Kate’s view of success What does success look like for Kate today? With all the instant validation of Instagram no longer factoring into her view of success - Kate has had to rethink her personal definition of success. Kate is now focused on maintaining a positive attitude and a healthy mindset - she believes that forward thinking and staying in-tune with her emotions will put her back on the right track. Professionally, Kate finds encouragement in the positive feedback she gets from her peers - she’s not chasing approval, but she’s grateful to get it from her friends.

How would you optimize your working area? What materials would you use? Instead of guessing the answers to this beautiful scenario - I got to ask my friend Kaethe Bealer all about it! Kaethe is a long time listener of Savvy Painter and she’s participated in several of my workshops over the years. I have been so impressed with Kaethe’s growth as an artist. From life on a boat to her process using acrylic paint I know Kaethe’s unique insights and reflections will help artists like you in a number of ways. Life on a boat Seriously though - what is it like living on a boat near San Francisco? Don’t you want to know? Apparently, it is not always as romantic as it sounds. As you can imagine space is at a premium. Forget leaving a studio space set up - if space isn’t being used - then things have to be put away. Thankfully, Kaethe has a supportive spouse who encourages her and supports her in her growth as an artist. While life on a boat sounds challenging - Kaethe also has some stellar work to show for it - which she has to store off boat at her father-in-law\'s house. Why acrylic paint? Speaking of Kaethe’s artwork - I was interested to hear what type of paint she uses on her boat and why. Kaethe uses acrylic paint and works mostly on pannel - her subject matter is all over the place - she loves to explore whatever catches her interest. With her life on the boat - Kathe has found acrylic paint to be the best material to use - it’s easy to clean up! She has a little evaporation bucket outside that she uses to discard her dirty water. Kaethe also uses Open Golden which is an extended drying acrylic paint. Just keep painting “Just keep painting” is one of the mantras that has impacted Kaethe’s on her journey as an artist. She experienced a significant period in her life where she stopped painting and it took her while to get back into the rhythm. These days Kaethe is committed to putting in the time and logging those hours at the canvas. She wants to encourage her artisitc peers to keep at it and stay in the game. Selling her work on the internet was a huge turning point for Kaethe - that experience also buoyed her spirits and emboldened her to get her work featured in art galleries. Workshop junkie Have you heard the term, “Workshop junkie?” I would consider myself a workshop junkie - I LOVE workshops. If money wasn’t a factor I’d fill up my days in workshops with fellow artists honing my skills and learning new techniques and insights. In our conversation - Kaethe and I also discussed the danger of using workshops as a crutch. Attending too many workshops can lead to thinking too little of your abilities and hamstringing your growth. Finding the balance is not an easy task but it is crucial - you need to have a healthy mindset! Outline of This Episode  [0:45] I introduce my guest, Kaethe Bealer. [3:15] What led Kaethe to her current work with acrylic paint? [5:15] Living on a boat, is it as romantic as it sounds? How does Kaethe manage it? [8:45] Kaethe describes her process and how she works with various acrylic colors. [15:30] How did Kaethe lose the “Chalky” feel of her paintings? [20:30] Kaethe and I talk about the influence of Peggi Kroll Robers. [23:30] Make sure to check out the Trekell Art Supplies competition. [25:30] Just keep painting. [30:00] Kaethe describes her evolution as an artist. [37:30] Advice Kaethe has for fellow artists. [40:30] How does Kaethe decide which art competitions to enter?

Connect With Antrese  On Facebook On Pinterest On Instagram On Twitter  | I’ve got a special episode in store for you all this week including questions and answers to a few select topics. I wanted to experiment with a new format, and I’m glad to have you along for the ride! On this episode - I cover how artists like you can navigate art competitions, I give an update about my move to Argentina, and I go over some productivity tips. I’m so thankful to all of you who have been so supportive and encouraging as I’ve made the transition back to Argentina - I excited to roll out some exciting new interviews and innovative episodes like this one! How to find the right art competitions I know it might feel that way, but here is the truth - not all art competitions are shady. It is also unfair to lump them all into the same category, some art competitions will be a great fit for one artist, and they’ll be a terrible fit for others. Here are my four tips for finding the right art competitions.  Understand your goal. Do your homework. Celebrate when you get in! Just move on when you don’t get in.  You are responsible for your own career - so act like it! Don’t get upset about the cost of entering into an art competition, if you think it’s a right fit and that you have a shot then go for it. As you can tell, I’ve got a lot to say about this topic, and I know it’s not an easy one. I’d love to hear from you - what tips do you have to share about finding the right art competitions? Argentina update We did it! We’ve made it to our new home in Villa Carlos Paz in Argentina. It’s been great to hear from many of you as you’ve patiently waited to hear from me during this whole transition process. My new studio is all set up, and I am ready to jump back into my routine. One thing that is a bit of a love/hate factor of life here in Villa Carlos Paz is all the mom and pop stores. I love that I get to directly support the local economy with my purchases - I hate that it can take weeks and weeks to get something as simple as binder clips. All-in-all life is good, and I’m glad for this new chapter of life! Be kind to yourself! As an artist, you want to create worthwhile art, and that’s great! Let’s be honest - when you fail to create the stellar art you have envisioned in your mind - you let yourself have it. We are notorious at holding ourselves to such high and lofty standards that when we fail, we are our own worst critics. Self-reflection is great! Beating yourself up is not so great. Think of it this way - you wouldn’t let your friend beat themselves up - so don’t do it to the person in the mirror! I firmly believe that you cannot create from a place of frustration or negativity - if that sounds too fluffy - too bad :) Outline of This Episode  [0:15] I introduce this special question and answer episode. [2:20] My tips for navigating juried art competitions. [8:00] What is a reasonable price to expect for entering an art competition? [10:00] I give an update on my move to Argentina.

The Renaissance Society in Chicago is showing  "LaToya Ruby Frazier: The Last Cruze." The exhibition features a new body of work that focuses on the United Auto Workers members at General Motors\'s Lordstown, Ohio plant. The facility, which had produced automobiles for over 50 years, was recently "unallocated" by GM -- a term-of-art that indicates the plant has been shut down. Until recently it produced the Chevrolet Cruze. Frazier\'s pictures present members of UAW Local 1112, and tell the story of their lives and the community they\'ve built in northeastern Ohio. On September 14, the day the exhibition opened in Chicago, the UAW\'s current national contract with the Big Three automakers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- ended. The UAW instigate a strike at GM plants. It is already the longest strike against GM since 1970. LaToya Ruby Frazier is a Chicago-based artist whose work most often examines the ways in which corporations have impacted the lives of workers, their families and their communities.

The New Museum is presenting  "Lubaina Himid: Work from Underneath" through October 6. It is Himid\'s first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Lubaina Himid was a pioneer of the British Black Arts Movement of the 1980s and \'90s.

Himid\'s work has been the subject of recent solo shows at the Baltic Center for Contemporary Art and the Platt Hall Museum of Costume at the Manchester Galleries.

It features a large deity in the center of the orange and black earthenware object with a band of glyphs around the edge of the dish. This object is well-known to Maya specialists, not only for the mastery of the design, but because of the inscription that not only mentions the name and location of the donor but also explains that it was a plate used to serve white venison tamales.In this episode, we talk to four experts in the field, Gardiner Museum educator and curator Siobhan Boyd, Metropolitan Museum curator James Doyle, cultural historian Margaret Visser, and Popti storyteller Maria Monteja to peel back the layers of history in this wondrous artifact from ancient times to learn about Maya traditions and culture through the lens of today.A special thanks to SunSon for providing the music to this special series, which is produced by Hyperallergic in conjunction with the Gardiner Museum. | Joseph Pierce wants you to question everything, but especially queerness.The Cherokee citizen and Stony Brook University assistant professor believes the moment has come for queer academia to seriously question the roots of their discipline, and ask how the field can expand to include more voices outside the Euro-American canon of Judith Butlers and Jack Halberstams."When we think about queerness," Pierce explains, "it\'s seen as a universal theory that can be applied everywhere. But often what that does is maintain a framework based on coloniality and white supremacy. What we want to do is question how queerness circulates."Accordingly, the young researcher has teamed up with scholars from across the Western hemisphere to produce a special edition of GLQ, an important journal of lesbian and gay studies published by Duke University Press. The forthcoming issue intends to address the limits of queerness outside normative white contexts, and how decolonization and the schema of radical liberation might provide new context to how LGBTQ culture operates in regions like Latin America and the Global South.An erstwhile contributor to Hyperallergic, Pierce has also written a new book that will release this November, called Argentine Intimacies: Queer Kinship in an Age of Splendor, 1890–1910. The result of extensive archival research, the book is a study into Argentina\'s turn-of-the-century crisis of modernity, and how political and economic changes in the country opened up new ways of conceptualizing family.For a discussion about the relationship between queerness, decolonialiality, culture, and politics, we invited Pierce onto the Hyperallergic Art Movements podcast to share some insight into how he and other academics are trying to evolve queer studies into a more open field of inquiry.The music for this episode is available under the Creative Commons 0 license.Subscribe to Hyperallergic’s Art Movements on iTunes, and anywhere else you listen to podcasts.hyperallergic.com | There\'s a curious collection of 18th-century porcelain figurines displayed on the second floor of the Gardiner Museum. Set amidst an impressive display of European ceramic table wear and figurines, this small assortment of Harlequin sculptures don dark masks that stand out for contemporary audiences. One of the colorful sculptures is by Wenzel Neu and hails from the Kloster-Veilsdorf Porcelain Factory in Germany, c. 1764–65, and beside it is a sign that asks, "Is Harlequin in blackface?"In this episode, we talk to Professor Cheryl Thompson, anti-racist educator Rania El Mugammar, and the Gardiner\'s Chief Curator Sequoia Miller about this figurine that portrays a character from the Commedia dell\'Arte that was a precursor to the more violently racialized images of blackface in 19th and 20th-century minstrel shows.

In this episode artist Kent Monkman recounts his own youth visiting institutions that didn’t reflect the lived reality around him and his Cree community in Winnipeg.\xa0Since those formative years, Monkman has become an important voice in contemporary art who challenges the histories told inside the hallowed halls of museums, pushing them to reflect the complexity of the world around them. He is an artist who teaches us to imagine the world we want to see, one that refuses to erase the stories of pain, but instead uses them to portray the power of resilience and future possibilities.This is the first in a four-part series by Hyperallergic in conjunction with the Gardiner Museum and its Community Art Space, a platform for experimentation and socially-engaged art. The series explores the role of museums, ceramics, and the stories they tell.A special thanks to Brooklyn-based musician SunSon for providing the music to this episode, and you can check out his website sunson.band.

For that project, she recreated objects destroyed by the ISIS terrorist organization in Iraq. For that ambitious endeavor, she used the few images she could collect of the artifacts themselves and then 3D printed them in a beautiful translucent material that revealed a USB — filled with the related data — buried deep inside the new works.Her latest project, which is performance-lecture that was commissioned and presented by New Museum affiliate Rhizome, is titled Physical Tactics for Digital Colonialism, and it builds on her concept of digital colonialism in relation to the technology of 3D printing.The lecture was just released online by Rhizome, but I wanted to invite her into our Brooklyn studio to talk about the issues surrounding digital colonialism.A special thanks to Prince Harvey, who provided the music for this episode. Titled “Stay Gold” you can find more about the artist on his website at www.princeharvey.com. | What is June, really? It\'s a time for the LGBTQ community to come together and reflect on the ongoing fight for equality, even as we honor the hard-won achievements by queer activists past and present. It\'s also an opportunity to reflect on the rich creativity and diversity of our friends and chosen families.That\'s why Hyperallergic is putting a special spotlight on the queer arts community this month. Writers, philosophers, activists, illustrators, painters, sculptors, poets, filmmakers, performers, drag queens — everyone, all creative people are important beacons of hope and resilience in a time of political uncertainty. We\'ve always been devoted to using our website as a platform for historically marginalized peoples, and Pride Month is also a time to celebrate and double-down on that work.Inaugurating this effort, we invited artist and actor Cristina Pitter to share a selection of readings from her solo performance, Decolonizing the Color of Queerness on our Hyperallergic Art Movements podcast. It\'s something of a paean to self-discovery that weaves its way toward self-actualization through histories of hardship and episodes of revelation — something every queer person can relate to. The music in this episode is generously provided by the composer Serena Ebony Miller.This episode is part of our "2019 Pride in Art" series, which is sponsored by Swann Auction Galleries who are running their "Pride Sale," a curated auction of material related to the LGBTQ experience and the gay rights movement on June 20, 2019 at their location at 104 East 25th Street in Manhattan.This episode is sponsored by Swann Auction Galleries.Swann’s first ever "Pride Sale," a curated auction of material related to the LGBTQ+ experience and the gay rights movement, takes place on June 20, 2019.

Harris get together, sparks fly. Wolfson’s art confronts intimacy, violence, and desire with sometimes shocking honesty. Likewise, O. Harris, whose buzzed-about and radical Slave Play comes to Broadway this fall, uses music and bodies to complicate themes of violence and sex—and perhaps most powerfully of all, race and history. O. Harris is able to dip in and out of absurdity even at his most serious, something that Wolfson has also mastered in his mysterious narratives. Here, they debate and cover everything from suppression and transgression, sexuality, Lady Gaga, porn, and more.Get tickets to Jeremy O.

In this first episode we discuss his background in Norwich and his studies at the Courtauld Institute under Nikolaus Pevsner, where he wrote his PhD on the history of the modern movement. We then consider his involvement with 'The Independent Group' at the Institute of Contemporary Art, his support for the 'New Brutalism' of Alison and Peter Smithson, and his role in British architectural culture.Central to the development of Banham's project was his obsession with technology and his growing fascination with the potentials of American consumerism and the ways it might change architecture. We conclude with his ecstatic vision of the mechanical pudenda of technological architecture, in his first visits to America and his plastic bag homes.Here are the key Banham texts we discussed in this episode:PhD thesis (later to be published as Theory and Design in the First Machine Age)'School at Hunstanton, Norfolk' Architectural Review, September 1954'The Machine Aesthetic' Architectural Review, April 1955'Vehicles of Desire'  Art, September 1955'The New Brutalism' Architectural Review, December 1955Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, 1960'The History of the Immediate Future' RIBA Journal, May 1961'What Architecture of Technology?'

We discuss Prince Charles' architectural interventions and the theories of our future king's favourite architect, Leon Krier (and Krier's problematic fave, Albert Speer). We also dive into the hotbed of Trad theorising, Peterhouse College Cambridge, and its two favourite sons, architectural historian David Watkin and philosopher Roger Scruton. We explore the framing of traditionalist theory against modernist hegemony, and ask if the architectural consensus of the 21st century is a bit more Trad than some advocates would admit.We also dip our toes into the culture war, and ask questions about the political connotations of architectural style in the age of social media. Is an obsession with style actually holding us back from confronting the real social, economic and political problems that ail the city? Ultimately, we lament the destruction of good architecture of any style, with a poignant reflection on the proposed fate of the Aton Estate in RoehamptonEdited by Matthew Lloyd Roberts.

Modernism became the hegemonic architectural and urbanist mode in England during this period, and we examine those who rejected the consensus, and sought to continue the retreat into the past, designing architecture that occasionally verges on Caesar's Palace, without any of the fun.In this episode, we discuss Raymond Erith, the traditionalist architect who restored Number 10 Downing Street in the 1960s. We go on to discuss his pupil, Quinlan Terry, whose Richmond Riverside Development we went to visit and recorded our observations in situ. Their stodgy, and often unsuccessful attempts to revive and reconjure a classical vernacular expresses a political and ideological agenda that we attempt to unpack, and will go on to discuss in our final episode on the Reactionaries.

We'd love to meet you!Modernist Architecture has always had more than its fair share of critics. In this episode, the first of a two parter, we discuss the reactionary, counter-revolutionary opposition to modernism in Britain during the interwar period. First, comes an examination of the stodgy, flag-waving, imperialist Classicism of the Edwardian era, which Luke thinks includes some of the worst architecture in Britain. One of the perpetrators of that style, Reginald Blomfield, wrote a patriotic screed against the continental, ‘cosmopolitan’ Modern architecture, which he subtly titled ‘Modernismus.’ We also examine Lutyens’ review of ‘Towards a New Architecture,’ a critique of Corbusier’s theory, but also a refutation of modernism as an appropriate style for living in. Lastly we consider the slightly outlandish ‘England and the Octopus’ by the eccentric architect Clough William Ellis, famous for designing the town sized folly of Portmeirion in North Wales. Fruity characters, problematic tropes and anxiety about a declining Empire abound.In the bonus episode we will discuss the Evelyn Waugh's 'Decline and Fall.'This episode is sponsored by The Article Trade Program.Edited by Matthew Lloyd Roberts.

If you’ve only ever heard of one manga, it’s probably this one. We’ve been reading the definitive  black and white version — worth getting hold of if you can.  Actually we didn’t even get to start talking about the book proper because we went on about context too long. We talked a bit about the earlier works ‘Fireball’ and ‘Domu’, the documentary ’God Speed You Black Emperor’, manga as a genre, and a load of other stuff.

Vast, white, monumental and enigmatically detailed, the Hawksmoor churches are a looming and mysterious presence in the architectural consciousness and mythic history of London, somehow both of time and out of it. Bombed, burned, spurned by popular taste before they were even completed, they have nevertheless survived to become objects of fascination, speculation and obsession. Created on the threshold of modernity, they reach back toward an imagined (and distant) past when the Church was young, and the worship was pure. We’ve recorded a series of observations of the churches on site, and attempted to locate them in the world of early 18th century England. On a forthcoming bonus we’ll be exploring the fictional Hawksmoor — as time-magician, cabbalist, summoner of Egyptian gods and more.

Russell & Robert meet Vik Muniz, the superstar Brazilian artist best-known for his complex photography made with a diverse range of materials including sugar, toys, diamonds and even trash to recreate and interpret famous images, such as the \'Mona Lisa\' (which he executed in peanut butter and jelly), or a Picasso (created entirely with raw paint pigment). Muniz taps into our collective memory of known and recognisable images and artworks. With a wry and canny combination of high and low, Muniz uses the photograph not in the traditional sense, as a recording of reality, but instead as a document of his illusion. Recorded live in front of an audience at Soho House Greek Street, we discuss his new Ruinart collaboration \'Shared Roots\' on display this week at Frieze Art Fair in London. As well as looking back to his childhood dyslexia, drawing cartoon clouds in the Manhattan sky and his legendary \'Verso\' series in which Muniz recreates the back panels of world famous paintings like Van Gogh’s \'Starry Night\' or Vermeer’s \'The Girl with a Pearl Earring\'.\xa0We discover why he decided to work with photography following a life-changing shooting which led to him moving to New York to become an artist.

Russell & Robert visit NYC to meet gallerist Jasmin Tsou (JTT Gallery). We discover why she set up her Lower East Side gallery in 2012, initially exhibiting her peers, but soon expanding her program to include emerging artists in a climate that she describes as ‘scary and intimidating.’ Tsou has a very collaborative approach: ongoing conversations with colleagues have shaped JTT’s program and remain at the heart of her activity as a gallerist. We explore the work of her artists Marlon Mullen, Diane Simpson, Issy Wood, Jamian Juliano-Villani & Borna Sammak.

For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Russell & Robert meet artist Wong Ping at Camden Arts Centre, London for a special tour around his solo exhibition \'Heart Digger\'. Wong Ping creates digital and sculptural works that reveal very human, often universal fantasies, through absurd narratives. Drawing from his own social encounters, he elaborates his stories into dark humorous tales that touch on political and cultural anxieties. Digitally rendered in a seductive technicolour language, they recall the modernism of Fernand Leger, the pop language of Tom Wesselman or Allen Jones, and the design aesthetic of The Memphis Group and early 1980s video games. These simple but seductive animations also disguise a deeper critique of technology.Wong Ping is the inaugural recipient of Camden Art Centre’s new Emerging Artist Prize at Frieze (2018). The Prize was established in collaboration with Frieze Art Fair, as part of Camden Arts Centre’s commitment to nurturing and celebrating the most innovative artists of the moment, who have yet to receive the recognition their work deserves. The annual prize awards an artist exhibiting in the Focus section of Frieze London with an exhibition at Camden Art Centre.

We learn how he has been addressing the challenge of bringing art to as many people as possible (including a notable recent collaboration with Arthur Jafa) as well as his early interest of bringing together art & science, the legacy of curator Lucy Lippard, of caring for the environment and the importance of taking ecology to the centre stage.

to you from Europe today but before we begin this episode, go download the FREE GUIDE TO SELL YOUR OWN WORK.“How to Sell Art Online”https://www.emilyjeffords.com/howtosellartThis guide is going to make the whole process of bringing your work to the world clear and inspiring. \xa0Two weeks ago we talked about ways to create authentic art that is pure and from YOUR inspiration \xa0\xa0Before we dive into this too far, we need to lay a foundation:\xa0 EVERYTHING IS A REMIXEverything builds on something that came before.Acknowledge the massive amount of inspiration that went into the formation, creation, and execution of your own work.You and I are part of a long, long lineage of artists building on ideas and working within mediums.What an honor!\xa0\xa0Thoughts travel at the speed of light in our connected worldIf your ideas are good, and if you share them (which you should) they WILL travel around at lightning speed and they WILL inspire others.\xa0If your ideas are resonating with you, chances are they will also resonate with something else\xa0This often leads to purchases and buyers and collectorsBut it can (and probably will) mean that you also inspire other creatives.\xa0THIS IS A GOOD THING\xa0In order to make any measurable impact on the creative landscape your work WILL impact others\xa0We’re all inspiring each other all the time, and if that includes you and your work, it means your doing something really meaningful.\xa0The collective unconscious has become the collective CONSCIOUS as we become more and more interconnected\xa0\xa0Ok, but don’t miss hear me:I’m not saying “if people copy your work you should be thrilled!”\xa0 No…. not exactly.\xa0\xa0As the creator of your work you are also in charge of protecting your work.\xa0This is not an act of selfishness or fear.This is an act of valuing and honoring your work and asking others to do the same.\xa0\xa0Don’t hide your work feel the need to keep it behind a tall wall.\xa0 The energy in your work wants to be shared.\xa0 It wants to be seen and loved and a source of light to others.\xa0Keeping it behind closed doors or hiding it behind a giant watermarked image doesn’t allow it to sing.\xa0\xa0\xa0If you don’t stand up for the integrity of your work who will?If you don’t preserve the value and preciousness of your work then who will?Especially if you are a fine artist or an independent designer… the value of your work is your lifeline - and by proxy, your creative work’s lifeline (if you feel stolen from and abused your work suffers most of all).\xa0Innovate.\xa0 Always.\xa0In the episode, we talk about practical ways to talk with people who are "copying" your work -- give it a listen if this is a subject that impacts your work.\xa0\xa0XOEmily Jeffords\xa0\xa0\xa0 | Having been in the creative world for quite a few years with a pretty wide audience, I\'ve had the "honor" (lol) of having my work copied many, many times.\xa0\xa0In this episode, I get into why copying someone\'s work is harmful to not only the original artist but also for the person who is being heavily inspired.\xa0\xa0We also get into mental shifts and practical tips for creating good, authentic, ORIGINAL art that is going to help your work thrive.\xa0 Creating work you are proud of and that speaks from your point of view and personal aesthetic leads to great success in your career.\xa0\xa0This topic is sensitive, and I want to approach it with love and understanding, but I also want our industry to grow and improve, and the only way we can do that is by exposing our wounds and allowing them to heal.\xa0Keep creating good work.\xa0 XO\xa0Learn more about Emily Jeffords:

A group of artists, architects, scientists, critics, and collectors sympathetic to Ruskin’s ideas formed the Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, which sought reform not only in artistic practices, but also in the broader political arena. In a paired lecture delivered at the National Gallery of Art on June 16, 2019, Sophie Lynford and Diane Waggoner described further what Lynford has called the American Pre-Raphaelites’ “comprehensive, multipronged agenda.” By looking beyond painting to the group’s ideas about architecture and photography, Lynford and Waggoner more fully illustrated the philosophy of the American Pre-Raphaelites, whose search for truth had both pictorial and moral stakes. | Ken Burns, filmmaker, in conversation with David M. Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, trustee of the National Gallery of Art, and chairman of the Smithsonian Institution In documentaries such as The Civil War, Baseball, Jazz, and The West, filmmaker Ken Burns has spent 40 years investigating American history and culture. His films tell the American story not only in terms of victories and major historical flashpoints, but also through the lives of individuals and relationships. Burns’s films have been honored with dozens of major awards, including 16 Emmy Awards, 2 Grammy Awards, and 2 Oscar nominations; in September 2008, he was honored by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The National Gallery of Art, in collaboration with the Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE), hosted Burns for a conversation with David Rubenstein on April 28, 2019. | Paul Carter Harrison, playwright and expert in African American theatre, and Quincy Troupe, poet, in conversation with Harry Cooper, senior curator and head of modern art, National Gallery of Art American painter, printmaker, and sculptor Oliver Lee Jackson (b. 1935) has created a complex body of work which masterfully weaves together visual influences ranging from the Renaissance to modernism with principles of rhythm and improvisation drawn from his study of African cultures and American jazz. In a paired talk on May 19, 2019 at the National Gallery of Art, Paul Carter Harrison and Quincy Troupe, both writers and friends of Jackson, discussed their parallel pursuits of new avenues for creative thought and action. Harrison shared anecdotes from late-night studio discussions with Jackson, along with explanations of Jackson’s understanding of how his heritage factors into his work. Troupe read from his poetry and talked about the social and artistic environment in St. Louis, Missouri, that produced jazz musicians Miles Davis and Julius Hemphill, as well as the Black Arts Group that supported Jackson’s early work. Harrison and Troupe were then joined by curator Harry Cooper for a brief conversation. | David Gariff, senior lecturer, National Gallery of Art. The First World War, known as the Great War, was also the first modern war, claiming millions of lives, in part, by newly invented weapons such as the machine gun, tank, aircraft, and poison gas. The arts of the period present a portrait of the terrible price paid by humanity—the carnage and suffering caused by the war were documented in paintings, sculptures, novels, memoirs, and poems produced both during, and immediately after, the struggle. In this presentation on March 27, 2019, senior lecturer David Gariff explores the responses of artists and writers to the trauma of the First World War, which transcended national boundaries. Paintings, sculptures, and prints by Otto Dix, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Käthe Kollwitz, Fernand Léger, John Singer Sargent, and Natalija Goncharova; poems by Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, and Anna Akhmatova; and memoirs and novels by Ernest Hemingway, Erich Maria Remarque, and Robert Graves are discussed against the backdrop of “the war to end all wars.” | John Hobson, staff assistant, department of special projects, National Gallery of Art The study of Slovene photography has remained intertwined with the medium’s specific relation to pan-Yugoslavian artistic development, generally focusing on the period between 1945 and 1991. In celebration of the National Day of Slovenia, John Hobson expands the current understanding of the development of photography in the Slovene region, breaking from the Yugocentric narrative to present his research on the breadth and complexity of twentieth-century photography created by Slovenians. In this lecture at the National Gallery of Art on June 3, 2019, Hobson discusses the creation of photographic conventions and traditions, as well as transgressions against them, across the twentieth century. | Jeffreen M. Hayes, executive director, Threewalls An outstanding sculptor associated with the intellectual and cultural awakening known as the Harlem Renaissance, Augusta Savage (1892-1962) overcame poverty, racism, and sexual discrimination in pursuit of her goals. Creating new visions of black identity in her work, she was also an activist, campaigning for equal rights for African Americans in the arts. The traveling exhibition Augusta Savage: Renaissance Woman and its accompanying catalog is the first to reassess Savage’s contributions to art and cultural history in light of 21st-century attention to the concept of the artist-activist. The exhibition viewing dates are as follows: the Cummer Museum of Art, October 12, 2018-April 7, 2019; the New York Historical Society, May 3–July 28, 2019; the Palmer Museum of Art, Pennsylvania State University, August 24–December 8, 2019; and the Dixon Gallery and Gardens, January 19–March 22, 2020. The groundbreaking catalog features illustrations of more than 40 works by Savage, her students, and her contemporaries, archival letters, rarely seen photographs, and an extensive bibliography and essays by Kirsten Pai Buick, Bridget R. Cooks, and Howard Dodson. In celebration of the Washington, DC, book launch on June 23, 2019, exhibition organizer Jeffreen M. Hayes discusses the life, work, and lasting legacy of Savage as an artist and a community builder. This program was proposed and made possible by Darryl Atwell. | Kristen Gonzalez, department of northern baroque paintings, National Gallery of Art Jacobus Vrel is not exactly a household name. A painter of quiet Dutch genre scenes, he produced some fifty works and quickly fell into obscurity. Composing modest interiors and street scenes, Vrel’s mature paintings predate those of the most celebrated Dutch masters in the 17th century. In fact, many of his works were misattributed to Johannes Vermeer. In this lecture held on April 22, 2019, Kristen Gonzalez discusses the Gallery’s Young Woman in an Interior by Jacobus Vrel and the striking modernity of his genre paintings. In anticipation of a major retrospective exhibition in Munich, Paris, and the Hague next year, Kristen discusses the challenge of studying the enigmatic Vrel and establishing his artistic identity distinct from Vermeer and his contemporaries. | Lorena Bradford, accessible programs, department of education, National Gallery of Art Since it opened to the public in 1978, the East Building has been recognized as one of the National Gallery of Art’s most prized masterpieces. The passing of the building’s architect, I.M. Pei (1917–2019), invited a new look at his building projects around the globe. In a talk given on July 7, 2019, Lorena Bradford situates the commission of the East Building within the context of Pei’s blossoming career and shares some of the challenges Pei and his team faced in developing the final, inspired design. Bradford analyzes the responses of critics, fellow architects, and the public to the East Building both before the completed structure was unveiled and after it opened in 1978, concluding with reflections on Pei’s legacy. | David Gariff, senior lecturer, National Gallery of Art. David Smith (1906–1965) is arguably America’s greatest sculptor of the 20th century. His art enlarged the vocabulary of sculpture by employing welding and industrial processes and materials, laying the groundwork for the directness of minimalism and the realization that sculpture could be anything the artist desired. Smith’s oeuvre is a logical outgrowth of earlier 20th-century sculptural trends in cubism, constructivism, and surrealism. However, his work also represents a new paradigm for the language of modern sculpture that reflects the dynamic growth and industrial prowess of the United States after the Second World War. Smith’s confrontation with the process of creation broke the rules and expanded the possibilities of his art form. In part two of this lecture, presented at the National Gallery of Art on March 7, 2019, senior lecturer David Gariff explores Smith’s revolutionary art through a discussion of some of his most important and innovative works, including the Agricola, Tanktotem, Sentinel, Zig, Voltri, and Cubi series. | David Gariff, senior lecturer, National Gallery of Art.

And acquisitions have actually declined since 2009, according to a major new study “Women\'s Place in the Art World: Why Recent Advancements for Female Artists Are Largely an Illusion ” produced by\xa0In Other Words\xa0and\xa0artnet News. The report found that there has been no progress in museum acquisitions, and that just 14% of exhibitions were of work by female artists. The auction market for work by women doubled, but still only represents 2% of the global total—with just five female artists (Yayoi Kusama, Joan Mitchell, Louise Bourgeois, Georgia O\'Keeffe and Agnes Martin) accounting for 40.7% of that total.

Hollein discusses the distinct role he believes the Met can play in terms of contemporary art, and gives an update on recently-stalled plans for a $600m Modern and contemporary wing—part of more than $1bn the museum is slated to spend on renovations and expansions. In a week in which the Met returned to Egypt an ancient gilded coffin that had been the centerpiece of the exhibition “Nedjemankh and His Gilded Coffin”—but which prosecutors deemed to have been looted, Hollein talks about how the Met is tackling the fraught issue of cultural repatriation. He talks about the museum as a platform for debates: from the morality of where money comes from to diversity in programing and governance. \xa0\xa0 For this and much more—including what success looks like to Hollein—tune in today.

He has described the fraught political process of designing the prize-winning National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in Washington, D.C. in 2016, as eight years of pain. But “these buildings are long overdue,” Adjaye says, “There’s a language they need to bring, which is about the reality rather than the fiction of nation imagery.” In this podcast with Amy Cappellazzo (co-founder of AAP and a chairman of Sotheby\'s) and host Charlotte Burns (executive editor,\xa0In Other Words), Adjaye—who has designed the forthcoming expansion of the Studio Museum as well as the plans for the National Cathedral of Ghana—talks about how space can change the way we think about our own histories. “We’ve all been numbed into never dealing with big questions,” he says, asking: “Then what the hell are we all doing here?” For this and more, tune in today.

There\'s definitely a ‘too big’ possible.” In conversation with Allan Schwartzman (co-founder of AAP and a chairman of Sotheby\'s) and our host Charlotte Burns (executive editor,\xa0In Other Words), Zwirner discusses the future of the business and the state of the market—and talks about what he is looking for in the next generation of artists.

He shifted the conversation. That\'s why we\'re still grappling with him. Love him or hate him,” says Donna De Salvo, the senior curator and deputy director for International Initiatives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, who recently organized the blockbuster exhibition "Andy Warhol—From A to B and Back Again" (on show now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, until 2 September). Beyond the glamour of the celebrity and consumerism so often associated with Warhol, there is something destabilizing about his work, says Dominique Lévy, the co-founder of Lévy Gorvy—which is showing “Warhol Women” in New York (until 15 June). “If you spend enough time in front of a Warhol painting, little by little it unnerves you,” Lévy says. When people fetishize the trophy of the Marilyn, they\'re missing a certain point of the way that Warhol is constantly disrupting,” De Salvo says: “Whether it\'s the off registration of the screen, through the color, through the scale, the multiplicity of images. He\'s not about a fixed image. He\'s actually quite the opposite and that gets to issues of identity.” Together with host Charlotte Burns, Lévy and De Salvo discuss the radical aspects of Warhol\'s work, discussing how much of it is still undervalued and under-appreciated—particularly drawings from the 1950s and works from the 1970s and 1980s. “He reinvents himself and becomes more and more conceptual, and more and more relevant,” Lévy says. “His project ends because he dies,” De Salvo says: "He was just getting going again." Ultimately, she says, Warhol “reflected these twin American desires, which are at odds: our desire to innovate and our desire to conform.” For this and more, tune in today.

Taking different approaches, Hudson and Bröcker Wieder are both interested in what a more equitable art world would look like and both are invested in community and collaboration.\xa0 The dialogue on democracy, community, tech and collaboration closes with a call for openness. “I see a big role for institutions reclaiming this territory of culture,” Hudson says: “How we shape and create our culture as being above and beyond politics and economics.” Tune in today for more.

On today’s show, the legendary dealer talks about the history and future of her gallery together with Steven Henry, who has been the gallery director for more than two decades, Allan Schwartzman, co-founder of Art Agency, Partners, and host Charlotte Burns. Known for her eye, Cooper has represented some of the most important international contemporary artists of the past half-century. “Artists will give her the best shows, the best work,” says Henry. The gallery has remained a leader of the pack throughout the past 50 years, despite seismic shifts in the art world and market. Nowadays, “it’s this huge international money world,” says Cooper, who also discusses new styles of collecting and the impact of politics on the art world. She also talks about the future: “I really have to think about not being here, now at this point," she says. Ultimately, the legacy of the gallery will be the artists it has supported, she says: “The gallery will be forgotten.

It started coming down hard just as I entered SNP east and just after they closed the park.
