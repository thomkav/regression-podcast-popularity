Informed by his deep knowledge of the discipline, Cohen shares his early memories of architecture, and his belief in the catalytic role architecture must play in the transformation of our urban context. Discussing the mechanics of contemporary practice, Cohen reveals how his practice approaches the intensive process of project development with a progressive attitude, and how a permutational approach can sidestep the pitfalls of conventional value engineering. Looking back on his 2013 Walter Gropius Lecture and his 2018 GSD studio titled “The Future Provincetown,” Cohen furthers his analysis of the challenges confronting architecture today. Cohen ends by asserting his hope for a more symbiotic interaction between architecture and urban planning.Preston Scott Cohen is the founder and principal of Preston Scott Cohen Inc, and Gerald M. McCue Professor in Architecture at the GSD, where he served as Chair of the Department of Architecture from 2008 – 2013. Cohen’s work encompasses diverse scales and types of buildings, including houses, educational facilities, cultural institutions, and urban design. His work has been the subject of a wide range of publications and exhibitions and is held in various collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Cohen is the author of Contested Symmetries and numerous theoretical essays on architecture.

Discussing his deep engagement with living systems, Gary describes the intrinsic properties of landscape architecture that differentiate it from the other design disciplines, and the significance of treating temporality as a medium for design. Commenting on the trajectory of landscape urbanism, he highlights the ways in which new modes of representation have impacted the scope and capacity of landscape architecture to imagine larger systems, and to engage with pressing problems of equity and climate change. Gary also reflects on the organization of his own firm as a cultural practice, its benchmarks, periods of stability, and growth, as well as the need for flexibility within the practice of negotiated boundaries.Gary asserts the importance of trust in practice and the ways in which the pressing questions found in practice inform his efforts in the academy.

In addition, the weight of the debris will also have some bearing on waste management fees. This is an unexpected line item that ideally we want to avoid. \xa0 In this week’s episode, I’ll give you some quick tips on how to reduce job site waste so those overage fees are less likely to occur. Plus we’ll hear from Angela Phillips of ZTERS, the waste management solutions company that I’ve been working with.\xa0 Angela will give us a little more insight into how we can manage our waste more efficiently.

They made this list based on trends that they see in photos that designers and homeowners have submitted and based on their conversations with design professionals. \xa0 This list includes things that I too have been seeing in the past few years that I think we’ll continue to see in new homes as we go into 2020. Show notes at BYHYU.com | Don’t call it a comeback, marble’s been here for years.\xa0 But in the last decade, marble has become more popular than ever, especially in bathrooms and kitchens.\xa0 But… how good of an idea is that?\xa0 In this week’s mini-lesson, we’ll look at the pros and cons of using marble in our new homes and the difference between 2 of the most widely requested types of marble: Calcutta and Cararra marble. Show notes at BYHYU.com BYHYU.com | For decades, the standard ceiling height was 8 feet tall—a dimension that resulted from two 4-foot-wide drywall sheets laid together horizontally.\xa0 But homes are now being built with standard 9 or 10-foot ceilings on the first floor, and ceilings at 8 or 9 feet tall on the second floor.\xa0 With today’s taller ceiling heights, the potential space above standard upper kitchen cabinets has become larger and we’ll have to decide how far up we want our cabinetry to go.\xa0 Should we leave an open space between the upper cabinets and the ceiling, or should we fill that space with a soffit or with additional cabinetry? \xa0 This week we’ll talk about the pros and cons of cabinets that extend all the way to the ceiling.

We went over 2 of the most common styles—single, standard doors and French doors.\xa0 Plus, we talked about a new kid on the block, bifold doors. In this second part of our list, we’ll discuss some more old school and new school door styles, including sliding doors, pivot doors, and dutch doors, and we’ll be answering the burning question “Are storm doors still a thing?” Show notes at BYHYU.com https://www.facebook.com/BYHYU | Whether you’re deciding on the style of door you want for your main front entry, or to your patio, or to any other area that leads to the outdoors, there are several door styles to consider. It’s not just a matter of choosing a traditional single or double, French doors for your main entrance. You could also install a pivot door or a dutch door.\xa0 And for patio doors, there are French doors, sliding doors, and bifold doors.\xa0 This week, we’ll talk about the pros and cons of each style of exterior doors.\xa0 Shownotes at BYHYU.com https://www.facebook.com/BYHYU | In part 1 of the mini-lesson, we talked about how many homeowners and house designers pay too little attention to roof overhangs because they think of them as purely aesthetic. But overhangs have several important functions: they can protect exterior doors, windows, and exterior walls from rain and snow; they can shade windows from hot summertime sun rays, and they can help keep basements and crawl spaces dry by directing rainwater away from the main structure of the house. This week, we’ll go over whether you need deep roof overhangs for shading on the north, east and west sides of your house.\xa0 Plus I’ll tell you what you can do to protect your house from the sun’s heat and rain if you either don’t want overhangs or can’t have them because of building code.\xa0 Yep, building codes in some areas don’t allow overhangs.

Build Your House Yourself University (byhyu) will teach you to save money and make smart decisions about the construction of the place you and your family will call HOME. We will help you understand residential construction— simplify and demystify the design build process. You’ll come away with successful strategies for building your own house, with or without a general contractor.  Become an educated consumer, even if you prefer to buy, rather than build a new house. Complex construction jargon and best practices will be explained in easy to understand terms.  It’s not the typical DIY (do it yourself) show.  You will learn how to MANAGE the labor, not DO the labor for your new house.Join me, Michelle Nelson, host and fellow informal residential construction student.  I’ll share the research I find on home design and building as I prepare to build my home. Together, our community of future home builders, will learn the tips, tricks and trends of experienced contractors and industry experts. I’ll interview owner-builders and construction professionals.  During our mini lessons, I’ll inform you about framing, flooring, windows, insulation, kitchen cabinets and countertops…almost anything having to do with new construction homes.  You’ll hear about energy efficiency and green building too.  There will be product reviews in which you will be introduced to cutting edge, as well as, tried and true products and services.  And in keeping with the university theme, episodes will end with short, fun quizzes. If we do our due diligence BEFORE we start construction, we will actually start construction with the most difficult part of the project behind us.  Let’s put in the time, effort, preparation and research BEFORE we break ground and building our homes will be much easier and more enjoyable.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/4a/10/76/4a1076e1-8339-b225-b015-f8f34c625569/mza_8002907600294518843.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2016-01-13'}}

It can be hard to focus on both moving product and creating the designs for that product, especially when we’re juggling online, wholesale and licensing accounts. Turns out, you don’t always have to do it all. Today’s Proof to Product guest, Erin McManness, is a Paper Camp alumni who’s lived every side of the business and decided to stick to the parts that are most fulfilling for her. I’m excited for you to hear her story.\xa0 Erin is an illustrator working in Atlanta, Georgia. She\'s been freelancing full time for five years under her brand Paper Raven Co., which started as a small greeting card line and now includes licensing for an assortment of cards, gifts, fabrics, and home décor. Erin incorporates her values and love for the environment in her work by printing all of her cards on 100% recycled paper in the United States. She also donates $1 from every sale to her reforestation partner, One Tree Planted. Over the course of her career, Erin has collaborated on projects with companies like Macy\'s, Target, Trader Joe\'s, Publix, and Aldi. In October, she\'s releasing her second book, The Art Starts In The Heart: An Inspirational Guide To Making Meaningful Art. On Episode 125, Erin and I sit down to cover all of the above. We talk about how Erin has built the licensing arm of her business, the pros, and cons of flat rate and royalty payments and why she\'s made the decision to ramp up her licensing arm and slow down on the wholesale side. We also talk about Erin\'s new book, so enjoy! ON TODAY’S EPISODE:\xa0 - The inspiration behind Paper Raven Co.\xa0 - How Erin’s evolved from one stationery line, to multiple product categories, licensing and more - What it’s like to collaborate and design for big brands - The importance of going out and asking for what you want - The difference of working with both smaller and larger brands\xa0 - Advice on how to navigate negotiations and creative collaborations - How to trust your gut and choose the right projects\xa0 - Flat rate fees vs royalties\xa0 - The 3 questions Erin asks herself before choosing to work with brands - Making room for life beyond work\xa0 - Why you should double check a company’s tracking & metrics before signing a royalty deal - What inspired Erin to make the switch to 100% recycled paper products and partner with One Tree Planted - How to research, evaluate and choose ethical companies to work. with - Tough decisions, book celebrations, and what’s next for Erin\xa0 \xa0 KEY TAKE-AWAYS:\xa0\xa0 “You need to go for what you want and if you want something, tailor your portfolio and go ask for it.” - Erin McManness \xa0“At tradeshows, and Instagram, too, you never know who\'s watching. You never know who\'s paying attention to you or where the next great opportunity will come from.” -\xa0 Katie Hunt\xa0 “I love to work with smaller brands because they can be really flexible and they\'re not this big, huge company. There\'s a lot of creative freedom and things like that.” - Erin McManness “My rule is that if I get excited and I listen to my body, and my body is like, ‘Yeah, whoa, let\'s go. This is so exciting, I\'m so inspired by this,’ I\'m like, "Yeah, let\'s do it." - Erin McManness “Saying no is difficult for a lot of people, myself included. But when we say yes to everything, we run ourselves ragged and we’re not focused on the things that are really the most important.” -\xa0 Katie Hunt\xa0 “I really try to be intentional about structuring my business with what brings me the most joy, what I absolutely love doing.” - Erin McManness “I was ready to move on, but I was so worried about proving that I was a financial success out on my own that I just hustled and hustled and hustled, and I put things off to the side.” - Erin McManness “I realized making art is really what I want to do. Making the art is the most important thing to me.”\xa0 - Erin McManness “I just want it to be me, I don\'t want an empire. I just want to be happy, make art, make things that make other people happy.” - Erin McManness “I try to do my research about companies that I work with. Are they ethical? Do they have practices that I can be proud of to be associated with?”\xa0 - Erin McManness “It’s super important that there are shared values between us and those we\'re partnering with or collaborating with.” – Katie Hunt LINKS Website: http://www.ShopPaperRavenCo.com Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/paperraven.co/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/paperravenco/ Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/paperravenco/ https://onetreeplanted.org/ \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

Thanks so much for listening. We\'ll be back next week with a new episode! | You’ve likely heard me say this here on the Proof to Product podcast and in our emails, but I’m a firm believer that relationships are they key to running and building a successful business. Everyone from our team, to our customers, to our colleagues, to our vendors plays a significant role in our personal growth as well as the development of our company. Your relationships with wholesale buyers, are no exception. \xa0 BUT HOW DO YOU FIND THE RIGHT STORES? HOW DO YOU CONNECT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WITH THE BUYER? HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A STORE IS A GOOD FIT FOR WHAT YOU SELL? \xa0 These are common questions, so let me share some ideas: \xa0  FOCUS ON QUALITY OVER QUANTITY.  I often hear people say that they want to be in hundreds of stores. But, I’d argue that it is more beneficial (especially in the beginning) to work with a smaller group of stores that order from you regularly. It’s much easier to provide great customer service and build meaningful relationships with a smaller pool of customers. And, it gives you time to refine your internal systems and build a strong foundation so that if you do grow your wholesale line to a point when you have hundreds of stockists, you’ll be able to keep up. Set realistic goals when you’re starting out and remember that fewer customers isn’t necessarily a bad thing. \xa0  GO BEYOND THE WEBSITE.  The internet is a fantastic place to research potential wholesale partners, but there is so much more to a business than just their website. How is the store showing up on social media? Who are their customers? What other brands do they buy from or do they engage with on social media? Which shows are they attending and talking about? What types of products do they feature? I’m not advocating stalking, but the more you know about a potential shop the more effective your first point of contact will be. You’ll also have a clearer idea if your products would work in that store. \xa0  START A CONVERSATION.  Again, don’t stalk. But don’t be afraid to engage with people in your industry, particularly shops you admire. Comment on their social media, like their posts, send an email introducing yourself and your line. Or, send a note (on one of your cards!) and let them know you’ve enjoyed their emails / social media posts / their window display was cool. Relationships take time to build and I know you’re busy juggling one thousand other things on a daily basis. But, if stores don’t know about you, they aren’t going to buy from you. \xa0 And that brings us back to relationships. \xa0 These stores are your customers. Focus on customer experience, building real connections and delivering on your promises. \xa0 Be professional, polite and use every point of contact as an opportunity to strengthen your relationship with your buyers. \xa0 At Paper Camp we\'ll dive deeper and explain how to identify the right stores for your products, then we\'ll provide you with strategies for how to reach them.\xa0 Our Paper Camp E-Course starts on September 30th and we\'d love to have you.

You want your products to look unique and stand out from the crowd, but you don’t have to break the bank to do it. \xa0 There are so many packaging options available, and it’s important to know when to follow the crowd and use standard packaging and when to get creative and do your own thing. Ultimately, your product packaging must make it easy for the end customer to understand what your product is and how they can use it. And, from a business standpoint, you want to ensure that your packaging looks great, is scalable and doesn’t cut into your profit margins. Here’s where to focus. \xa0 - Keep it Simple - Keep it On-Brand - Keep Costs Down \xa0 We dive into each of these during today\'s episode. \xa0 Also, our Paper Camp E-Course starts on September 30th and we\'d love to have you.\xa0 Enroll or join the waitlist at www.prooftoproduct.com/papercamp.     \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

Thanks so much for listening. We\'ll be back next week with a new episode! | I’m recording this on a Sunday evening, just two short days after I finished hosting our 16th Paper Camp conference and I’m just now getting a chance to reflect on everything we did at Paper Camp and the amazing feedback we had from our students.\xa0 In this episode, I want to share some of their key take-aways with you here on this episode. \xa0 But first I want to preface this conversation by saying we cover a lot of ground at Paper Camp.\xa0 This is our signature program and we’ve helped over 1,000 small businesses on how to get their products on the shelves on their favorite retail shops. \xa0 We talk about product development, sales tools for wholesale, sales strategies - working with reps and tech solutions like Faire, marketing to wholesale buyers and the nuts and bolts of exhibiting at shows. \xa0 As you can imagine, it is a very rich, full two days.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 I tell you all of that to let you know that we modify each Paper Camp conference for the cohort that is there.\xa0 They tell us where they are in their business and what they need help with. So, we tailor each conference and course to the attendees that are in attendance; and that is what is reflected in these student take-aways \xa0 Now, let’s get to the meat of it. \xa0 Here are the top four take-aways our students left with: \xa0   Validation.\xa0 They are on the right track, making smart decisions in their busines and they are not alone.\xa0 They left feeling validated in the decisions they’ve made thus far and confident in the steps ahead.\xa0   Road Map.\xa0 They have answers and know where they are going next.\xa0 They were given strategies, tools and next steps for their specific business at Paper Camp and now they just need to do the work.\xa0 Many of them felt relief knowing they have a road map in place.  Community. \xa0 So often creative entrepreneurs feel like they are working in silos.\xa0 So, to sit in the same room as people who understand them, are working towards similar goals and building similar businesses is refreshing.\xa0 Having an safe space to openly share resources and strategies without feeling like you’re in direct competition is a special thing.  Options.\xa0 They realized they have a lot of options for how to create their work, diversify their revenue streams and build a sustainable company.\xa0 There is no one size fits all approach, but now they have information to make the best decisions possible for the business they want to build  \xa0 In addition to the student’s takeaways, I also want to share with you our speakers’ final parting words of wisdom: \xa0 Rachael Hetzel from Pistachio Press reminded people that there is no one way to build a business.\xa0 We all do things differently, and that’s what makes our products & business unique.\xa0 Doing what you love and being confident in your decisions is what will make your business grow stronger.\xa0 We’re in a unique and supportive industry that o \xa0 Kimberley Yurkiewicz from Crow & Canary reminded people that they are not alone.\xa0 If they have a question, its likely someone else has that same question.\xa0 So, reach out to the community, lean on your peers and leverage the Paper Camp community as you continue to grow. \xa0 Katie Wilson from The Good Twin encouraged our students to embrace incremental growth.\xa0 She acknowledged that everyone is building their businesses in a unique way and there is no “right way” to launch to wholesale or release new products. \xa0 She reminded everyone that even though they all have the same tools, advice and strategies from Paper Camp, that their journeys will be unique. Take comfort in your path and be proud of what you’re building. \xa0 Carina Murray from Crow & Canary advised people to push themselves to cultivate a unique point of view with their products.\xa0 While there is an insecurity around being different, embrace it -- buyers are hungry and want to see innovation.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 And, I reminded everyone that slow steady growth is how strong businesses are build.\xa0 Be intentional, strategic and confident once they decided on a path. Trust yourself to make the right decisions \xa0 These are just some of the things we talked about at Paper Camp.\xa0 I wanted to take you behind the scenes as to what we do at Paper Camp as well as what our key take-aways were.\xa0 I hope you find it helpful as you’re navigating decisions in your own business.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 And, I want to remind you that our online program -- the Paper Camp E-Course is open for enrollment and we only have a few seats left.\xa0 Registration will close this week and we’ll start classes on September 30th. Get more information and register at proooftoproduct.com/papercamp. \xa0 I look forward to working with you! | Do you ever sit down at the end of a long day of work, after checking box after box off your to-do list and still think, wow, I have so many more things I should get done. This feeling of overwhelm is common for small business owners and mompreneurs alike and it’s the reason today’s guest, Tonya Dalton, was inspired to write her new book,  The Joy of Missing Out.\xa0 \xa0 You may remember Tonya from  Episode 26 of Proof to Product, where she shared her start-up story of founding inkWELL Press and how she built systems and processes for both work and home. Since then, Tonya has been featured on Real Simple, Entrepreneur, Inc., Apartment Therapy, Lauren Conrad, and HGTV. In 2019, Tonya received the\xa0 Enterprising Woman of the Year Award and was named North Carolina\'s Female Entrepreneur to Watch by The Ladders. Tonya is truly a productivity expert and has made it her mission to help other women reduce and remove the overwhelm in their lives through her inkWELL Press products, liveWELL Method Course, Productivity Podcast, and book that comes out October 1st.\xa0 \xa0 On today\'s episode, Tonya takes us behind the scenes of The Joy of Missing Out. She shares her motivations for writing the book, why she chose to weave stories in as lessons, and the power of saying yes and no. I also discuss a personal story of my own that Tonya shares in her book. If you’re looking for ways to reduce overwhelm in your life and carve out more time for the things that matter most, this one\'s for you! \xa0 ON TODAY’S EPISODE:\xa0  What inspired Tonya to write The Joy of Missing Out The importance of being raw and honest Where to start when you get feel caught spinning in circles\xa0 How to identify your priorities and true North Star Misconceptions about what’s urgent vs important Letting go of the idea of balance to embrace the idea of movement Advice for coping with feelings of guilt The value of free-time and white space to boosting productivity Ultradian rhythm is and why it’s important\xa0 How Tonya uses her white-space and free time The sandwich strategy and how to use it Tools, resources and bonuses being released with The Joy of Missing Out\xa0  KEY TAKE-AWAYS:\xa0\xa0 “We\'re overwhelmed by our tasks, overwhelmed by our own to-do list. And I wanted women to see that it is possible to live the life you want and to achieve greatness without spreading yourself so thin, without making yourself do everything.” - Tonya Dalton\xa0 “It\'s not always easy to say no, to live with intention, or to let go of the guilt that we feel making these choices. And I think was really important to just be raw and honest about that.”\xa0 - Tonya Dalton\xa0 “The best teachers are those that have been through difficult times and are open to sharing both how they got through it as well as the messy parts of dealing with it.” - Katie Hunt “None of us get through life with all successes, without any failures. It\'s the things that we stumble on, the things that we fail at, those are the things that make us resilient.” - Tonya Dalton “Instead of trying to go the 50 different steps, why not choose to do five? Why not do less and focus in on what\'s important.” - Tonya Dalton “If everything is perfectly equal and even, there\'s no movement. You have to have some imbalance in order to move forward.” - Tonya Dalton “I think that\'s the problem is when we are trying to do everything, we end up doing nothing.” - Tonya Dalton “The biggest mistake some people make is thinking periods of rest are a reward for great work, but periods of rest are actually a requirement for great work to happen. We need some white space in our lives, some breathing room where we can actually innovate and be creative.” - Tonya Dalton “Often the grace we give to others far exceeds the grace we give ourselves.” - Tonya Dalton “I am so guilty of putting out the fires and letting that pull focus, because it\'s right in front, whether it\'s my kids or my team or whatever it is. But using the priority list over the to-do list recently has shifted my mindset around that.” - Katie Hunt LINKS Website: https://inkwellpress.com/ Facebook: http://facebook.com/tonyaidalton Instagram: https://instagram.com/tonya_i_dalton Twitter: https://twitter.com/tonya_i_dalton Book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400214335    \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

We\'ll be back next week with a new episode! | On the Proof to Product Podcast we cover so many topics, from marketing and operations to tradeshows and product launches, but today I’m super excited to have Kaitlin Fontenot on the show to talk about what every product-based business absolutely needs to be successful in our modern world - a well-built eCommerce platform. Kaitlin is the founder and lead designer of Kait Studio, a branding and web design company specializing in retail. Kaitlin is passionate about helping entrepreneurs feel more confident with their online presence so that they can show up in other areas of their business where they are needed daily. In addition to running a successful studio that develops e-commerce sites, as well as digital marketing, social media, and branding strategies, Kaitlin is also a mom and head of a rapidly growing team.\xa0 \xa0 On Episode 120, Kaitlin and I sit down to talk about how you can best prepare before building an e-commerce site and ways to manage both online wholesale and retail shops. We talk about hiring, building a team with intention, and the importance of delegation. Kaitlin and I also discuss some misconceptions some product-based business owners have about e-commerce platforms and she shares a few important social media marketing strategies you definitely should start leveraging today.\xa0   ON TODAY’S EPISODE:\xa0  How Kaitlin built her business and the kind of work Kaitlin specializes in today Her favorite projects to work on\xa0\xa0 The importance of integrating your website into your strategic plan Misconceptions about managing an online presence\xa0 Strategies for driving and maintaining traffic on your ecommerce site What types of product pictures work on various social media platforms How Kaitlin plans and executes the web build process\xa0 The pros/cons of various e-commerce platforms\xa0 Best practices for brands selling in both retail and wholesale\xa0 How to get more eyes on your site & tips for widening your reach Hashtags, videos and other tactics you shouldn’t be ignoring The life-changing benefits of delegation  KEY TAKE-AWAYS:\xa0\xa0 “If I had to pick one aspect of my business that I completely loved and was so passionate about, it would be the design development side” - Kaitlin Fontenot “People would ask, “Who\'s growing your Instagram account? Who\'s helping you with all of this? Is it just you?” And I would just say, "Yeah, you know, it\'s me. I built the site. I\'m doing all of this myself."\xa0 - Kaitlin Fontenot “You need to be leveraging your website in a very strategic way to not only get people coming through to your site, but to get them engaging with your products and purchasing your products and engaging with your brand.” - Katie Hunt\xa0 “You have to think about the amount of time people are spending on social media and how they\'re getting to your website. There\'s so much that goes into it, and you have to know your customer 100%.” - Kaitlin Fontenot “I truly believe that if you\'re solving problems for people, especially through your website or your online shop, they will convert into paying customers.” - Katie Hunt\xa0 “Everyone\'s customers are different. Everyone\'s audience is different. So really, it\'s all about what your audience is responding to the most.” - Kaitlin Fontenot “Once the build phase is done sometimes people get stuck. They don\'t move forward with any other strategies. So I always recommend the website is done, step away. Let\'s try some other things. Go to Instagram, go to Pinterest, see what you can do.” - Kaitlin Fontenot “Hiring a team, it\'s really scary. But as a mom and a business owner, it has been the most life-changing thing for me.” -\xa0 Kaitlin Fontenot “I was doing everything myself for a very long time, had small children at home and when I started delegating and outsourcing, even just small pieces, it changed my life. I was able to do more in the business and focus on the high-level strategic things that needed my attention.”\xa0 - Katie Hunt\xa0 “Find someone you feel comfortable with, that\'s okay with answering your questions no matter how crazy you think they are. Find someone who understands where you\'re coming from because it is a big investment and anyone you work with should understand as a business owner themselves.” -\xa0 Kaitlin Fontenot \xa0 LINKS Website: http://www.lovekait.com Instagram: http://instagram.com/kaitstudio / http://instagram.com/kaitlinfontenot https://tsbc.teachable.com/p/delegating\xa0  \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

Thanks so much for listening. We\'ll be back next week with a new episode! | Behind every great business is an even better story. Kelly Wang Shanahan, creative director and founder of the Ziran fashion design company has just that - an amazing story. Kelly officially started her line in June, 2016 after becoming disillusioned with the luxury fashion industry, particularly it\'s waste and fast fashion mentality. \xa0 While researching ancient fabric techniques in China, Kelly discovered a special fabric called Xiang Yun Sha silk and instantly fell in love with its luxurious beauty and cultural significance. Today all Ziran pieces are made from this special silk, which is imported from China, and designed and manufactured locally by Kelly in Los Angeles.\xa0 \xa0 Today on Episode 119 of Proof to Product, Kelly shares the long process of finding the silk, building a relationship with the silk boss in China, and gaining exclusive rights to use it with our products. Kelly shares her passion for sustainability, what inspired her to keep going through this long process, how she leverages story and influencer marketing, and why relationships are a key component to business success.\xa0  ON TODAY’S EPISODE:\xa0  The Ziran products and what makes them unique How Kelly traded “the lawyer plan” for fashion entrepreneurship Hurdles that product based businesses face\xa0 Finding customers and leveraging social media\xa0 The sales channels and marketing channels Kelly utilizes\xa0 How Kelly got connected with the right vendors and manufacturers Misconceptions about influencer marketing The importance of building relationships for the long term Building a network in the fashion industry \xa0Kelly’s advice for others starting out in the business Coming up next for The Ziran...  \xa0 KEY TAKE-AWAYS:\xa0\xa0 “I went to China, I visited the silk farm. I saw how they made it. I was completely blown away, and then that\'s when I was like, this is what I want to do.” - Kelly Shanahan “I feel like especially with social media, there\'s so much noise, so I try to make everything ... every collection or drop have a deeper story and have a meaning behind it.” - Kelly Shanahan “I\'ve tried to be more strategic with the influencers that I align with to make sure that they are actually supporters of the brand in an authentic way, and they actually vibe with it.” - Kelly Shanahan “I\'m proud that I\'ve been able to do that and help bring this ancient thing into modern times and make it relevant today.” - Kelly Shanahan “You work so hard on this thing and then you send it off into the world and you hope it brings everyone else just as much joy as it did you.” - Katie Hunt “What kept me going is just wanting to continue ... wanting to preserve and save this craft.” - Kelly Shanahan “In a world where everybody is consuming everything so quickly, lots of machines are making things, there’s just a tangibleness to these handcrafted products, I know it\'s something different, there\'s nothing else like it.” - Kelly Shanahan “There\'s kind an openness among those of us who are making clothes in Los Angeles where we\'re open to share what we know, because we all know how hard it is and we\'re in it together.” - Kelly Shanahan “When one of us finds success, all of us gain success from that. And the more we can share, the stronger all of our individual businesses will become.” - Katie Hunt “You got there for a reason on your own, so you should follow your gut and your intuition too.” - Kelly Shanahan  LINKS Website: https://theziran.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theziran/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theziran/  \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

It’s the draw of the creative process. We love to brainstorm, create and then create some more. And it keeps our businesses exciting and alive—for us and for our bank account. \xa0 Releasing new products is our ticket to business growth. It sets us apart from the competition and shows retailers that we\'re serious about our business and our product line. But it’s important to realize that timing is a major factor with new releases, particularly when you’re selling wholesale. \xa0 At Paper Camp, we talk a lot about scheduling and timing, but the three things we need to consider are: \xa0 - Timing - Frequency - Reorders \xa0 We dive into each of these during today\'s episode. \xa0 Don\'t forget to download our free workbook:\xa0 How To Build a Profitable Product Line or connect with us in our Friends of Proof to Product Facebook Group\xa0   \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

Thanks so much for listening. We\'ll be back next week with a new episode! | As entrepreneurs and product-based business owners, there comes a time for all of us when we have to make the decision to pivot. The pivot period can be a tough and turbulent time, but today on Proof to Product, my friend Kristin Kaplan is here to tell us how she managed to gracefully pivot away from her successful wedding planning business after 10 years to begin working as an integrator for online entrepreneurs. Kristin now creates strategic plans, action steps and manages profitable, sustainable businesses. She is also the host of the Planning for Profit Podcast, the creator of The Pricing Workbook and the founder of Plan to Profit, a monthly program to help visionary business owners reach their goals. On top of all that, Kristin also balances life as a wife, mother to three kiddos, organization addict, beauty & skincare lover, marathoner, and wine drinker (she needs at least one vice to manage all of the above). \xa0 On today’s episode, Kristin and I are talking about what it means to be an Integrator - what they do and how to know if you’re ready for one. We also talk about pivoting in business - the fears surrounding it but also how it shows growth as a CEO and money mindset, particularly how to positively frame your thoughts around money. If you’re looking for advice on how to manage it all, or how to make your pivot period easier, this episode is 100% for you!\xa0 \xa0 ON TODAY’S EPISODE:\xa0  Kristin’s entrepreneurial path\xa0 The difference between Project Managers and Integrators Why Integrators are often born out of Virtual Assistant roles\xa0 Her areas of expertise and how she helps clients\xa0 The importance of focusing on revenue-generating tasks Tips to improve your goal setting How to know if you’re ready for an Integrator The pricing range for hiring an Integrator Why it’s natural to pivot in your business\xa0 How little nudges can lead you in a whole new direction The exciting parts of closing one business to open another Strategies for resolving\xa0 your money hangups\xa0 Advice for first-time entrepreneurs\xa0 What’s up next for Kristin\xa0  KEY TAKE-AWAYS:\xa0\xa0 “My job is to come into someone\'s business, help plan out all the processes and systems and everything. My job is to make everything happen.” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “Money is just a tool. It\'s not the scary evil thing that we all have to be afraid of. It\'s okay to build a profitable business that makes you some.” \xa0- Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “My biggest strength is being able to take a really big goal or vision and then break it down into pieces so that it actually gets done.” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “It\'s so helpful to get an outside perspective on what your goals are, what your financial goals are, what you\'re trying to accomplish, what kind of impact do you want to make in your business.” - Katie Hunt “Sometimes as creatives, everyone wants to chase the new shiny object that\'s right in front of them.” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “I wish people would play a little more and set bigger and bigger goals because once you start setting huge goals, even if you don’t meet most of them, you play at a different level, take bigger risks and invest more.”\xa0 - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “It\'s super fun to do the vision board, but then, how exactly are you going to make that happen...like specifically?” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “A piece that a lot of creative entrepreneurs just struggle with is how\xa0 to create the stepping stones they need to get to the final product or end goal that they want.” - Katie Hunt “Once you hit that point of like, all right, I\'m looking to bring on my second or third team member, I’m ready to operate as the CEO, that\'s the time to think about hiring an integrator or project manager.”\xa0 - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “It is hard to stay in the exact same place for decades on end. It gets old for most of us. I feel like we\'re all in this natural journey.” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0 “It\'s natural to pivot. We have to continue to stay relevant in our businesses and that\'s what pivoting is. It\'s just continuing to evolve as a person, as a CEO, as an entrepreneur, and how we interact with our customers.” - Katie Hunt “Pivoting is evolving.” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0\xa0 “Just focus your attention on being positive, being grateful, feeling abundant, and try to move away from any feelings of negativity and scarcity.” - Kristin Kaplan\xa0\xa0 \xa0 LINKS Website: https://www.kristinkaplan.com/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kristinckaplan/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/kristinkaplanLLC/    \xa0 SUBSCRIBE To subscribe on iOS, go to the  iTunes page and subscribe to Proof to Product.

I love a good life story and Caroline\'s is so interesting!\xa0 \xa0I don\'t want to give away any more.\xa0 Let\'s get started.\xa0\xa0 | Kim Gordon is a designer, an artist, a businesswoman, and best of all, she\'s incredibly intuitive when it comes to creating dream homes.\xa0 Not the kinds of dream homes that are filled with expensive luxury items.\xa0 But the kinds that really fulfill us in an emotional, creative and even spiritual way.\xa0 Kim doesn\'t shy away from honoring the mystical.\xa0 And what I mean by that is she connects our deepest desires with our intentions for our homes, and then, sort of magically, other areas of our lives get better.\xa0 | When Karen Grant was co-hosting the podcast with me, we both fell in love with Erica Tanov and her book, Design By Nature:\xa0 Creating Layered, Lived In Spaces, Inspired By the Natural World.\xa0 I knew this episode was one that I\'d want to re-release and now is the perfect time because I\'m excited to say that Erica has generously given me copies of her book to give everyone who comes to the Glamping Design Camp in Tulsa this October.\xa0 Since that retreat is all about using nature as inspiration in our homes, I\'m using her book as a jumping off point for the entire premise of the retreat.\xa0 What I love about Erica is that she goes beyond just copying natural motifs in her designs.\xa0 While she does have some literal things like fern leaves in her wallpaper, she also looks to natural objects for abstract inspiration. Tree bark, seed pods, rippling water and even weeds are re-imagined as color palates, textures and patterns.\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re going to be working on during the Glamping Design Camp.\xa0 You can get the full picture of what to expect during the retreat weekend at littleyellowcouch.com.\xa0 It\'s truly going to be a spectacular weekend, with great conversation, individual attention to each of your homes, hands-on workshops, delicious food, and,of course, the opportunity to sleep in total luxury under the starts!\xa0 I hope you can join us!\xa0 In the mean time, you\'re going to be energized to start bringing nature into your home after spending a little time with Erica today!\xa0 So let\'s get started.\xa0\xa0 | This interview with Melinda McCoy of House 214 Design was originally aired in Oct of 2016.\xa0 What we so appreciated about Melinda was her understanding that just saying "your home should tell your story," isn\'t clear enough.\xa0 What does telling your story mean and how does that show up in your home and design choices.\xa0 Since then, Melinda has created a course and membership site that you should definitely check out.\xa0 But her core principles remain the same, making this interview just as helpful today as it was 3 years ago.\xa0\xa0 | This week I\'m sharing our interview with Maxwell Ryan, founder of Apartment Therapy and author of several books on home and design.\xa0 We recorded this interview in 2015 when he was on a tour for his most recent book, Apartment Therapy Complete and Happy Home.\xa0 Even though this was several years ago, it\'s still one of our best interviews ever and I think you\'re going to get a lot out of it.\xa0 In this re-release from our archives, Karen Grant is co-hosting with me and she just asked Maxwell to tell us about his overall approach to design and making a home.\xa0\xa0 | On this episode of On The Little Yellow Couch I talk about the power of connections. Not the networking kind. But the power of feeling truly connected. To each other. And to the deepest reserves of strength and optimism we all have somewhere inside us. To encourage you and I to have real conversations where you get to actually speak with me instead of just listening to me talk, I hope you’ll take me up on my offer of some free consultation this summer! I’ve had the absolute pleasure of meeting some of you in person at one of our Style Retreats. And even though not everyone can make it to these special weekends, we can at least talk via email. I encourage you to subscribe to the Little Yellow Couch newsletter and send me an email about a decor or design dilemma you’re facing. I’ll get back to you ASAP (hopefully within 24 hours!) and we can work it through together to a solution. I look forward to hearing from you! \xa0 | I am having two lovely friends back on the show with me today.\xa0 I call them "the Ashleys" for short because they are Ashely Daly and Ashley Palmer, co-owners of Retro Den Tulsa.\xa0 Today we talk about finding your true style by leaning in to who you are.\xa0 Let\'s get started.\xa0\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Style Matters is all about the substance behind developing a personal style in your home and surrounding yourself with beauty in a way that is meaningful.

Fred currently teaches architecture and urban design at Morgan State University's School of Architecture and Planning, and is the Principal and Co-Founder of The Working Group on Adaptive Systems. What brings him on today’s show is his just-released new book Space Settlements. The 400-page paperback contains a visually stunning collection of designs for space colonies from the mid-70’s, including iconic artwork and comparison studies of 20th and 21st century architecture projects. Our conversation talks about his research leading up to this book, the process of writing the book and the fascinating stories discovered along the way. | We have a very special July 4th episode for you today.\xa0 Today’s show offers a very American conversation with the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Paul Goldberger. The discussion was recorded live at\xa0Archinect Outpost\xa0last month for the launch of his latest book\xa0Ballpark.\xa0 Ballpark takes a deep dive into the history of the ballpark, and the impact it’s had on the evolution of the American city. The book looks at a selection of case studies to arrive at a simple yet compelling thesis: “In the ballpark,” Goldberger writes, “the two sides of the American character - the Jeffersonian impulse toward open space and rural expanse, and the Hamiltonian belief in the city and in industrial infrastructure - are joined, and cannot be torn apart. If you’re interested in a copy of the book, we have a few copies available at Archinect, both in our shop in downtown Los Angeles, and\xa0online at outpost.archinect.com.\xa0 Paul Goldberger began his career at The New York Times, where in 1984 his architecture criticism was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criticism, the highest award in journalism. From 1997 through 2011 he served as the Architecture Critic for The New Yorker, where he wrote the magazine’s celebrated “Sky Line” column. He is currently a contributing editor for Vanity fair and holds the Joseph Urban Chair in Design and Architecture at The New School in New York City.\xa0 | On this latest episode of the Archinect Sessions podcast we're joined by Jennifer Newsom and Tom Carruthers of the Minneapolis-based practice Dream the Combine. Jennifer and Tom are a husband and wife team that specialize in site-specific installations. Their work is deeply-collaborative, directly referenced in the name of their practice, and looks at the overlaps in art, architecture, and cultural theory, while manipulating the boundary between real and illusory space. | This week Ken and I are speaking with the leadership team responsible for the upcoming Brown University Performing Arts Center –\xa0Joshua Ramus\xa0of\xa0REX,\xa0Carl Giegold\xa0of\xa0Threshold Acoustics\xa0and\xa0David Rosenburg\xa0of\xa0Theatre Projects.\xa0 The Brown University Performing Arts Center is a formally stunning project designed by REX for the Brown University campus in the relatively small town of Providence, Rhode Island. The exterior of the almost 100,000 square foot building consists of a large monolithic mass clad in aluminum, with a cantilevered glass-encased 13-foot tall clearstory jutting out from the lobby level, covering a lower-level outdoor public space.\xa0 The interior of the Arts Center, however, is where the magic happens. To facilitate the university’s requirement to host performances for a variety of needs and audience sizes, REX and his team of theater and acoustics specialists designed a transformable concert hall that can accommodate five completely different configurations, from a small experimental sound cube for media performances, to a\xa0625-seat symphony orchestra hall. Our conversation starts with Joshua Ramus describing the conception of the project, starting with the client’s brief…\xa0 | This week Ken and I are joined by\xa0Alan Maskin, partner and co-owner of Seattle-based\xa0Olson Kundig. Alan shares his story growing up on the East Coast, working as an artist and arts educator before moving onto architecture school in his 30s. He tells us about how he finally landed a job at Olson Kundig after 4 failed job applications, and then strategically moved his way out of his initial role of IT manager. He provides insight into what it took to move up in the firm, eventually becoming a partner and co-owner, and what kind of qualities Olson Kundig looks for when hiring new talent that fits well with time-crafted firm culture. Of course, we also talk about his work, including the highly publicized\xa0renovation of Seattle’s iconic Space Needle, and some recent projects he has designed for children and families. We even get his thoughts on two topics weighing heavily in the news these days -\xa0unpaid internships\xa0and the\xa0restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral.\xa0\xa0 | On this episode of Archinect Sessions we're\xa0joined by\xa0Eva Hagberg, a\xa0NY-based writer\xa0and\xa0architectural consultant. Our conversation covers Eva’s architectural studies at\xa0Princeton\xa0and\xa0Berkeley, and how that transitioned into a successful writing career spanning\xa0architecture criticism\xa0to writing about her own life in her recently published memoir\xa0How to Be Loved. We also talk about the unique personality traits of architects and her approach to helping architects communicate. | On this week's episode of Archinect Sessions we talk with Carlo Aiello, a Mexican-born, LA-based designer and founder of\xa0eVolo . Most of our readers are familiar with eVolo's (very) popular annual skyscraper competition and related series of books. Carlo, the founder of eVolo, is also the designer of the award-winning\xa0Parabola Chair \xa0and the designer of the Kickstarter-success\xa0ESCALA , a 2-in-1 drawing tool combining the scale-ruler with an insertable fountain pen . In our conversation we track his progress from his studies at\xa0Columbia's GSAPP , to working for\xa0SOM \xa0and\xa0Asymptote , to embarking as a self-made entrepreneur with a move west, to LA.\xa0 | This week on Archinect Sessions we’re sharing our inspiring conversation with Theaster Gates. For those of you who aren’t already familiar with Theaster, you’re in for a treat. Theaster Gates often refers to himself as a potter, and while it’s true that he is, through years of training and practice, he’s also an extremely talented multidisciplinary artist, urban planner and community-focused social activist. Theaster may be most well known for his non-profit Rebuild Foundation. The foundation purchases abandoned buildings in the south side of Chicago, the neighborhood Theaster grew up and still resides in, and transforms them into beautiful community hubs that connect and inspire the local residents through art, creativity, and professional skill training. Gates work extends into academia as well. He is a full professor in the Department of Visual Arts at the University of Chicago, where he also the director of Arts and Public Life. It’s in this context that he is unveiling his latest project, part of an $80 million dollar renovation and restoration of the Edward Durell Stone-designed Keller Hall, home to the school’s Harris School of Public Policy. Theaster’s role involved designing a soaring communal atrium space, lined with wood from fallen ash trees, and milled by local residents. Our conversation with Theaster Gates starts with his reuse of Chicago’s diseased ash trees into millwork and detailing for the new University of Chicago Keller Center, and quickly veers into topics of hand skills, black labor, neighborhood communities, and socio-cultural readings of beauty.", 'chan_desc': 'A biweekly discussion of pressing architecture news and issues, hosted by Paul Petrunia, Donna Sink, and Ken Koense.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/6a/b5/3b/6ab53b95-9201-8a8d-7ab7-cd4a3e8c2944/mza_7520532090952149975.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2014-10-09'}}

In this week’s podcast for the first time in Heroine history my editor, Anne Hoffman, flips the tables and interviews me. It quickly gets raw and real as we dig deep. We talk about everything from loving rubrics in school to how I felt like I was wearing a costume when I worked an outwardly perfect cubicle job at a research organization in D.C. It was so much fun to walk through all the threads that led me to step into my creative purpose as a podcaster, writer, and women’s leadership coach. Highlighted ExcerptAnne: I think your story reflects this story that when you’re twenty or thirty you can’t really write anything because you haven’t lived enough and in your forties is when you write. I know you’re in your thirties but it’s like you did so much living and there’s a way in which, when it happening, you’re like “where is this going”. There are all these disparate experiences but look where it got you. It all sort of culminates in your book.Majo: Creativity is built from inputs. you’re literally taking all these threads from your life and mashing them together to create new things.

It’s about looking back …that’s how we live creative purpose, it’s not sitting around and waiting and feeling chronically “not ready yet”…it’s by active design and engagement, and that’s the creative process.\xa0\xa0You create your life as much as you create a poem, a short story, a film, a podcast episode… Anne: I think for me and for a lot of other women you are the example of having the confidence to synthesize your experience into art or something greater than the experiences. Discover your creative, feminine power with my free online quiz at http://majo.co | Discover your creative, feminine power with my free online quiz at http://majo.coHave you ever had the urge to follow the opposite of what you learned in school? That’s a theme for my guest Ann Shen – an illustrator and author of Bad Girls Throughout History and Legendary Ladies, books that depict women as they are: complex, funny, dark and everywhere in between. In fact, her book Bad Girls Throughout History  resonated so much that it has even been picked up by Universal Cable Productions to become a show.  A daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, Ann calls herself a reformed goody two shoes who creates art that empowers women to be their authentic badass selves. She combines incredible artistic talent with a high degree of business sense and shows us that choosing your own path does not have to mean depending on your parents, spouse, or whoever to survive. While her professors in art school pushed the students to all create very masculine, serious art, she went in the opposite direction – her own style that markets to women in a really fun, whimsical way, and of course in the time of Instagram, this style blew up. You can find her empowering, delightfully illustrated, books on Amazon and in stores like Target so definitely check them out after you hear her story. Also as a heads up, Ann and I met and recorded at the lovely all-female co-working space The Wing in Los Angeles so the audio is a little busy and echo-ey at times and I apologize in advance, but I have a feeling that you’ll be so engaged in our conversation, you will barely notice! Plus, y’all know me: progress over perfection. Highlighted ExcerptAnn: The art school I chose to go to was very militant and demanding. Majo: Okay so what were people telling you was the right kind of work and what did you discover?Ann: So in school, it was very trendy at the time to think about editorial illustration as the career, like the ultimate career. And you do like New York editorial illustration stuff that’s like in the New York Times, The New Yorker, like just very serious, beautiful. A lot of it is conceptual or just technically very, it just looks a certain way. And most of it was a very male-dominated view. Majo: Okay, and what did you discover was like what you really wanted to do and move into?Ann: That’s my favorite question because it wasn’t something that was really presented to me as an option and then I discovered this later was I just wanted to do stuff for women.  Stuff that I was interested in, stuff that was floral or decorative or representative. Like just having something that’s like “oh, this is just a beautiful painting”. It either had to be a beautiful fine art oil painting or it had to have like a really brilliant concept behind it for it to be considered “good” in school.  And then I left and I was like “Oh, it’s good enough for it just to be a beautiful thing that brings people joy”.

Heroine, before you go, I have a really important question for you: Do you want to look back on your life in 40 years from now and feel like you didn’t live up to your greatest, creative potential? I’m pretty sure the answer is no. Yet perhaps you know in your heart of hearts that you are currently holding back your voice and gifts, that you aren’t as expanded as you could be, and frankly you’re feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and confused. You’re certainly not alone.

I interviewed two guests: Adereni Fashokun - a Life Coach, Co-Founder and Sr. HR Business Partner at Amazon AND Lauren Harper - the Director of Marketing at Palm. The topic? Technology and mental wellness. Does that sound like a contradiction to you, heroine? Sometimes it does to me, too.Technology is increasingly a part of our lives. It can feel impossible to get away from it. A friend of mine once had her phone break down for an entire weekend. At first she was furious, and then fearful. But she and her husband had plans that weekend, and as she immersed herself in what they were doing, she forgot about her phone. She was able to lose herself in activities. To let go. It was a kind of mental recharge she didn’t know she needed. Once her phone was fixed, she reflected that she had felt better that weekend than she had in a long time.So how do we set limits with technology, so we too can experience this kind of mental recharge…. and still stay connected to the world? The guests on today’s show offer ideas you may have never thought about. I’ll share just one: turn off all of the alerts on your phone. All of them. No beep for a text. No on screen notification that you just got an email. My editor Anne is doing this now, and she says it’s made a huge difference in her ability to focus on what’s happening in the moment. Stay tuned as the Fall season will pick up in September. In the meantime, you can always connect with me on my website majo. Co (MAJO.CO) or on Instagram majo.heroine! | Earlier in this season we talked about fairy tales. Queens, specifically…. and waifs. The waif is a passive figure, like the stereotypical vision of Rapunzel. She sits, in a tower, waiting for someone to come and rescue her.

You can also stream it live from any browser on spreaker.com/heroine).As the writer and cultural critic Gloria Anzaldúa once said, “Nobody’s going to save you. No one’s going to cut you down, cut the thorns thick around you. No one’s going to storm the castle walls nor kiss awake your birth, climb down your hair, nor mount you onto the white steed. There is no one who will feed the yearning. Face it. You will have to do, do it yourself.”Some women seem to understand this inherently, and live their lives accordingly. Some of us struggle a bit more to accept this.American Photojournalist and New York Times Best Selling Author Lynsey Addario falls into that first camp. She’s a war photographer who works in conflict zones all over the world. Throughout her entire career, Lynsey has been willing to risk her life, her safety, and her creature comforts to pursue what makes her feel alive. She’s photographed women under the Taliban, documented misogyny in the Congo and been kidnapped in Libya. And she has also found love and become a mother. Lynsey’s story reminds me to choose to do what is meaningful …. To feed the yearning, as Gloria Anzaldúa says.Also, heroine, today’s episode wraps up the Spring season, though keep your ear open for a bonus episode or two dropping this summer. And don’t worry, we’ll pick back up in the Fall. Also, this episode happens to be the 100th episode of the podcast. Can you believe it?

Her clothes - and her signature style - soft, elegant, warm - are an entire way of life. But unlike many famous leaders, and especially many famous FASHION leaders, Eileen is not driven by ego. She is humble. Midwestern. The Devil Wears Prada...she is decidedly, NOT. Throughout our interview, I wondered, how can such a strong leader speak with such a down to earth realness? Perhaps it’s because Eileen is an example of how to succeed well. As her brand continues to grow, she continues to reinvent. Instead of defining her business by how much money it makes, her company’s new parameter of success…. is sustainability. Her new mantra is do the most good instead of make the most money.In a world where our political leaders deny climate change...and other painful truths such as a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body...all to hold on to power...I think we can all take something from Eileen’s example.Live your values, show up, try. And remember that integrity is the only real currency we have in this world.

Perhaps you find yourself becoming a bit blonder, a bit more stylish, and less, well, you -  to fit into his life. I think we’ve all done this to a certain extent. Changed ourselves to fit the needs of someone we wanted to fit with. (Quick note: This episode is from the archive and available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine or wherever you get your podcasts.  You can also stream it live from any browser on spreaker.com/heroine).But let’s say this all happens in the public eye. You and this man start a family. And after all this stretching and shifting, tragedy strikes. Nothing can insulate us from that. And then, he breaks up with you. And quickly takes up with someone new.That’s what happened to Justine Musk. She’s a writer, speaker and soul-blogger. She is also the ex-wife of tech billionaire and provocateur Elon Musk. When I interviewed Justine, I was reminded of why I do this podcast. Justine experienced something in the Heroine’s journey called the descent. In crude terms, Justine was kind of a starter wife. She herself has said this in an article she wrote for Marie Claire. But as we’ve seen with our examination of archetypes in fairy tales at the beginning of the season, this one is woefully inadequate. It’s an oversimplification as they do little to reveal the soul of the person. And the origins of Justine’s story don’t define her. It’s what she chose to do with her story...that does.And it’s the descent - the darkness in her life that revealed the light of who she is. Which I think...is the truth for all great heroines. As the Sufi mystic Rumi once said, be patient where you sit in the dark, the dawn is coming.

Honestly, I remember feeling so nervous, not so much during the conversation, but more so in sharing the interview, as it was the first show that launched the podcast. Today, my editor, Anne, recut this so it’s lively, fresh and even more revelatory. (Quick note: This episode is from the archive and available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine or wherever you get your podcasts.  You can also stream it live from any browser on spreaker.com/heroine). Give yourself a second to really think about the fact that Roz rows across oceans alone. She sits in a small boat, day after day, with little besides the cold waves for company and the sea mist hitting her face. This is a woman who is comfortable with solitude….and freedom.But when Roz started rowing, she was, in her words, “just a management consultant” from the UK.  So...how did she get to that wide, open ocean? What drives someone to leave everything they’ve known for so long to achieve a distant goal? In a way, that’s really the central question of this podcast. How do we stop being good girls and start being the heroines we’re meant to be? How do we write our own stories, create our own myths? How do we activate our own potential - even when it goes against all of our social conditioning?Roz ended up leaving her ordinary life because she sat down one day and wrote herself two obituaries. It sounds morbid, but for Roz it was clarifying. In one version, she had lived life as a business woman, in control and with fancy clothes. In the other, well, I won’t give too much away. Let’s just say, in the other obituary, her clothes didn’t matter. References:Roz Savage’s book, "Rowing the Atlantic: Lessons Learned on the Open Ocean."

This episode is available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine (or wherever you get your podcasts).  You can also stream it live from any browser here. Let’s bring back Kate Forsyth – an incredible novelist and fairy tale connoisseur – from the last episode. Kate argues the motifs we believe are passive in the tale, or that look passive at first glance, really aren’t. Here’s our convo.Majo: Yeah, I mean on the one hand her hair is kind of passive because it\'s dropping off the side of the building and it\'s being climbed on or it\'s being used but on the other hand –Kate: See I don\'t think that is a symbol of passivity, her own hair is the only form of ingress to her, it\'s the only way that people can reach her in her isolated state and in the end try and think of it more her hair is actually a symbol of her own strength that is being used against her. And once she\'s freed from that that is when she comes into her true power. It\'s not necessarily a symbol of passivity, in fact Rapunzel is not a passive figure, she sings with all of her strength and that draws the prince to her, she allows herself, she takes control of her life even though she is trapped against her will in this confined space. It\'s a misunderstanding of the fairy tale to use her as an example of female passivity.Majo: Yeah, that\'s really helpful, I love what you wrote, "Rapunzel\'s no passive maiden awaiting rescue. She was an active agent in events, an empowering figure. Though later versions increasingly drain the tale of it\'s subversive power."Kate: I mean that is exactly right, so the earliest versions are when she\'s at her most active. So what happened? Turns out the Grimm brothers, who were telling these tales in a very religious society, received a ton of backlash for the Rapunzel story. The story of lovers having sex in a tower was too racy (especially for children), so they stripped away the eroticism, darkness, and violence out of the original story. As Kate shares, The Grimm\'s were trying to make their stories more suitable for children but Rapunzel was never meant for children, it was always meant for young women on the verge of their own sexual lives. Because the truth is Rapunzel was proactive, clever, and resourceful. She was not waiting around. In one older version of the tale by Italian folk collector Giambattista Basile, Rapunzel is even more fierce, as she finds three acorns from the witch she then uses against her. Each acorn becomes an animal ally of sorts – first a dog, then a lion, and finally a wolf that devours and kills the witch. I was super into this version, and was going to go with it and be like, “See Rapunzel’s a warrior!” until I met Kate, who brought way more refinement to the conversation. Kate was attracted to the version written by 18th Century French, female writer Charlotte Rose De La Force. Because in that version, it is Rapunzel who heals the prince with her tears. The more I reflect on both versions, I do love what De La Force did to the tale...Rapunzel’s tears are not a sign of weakness, but of power. This got me thinking about something a friend once told me, “healing doesn’t happen through force, or action, it happens through relaxation, opening…release.” Tears are a form of release, sacred tears are the release that, like the rain, allow for new growth to happen. For centuries, we’ve been shamed for having tears, for being emotional, we’re called hysterical, when our feelings are a source of our intelligence as women, and I think that’s what Rapunzel is truly all about. Feelings, sadness, grief, and tears, allow us to release and move on, allow us and others to heal. Tears are a sign of compassion. In fairy tales, we’re so used to good versus evil, but Rapunzel not only heals the Prince, but she redeems the witch. Rapunzel moves the witch to remorse for what she’s done, essentially saving the old, magical woman in the process. In other words, it isn’t about dominance and winning, but about harmony. I don’t know about you, but I can feel my entire body go into a deep sigh of relief when I hear that one.I’m only scratching the surface of our conversation in this post, as you’ll need to listen to the episode ( ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine and here)  to get the full picture of Kate’s work and the real depth of this tale and heroine. So now it’s your turn: What tears are you holding back, when, and with whom?  Who do you need to have a good cry with? And who do you need to nurture and forgive? Big questions, and I don’t have the answers for you, but that’s the power in the waif archetype, that’s what lies truly underneath her, and that is maybe even how we change the world. Thanks for tuning in, this has been a really amazing series for me, and I enjoyed every second of this experiment of examining fairy tales. To be honest, it has rejuvenated my love for this podcast and strengthened my conviction in the power of stories and female-drive narratives with heroines at the center, battling their inner and outer shadows. Alright, heroine, til next time!xxMajoP.S. As a reminder, next episodes, we’re going to be going back into the archive while throwing a fresh perspective on each interview, with a new setup and new cut, so you can really let their stories sink in, in relationship to the work we’ve explored with fairy tales and myths.

Today’s episode is available when you subscribe to the podcast on ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine (or wherever you get your podcasts).  You can also stream it live from any browser here. Some of you may be wondering why I’m focusing on fairy tales, when most of us haven’t thought about them since we were children. What do they have to do with you now? To help me answer this question, I invited Australian author Kate Forsyth onto the show. Kate has retold many fairy tales through her novels, including Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Rapunzel. I asked Kate if she thinks that reading fairy tales as little girls actually affects us as adult women. Kate says that yes, fairy tales help prepare us for what’s to come:I mean in a way the witches and the dragons and the ogres, these are metaphors that allow us to examine things like fear of abandonment, fear of not being loved, fear of failure, fear of death, fear of harm. And because they\'re generally told in a safe place in a circle of light around a fire, in the comfort of a mothers lap, while tucked up in bed, because the person listening to the story is safe, it enables them to for a while in their imagination do battle with these witches and these monsters and triumph over them. Now we know, neurologically speaking, that anything that we experience in our imagination acts in the brain as if it has actually happened. So when we feel that thrill of triumph at having outwitted the witch well our brain processes it as if we had actually done it.So these stories help us learn emotional resilience and intelligence, and if we were fed wonky stories, or if we didn’t fully integrate them as little girls, that will affect how we live and lead down the road.  A few years ago, Kate completed her PhD on reimagining the Rapunzel archetype, which is why I specifically reached out to her. I thought she could better help me understand this maiden in the tower. In this episode, we go over the Rapunzel tale together, which is super important because some of you may remember it differently (I was shocked by the ending, which I had no memory of whatsoever). In her more reduced interpretation (as a trope for female passivity), Rapunzel represents this idea of feeling trapped, which is symbolized by the tower in the  tale, as Kate shares:I mean fairy tales work at this kind of metaphorical or archetypal level and it\'s a rare human that does not find themselves trapped and disempowered by their circumstances in some way. And so in Rapunzel the tower stands in for anything that is tying back the human spirit, it might be fear, it might be an unhappy relationship, it might be ones own parents, it might be the school that you are forced to go to against your will, it might be a job that is making you deeply unhappy. It\'s a metaphorical tower and so for that reason it is the most memorable motif in the fairy tale.So what’s your tower right now? It could be internal or external. That’s my question to you. Or let me put it this way: what is the story you’re telling yourself, about how you’re trapped, and you have no choice to be doing this or that. Remember, an uncomfortable situation and relationship can be bizarrely comfortable because it’s familiar, so we forget amidst that cozy comfort, that we still have choice. Every day, every second, we are making choices. The first step to getting out of your tower is taking back your agency by seeing that you have choice. Rapunzel made choices. She was far more proactive than we think. I’m only scratching the surface of our conversation in this post, as you’ll need to listen to the episode ( ApplePodcasts.com/Heroine and here)  to get the full picture of Kate’s work and the real depth of this tale and heroine. xxMajoP.S. In the next episode, we’re going to explore the possibility and power of healing and redemption in Rapunzel (seeing her beyond her usual interpretation, and what we can learn from her). It’s super fascinating, so stay tuned for Part II coming out next week!

I\'m Dawan Stanford, your host. Today I\'ll be giving you a brief introduction to design thinking. It starts with a story about Doug Deitz. In 2012, Doug was a principal designer at GE Healthcare. Doug designed a new MRI machine. One day, observing the new model in action at a hospital, Doug encountered a distraught child who had to undergo an MRI. He found out that over 80% of children had to be sedated to receive an MRI. Since he designed the original MRI machine, he felt responsible for this and wanted to remedy this issue for children. So, he spoke with teachers and other professionals who interact with children on a day-to-day basis, asking them how he could make their experience in an MRI machine less traumatic. As a result of those conversations, Doug and his team found a way to modify\xa0 an MRI machine for children. They added stickers to the floor with water and rock on them. Covered the MRI with stickers that looked like wood planks and sails. Now, instead of a scary piece of hospital equipment, the MRI looked a lot like a pirate ship.. They even created a storybook that accompanied the themed MRI. Parents could read to their child the pirate ship adventure story ahead of their child’s scheduled appointment. These changes resulted in a decrease in the need for sedation from 80% to 27%. Today, we explore how seeing the problem is an integral part of design thinking, and we’ll break down design thinking into process, methods, and mindset. The process is your step by step "rough" guide. With the methods, we have a bit more cohesion; design methods help us explore problems in specific ways, and guide us to ask questions in new ways in order to discover the right problems to solve. The mindset is something you have to practice your way into, in order to learn how to change your mindset. At its most basic, design thinking is the discipline of finding human problems worth solving, and creating viable new options in response. In many ways, it\'s the discipline of helping people ask the right questions at the right time. This episode also offers a definition design thinking that replaces creativity myths with truths about discipline and action. I break down the design process into Seeing, Solving, and Acting, and talk about why we should think about design from the perspective of the people we serve. \xa0 In This Episode [01:26] Doug’s background in MRI science and his experience with a child getting an MRI. [03:04] Over 80% of children need to be sedated to have an MRI or a CAT scan. [06:15] Design thinking can be broken down into process, methods and mindset.[07:07] What has design thinking given students, and how design thinking can shape curriculum and projects inside the classroom. [08:02] The definition of design thinking. [09:57] Creating viable new offerings and what is defined as “new”? [12:11] Breaking down the design process into its three main components: seeing, solving and acting. [15:09] Responses generated from a fixed mindset in opposition to the responses from a growth mindset. [16:51] Everything is a prototype and designers are open to questioning how things work. [20:17] What Doug was Seeing as he redesigned the children’s MRI experience.

I\'m Dawan Stanford, your host. Today I\'m interviewing Danielle Lake. She is the Director of Design Thinking and Associate Professor at Elon University. As a feminist pragmatist, her scholarship explores the connections and tensions between wicked problems and the movement towards public engagement within higher education. Her current projects focus on exploring the long-term impact of collaborative, place- and project-based learning, design thinking practices, and pedagogies of resilience. Lake is co-editor of the book series, Higher Education and Civic Democratic Engagement: Exploring Impact, with Peter Lang Publishing. \xa0 Danielle started her journey by designing her own major; she called "designing life" her philosophy, relating to who we are and what we want to do. In her Ph.D. program, she uncovered "The Field of Wicked Problems," while working with her Ph.D. advisors Kyle White and Paul Thompson, looking at large-scale systemic crises needing a different approach. She had learned from many experts before discovering design thinking, and she asked herself how she could take her teaching, research, and service, and weave them together. \xa0 Today, we explore how design thinking has played out in Danielle\'s teaching, such as redesigning student outcomes so that a final product is a practical solution to a current issue. This way of teaching has flipped the classroom for Danielle, and she talks about how this methodology on student learning has been very impactful in her classrooms. Project-based, relational, and on-going learning experiences are critical ingredients for long-term learning. Early on, she faced some challenges: opening up to students, starting small, and finding ways to invite other experts in and allow them to lead with their expertise. Danielle is looking to continue to design courses to give students the time to delve into the work they value. \xa0 We\'ll also dig into the relationship between design and philosophy, and how they work together to give us a place to start in learning about our environment, being collaborative, and solving societal issues. Danielle also talks about what she hopes to accomplish in her professional relationships moving forward, and we’ll hear a little about Dawan\'s own journey in discovering design thinking and the creation of Fluid Hive and The Education Design Lab. Dawan also talks about how he was introduced to Elon by Design, and his process of discovering design thinking was part of the Elon culture, and the importance of having the space to learn with others who are practicing design thinking.

Dustin is a designer and researcher who works to integrate the study and application of behavioral science and human-centered design to develop digital interventions that change real-world behaviors. In 2009, he founded the Behavior Change Design practice at Mad*Pow, where he and his team have designed effective interventions for improving health, financial well-being, and life-long learning. \xa0 When he’s not working on client challenges and creating new real-world interventions, Dustin teaches “Design for Behavior Change and Social Impact” at the Rhode Island School of Design. He also collaborates on grant work with colleagues from University College London’s Centre for Behaviour Change and other academic affiliations. \xa0 Today, we travel down the path that Dustin took to get to where he is today. From his work at Botticelli Interactive, through the advertising world, and then back home to design, Dustin chats about his need to impact society in a meaningful way, and why behavior change design has resonated the most with him. \xa0 Dustin shares information on how he and his team approach their design projects and the methods they use to quantify and qualify third-party research. He also delves into their use of the COM-B model in creating, applying, and implementing their designs. They even use this framework when explaining the product to their clients! \xa0 Dustin shares several fantastic resources that he has written and used to inspire his design mind. He also provides some insights on how gamification in behavioral design has been used inappropriately and how it could be better. \xa0 Learn More About Today’s Guest \xa0 Dustin on LinkedIn Dustin on Twitter: @DU5TB1N Mad*Pow \xa0 In This Episode \xa0 [01:28] Welcome to the show Dustin DiTommaso!

I’m Dawan Stanford, your host. Today I’m interviewing Alix Gerber. She’s currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Washington University in St. Louis, and has been developing and teaching courses there, such as Radical Design, where undergraduate students imagine alternatives to civic experiences like policing, capitalism, or voting. During our conversation, we talk about speculative design, designing for justice in Ferguson, Missouri, teaching radical design, and how her practice and teaching have influenced her as a design researcher. Alix is a design researcher who works with people to visualize and enact the futures we imagine, provoking discussion around how our society could be more equitable and meaningful. Alix has worked with residents of Harlem, New York, and Ferguson, Missouri, to explore alternatives to our current policing and court systems by making artifacts from divergent futures. She grew up in a family of designers; both of her parents as well as her brother have all chosen careers in design. She enjoys learning from her students when teaching her Designing Creativity: Innovation Across Disciplines class at Washington University. Alix is always learning and restructuring her teaching method to create a better learning experience for the students in her class, and working to design real life experiences for her students to learn from at the university. Today, we explore Alix’s design career path from her start while attending Cornell University, and then following her design experience and growth through several different design types and projects during the last eight years of her career. Alix explains the different types of design she has used, when each type of design worked well in a project, and how the design tools she uses are applied in design thinking. We’ll also dig into her teaching assignment, where Alix instructs undergraduate students on social design issues, and on understanding the impacts of different design perspectives on society.

He leads and advises teams on digital innovation projects in complex environments, such as local authorities and healthcare organizations, as well as commercial enterprises. Boris collaborates closely with clients in all stages of the innovation process, from initial customer research and co-design workshops through to developing a live service. He works best in an agile environment, where iterative improvements and open communication help guide the team towards a shared goal. Boris has been working in the public sector for the last few years; his current focus is on creating better public services outcomes and using service design and design thinking to deliver solutions to social problems. Today we explore Boris’s path from his career start in visual design, which led him into web design and from there, finding his way to service design. Boris explains his perspective on service design, and what types of models and prototypes he uses when he is designing. He also talks about how companies can take a look at a series of changes to understand how their products have an impact on the public sector, and how companies can connect their work to specific outcomes to be more confident in their product output. From his beginnings in a small startup in technology to his current position as a service designer, Boris talks about his experiences with service design, from client engagement to the characteristics he believes the ideal project advocate should have. We’ll also dig into his project, Prototyping for Impact, which offers a toolkit that anyone involved in innovation - in both the public and private sectors - can use to guide their innovation process. Boris tells us more about the project’s purpose and what he hopes the project will accomplish.

I’m Dawan Stanford, your host. Today I’m interviewing Chris McCarthy. He is the Vice President of Strategy & Design at Hopelab where he is excited to deepen its impact on the health and wellness of young people through design and systems thinking. He is also the Executive Director and Founder of the Innovation Learning Network. Today we explore the different pathways of healthcare and the effect of design thinking on the healthcare industry, the beginnings of design thinking in the healthcare industry and why design thinking is so challenging to implement in the field of healthcare. One of the most important factors for Chris was to not put the Innovation and Design team out front first. Putting the Innovation and design team out first “triggers the immune system of the organization” as the team is so different from the other sections of the company. He explains why he had the innovation and design team behind the scenes when working with staff members. Chris and I talk about the subtle dance of support and help, along with people being able to tell their story with their voice for the staff to have a say and a stake in the process of development in the design innovation realm. We’ll also dig into his projet, Hopelab which is a social innovation lab focused on designing science-based technologies to improve the health and well-being of teens and young adults.

I’m Dawan Stanford, your host. David Dunne, Professor and Director of MBA Programs at the University of Victoria’s Gustavson School of Business, joins me today. David and I were introduced by  Paolo Korre, who you may remember from an earlier episode of the show! We’ll chat today about a range of subjects, including the use of design thinking in redesigning an MBA program. As you’ll learn today, David’s background in experience and marketing helped to lead him to design thinking. When he returned to school intending to become a professor, he found himself deeply interested in student-centered methods of teaching. He worked in design on the side, taking sabbaticals to spend time with designers and in design schools. Design thinking is a practitioner’s art, and it takes experience with it to really make the methods your own. This applies both to my own journey and David’s, and we’ll explore the concept today in our conversation. We’ll also talk about the struggle to help students to make methods their own, rather than only learning the methods. David and I talk about helping people to achieve the ability to think about how they’re thinking. He recommends meditation as a powerful tool to reach this space of metacognition, and suggests the book  Why Buddhism Is True. David also teaches students about cognitive biases and runs exercises to help them discover which biases are most prevalent in their teams. We’ll also dig into his book, and what designers or people on design pathways can learn from it. He’ll explain the three tensions that he sees in a design thinking process: inclusion, disruption, and perspective. We’ll also hear about the four models for how designers can respond to these tensions.

Architects design, create, delegate, follow a special calling, but they’re not often seen as “working for a living”, and they’re certainly not much like the workers who actually construct or extract the resources for the buildings they design. And yet, architectural work in the twenty first century has become ever more precarious. As with other white collar workers, architects are becoming increasingly accustomed to short-term contracts, overtime without pay and other traditional hallmarks of exploited labour.\xa0In light of this new reality, for this episode we’ll be talking to architectural workers from the UK, the USA, and Brazil, about the role a labour union could play in the contemporary architectural profession. We’ll discuss the difficulties, limits and challenges of organizing architectural workers and speculate as to why architects have, until recently, been relatively absent from the history of the labour movement. We’ll also consider how unionisation could give ordinary architectural workers greater control over the buildings and spaces they design as well as over the wider spatial production sector.Keefer Dunn is an architect based in Chicago and a national organiser for the Architecture LobbyFernanda Simon Cardoso is an architect based in São Paulo and a former Director for the FNA (Federação Nacional dos Arquitetos e Urbanistas)Sam and Alex are architectural workers based in the UK and organisers for Workers Inquiry: ArchitectureThis episode was directed by Charlie Clemoes/Jake Soule/The Failed Architecture Team | Mecca is the holiest city in the Islamic religion and the birthplace of the prophet Mohamed. Located just off Saudi Arabia’s western coast, all Muslims are required to visit at least once in their life if they are physically able to. With air travel becoming easier, the number of pilgrims has been rising rapidly over the last few decades, with a record number of 3 million people visiting Mecca simultaneously during the 2012 Hajj. More recently, visa regulations have been made more strict to keep the situation under control.In this episode, we discuss with various experts how this rising number of pilgrims is fueling a radical makeover of the city. While Mecca has always been changing and under construction, the current developments are of an unprecedented scale. What does Mecca’s radical makeover look like? Who is profiting from these developments and what does it mean for the city’s spiritual character? What does the current building craze mean for older buildings, and what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in the city’s informal settlements?Amna Solati is an architect and urban researcher based in London, until recently working with Rotterdam’s Het Nieuwe InstituutHussam Dakkak is an architectural designer and one of the founders of the Architectural Association’s Visiting School to MeccaThis episode was directed by René Boer/The Failed Architecture Team | Contemporary urban discourse relies overwhelmingly on visual representation. While it may be more effective both in conveying the actual appearance of a particular urban space and in communicating the intentions of the architect and the planner, this kind of representation leaves little room for individual interpretation and cannot possibly capture the full range of feelings and emotions that people attach to particular places. For this, we must also turn to the more immediate sensations of touch, smell, taste and sound. This episode explores the last of these sensations, considering what it means to represent cities and architecture through sound.Unlike the visual, sound cannot be so easily contained, it flows freely, stimulating memories, helping to create a collective urban experience and bridging gaps across space and time. As such, recording and discussing the built environment through the medium of sound offers a vital means through which to challenge the dominant ways in which architecture and cities are represented.The main part of this episode comprises a conversation between hosts Mark, Rene and Charlie, unpacking the work involved in producing a podcast about architecture and discussing what it means to represent architecture through sound and how music, in particular, can convey certain urban moods. But in the breaks, we will also introduce a series of other sounds found on Aporee, an online map tool on which people can post geo-located sounds.\xa0NotesTrack listing (in order of appearance):Streets of Rage 2 Soundtrack, Go StraightBurial, Night BusMelania de Biasio, Blackened Citiesmahrajan hutat miniy, halbasat haysat alsuwisi, 100 nuskhatan(مهرجان حتة مني – حلبسة هيصة السويسي – ١٠٠ نسخة)\xa0Transcript of Tsan-Cheng Wu explaining the Taiwan Sound Map project:You can call me Tsan-Cheng. In Taiwan maybe some people would call me a sound artist, in visual art. I have been producing this Taiwan Sound Map project\xa0for seven years. I will do this project for ten years, so it will end in 2021.The choice of my recording is very random. I record as many ambient sounds as possible. I just see the map and say ok today it’s here, I do not have any goals, any view, just walking in this place, and then maybe I want to turn right or turn left, just recording.If I’m in a park, I can hear the birds, bird song, most of the recorders, they just want the bird song, but I will record the birds and where, in this park, they have a big wall and they have noise, like the traffic noise, I record at the same time and I will keep the traffic sound because the noise is very important for this bird song. When I record many many parks in the city, I think we can find why the people like this park or why people do not like that park. So with this field recording, I think the data is a different kind of way to think about the city.In Taiwan we have many traditional markets. Most of the markets will be outdoors, and the vendors will be chatting and it’s very noisy, but in this space in Taiwan it’s very, very exciting, you can go around, you can choose, you can chat, it’s very very interesting, but the new markets in the city maybe it’s just a big building, the market will be boring, yeah so, when I record the market, the new market or the old market, I want people to think about which market you want to go to.This episode was directed by Charlie Clemoes / the Failed Architecture team. | Albert Speer is one of the most infamous architects in history. During his time working for the Nazi Party he was responsible for designing the Reich Chancellery and the Zeppelinfeld Stadium in which the Nuremberg rallies took place, as well as being in charge of Germany’s war production during the Second World War and having responsibility for the plan to reconstruct Berlin as Germania. Yet by emphasising his detachment from the general conditions in which he was working, he was able to avoid the death sentence after the war.While his is an extreme example, it offers a compelling jumping off point to explore the wider issue of an architect’s responsibility for the wider system that they work in. Moving from mid-20th Century Germany to the present day, this episode explores the specific role certain architects have played in developing the stadiums and infrastructure for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.Here, gross violations of human rights and international labour law throw up serious questions about the moral ramifications of designing projects in such a country. How can architects balance the benefit of bringing a smooth, shiny new project against the human cost required to produce it?— Thomas Rogers works as a freelance journalist, editor and translator in Berlin, often for SPIEGEL International.— Nicholas McGeehan is a Gulf researcher who has worked at Human Rights Watch as the Bahrain, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates researcher and at Mafiwasta, an organisation for workers’ rights in the United Arab Emirates, where he was also director.This episode was directed by Charlie Clemoes / the Failed Architecture team | Italy’s landscape is dotted with unfinished structures. For a myriad of reasons, the construction of these buildings and pieces of infrastructure stopped half-way, leaving the often concrete and often striking remains of hitherto incomplete plans. The ‘Incompiuto Siciliano’ (Unfinished Sicilian) project has been mapping and researching these many structures, on Sicily as well as in the rest of the country. And, to draw attention to the phenomenon, started to refer to them as “Italy’s Most Prominent Architectural Style”.In this episode, we join Incompiuto on a trip to one of the largest unfinished objects, ‘La Diga di Blufi’, 130km south of Palermo. Construction of this impressive water engineering project, which was supposed to supply southern Sicily with drinking water, was abruptly halted in the 1990s and has since become a 260-hectare contemporary ruin. Together with architects and artists involved in the project, we discuss the many implications of the ‘Incompiuti’, from their poetic qualities to the planning failures, from ruin porn to the need for spiritual structures, all the while contemplating architecture’s illusion of completion.Veronica Caprino is an architect based in Milan and part of Fosbury ArchitectureAndrea Masu is an artist, currently based in Palermo.

During the recent peak in the number of refugees, the French and British authorities increasingly fortified this border landscape, forcing those on the move to build increasingly permanent shelters for themselves. As this self-built city, also sometimes referred to as ‘the jungle’, continued to grow the response of the authorities became increasingly violent. Now, the self-built city has been demolished and its inhabitants displaced.The media hype following these events prompted a large number of aid workers, activists, volunteers, but also architects to make their way to Calais. For this episode, we talk to a few of them to find out what in particular triggered them to go, what they encountered and what they did. How should architects relate to these large, self-built areas? Is it possible to make a positive contribution in such a complex environment? Should ‘architecture’ be the focus of these violent border systems? And is there a need to document or archive such self-built cities?– Grainne Hassett is a Dublin-based architect, who initiated various construction projects in Calais as well as worked on an extensive documentation project.– Léopold Lambert is based in Paris, where he is the founder and editor-in-chief of The Funambulist, a magazine that continues to critically reflect on complex spatial-political situations such as Calais.– Merve Bedir is an architect, now based in Hong Kong, and has over the last few years been involved in different locations on the ‘migrant trail’ between Syria and Calais.\xa0References (in order of appearance):40:15 IKEA refugee tent48:18 Sam Jacob’s replica refugee shelter, exhibited at the V&A and Venice Architecture Biennale52:30 Gran Horizonte, Urban Think Tank’s prize-winning exhibition on Torre David at the Venice Architecture BiennaleThis episode was directed by René Boer / the Failed Architecture team | In this episode, we use the work of London-based rapper Gaika to explore the subject of London, talking to both Gaika and Ash Sarkar, a senior editor at Novara Media who has previously collaborated with Gaika, about the city’s near future and its recent past.Gaika’s work covers a lot of themes, but his “Security” and “Spectacular Empire” projects are among the most incisive articulations of the mood that has pervaded London in the past decade. Produced in 2016 and 2017 respectively, these two projects cover a diverse array of themes: ranging from race, the built environment and the housing market, to technology, space, and security… all the while employing the time-honoured medium of speculative fiction to diagnose the present historical moment.Casting a long shadow over this subject, as well as Gaika’s own work, the 2011 London Riots occupy a significant part of the initial discussion. Both Ash and Gaika speculate on the conditions which caused the riots and consider their implications for the future of the city, as well as society more generally.From there, we move on to discuss London’s relative stability and the value of insurrectionary moments to a progressive urban politics, along the way making references to, among other things, defensible space, One Hyde Park, gnostic fantasies, that Redrow advert, and the ironic lightness of a possible communism that is not definable in any way.References (in order of appearance):7.31GAIKA – PMVD (feat.

Can we really blame the architecture for what went wrong? How can an entire neighbourhood, where thousands of people continue to live their lives on a daily basis, be simply dismissed as a grand failure? In recent years, however, there has been a slow but steady reappreciation of Modernist architecture taking place, but rather for its aesthetics than its social ideals.While architecture from that era is still being demolished at a large scale, this renewed interest is Modernist architecture has also allowed investors to renovate entire blocks of it, and sell the individual apartments for lucrative prices. One of the last remaining Bijlmer flats, Kleiburg, went through a similar process, which was later even given the Mies van der Rohe Award and other major architecture prizes. For this episode, we revisit Kleiburg with Fenna Haakma Wagenaar, an architect who grew up in the flat, and discuss the simultaneous disregard and reappreciation of Modernist housing estates with critical expert Owen Hatherley.– Fenna Haakma Wagenaar is an architect and currently design lead at the Municipality of Amsterdam. She grew up in Kleiburg.– Owen Hatherley is an architectural historian and author of such books as Militant Modernism, A New Kind of Bleak and The Ministry of Nostalgia.– SBMG (Sawtu Boys Money Gang) consists of rappers Chivv and Henkie T; their music video Oeh Na Na features in the episode and was largely shot in and around Kleiburg (full video below).This episode is directed by René Boer / the Failed Architecture team.. | Video games have changed the way we interact with space. From their very inception, these increasingly complex virtual worlds have been forcing new perspectives and new ways of interacting with the world beyond. Once they were able to represent cities, their role in shaping our everyday urban experience became even more acute, thrusting players into environments that they would otherwise have never come close to and exposing them to representations of urban life which will have had countless effects on the way players experienced cities in real life.But while it’s long been accepted that film, music and other established forms of culture have been instrumental in crafting people’s perception of city life, the role of video games has hitherto been rather neglected. This, despite the fact that the industry is in many countries bigger than film and music combined. If we do not accept the wide-ranging and increasingly significant role that video games have in shaping the way people interact with city space, then we leave it open to conservative or reactionary portrayals of city life and space more generally.The initial inspiration for this episode came from one such reactionary portrayal: the crime-ridden inner city of Streets of Rage. Considering the way this game helped shape a specific neoliberal policy narrative emerging in the late 1980s, the episode questions how and in what ways games can do the opposite: expanding, rather than narrowing our perceptions of city life.– Oli Mould is Lecturer in Human Geography at Royal Holloway, he blogs at Tacity– Rosa Carbo-Mascarell is a game designer and co-founder of Games for the Many– Darran Anderson is a writer and author of Imaginary Cities and the forthcoming Tidewrack– Hannah Nicklin is a writer, narrative designer and game designer with a PhD in games influenced theatre and theatre influenced gamesThis episode is directed by Charlie Clemoes / The Failed Architecture Team', 'chan_desc': 'Failed Architecture is a podcast on architecture and the real world.

Dyson creates visual and material systems that explore relationships between bodily movement and architecture, with an emphasis on the ways that black and brown bodies perceive and negotiate space.

Annabelle Selldorf is founder and principal of Selldorf Architects, a New York City-based firm that is currently working on several expansions to existing cultural institutions, including the Frick Collection in New York City and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. They discuss designing for existing spaces and explore the connections between art and architecture.“When I think about space and art, I think about the person who is viewing it. Ultimately, I think there isn\'t such a thing as a neutral space. It is your own experience, evaluation, or judgment that contributes to the analysis of what works.” – Annabelle Selldorf | Daniel Bernal, a dual degree student in the MARCH and MSRED programs, speaks with Nina Baier-Bischofberger and Florian Baier in advance of their lecture at the school on April 8, 2019. The pair founded their firm Baier Bischofberger Architects in 2005 after meeting as students at Columbia GSAPP. They discuss the studio’s work and creative process, and reflect on their experiences at GSAPP and the realities of architectural practice which they encountered post graduation.“When I graduated, I went to visit a friend who was working at NASA. They said NASA actually quite liked hiring people with architecture degrees because they could look at lots of different things at the same time and understand the bigger picture... I think architectural education allows for so many new possibilities.” - Nina Baier-Bischofberger | CCCP student Paula Vilaplana speaks with Ana Paula Ruiz Galindo and Mecky Reuss, co-founders of Mexico City-based firm Pedro y Juana, following their lecture at the school on February 11, 2019. The duo is also teaching advanced studio VI at GSAPP during the Spring 2019 semester. Their work explores the capacity of objects to change their environment through typological transgressions, the indiscriminate use of material, texture, color, placement, or form. Recently, their installation Hórama Rama won the 2019 MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program.“We like to think that objects also have agency within their environments. How you place the object, or the amount of permission you give the user to change or fix it, actually creates different actions...We\'re very much interested in seeing what happens within spaces more than holding on to an idea of how they should be used.” - Ana Paula Ruiz Galindo | MARCH student Tim Battelino speaks with Anthony Acciavatti following the 5th Annual Detlef Mertins Lecture on the Histories of Modernity at the school on March 25, 2019. Anthony Acciavatti is a GSAPP faculty member, historian, cartographer, architect, and author of the award-winning book, Ganges Water Machine: Designing New India’s Ancient River, the first environmental and urban history of the world’s most densely populated river basin. "I\'m trying to make almost a graphic biography of these [Ganges River Basin] regions and areas by pairing image and word… I’m always trying to couple what I see with ways to describe and narrate the work that I do, both empirically but also theoretically. Ganges Water Machine in that way was very much an experiment in how to narrate such a vast territory.” - Anthony Acciavatti | MSCCCP (M.S. Critical, Curatorial & Conceptual Practices) student Amelyn Ng speaks with Adrian Lahoud, Dean of the School of Architecture at the Royal College of Art London. He is also the inaugural curator of the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, the first major platform for architecture and urbanism in the Middle East, North and East Africa, and South and Southeast Asia, which will be held in November 2019. During the conversation they discuss curation in architecture, the upcoming Triennial, and the thinking behind its theme, “Rights of Future Generations.”“The entire aim of the Triennial is to say that climate change is the colonization of a single perspective on what it means to relate to other beings, and that perspective is an extractive one. So the question is how do you decolonize that extractive perspective, how might you allow other kinds of modes of existence to reverberate and to register? I think ultimately if climate change is about anything, it\'s really about that.” – Adrian Lahoud | UP students Laura Postarini and Tyrene Calvesbert speak with Ananya Roy, Professor of Urban Planning, Social Welfare and Geography and inaugural Director of the Institute on Inequality and Democracy at UCLA Luskin, in advance of her lecture at the school on February 25, 2019. They discuss Ananya Roy’s current research around metropolitan segregation and racial banishment in Los Angeles, and decolonization of the urban planning discipline in the United States.“What might decolonial logics look like? In urban planning, it starts with thinking about the role of our discipline and profession in this colonial violence…I want to know what reparations urban planning is going to make for the tremendous colonial harm that we have inflicted. I want to know how our instruments of planning are deeply colonial or imperial, or rooted in the extermination of indigenous people in this country. What then do we do with those instruments?

Physical models have a bigger impact on the space when people can interact with them, but digital models are a more powerful tool for the act of creating architecture. | Taking the architectural registration exam is a crucial step in the process of becoming an architect. The test is long, difficult, and stressful, but it is an absolute necessity if you want to be an architect. | Your college architecture projects will be silly because they are designed to make you think outside what you already know. They are also supposed to force you to evaluate your own belief system, your own understanding of how spaces work, and the things that shape\xa0your\xa0ideas. | Do Architects have obsessive personalities? I tend to think so, and only partially based on my own behavior. I should throw out the caveat that I don’t think you should have to explain why you obsess over something. Isn’t that the nature of any obsession – that there is some level of irrationality associated behind it? Of course, people seem to typically feel that their logic is flawless and that they are completely justified in their behavior and if you can’t see the wisdom in their position, the fault lies with you. | Is It the dream of every architect to start their own architecture firm? Most architects think about it at one point or another and Austin Architect Michael Hsu sits down to talk about how he started his own firm. | If I have one regret during my college education is that I never worked on a construction site. Once I graduated from college, I went straight to work in an architectural office, drawing up all sorts of stuff that I had literally never seen before in my life. I managed to get along but I was acutely aware of my lack of practical knowledge and I have been trying to make up for it over the last 20+ years.[Note: If you are reading this via email, click here\xa0to access the on-site audio player]\xa0      googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-1562005974350-0\'); });  We\'d like to thank today\'s guest, Nicholas Renard, the owner, architect and registered residential contractor of Dig-Architecture, an architect-led design-build firm in Jacksonville, Florida. We recorded today\'s episode live in Las Vegas from the Expo floor of the 2019 AIA Conference on Architecture as special guests of Huber Engineered Woods.\xa0a small portion of Bob\'s tool collectionMy practical experience, and I suppose formal construction education, really didn’t start until I bought my first house and didn’t have the money to pay someone else to do the work. My wife had a job that required an extensive amount of traveling and since I am not a “go out to the bar” kind of dude (despite what others might think) I would stay home in the evenings and work on projects around the house. It was during this time that I started building up my tool collection. Did either of you work construction when you were in architecture school?\xa0[2:30 mark]Both Bob and Nick worked on projects with their father around the house and this gave them their initial exposure to the basics of the construction process. They spent time either watching or helping their fathers around the house as they took on projects of various scales. But of the three, Andrew is the only one who has ever actually worked in the construction industry during their architectural education. \xa0Andrew worked in construction during the summers as a high school student. Then, while in grad school, he worked in a cabinetry shop construction custom cabinetry in a small shop in Oregon. Apparently, the common thread among the three of us is having built a deck in our backyards at some point in our lives.How do you think working in construction would benefit an architect? [10:17 mark]The translation from the drawing environment to the built environment typically takes time for a new professional in architecture. The knowledge of the process of construction, the tolerances involved, the order of operations and other physical activities all have an impact on the design and final product. So being able to understand all of these aspects of the downstream portions of your design is very beneficial and can impact your ability as a designer to impact the final result, the budget, and the overall process. Being able to understand and apply this to your projects is a valuable skill for any architect.Understanding the differences between the exactness of the drawing environment versus the built environment. \xa0[14:30 mark]The system of education tends to push you as an architecture student to strive for perfection in your processes. This seems to translate over into your career and the way you design or draw digitally. The reality of the construction site is that there is not a possibility for perfection. Part of being on a construction site allows you to understand the tolerances of this process. Every part of the assemblies on a job site has built-in tolerances. And as they are assembled, those tolerances compound and create project dimensions that cannot be held to the digital perfection. Understanding this concept and how it affects your design is something that takes time as a young professional. One of the benefits of being on construction sites early in your education or career is that it reduces this time frame and allows you to grasp that concept quicker, | In order for social media to have an impact, you first have to decide on what you want to achieve and from there, you actually have to put yourself out there as an individual because social media only functions when you are social - which means there has to be a 1st person narrative. I should point out that this doesn\'t necessarily mean talking about yourself, it means talking about things from your perspective. | How much time have you spent thinking about the legal side of architecture? \xa0If you are like most architects, you probably haven\'t spent enough time thinking about it. While it may not be the sexiest part of the architectural profession,\xa0 it is something that every licensed architect must consider on every single project. | “Your first architectural job is important.” I’m not talking about summer jobs or internships … those don’t really count because they have a known shelf-life associated with them. I’m talking about the first job a person takes once they’ve graduated from college – the job that signals the beginning of their professional career. | Today we are talking about Architectural Bucket lists. Everyone knows what a bucket list is – things you want to do or achieve in your life. For an architect, this could be visiting Therme Vals in Switzerland by Peter Zumthor, or if this was prior to 1969, maybe it would be smoking cigars with Mies van der Rohe.[Note: If you are reading this via email, you will have to click here\xa0to access the on-site audio player]\xa0Items that an architect would put on their Architectural Bucket list could cover a lot of ground, but that’s what we are going to be talking about today. Preparing for this show was actually agony for me because I tend to not identify with favorites. There is an ebb and flow to my interests and while I might really like something today, chances are better than good that I will replace this current object of my fascination with something else before too long.Never the less, let\'s see where our current interest lies as of today.PersonWho would you like to have as an ideal "Architect" buddy for your life/practice? I would assume that this would be a famous architect but it doesn’t have to be. But let’s put the caveat on here that they have to be living?Photo of Renzo Piano Photo: Eric Feferberg/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\xa0 Photo of the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre Photo: Sergio Grazia/ADCK/Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre/RPBWAndrewI chose Renzo Piano. While there may be a language issue, as pointed out by Bob, I went a more professional route and chose him based on my appreciation for his work and the impact his friendship might have on my own work. So for this one, it would be a true "architecture buddy". I think Renzo is thoughtful in his work and he has a fantastic sense of detail and creativity. He has long been an architect that I admire, so therefore I would want him for my practice side of life.\xa0 As noted in our conversations, I chose a different direction of thought than Borson on this one.Photo of Tom Kundig: Juliana Sohn for The Wall Street Journal.Photo of the Delta Shelter: Tim Bies/Olson Kundig Architects.BobThis was a tough one for me because most of the architects who I admire are probably too mature to actually enjoy spending time with me. Answering this question came down to narrowing a few perceived character traits. Do they like to party? Could we talk about something other than architecture? And for what traits have I selected them? Design? Technical prowess? Business acumen? Originality in their thinking? How about all of these items? For that reason, I went with Tom Kundig. On one hand, this seems like it would be a popular choice, the non-architect’s choice, but I chose Tom because I like the technical nature in which he designs appeals to my own process. I would live in every house he has ever designed, he looks like he enjoys what he does and despite the ability to change the scale of the projects he tackles he has continued to accept and design single-family residential works.I almost went with Omar Ghandi but he seems either so cool as to appear disinterested in everything or maybe he’s mean. Every project of his I love but whenever I see pictures of him, he seems too intense to be my friend ... but maybe I\'m wrong about that.PlaceThis would be a location you would like to visit. It could be a broad point and/or a very specific one … I’m not even sure that it has to be “architectural”.A riverside view in Bavaria, Bamberg, Germanyphoto credit FOROLIA/APAndrewI chose a region of a country for this one. Bavaria Germany was my choice as a "place". I have never been to this area so it holds a romantic mystique for me. I feel drawn by my ideas of the mixture of landscape, history, architecture, food, and drink. I believe I would enjoy this area for all of those reasons and more. While I am a "modernist" at heart, the idea of traveling through medieval towns and visiting castles while enjoying great food and beer sounds like the best experience imaginable.', 'chan_desc': "A gifted storyteller communicating the role and value of architecture to a new audience, host Bob Borson uses the experiences acquired over a 25-year career to inform his podcast.

But first, what’s happening on the homefront? It’s summertime, which means swimming and camp for the kids (carpentry camp, to be exact, how cool is that?!). The girls are currently working away on crafting some birdhouses for the yard.\xa03:50 - This week’s Newlywed Game question is: what is the other person’s least favorite thing about summer? Tasha thinks Joe dislikes mowing the grass all the time at the beginning of summer, but Joe actually enjoys taking care of his lawn. Instead, Joe’s least favorite thing about summer is the heat, especially when tackling projects. Joe guesses that Tasha’s least favorite thing is also the heat (and humidity), which she wholeheartedly agrees with.8:40 - Before we get started, make sure you’re subscribed to Colorful Conversations wherever you get your podcasts, and please leave us a review! If we read your review or comment on an episode, we’ll send you some free swag. This week’s review is from Elizabeth, who enjoys the laughter, home improvement tips, and the dynamic viewpoints from Tasha, Joe, and Thea. Thanks so much for listening, Elizabeth!\xa0(If you hear your review or comment on the show, but don’t hear from us, it might be because we don’t have your contact info! In this case, please email us at podcast@colorfulconversations.com).10:30 - Tasha offers some opening comments on kid-friendly home decor. Many people seem to think that style and kid-friendly are mutually exclusive and you can’t have both. Because of this, so many people wait for their kids to get older to decorate their house. Please, don’t wait to decorate and enjoy your home! There are also huge benefits to teaching kids to respect their home (yes, it’s their home too) by not coloring on walls or cleaning up after themselves.16:42 - Here are some great, practical tips for how to have a kid-friendly home that still suits your style. Tip #1 (this may be Tasha’s biggest tip) is stylish storage. You gotta hide the ugly! Kids toys and playthings aren’t the most aesthetically pleasing, so cleverly storing it and keeping it organized can help balance having an intentional style while also making it a happy home for your kids. Store kids items in beautiful wicker baskets, a functional dresser with drawers, or an upholstered bench that gives a more grown-up and organized feeling.\xa024:27 - On to Tip #2: Once you’ve hidden the ugly (and if you’ve already done this, you’re winning), be smart and intentional about the fabrics that you choose for your space. There are so many fabric choices to suit all types of styles while also being super durable and easy to clean. For example, Tasha and Joe have vinyl barstools, but the fabric looks like a lovely cream leather. Microfiber, twill, even denim and velvet are great, versatile, and durable fabrics that can really bring out your style! Check out our own distressed velvet sofa, which was recommended for people with kids.34:05 - Before we move on to Tip #3, let’s first hear from this week’s sponsor! Today’s episode is brought to you by Designer in a Binder. Now, you can order a physical copy of Designer in a Binder, shipped straight to your door! This is not just a book, it’s really a shortcut - it’s a system to teach you how to think and design your home like an interior designer, but you get to do it yourself! Because you are creating your own interior design plan, it’s way more customized to your style and what you really love (and it costs less than a one-hour consultation with a licensed interior designer). To order your copy of Designer in a Binder, just visit designerinabinder.com.35:45 - Now for Tip #3, which is that you just have to carve out some space for your kids’ stuff, which can be accomplished even in the smallest of homes. If you’ve got a lot of space, maybe the kiddos can have a dedicated playroom. As Tasha and Joe’s girls have gotten older, they moved out of their playroom (now Tasha’s office) and have claimed a part of the family room for themselves. Organizational furniture pieces like IKEA’s Trofast storage series can help create a great, organized place for children within shared living spaces. Designated spaces make everybody’s life easier!49:03 - Tip #4 is about area rugs. Tasha feels that every room should have an area rug because it’s such an effective way to bring color, texture, and patterns into a room. These days, you can find great rugs that aren’t crazy expensive, but also think about indoor/outdoor rugs. These things are UH-MAZING. Indoor/outdoor rugs are super durable and easy to clean, so they are perfect for kids to play on, spill things, and get dirty. You can also try FLOR carpet tiles, which are adhesive, square tiles of carpet that can easily be replaced if they get stained, but also allow you to get creative with different patterns, colors, and layouts. Ruggable is another great option that offers affordable, machine-washable area rugs. Let us know if you’ve tried FLOR or Ruggable and what you think of them!54:07 - Moving on to Tip #5 is all about establishing basic house rules, which is especially important with kids. Kids are capable of a lot more than we think they are - don’t assume they’re going to ruin or break everything - but you still have to let them know what the expectations are (like, the paper is for drawing on, walls are not).\xa055:37 - Tip #6, which may be Joe’s favorite, is to purge the unused kids\' stuff regularly and make sure that your kiddos are involved in that process. Involve them in the decision making of choosing what to get rid of, especially with things that aren’t as age-appropriate anymore. A useful tool is a one-in-one-out rule - kids should understand that when they want a new toy, an old one should go to make space for it. (P.S. This rule also applies to adults! A cluttered room will never be a beautiful room.)1:02:00 - We’re going to close out with some listener questions and comments. First, from Instagram, “I have a 3 year old boy and twin girls who will be 1 next month. I can’t quite merge their toys because of choking hazard issues, so what is the best way to organize their toys separately?” Tasha’s tip is to take advantage of the height and gender difference in your children. Store your boy’s toys higher up than the girls’ toys, and use different colored storage to show them which toys are for who. If your son has some smaller toys that could end up in a baby’s mouth, find some stackable storage bins with lids! Tasha and Joe have a couple storage bins with hinged lids that the 3-year old can access but would still protect your younger daughters.1.7.18 - Remember to subscribe to Colorful Conversations wherever you get your podcasts and email us with questions and comments at podcast@kaleidoscopeliving.com.

Joe and Tasha are going to share the lessons they learned and answer questions from social media.0:58 - Before we get started, let’s get an update from the homefront. It’s pool and swim practice season, but Tasha’s also getting the kids to exercise their creative side with an online Watercolor for Kids class by fellow blogger Emily of Jones Design Company!5:07 - It’s time for Thea’s favorite game, the test of how well Tasha and Joe know each other! Thea’s question for today is: What was your biggest compromise in the kitchen? Tasha guesses that Joe compromised on the overall amount of stuff in the space - if it were up to him, she thinks there would be more empty, clear space (and he agrees). Joe thinks that Tasha’s biggest compromise was that they didn’t open up the wall to the living room. However, Tasha feels her big compromise actually was not tiling the entire wall - that was a hard vision to let go of!9:25 - You know this is no ordinary, regular podcast.

(Keep listening to hear a sneak peak of what this sweet swag is!)13:05 - Today, we’re diving into the questions, challenges, and lessons of the Big Agruso Kitchen Reno. The first lesson is: be prepared, have a plan, and be organized at the beginning! Joe and Tasha had a great contractor with specialized knowledge of kitchens and bathrooms, and he really helped them create a solid plan to move forward with.\xa015:00 - Tasha and Joe had to live with and use their kitchen for over 6 years before the reno, which really helped inform them of the changes they wanted and needed to make. The lesson learned is: the longer you have to actually live in and use a space, and understand how your family uses it, the easier it is to plan for big changes that work best for you long-term.16:45 - Joe wants to change his answer to the NewlyWed Game! He thinks his biggest compromise was actually deciding to use a contractor for the renovation from the very beginning of the project.\xa020:55 - The next lesson learned along the way is to pay attention, which sounds super obvious, but when life gets busy and the room reno gets underway, it gets harder to remember to check-in daily and get progress updates. Tasha remembers the can-light situation, where a plan had been laid out for where the lights would go, but they were actually installed in the wrong place. It wasn’t a big deal to move them because they checked and caught it early!24:50 - Lesson #3: Never underestimate the power of the hunt! And by hunt, we mean the hunt for knowledge and research to make informed decisions. This is crucial in catching small details, like where a microwave door hinges and how that will impact the space where it is positioned. Do your research and you’ll find options that work for you (and always check out IKEA)!29 03 - One thing that Tasha and Joe have questioned is if they wish they had done an appliance garage to hide some of the kitchen gadgets? While an appliance garage is great at clearing some counter space, it can sometimes be a functional hinderance.\xa031:30 - Other mistakes can come with the stressful situation of appliance shopping. Tasha and Joe made the decision to stick with the same brand for their kitchen appliances to ensure consistency in quality and appearance - this works great for the kitchen and the overall look! However, while loading up the brand new fridge with food, Tasha noticed there was no meat & cheese drawer… something they didn’t even consider while shopping. Small details are still important when you’re making big decisions.36:35 - Joe talks about the dishwasher - their old dishwasher had a utensil basket right at the front, where they could just slip in their dirty utensils. Now, the new dishwasher (and most new dishwashers, it seems) have these utensil baskets on the side. Not a major issue, but another one of those weird inconveniences you don’t think about while shopping.37:30 - Sponsor break! Today’s episode is brought to you by Article. If you’ve seen pictures of our kitchen on the blog, you’ll know that one of our favorite things about it is the colorful seating nook we created - it’s perfect for us to have some time to connect over coffee or wine!

Check out all they have to offer at kaleidoscopeliving.com/article.40:50 - It’s time for listener and reader questions! The first question is “Why did you get rid of the eat-in area in the kitchen?” Joe explains that there were just way too many sitting areas in the space, and Tasha points out that they now have four seats at the island, as well as open access to the dining room. The eat-in area just wasn’t necessary anymore!43:27 - Next question is “What is your favorite thing about the kitchen remodel?” Tasha says her favorite thing is the tile, which is surprising because she didn’t expect to love it so much! It was a bit of a struggle to make a decision about the tile and she didn’t feel super excited about it, but once it was installed, it felt like a big win! For Joe, his favorite thing is opening up the kitchen and dining room because they actually use the entire kitchen-seating-dining space. Additionally, Joe loves the garbage disposal (importantly, a batch-feeder disposal) from Build.com! It was a little bit of a mistake-turned-ideal purchase, and the way it works is super safe and efficient.49:00 - Next question: “How long did the renovation take?” It was a really quick renovation, only taking about 5 ½ weeks! The contractor wrapped up the build at that point, leaving Tasha and Joe to add some finishing touches to the floor, adding the quarter-round, the vent hood, and putting up some shelving.49:30 - “What DIY projects did you tackle?” The backsplash, the flooring (in the kitchen, dining room, and foyer), open shelving, and the custom vent hood were all done by Tasha and Joe!50:35 - Another interesting question is “Are you glad you didn’t use IKEA cabinets?” This, as Tasha says, is the great debate. The cabinets they chose to go with are very high quality, made with solid wood and dovetail joints, and just felt like the right choice for the renovation. However, IKEA cabinets are still a good go-to choice, have a great aesthetic and function, and Tasha and Joe do still have them in another spot in the house.53:55 - Some people want to know “What is the best thing about working with a contractor?” The greatest thing was being able to come home and, instead of putting in a couple of hours of reno work, just seeing the progress made every day. Things were also able to move a lot faster because the contractor and his staff dedicated full days to getting things done. Tasha feels especially lucky that she didn’t have to deal with the permits and licenses to green light the construction! Another perk is having access to sub-contractors who could come and address challenges quickly.56:52 - Last question! “What are your money-saving tips?” For Tasha, the best tip that comes to mind is really to hunt for the things you want. The most expensive things will be the easiest to find, but you can take your time to explore options to find something both beautiful and affordable. It took a long hunt for Tasha to find the kitchen backsplash tile, but it was so worth it! Also, don’t think you’re stuck with having only one or two options (like with a left-hinged microwave) - what you want is out there, you may just have to dig for it! Joe says they saved money by listening to their contractor and learning from his expertise. His honesty and transparency helped Tasha and Joe make solid decisions without breaking the bank.\xa058:37 - Make sure to like and subscribe to Colorful Conversations wherever you get your podcasts.

Joe and Tasha are tackling yard work in the crazy North Carolina heat - mowing the lawn, putting pine straw out, and having some sprinkler fun with the kids! Remember to check out Rachio, the smart wifi sprinkler system that Joe and Tasha use.\xa05:00 - Sidebar: Game of Thrones is over! Joe may have fallen asleep during the episode… What did you think of the ending?\xa06:33 - Back to business - it’s Joe and Tasha’s 17th wedding anniversary this week! That means we definitely have to play How-Well-Do-Tasha-and-Joe-Know-Each-Other (a.k.a. the “oldywed” game, according to Thea). This week’s question is what is the other person’s favorite thing to splurge on? Joe guesses that Tasha’s favorite splurge is on their vacations, while Tasha thinks Joe’s (rare) splurges may be more practical, like a new trash can or a couple more dollars in the retirement account.\xa011:52 - You know that this is no ordinary podcast.

Affordable interior design is 100% possible with some creative ideas. Some of the “roadside rescue” furniture pieces are Tasha and Joe’s favorites in their home.\xa018:25 - It’s tough love time. If you don’t love your home and you’re blaming it on a lack of budget, you may not be trying hard enough! Re-evaluate where you’re spending your money, see where you can save some pennies, and make conscious choices if you’re serious about making decorating a priority.\xa021:57 - Let’s take a quick break to hear from our sponsor! Today’s episode is brought to you by Designer In A Binder, a comprehensive, step-by-step workbook and e-book that teaches you how to design spaces with the intention to create a home that you love! The physical copy of Designer In A Binder includes a custom three-ring binder, custom tabbed pages and worksheets to design six different spaces in your house. To purchase Designer in a Binder, visit www.designerinabinder.com.\xa024:10 - It’s tip time! Tasha and Joe share their favorite, practical tips for affordable home decor and interior design. Joe’s first tip is a great one for listeners who love a $0 price tag; it’s to declutter and clean up your house! You can clean and freshen your home, simplify your possessions, and even sell what you no longer need or want!\xa026:37 - Tip #2 is you can do it yourself, which is literally how Joe and Tasha’s home reno adventures got started! Joe’s frugality paired with Tasha’s design desires pushed them to start DIY-ing to achieve a beautiful space on a thrifty budget. The internet and websites like Pinterest are great for finding DIY projects, but there are so many basic DIY projects to try out (like painting) if you’re just getting started.29:27 - Tasha and Joe have done a lot of the legwork already. Check out the links below for more insight and research on paint, find inventive ways to fill up empty wall space, and work your way up to bigger projects like the DIY Plank Wall!31:04 - Tip #3: Customize things yourself! Many of the things we see and covet on Pinterest and Instagram are custom items with hefty price tags. While custom home decor can be a worthwhile investment, it doesn’t mean you can’t get a custom look on a budget too. IKEA hacks were invented just for this - check out 10 of our favorite IKEA hacks, and then go see 10 more amazing custom hack ideas!35:00 - Tip #4 is all about creating a focal point (yes, on a budget!) A focal point really helps to ground a room and make it more inviting. Most people think of art pieces being a focal point (which can be pricey), but let us introduce you to the magic of digital art prints. Etsy.com is a great place to find affordable and unique digital artwork that you can download and get printed at an office supply store, or Tasha’s go-to website, printful.com. Don’t want to spend money on frames? Try hanging with some chic gold binder clips or fun washi tape!39:12 - Looking for some digital art to get started? Kaleidoscope Living email subscribers get free access to Tasha’s library of downloadable prints! Text “ARTLIBRARY” to 44222 and we’ll email you the link and password to access the free print library.\xa041:04 - The main takeaway? You can have a beautiful house on any budget!

But first, updates from the home front! The kitchen renovation is still underway with the contractors, but Tasha and Joe are getting ready for their DIY piece of the project. Tasha is going to be working on tiling the kitchen backsplash and they both will be installing the new floors themselves.2:30 - It’s time for the newlywed game for Thea and Tasha! Today’s question is what do I love least about my house? Tasha guesses that Thea’s least favorite thing about her house is that she has one bathroom, and there are several things about that one bathroom that Thea doesn’t like. Thea agrees, but adds that she thinks her house is haunted and that is what she was thinking of! Thea guesses that Tasha’s least-lovable feature is her master bathroom, which she describes as “the most 80s explosion of tile you’ve ever seen.”7:40 - This is not your ordinary podcast because we announce our upcoming topics so you can submit your questions for us to answer!

If we pick your question, we’ll send you a sweet free gift!11:00 - So, why do we believe it matters so much to truly love your home? Home is where we start and end our crazy busy days and home is usually a place where you spend a lot of time. You don’t need to have a magazine-style, perfect home to be happy, but your home should be a place that you love, that you’re proud of, and is beautiful to you.13:00 - Studies done by environmental psychologists recognize that for most people, their home is part of their self-definition - it helps define who you are! You’re in a relationship with your home, so you need to do a little work to make sure it’s a good relationship.14.20 - Click here for Designer in a Binder\xa016:35 - We have conscious and sometimes subconscious reactions to our space, and finding frustration in your home, whether it’s ugly tile or just untidiness, can cause unnecessary stress and negativity in our lives. Conversely, creating a space that you feel relaxed and happy in, those positive emotions affect the rest of our lives too.19:27 - Tasha feels strongly that when you really love your home, it gives you the energy to take care of your space. You may be tired, but you have more motivation to clear the dishes out of the sink or make your bed when those spaces make you feel joy. Remember, “home is a feeling, not a place.”25:50 - What Tasha and Joe are going through right now with the stress of their kitchen renovation is a perfect example of how loving your home matters for your mental health. Tasha even got a comment on Instagram from a woman who had gone through chemotherapy and a kitchen reno… guess which she claimed was harder?\xa029:15 - Tasha encourages people not to feel selfish or guilty for wanting to create a home that they really love, which she herself has experienced. When we feel at our best and feel good about our home base, we can do more for everyone else and help be a part of the solution for our larger world problems.\xa0Join the ConversationOur favorite part of recording a live podcast each week is participating in the great conversations that happen on our social media and in our comments section.

Interview with Richard Weller, the Martin and Margy Meyerson Chair of Urbanism and Professor and Chair of Landscape Architecture at PennDesign.\xa0He teaches in three subject areas: advanced design studios at all scales, urban design history and theory, and historical and contemporary ideas of Nature. \xa0 | What is the psychological process whereby one person inspires and influences another? In this interview, Dr. Raymond Richard Neutra traces the forty-year relationship between his parents and the great architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Cheap and Thin: Neutra and Wright, Kindle available at Amazon.\xa0 The author\'s father, the pioneer modern architect Richard Neutra, immigrated to the United States in the early 1920\'s with the dual motivation of working for his idol Frank Lloyd Wright and for exploring the American industrial potential for economical and light weight housing, schools, medical facilities and other "architecture of social concern." Wright\'s early cordiality changed when he characterized those projects as "Cheap and Thin."\xa0Although meant as an insult, the characterization revealed a recognition of the different direction that Richard Neutra\'s goals had given to the basic strategies that Wright had developed twenty years earlier: Neutra wanted to develop an economic and light way to deploy technology and nature for a happy and healthy life. The relationship between\xa0Wright and Neutra recounts family memories of visits between them. It then explores the substantial influence of Wright on Neutra and how Neutra adapted, adopted and added strategies and design features to gradually develop what was to become mid-century "California Modern." Cheap and Thin: Neutra and Wright, Kindle available at Amazon.\xa0 \xa0 | Change has arrived and it\'s time that the art world increases its influence, inspiration, and power. We’re entering a very interesting time in the arts, when increasing numbers of artists will use their talents to push back against a growing climate of racism, inequality, and social conservatism. As Ted Wells says:\xa0"Jump off the BLANDwagon."\xa0 Dark times can make life beautiful.\xa0With the arts, our lives can be\xa0transitional during a time\xa0full of powerful artistic commentary and vivid artistic and social expression.\xa0 Some artists protest the present while shaping and reinventing the future; others artists help us escape our current reality or remind us that beauty and novelty still exist in the world, regardless of how bad we’re currently feeling about it. During the 1960s, artists created work that protested injustice and inspired the counterculture to battle the conservative backlash. And others made art that was so beautiful that it soothed shattered nerves and lifted average people out of the shadows. That was what the world needed then, and it’s what the world needs now. And I feel that’s exactly what is coming in the next few years. The creation of art, by any of us, can be a way of expressing our feelings within a realm of freedom that we might not be experiencing in our job, or among our community, or within our family. In some ways, it can a be way of emerging some part of our soul that would otherwise be trapped because of the way artistic expression can be squelched by society.

The designer of Richard Halliburton\'s house (1938) in Laguna Beach, William Alexander Levy, would never again produce such an exceptional building nor work for such an eccentric client. He met Paul Mooney in 1930 and the two men became lovers. By that time, Mooney had a prolific professional and personal relationship as editor and ghostwriter to Richard Halliburton, the world-traveling adventurer, who at the time was as famous as Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart. Alexander was only 27 years old when he received the commission for the Halliburton\'s house. Alexander drew upon European contemporary architecture and created flat-roofed boxes of concrete and glass in a clear expression of the International Style of modernism. He hoped to create a house that soared like the modern spirit of Halliburton. Mies van der Rohe\'s work and his experimental concrete buildings of the 1920s, along with Le Corbusier\'s L\'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1924-25) and his famous Villa Savoye (1928-29) would influence Alexander. In 1936, the first major and well-publicized concrete dams, Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam were built, securing concrete as a practical and modern material in the United States. Frank Lloyd Wright, Alexander\'s teacher, had used concrete at the Larkin Building (1904) and Unity Temple (1905-07), but Wright most exploited its structural characteristics in the cantilevered concrete decks at Fallingwater (1936-37). At the Halliburton House, simple rectangular boxes of reinforced, poured-in-place concrete define the house. The boxes\' two open sides facing the ocean and the canyon are filled with thin steel frames of industrial windows. Cantilevered concrete stairs wrap the exterior\'s southwest corner to the entry door. The interior contains a gallery, the living and dining rooms, a small kitchen, two bathrooms and three bedrooms one each for Halliburton, Mooney, and Alexander. The roof is a deck with unobstructed views in all directions. Mooney named it Hangover House because of the dramatic setting overlooking the canyon. The words are impressed into the concrete retaining wall near the entry. The three men were aware of the obvious pun. Later, Alexander assisted Arnold Schoenberg, the composer, with the redesign of Schoenberg\'s Brentwood studio. Alexander befriended Ayn Rand, and provided quotes for her book, The Fountainhead (1943). Some of Rand\'s descriptions in the book of the Heller House are thinly disguised references to the Halliburton House. Alexander continued to practice architecture and interior design and by 1950 had moved permanently to West Hollywood. He died in 1997. For more information see the book, Horizon Chasers: The Lives and Adventures of Richard Halliburton and Paul Mooney, by Gerry Max.

For Harwell Hamilton Harris, a California architect in the 1930s and 40s, the photographer who helped make Harris’s buildings famous was one of the 20th century’s most celebrated Surrealists--Man Ray. Man Ray embraced the new ideas of art and culture, he was one of the leading spirits of DADA and Surrealism and the only American artist to play a prominent role in the launching of these two influential movements. He had never photographed architecture when Harris commissioned him to photograph three of Harris\' most interesting houses. Man Ray’s architectural photos were unlike anything Harris had ever seen--and Man Ray never photographed architecture again. We, who are interested in architecture and art, are the better for Man Ray’s short, but memorable side trip into architecture, when two great artists--one a mild-mannered modernist, and one a Dada Surrealist--met on sunny hillsides in Los Angeles and Berkeley and created works of art, in architecture and photography. For more information about Man Ray and his art, read Ingrid Schaffner\'s book, The Essential Man Ray (2003,The Wonderland Press, Harry. N. Abrams, publishers).

Many architects would answer, "Yes." Rather than see architecture as an aspiration of the best of what life can be, many see architecture as reflective of the worst of what life is. If architects do not think that buildings affect society and can contribute to the happiness and well-being of those who use the buildings, then architects devalue their profession and are saying that their work has no importance. Yet if architects admit that their work can affect society and make a difference in a users life, and yet architects insist on designing buildings that are confrontational and conflicted, then architects are knowingly contributing to the decay and dysfunction of society.In a world where we are constantly told how bad things are, architecture can give us hope about how things could be better. That’s an ancient idea whose time has come again. The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton is published by Pantheon. www.randomhouse.com/pantheon/ And visit www.tedwells.com. | Two men, both architects --  one, Antonin Raymond was a Czech who came to America and worked for Frank Lloyd Wright and would become the father of Japanese modernism; and the other, a talented American of Japanese descent from Spokane, Washington, George Nakashima. These men\'s paths would dramatically cross a few times during their lives, and each time, their lives were changed. Design in America, Japan, India and the world, is better because of it. This is their story. At the Graham Foundation in Chicago until May 25, 2006, visit the exhibition about Antonin Raymond and George Nakashima\'s ashram dormitory building, Golconde: The Introduction of Modernism in India (www.grahamfoundation.org). The Sri Aurobindo Ashram allowed scholars access to the library and archives and all images and drawings were catalogued wih the Ashram\'s permission. The research team for Golconde comprised of Pankaj Vir Gupta, AIA and Christine Mueller, partners in the firm of vir.mueller architects (www.virmueller.com).Mira Nakashima\'s book, "Nature Form & Spirit: The Life and Legacy of George Nakashima," is a tribute to her father, his architecture and furniture, and his reverence for nature.

It is a harsh land, this tip of Galicia, where the most valued natural resource is the sea. And on this westernmost point, Finisterre, also known as the coast of death because of a long history of shipwrecks, perches one of the most moving pieces of modern architecture, a cemetery for sailors and fishermen, by architect Cesar Portela.Through May 1, 2006, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York there is a new exhibit of  modern Spanish architecture.

Now, we go into the contextual examples of how these so-called smart devices can be used to evoke various types of traumas. We speak openly about researching in and around people with trauma and how to protect yourself if you’re a designer and a researcher.

But ask him to describe his earliest creative impulses and he’ll tell you without hesitation that he was an entrepreneur from “day one.” It quickly became clear that Phil is all these things and more after spending the day with him at IBM’s colorful, post-it-strewn design studio in Austin. In other words, to use a tech-speak term of art: Phil is a unicorn.\xa0 Need proof?\xa0 Look no further than his decision to embed design thinking at scale across a company that spans 387,000 employees and 170 countries. Fast Company recently praised Gilbert’s accomplishment at IBM as “establishing a modern standard for increasing the role of arts in business.”\xa0 Under Phil’s leadership, the legacy computer brand has resurrected and expanded its venerable design program and transformed itself into a nimble, forward-thinking company employing a fleet of designers, charged with applying their problem-solving skills to innovative software and B2B infrastructure initiatives, like quantum computing and state of the art digital security. To wit, ArtCenter alum Tina Zeng, a design researcher on IBM’s security team, offers an insider’s perspective on how design is being deployed on a day to day basis under Phil’s leadership. Over the course of a lively Change Lab conversation (conducted in IBM’s employee programmed radio station) Phil opened up about his appreciation for the school busing program in Oklahoma City that first exposed him to the value in a diverse learning environment, his evolution as a leader and the importance of seeing every day as a prototype that can be improved upon.\xa0 Related links: https://www.ibm.com/design/ http://www.tinalzeng.com/  https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/gooddesign/ | In\xa0the lead up to the launch of Change Lab Season 5 on September 25, we’re releasing a series of\xa0“Encore” episodes. For this final installment,\xa0we caught up with graphic journalist Wendy MacNaughton to discuss her latest creative endeavor: A Honda Element she’s tricked out to function as a mobile studio. The car features a custom-made drafting table, art supply storage, and a double bed to catch some zzz’s on longer road trips. Wendy embarked on the project after realizing that solo time on the road has always been a reliable source of creative inspiration. Wendy called us from her idea-generating machine in San Francisco to update us on her most recent wanderings.\xa0We hope you enjoy the episode.

For this installment,\xa0we caught up with designer and entrepreneur Jesse Genet for an update on the big changes she’s undergone in the short time since we last spoke. As the home-shopping revolution continues to redefine the way we shop and live, Lumi, Genet’s packaging business, has become an integral part of the e-commerce pipeline. To accommodate this growth, Lumi has moved into a larger space near the Arts District in Downtown L.A. Genet invited us into Lumi’s new HQ to give us the lowdown on the latest developments in her dynamic career. | In\xa0the lead up to the launch of Change Lab Season 5 on September 25, we’re releasing a series of\xa0“Encore” episodes. For this debut installment,\xa0we caught up with artist Jackie Amezquita before she embarked on a three-week journey from Southern California through Mexico, primarily on foot, all the way to her native Guatemala. Amezquita refers to this emotionally and physically arduous journey as a performance titled “De Norte a Sud.” Over the course of her three-week trek, she’ll be retracing the path\xa0she took as a young Guatemalan migrant to an unknown life in the United States of America, only this time in the opposite direction. Amezquita uses her interactions and conversations with people along the way to explore the myriad cultural, economic, and racial divides so entrenched in this part of the world. This bonus episode interweaves two conversations with Amezquita, recorded more than a year apart, producing an illuminating and intimate portrait of the lived experience of an issue that’s too often reduced to sensational headlines.\xa0We hope you enjoy this updated episode.

As the founder of Homeboy Industries, the largest gang intervention, rehab and reentry program in the world, Father Greg has been instrumental in turning the tide on violent crime in Los Angeles and beyond. The secret to his success begins with reframing the question typically posed by well-meaning social servants. Instead of asking “how can we serve gang members?” Father Greg asks: “how can we stand with them, in awe of the pain they carry, and allow ourselves to be reached by them?” Father Greg, a Jesuit Priest who affectionately refers to his flock of recovering gang members as his “homies,” would argue the centerpiece of what homeboy does is provide the space for “exquisite mutuality” to provide the framework necessary for healing from trauma. Lorne’s interview with Father Greg took place on location at Homeboy. As much as he had absorbed about Homeboy’s culture of “radical kinship,” he was still unprepared for the joyfully kinetic energy coursing through its bustling, light-filled headquarters. The place was teeming with men and women of all ages engaged in both casual conversations and impassioned heart-to-hearts. At the center of the communal action was Father Greg’s glass-encased office, which he seems to occupy only occasionally. To find Father Greg, search the crowd. He’ll be there, doling out bear hugs and giving his undivided attention to anyone in need. There never seemed to be any shortage of takers. Father Greg exhibits a striking generosity of spirit. But Lorne couldn’t help seeing him as the artist, and was determined to explore with him the creative nature of his work. Given his modesty, he initially resisted the notion. But by the end of the interview, a number of striking parallels emerged. \xa0 Links mentioned: https://homeboyindustries.org/  https://www.amazon.com/Barking-Choir-Power-Radical-Kinship/dp/1476726159  https://www.amazon.com/Tattoos-Heart-Power-Boundless-Compassion/dp/1439153159/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2/136-7784137-0791013?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1439153159&pd_rd_r=8f4f74ae-7cd8-11e9-ba98-0ff29dc49ff2&pd_rd_w=hM8Jy&pd_rd_wg=6FlCF&pf_rd_p=a2006322-0bc0-4db9-a08e-d168c18ce6f0&pf_rd_r=05B0AYAJB0JEVF778649&psc=1&refRID=05B0AYAJB0JEVF778649 | Rosanne Somerson is an internationally exhibited furniture designer and President of Rhode Island School of Design. Somerson, a RISD alum, sees her parallel roles as a leader and practitioner as complementary parts of her life’s work, which she says began when she was a young girl charged with describing the world to her blind grandfather and “opening doors for people to see things differently.” Somerson, who grew up outside of Philadelphia, initially set out to pursue a career in photography. She changed course after her first year at RISD, when she discovered her calling to create functional works of art in 3D during a woodworking class. After earning her degree in Industrial Design and establishing a thriving design studio, she began teaching at her alma mater. In 1995, she was asked to run the newly minted degree program in Furniture Design. The scope of her leadership responsibilities expanded in 2011 when she elevated to the role of provost, and then, in 2015, named president of Rhode Island School of Design. Lorne came to know and deeply respect Rosanne through their time spent together at various meetings and conferences. They discovered that in addition to leading colleges of art and design on opposite coasts, they also share a conviction that a studio based immersive making environment is fundamental to fostering and mastering a creative life. As they gathered in Detroit for a recent conference, Lorne sat down for an interview with Rosanne in a recording studio (converted from an old shipping container) to explore some of the most pressing issues facing arts education today. The result was a wide-ranging dialogue on innovation and change, affordability and accessibility, and the enduring and growing value of design thinking in these challenging times. | Jeff Goodby is an advertising legend, whose humanity and humility have propelled him to the peak of a profession not necessarily known for either. Imagine an ad man as clever and visionary as Don Draper, minus the chain-smoking and cynicism and you start to get a sense of the scope of Jeff’s influence in the advertising industry. As a founder of Goodby, Silverstein and Partners, Jeff has been the driving force behind some of the most groundbreaking campaigns and indelible taglines in recent memory. He famously coined “Got Milk?,” a slogan that became a cultural trope that endured for decades, spawning legions of derivations, imitations and a whole cottage industry of merchandise bearing his inspired catchphrase. Among his many other memorable campaigns are the Cheetos Museum, the famous car-less Saturn commercial and his work naming and rebranding the gaming giant, Electronic Arts. Jeff and his longtime partner, Rich Silverstein, have received the 2019 Cannes Lion Lifetime Achievement Award – among the top honors in their field. The two met nearly forty years ago in San Francisco, where their lionized boss, Hal Riney, paired them up and created a partnership that would be among the most durable and influential in the business. As a former ArtCenter trustee, Goodby offers a unique perspective on evolving state of the advertising industry as well as the ways in which ArtCenter students are poised to shape its future by entering the field with strong making skills. Over the course of Jeff’s lively and illuminating conversation with Change Lab, Jeff discussed his upbringing during the golden age of brands, his transition from journalism to advertising, the importance of facing the unknown to generate his most original ideas, the nature of cleverness and his commitment to creating change by treating people with respect and raising the level of conversation on the airwaves and in our heads. | Rebeca Mendez is an artist, designer, educator and ArtCenter alumna whose creative practice defies the bounds of traditional disciplines or descriptions. Her pioneering career in graphic design has been widely recognized. Most recently, her work was featured in shows at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2017, she was awarded the prestigious AIGA Medal for her transformative work in academia and design. Mendez is also a celebrated fine artist best known for her visually arresting mixed-media installations incorporating photography, film, video and typography. She explores the mediated experience of nature at its most elemental in her breakthrough series At Any Given Moment, filmed on location in Iceland between 2006 and 2008. The series exhibited to rave reviews around the world, including at ArtCenter’s Williamson Gallery in 2010. It was there that I first physically encountered Rebeca’s work and was spellbound by its raw power. Most recently her video installation piece, Ascent of the Weavers, was exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Oaxaca, Mexico A focal point of Rebeca’s creative practice is her long-term, transdisciplinary, multimedia project entitled CircumSolar, which encompasses a mural, a photo essay, and several large-scale single-channel video installations. The project is centered around the arctic tern (T-E-R-N), a very small sea bird distinguished as having the longest migration of all living beings on earth. Each year, it flies from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back again. This bird’s epic journey crystallizes Rebeca’s interest in nature’s exquisite refusal to succumb to the limits and artificial boundaries of human enterprise. Mendez also directs the CounterForce Lab at UCLA, where she is a professor of Design Media Arts. She founded CounterForce to develop new modes of field research to study the social and ecological impacts of climate change. Rebeca herself is a force of nature whose poetic spirit infused every moment of her impassioned and, at turns, tender and vulnerable interview with Change Lab’s Lorne Buchman. The conversation covered the broad arc of a remarkable journey from her upbringing in Mexico, where she became the country’s top-ranked gymnast, to a singular career that dissolves boundaries and, to borrow her phrase, rages with love.

A 2012 Product Design graduate from ArtCenter, she has, in a very short period of time, built a remarkable career addressing the needs of underserved populations. Through her work with IDEO.org and as design innovation lead for the International Rescue Committee, she led teams working on a range of challenges, from the Ebola crisis in West Africa to refugee resettlement in the United States. Currently, Mariana is a TED resident. She is also deep in the development of\xa0Design for Wildlife, a collective she recently founded with a mission to support wildlife conservation. As she makes clear in her interview with Change Lab, her interest in this new enterprise concentrates (intriguingly) on those conservation issues that emerge out of the specific relationship between animals and human beings. Over the course of this spirited conversation, she explores the origins of her twin passions for animals and design, her work on an alliance between once-endangered crocodiles and their human neighbors, and her ambitious ideas for the next phase of her creative journey, forged through an impromptu design process at a TED conference in Tanzania. | Fall 2018 Product Design graduate Ari Montanez spent much of his young life equipping himself with the skills and stamina necessary to succeed in a highly competitive arena – ideally one called Madison Square Garden or Staples Center. Indeed, this is a man who wanted to follow his hero, LeBron James, straight into the NBA. But when it became apparent his hoop dreams might be slightly out of reach, Ari pivoted, with the agility of a gifted point guard, to pursue a parallel career as an athletic shoe designer. His goal was still to land on the basketball court in spirit, if not body, through his performance-enhancing footwear designs. \xa0 Ari diligently researched his new chosen profession and discovered, under the mentorship of footwear design legend D’Wayne Edwards, that ArtCenter offered the best training ground for him to channel his parallel passions for basketball, sneaker culture and drawing into a coveted gig as a professional shoe designer. Ari’s determination and dedication paid off. Several months before he graduated, Ari accepted a job offer from No.One, a start-up sneaker company specializing in high-end handmade shoes. \xa0 Each season, we dedicate one episode to capturing a student or recent graduate, just as they’re poised to leave ArtCenter and embark on their creative travels. Ari’s journey from to dedicated athlete to hands-on maker seemed like the perfect narrative to kick off the fourth season of Change Lab. \xa0 In this episode, which includes a visit to No.One’s Venice studio, Ari and Lorne discussed the spark that ignited his interest in design, his insights into the booming sneaker subculture and how his facility for casual human connection animates and adds to the special sauce of his design process. In combination, these two experiences yielded a visceral portrait of the exhilaration and exploration and uncertainty fueling a nascent artist or designer’s creative journey. \xa0 \xa0 Learn more about the artists, designers and brands mentioned in this episode:\u202f \xa0 https://www.arimontanez.com/ https://no-one.la/ https://pensole.com/dwayne-edwards/  https://solecollector.com/news/2018/09/nike-lebron-16-jason-petrie \xa0 Learn more about ArtCenter and its programs at www.artcenter.edu', 'chan_desc': 'ArtCenter College of Design’s bi-weekly podcast features intimate interviews with leading artists examining the ideas fueling their work and how the creative process can be a catalyst for change—personally, professionally and globally.

We want to share with you all about our experience because if you are a designer at any level – right out of school or very seasoned – the value is tremendous. If you aren’t a designer and are listening to this episode, it will be interesting to you because we will talk about all the knowledge we have as professional interior designers and the crazy ways we learn about our trade! 2.\xa0 DETAILS - DAY 2 The event was held August 19-21st for 3 wild and crazy days on the infamous Biltmore Estate in Asheville, NC. We literally did not stop from 7:30 am to 9:30pm. A. Day 1:\xa0 The first big event was an Interior Design and Historic Preservation Tour of the Biltmore Estate held by the Biltmore’s Chief Curator. The restoration efforts underway at the Biltmore are fascinating – everything from reviving the original wallpaper and fabrics to restoring the grand rooms was in depth. B.

C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Closing Keynote by James Farmer of James Farmer Designs – our impressions. 4.\xa0 REASONS WHY WE ATTENDED THIS EVENT A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 To cultivate professional relationships with colleagues and manufacturers in an intimate and casual environment.

C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 To venture behind the scenes and discover the stories behind the pieces you’re choosing for clients and meet the people designing and making them. D.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 To savor all that\xa0North Carolina and the home furnishings industry has to offer while growing as a professional designer.\xa0 5.\xa0 OUR TOP TAKEAWAYS A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The inside atmosphere and work environment of a furniture factory – the long term tenure of the employees, how hard it is, the care and craftsmanship of every piece. B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 American made vs. import – quality over all else C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Inspiration is everywhere in our industry – fashion, automotive, historic places like the Biltmore, nature D.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We all have a story – like the Vanderbilts or James Farmer… we all have a history that play out in our interiors. | 1.\xa0 INTRO\xa0 We are very excited to announce that we are re-branding here at Kandrac & Kole.\xa0 What that means is that we are shaking it up and creating a new logo, different brand colors, a completely new website and some new design offerings.\xa0 One of them is referred to as e-design, which we will explain in depth. As a business, for 14 years, we have worked on hundreds of residential and commercial projects mainly doing what we refer to as “full-service” design. 2.\xa0 OUR PROCESS 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Consultation – An important first meeting – this is where we gain information regarding a client’s likes/dislikes, budget, how rooms should function, and overall scope of the work.\xa0 We ask a lot of questions, as well as measure, sketch and photograph the spaces. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0Design Proposal – Once a scope of work has been developed, we outline details for each space in our design contract.\xa0 Each space is assigned a flat fee based on the scope and estimated time it will take to design. 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Design Presentation – This is the day we present all selections.\xa0 Each and every selection is carefully chosen to create a custom, functional and well-curated space.\xa0 We discuss the reasons the items were selected and how they all work together and provide samples to touch and feel. 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Line Item Budget – This includes pricing for each item and will include tax and freight.\xa0 In other words, no surprises. 3. WHAT IS INCLUDED IN FULL SERVICE DESIGN (OUR TURNKEY SERVICE) 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Space plan and to scale rendering 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Paint color selection 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Floor coverings 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Lighting selection 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Furniture 6.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Soft furnishings – window treatments, pillows, bedding 7.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Accessories 8.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Artwork 4.\xa0 EXECUTION 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Order placement using software specifically for interior design. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Management and expediting of items going to our receiving warehouse. 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Clear communication throughout the project. 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Management of fabrication for custom pieces such as furniture, window treatments and soft goods. 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Coordinating professional delivery team and installers. 6.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Stylizing for a happy reveal! 5.\xa0 DESIGN FOR A DAY\xa0 A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 A program that is basically a 4-hour concierge service we tackle anything request.\xa0 Designing a room from A-Z, selecting a full interior or exterior color palette, helping with a family gallery wall, anything that is challenging to a client.\xa0 Included are all the things necessary for the client to do it themselves at their own pace.\xa0 We are at the client’s home from 10 am to 2 pm and the cost is $1,500. i.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We provide the client with a keynote, link list and floor plan ii.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Help from local contractors if needed iii.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Custom window treatments, if applicable. what is e-design and why are we offering it? – It is basically interior design services offered online.\xa0 this is designed for clients who may be in our area but more geared towards out of town clients who would like to have a home curated by Kandrac & Kole and either can’t afford full service, have trouble creating a space plan or putting things together and need a nudge in the right direction.\xa0 They get our design expertise and creative vision in an accessible and affordable platform. 6. E-DESIGN STEPS 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Correspondence will be done via phone, email or skype. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Take measurements and photographs of your space (we will guide you on how to measure) 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Send us links of inspiration photos – Houzz and Pinterest to give us a feel for what you like 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We prepare the design (approximately a 3-4 week turnaround). 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We will email you a complete design package which includes a floor plan, mood boards, paint selections and a thorough and organized shopping list of online retailers with clickable links and all the steps you need to put the room together. 7. THE WINNER OF OUR VIRTUAL E-DESIGN GIVEAWAY\xa0 Jennifer Baldwin, a busy physician and mom of two teens from California told us she needs help with her living room.\xa0 It has good bones, great natural light and a beautiful view, it just needs Kandrac & Kole’s professional touch!\xa0\xa0 Her biggest challenges are finding a focal point with windows all around and how to find an area rug that does not compete with the herringbone wood floor. Congratulations Jennifer – we will be in touch!! | 1.\xa0 INTRO It takes a village as they say and we couldn’t agree more. In last week’s episode on Partnerships, we discussed the importance of agreeing on what outsourcing expenses to incur as a company such as bookkeeping, tax prep, social media etc. Today we are going to talk about all the other people we rely on (and why) to make our business successful. 2.\xa0 ART AND WINDOW TREATMENT INSTALLER We have been working with the same window treatment/art installer since the inception of our business. We worked together at the design showroom (Decorating Mart) where we met. It has been an incredible partnership. A few important expectations we live by: 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Be super courteous to our clients. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Be professionally dressed – no holes in shirts, no belly hanging out, no smelling of smoke, no dirty shoes 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Come prepared – every tool, ladder, grommet, drill bit, saw, touch up paint, glue, paint brush, steamer etc. should be on that truck. 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Be on time- need we say more? 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Be flexible – installs can get hairy and hectic – you have to be able to go with the flow with no attitude and a “make it happen” attitude. 3.\xa0 WINDOW TREATMENT AND SOFT GOODS FABRICATOR Quality, professional custom window treatments, pillows, headboards, upholstery etc. is a huge part of our business. For years and years Kelly took all the measurements, wrote up all the work orders and ordered the custom hardware herself. We still do some of that but we’ve also started outsourcing a lot of this. Mistakes are big and expensive in our business so why have the stress? A ton goes in to custom window treatments – 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Our fabricator goes to the clients house to measure, writes up all workorders, orders all specified hardware and delivers the window treatments to the job site to assist the installer and make sure the quality is perfect. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Tricky walls and ceilings, molding and corners sometimes require a custom template to be made for that the hardware or how the mounting board is cut. 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The quality of the lining and pillow inserts we use are items we have perfected over time. 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Motorization for unreachable windows, room darkening treatments in media centers, unlined sheers in sunrooms – all items we need to discuss with the client. 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 You need to be able to make your design concept or a clients particular wish come to life and it’s all about your workroom’s abilities to make this happen. 6.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Remember – you get what you pay for. 4.\xa0 RECEIVER AND MOVERS Being established designers, we order 85% of our product direct from manufacturers. Most manufacturers don’t drop ship to residential addresses (nor do we really want them to for quality assurance purposes). So this means that most of our product has to be delivered to a loading dock, inspected for damages, and stored safely until install. Upon install, this same company delivers all of the product at one time (hopefully) to the install. 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Our experiences from Chicago to Charleston to Atlanta. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 All the same expectations that we have for our art installer (which sometimes requires babysitting- story of the belt). 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The cost for receiving and inspection, storage and delivery are big costs in our business and ones that have to be managed carefully. For example, as soon as the last time arrives for a client, we plan the install. 5.\xa0 FURNITURE MAKERS These peeps are a huge part of our team and our ability to make visions reality. When you can’t find what you want in the market place, what are you going to do? When you have a client with big dreams that he or she is looking to you to create, what are you going to do? 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Curating relationships with artisans. a.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thad at Modera b.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Jersey guys making the banquet for Allure c.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mitch – Joann’s bed, my mirror, custom sized kitchen tables, Klein’s sofa table, the arched doors at the Magnolia Showhouse 6.\xa0 WALLPAPER INSTALLERS 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Quote thoroughly and quickly 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Be prepared for ceilings and tight spaces. 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Sometimes working with difficult papers – MAKE IT HAPPEN attitude 7.\xa0 PAINTERS We’ve used the same painters for 18 years. When we call for our clients, they get the utmost service because of our partnership with our paint company and the respect we have for one another. 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Our expectations 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Big crews – efficient and timely completion 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Few call backs 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In uniform 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Quality paint at all times 8.\xa0 KITCHEN & BATH REMODELERS When the recession hit Atlanta in 2008, we were still super busy. People could sell their homes or build new ones because the market was in the toilet but they still had money. So lots of people started remodeling. This began our quest for really good contractors especially in the kitchen & bath arena. 1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 How we work together – it doesn’t always work out. 2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Working such that we alongside our contractor are both making a profit. 3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Contractors that can think outside the box and collaborate with us. 4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Contractors that have a good steady team of office peeps and reliable subs. 5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 How good are they with follow up issues and/or problems at any stage of the project especially the very end. | August 15th marks our 14th year together as Kandrac & Kole.\xa0\xa0 It has been quite a journey and similar to that of a marriage and raising a child!\xa0 We’ve learned and grown so much in these 14 years and even though there have been some ups and downs, seriously we are luck to say there have been very few downs, it has been a great adventure. Several business owners have shared that they wish they could find someone to share their business with and always ask us what makes it work. 1.\xa0 HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Understand the strengths and weaknesses each has B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Build each other up\xa0 C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Forgive mistakes (we ALL make them) D.\xa0\xa0\xa0 Appreciate each other E.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Share responsibility equally 2.\xa0 STRUCTURE A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 A business lawyer to structure/contract B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Accounting C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Buy/Sell Agreement –A formal agreement that defines exit strategy and ownership succession plans between co-owners of a business.\xa0 D.\xa0\xa0\xa0 Life Insurance 3.\xa0 BE FLEXIBLE A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Keep open minds B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Give and take C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Negotiate when needed D.\xa0\xa0\xa0 A bad mood is only “temporary” 4.\xa0 BE SUPPORTIVE - COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Honor personal needs and time B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Pick up the slack when needed C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Encourage each other – business and personal D.\xa0\xa0\xa0 Remember, you’re on the same team 5.\xa0 BE HONEST - IDENTIFY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This can be uncomfortable at times but voice a frustration or uneasiness B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Talk it through C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Move on from a disagreement 6.\xa0 HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It’s not cancer, It’s only interior design B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Laugh at your mistakes C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Have fun We feel infinitely blessed to be living our passion.\xa0 A big thanks to the outstanding people we work with, the service from our vendors, the clients who allow us to work in their homes, the brilliant design industry we are fortunate to be a part of, Amy and Lisa, our office mates who do such a great job for us and keep Kandrac & Kole running smoothly, and most important of all, to our husbands who are our biggest supporters!! | 1.\xa0 INTRO We owe much of our success as Designers to the fact that we make a commitment every year (and many times twice a year) to invest our time and travel funds to the High Point Furniture Market. It is here that we have created literally hundreds of relationships with manufacturers, artisans, a long list of leaders in our industry and of course our peers. With 12 million square feet of show space spanning over 180 buildings, High Point Market is the largest home furnishings trade show in the world. It brings more than 75,000 people to High Point, N.C., every six months to view product from more than 2,000 exhibitors. Registration for the Fall Show just opened on July 16th so we thought it was perfect timing to share our pro tips on how to navigate Highpoint Market. We consider ourselves pros because Joann has been visiting the market for 25 year and Kelly for 14 years. Let’s start with some basics and then we will get into some juicy tips from our personal experience. 2.\xa0 WHEN IS IT? High Point market is in the Spring and the Fall.

When their entrepreneur son Mark and his architect wife, Julie joined them, they created a company dedicated to discovering beautiful and unusual hand-crafted home décor for their exclusive design trade clientele. Today, their children, Jason and Jessica have become integral parts of the business. B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 They are a design leader in the furniture industry and have received some of the top industry awards, including multiple Pinnacle and ADEX Awards, as well as a four-time recipient of the coveted ARTS Award for Top Product Designer. C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 They offer products such as organic contemporary furnishings, accessories, wall décor and sculpture. D.\xa0\xa0\xa0 They are a to-the-trade company with showrooms in Atlanta, Dallas, High Point, Laguna, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York. If you are a consumer you can purchase their products through an Interior Designer or find their products at fine furniture dealers around the world. E.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Commercial Work – There’s a good chance you’ve seen their products at the movies or on TV, as well as your favorite restaurants, bars and nightclubs. We are very excited to have Jason Phillips, Vice President of the Phillips Collection as a guest today. 3.\xa0 TELL US THE ROLE YOU PLAY IN THE COMPANY A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Did you always want to be involved in the family business?

Called The Designer Experience. The Designer Experience is a two-and-a-half day symposium exclusively for the design trade. This creative forum puts a unique spotlight on North Carolina’s enduring legacy as a center for textiles, furniture-making and manufacturing, as well as its renaissance and appreciation for farm-to-table dining and wining. Designed to inspire, educate, entertain, and foster life-long relationships, the event delivers custom-designed, accredited educational experiences plus time to savor the best food and culture North Carolina has to offer in the company of your colleagues.\xa0 The event was put on by PBM Brand and Designers Today Magazine (which if you aren’t reading, you SHOULD be). 2.\xa0DAY 1 A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Jill Seale – Jill Seale Design Studio B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Lisa Mende of Lis Mende Design C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Made in America Panel with Norwalk Furniture, Capel Rugs, Sylvester Alexander D.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Evening with Universal and Crypton 3.\xa0 DAY 2 A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Melissa Galt – Get More Done and Love Your Business More B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Phillips Collection Factory Tour C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Lexington Design Center and CEU Discuss with Marcia Blake of Glen Ravin about performance fabrics D.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Tour and dinner at Sunbrella’s HQ 4.\xa0 DAY 3 A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Markor tour – Caracole, A.R.T., Jonathan Charles, Rowe B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Speaker – Amy Flurry – Recipe for Press, Paper Cut Project | 1.\xa0 INTRO\xa0 There was a time when all we sourced were bold paint colors for walls using various shades of white for trim and ceilings.\xa0 That has truly changed, although sometimes we’ll specify an accent color and, if our clients will let us, wallpaper on ceilings. The trend for white walls has been strong and for being “color” girls, we have really embraced this. A. Why White Walls i.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 A great canvas or backdrop for art (this is why art gallery walls are always white) ii.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It highlights the architecture of the home. iii.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It makes a space look bigger. iv.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It’s the cheapest way to make over a room. v.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Helps for resale.

B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Hollywood Sign got a “face lift” from Sherwin Williams and The Hollywood Sign Trust. i.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Hollywood sign is 450’ wide.\xa0 Each letter stands 45’ high and ranges between 31’ and 39’ wide ii.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The sign’s nine letters had all existing coatings removed before being primed and painted. iii.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The sign’s color is Sherwin Williams High Reflective White (SW7757) iv.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The sign was painted with 225 gallons of Emerald Exterior Acrylic Latex Paint in Satin. v.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The sign was primed with 105 gallons of Pro-Industrial Pro-Cryl Universal Acrylic primer vi.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The refurbishment took nine weeks to complete \xa0 | 1.\xa0 INTRO We are just back from Napa Valley, CA where we were invited as special guests of Design Hounds and Signature Kitchen Suite to be a part of a three-day brand immersion trip to learn all about the new SKS showroom and their luxury lien of appliances. A.\xa0\xa0\xa0 Background – Part 1 – Design Hounds i. We have been very fortunate to be a part of Modenus Blogtour and Design Hounds trips around the country and in Europe. Design Hounds and Modenus are run by a woman by the name of Veronika Eagleson. She has done an incredible job of curating a large network of design professionals who share best practices, design finds and product knowledge via social media and their own design businesses. These designers are also known as micro-influencers who align brands like Signature Kitchen Suite with truly relevant audiences. And you thought we just made homes look pretty! B.\xa0\xa0\xa0 Background – Part 2 – SKS \xa0i. Signature Kitchen Suite is the new luxury brand from LG Electronics. The Napa showroom that we visited was a 2 ½ year dream in the making. It was one of the most impressive showrooms we have ever been in complete with an appliance playground, a massive kitchen for inhouse cooking shows and training, conference rooms, dining rooms, an killer bar etc. The SKS team wine and dined us and told us their story… 2.\xa0 TRUE TO FOOD A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Storytelling - Before SKS sells you an appliance, they tell you a story. They are all about being what they have coined “TRUE TO FOOD”. If you go to their website, (signaturekitchensuite.com), watch the film series all about their deep respect for food and where it is sourced. You will see stories about cheesemakers, breadmakers, fishermen, vineyard owners and more. It is so cool. So if you have a deep respect for food, where it comes from and who grows or produces it, then it makes senses that you would continue that respect for how you cook the food. This is what SKS does. B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 “Technicurean” – SKS believes that being on top of technology is a luxury experience. They also believe that people are willing to pay more for performance and technology. So they coined another word – one for those people that are passionate about food and technology - Technicureans. 3.\xa0 HOW TO BE TRUE TO FOOD A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Cook “Sous Vide” pronounced (sue-veed), which is French for “under-vacuum”. This is a cooking technique where food is vacuum sealed and then submerged in water and slow-cooked at a constant, precise temperature until it’s perfectly cooked. So for example, you won’t see that gray to pink radiant in your meat because it’s cooked evenly edge to edge. You can cook chicken, fish, eggs, and vegetables all sous vide. SKS is the only brand to incorporate a sous vide built in to the cook top range. B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 There are several ways to cook on the SKS ranges – sous vide, induction, gas, griddle, true convention and steam. The ranges come in 36” and 48” with different combinations of components. C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Don’t forget about refrigeration - With SKS you choose your columns and put them together – so you can choose a freezer column that is 18”, 24” or 30”. You can choose a refrigerator column that is 24” or 30” or a 36” French Door frig. SKS also just debuted their 18” (holds 71 bottles) and 24” wine refrigerators (holds 113 bottles) with “wine cave” technology that mimics the wine preservation of historic, old-world caves. 4.\xa0 OH WOW LEARNING MOMENTS A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 SKS sells 120 LG products that are wifi compatible or wifi connected. So if you want every one of your appliances to be connected to your home system, your phone or your ipad – go for it! This also means that you have on-going monitoring of your appliances because of the on line connectivity. B.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 SKS has a 5 day repair or replace guarantee on their products – no questions asked. C.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When you buy an SKS appliance, you have a single point of contact for your product needs once you register. No suffering thru the automated cycle of button pushing! D.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 All SKS appliances have a 2 year warranty with an additional 1 year added as soon as you register your appliances. E.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Their average repair time is 3 days and they have 24/7 service. F.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The 48” range has an articulating handle that helps you to open and close the oven door. G.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The new column refrigeration is built so that you can refit any built in refrigerator without tearing down cabinets. H.\xa0\xa0\xa0 The refrigerator has a convertible drawer so you can make it what you want – a freezer (-6 to 0 degrees) or a beverage drawer at 33 degrees or a meat drawer at 29 degrees etc. I.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The drawers in the refrig move easily and the LED lights move with it. The bins pop out super easily to clean. J.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When you buy a wine column, you have the “True Sommelier App” – this app is SO COOL – it will catalog your wines, recognize your labels, assign different “cellars” within your wine column, learn your preferences and those of your friends and frequent guests. If you go to a certain restaurant, it can tell you what to order based on the brands you prefer. 5.\xa0 CONCLUSION A.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 So as you can see, we became big fans in a big way on LG and the SKS luxury arm of appliances. We cannot wait to introduce our clients to the Signature Kitchen Suite of options the next time we work on a kitchen renovation or new build. We LOVED the Napa region and had a total blast with our fellow design buddies. 6.\xa0 NOTE SKS nor Design hounds is sponsoring this podcast but our trip was sponsored.', 'chan_desc': 'A lively conversation about the latest interior design trends, travels to industry events, current design projects (the good, the bad and the ugly), do’s and don’ts, product recommendations and more.

Ferris persuades his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) to help lure Ferris' girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school and let them use his father's prized 1961 Ferrari.

Host\xa0George Smart\xa0talks to two big Rudolph fans, returning guest Sarasota Architecture Foundation President Christopher Wilson and the lead moderator of the Modernism Week Paul Rudolph tribute, Dick Burkett. \xa0 | Today we welcome back Justin Shubow, President of the National Civic Art Society, a non-profit dedicated to promoting the classical tradition in public art and architecture. President Trump appointed\xa0him in 2018 to the\xa0U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a federal agency which oversees the design and construction of government buildings and memorials\xa0in Washington DC. Shubow is the author of The Gehry Towers over Eisenhower, a 150-page critique of the Eisenhower Memorial, a battle he sort of won, sort of lost against architect Frank Gehry. With a background in philosophy and law, he has taught at Michigan and Yale and speaks on architecture at places like the US State Department, Baylor University, Colorado College, Hamilton College, and the University of Virginia.\xa0 | Palm Springs has a huge architecture event called Modernism Week every February. It’s a fascinating array of architecture, lectures, parties, tours, exhibits, and the occasional plastic surgery gone awry. Host\xa0George Smart was there earlier this year talking with nearly all the speakers, authors, and special guests who make the week (actually 11 days) a blast!

The Huffington Post named him one of the five greatest architects under 50. Wallpaper Magazine described him as one of the world's most influential young architects. Esquire Magazine dubbed him the young saviour of American architecture. Icon Magazine called him one of the 20 Essential Young Architects. And Popular Mechanics said “Josh who? Is he that cold fusion guy?”  Graduating from Harvard in Architecture in 1996, Ramus worked for Rem Koolhaas before forming his own practice, REX, in 2006. Like many famous architects, Charles Gwathmey and Richard Meier come to mind, his mom helped him get the project that rocket-launched his career. He has been a Visiting Professor at Yale, Rice, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, and Syracuse.

This is a very very generic dictionary definition! But this is an INCOMPLETE definition!2.\xa0 https://freshome.com/2007/07/12/7-most-important-interior-design-principles/“Interior design is the process of shaping the experience of interior space, through the manipulation of spatial volume as well as surface treatment. Not to be confused with interior decoration, interior design draws on aspects of environmental psychology, architecture, and product design in addition to traditional decoration.3. http://www.iida.org/resources/content/9/7/documents/ID_Definition.pdf The true and complete definition is defined by the NCIDQ - It is the Board for Interior Design Qualification\xa0 Here’s their definition - Interior Design is a multi-faceted profession in which creative and technical solutions are applied within a structure to achieve a built interior environment. So a designer’s job is not only dependent on aesthetic factors but also on codes, safety guidelines, behavioral studies, ergonomics, research and a lot more that gets applied all throughout the design process. If we look at these 3 definitions, it looks to me like a scale. Neither is wrong and they all represent some aspects of ID. Keeping in mind the NCIDQ is the most complete definition\xa0How do you understand as an interior designer, where do you fall on that scale?That is only dependent upon each designer’s PERSONAL PREFERENCE and PERSONAL GROWTH to decide where on the scale.\xa0Why does it matter to understand these definitions? What does it mean to us?Because this field is so vast and multifaceted that can get a lot of designers overwhelmed or confused as to what they want to do with their career.\xa0Over the last just 7 years ago pursuing my ID career I have grown to learn so much about the possibilities of ID and understanding one concept -\xa0That you are not bound by one speciality or type of design and it’s really a personal journey that you have to figure it out along the way. Do I know what I want to know do? Yes, I do have some vision of what I want to pursue and that’s why I started this podcast. \xa0Wherever you are on the scale know that it is a PROCESS. That’s what I want you to take away from this. You can’t beat around the bush or think you can do whatever. You CAN but ultimately that won’t make you feel happy or fulfilled in your career. Because this field requires so much time, energy, effort and it’s very creative, technical, and demanding job. You can get easily burnt out if you are unclear about what you want to do!\xa0So why does that matter? Why does study of Interior Spaces matter?\xa0Because of a very important fact/Statistic -\xa0Did you know that the average American spends almost 90% of their life indoors. In a study\xa0 done by EPA (Which is the Environmental Protection Agency) the avg american spends 87% of their life indoors, 6% in a vehicle or other indoor locations, and merely 7% outdoorsBecause the interior spaces we occupy will affect an individual\'s health, comfort level, emotional and mental state.

I’ve brought him back because recently his company conducted a  Marketing for Consultants Study\xa0that I find fascinating and is full of valuable information and which marketing techniques can help build a successful business. \xa0 In this detailed study, 34,000 consultants were surveyed to find out what is actually working in their marketing techniques- what tactics they’re using and getting results from. The survey identifies and compares what high-performing consultants are doing vs low-performing consultants. Learn what the best practices are that we can all benefit from. For instance, what type of marketing works best and how much should you invest in marketing? Michael and I discuss in detail how you can shift your mindset for marketing costs from an expense to an investment. We’ll dive into some data from the survey to help give you a better understanding of what others are “investing.”\xa0 \xa0 We also explore network effects, the simplicity of a phone call, and other marketing tactics that you may or may not already be using. Where should you be putting your money in when it comes to marketing? Listen here to find out and explore more on the survey at  https://www.consultingsuccess.com/marketing-for-consultants-study. | In this episode, I talk with Mary Ellen Slayter\xa0, CEO and team leader at Rep Cap, which is a content marketing agency that specializes in creating thought leadership, strategies, and plans for B2B industries.\xa0She is also the Publisher and Founder of ManagingEditor.com. \xa0 Mary Ellen pursues most of her work in Insurance and HR Tech, but worked her way through her journalism career by writing for things like B2B newsletters, career advice columns, and as a finance editor. She has an understanding of large technical and financial terms and has a multitude of knowledge pulled from her professional experience and from her studies in college to get her degree.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Mary Ellen has an edge that makes her stand out from others- she is comfortable writing content for her clients that most other writers want to stay away from. And after taking her own ideas and organizing them into processes through a project management tool, she’s created a team of writers that have similar values on the quality of their writing. Each member of her team has a background in the field of expertise their clients are in, so being able to understand the jargon their clients use helps her team produce top notch content. No “content sludge” here!\xa0 \xa0 Join me here for some insight into how Mary Ellen helps sell the incredible ideas her clients come up with- and just how she is able to pull information from her smart, reserved clients. If you are looking for more information, please visit ManagingEditor.com. | In this week’s episode, I sit down and have a very honest conversation with Franco Cabral , who is the CEO of inMark Media Group\xa0and owner of his personal brand at FrancoCabral.com. InMark Media Group helps small to medium sized businesses with their brand and advertising inside almost 700 supermarkets across the nation.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 In just three and a half years, Franco rapidly grew his sales team for inMark Media Group, but it took a lot more time and energy with his personal growth for him to get to where he is today.\xa0 Franco had it all- or at least it would seem that way on paper, or looking from the outside in. However, it was only when he reached a pivotal moment that he realized how unhappy and unfulfilling life really was. In this episode, Franco shares his amazing story of how he went from studying to become a doctor, to working in sales and becoming a National Sales Director, and then building his own business by using his credibility and reputation within the field.\xa0 \xa0 Franco is someone I look up to and am always learning something from. I feel like I can relate to some of his story with personal growth and I hope this hits home for many of you. Join me in this open and honest episode that describes the process Franco entailed to get to his success today- success with his business and in his personal life. \xa0 For anyone looking to hear more from Franco Cabral’s podcast, please visit inMarkMG.com and click on the link to his podcast or you can find it as The Honest Liar Podcast. | In this noteworthy episode, I sit down with Devin Bramhall , Director of Marketing with Animalz, a content marketing agency that works with huge name customers. It was founded as a co-located company in NYC by a man named Walter Chen. Because the best talent isn’t all in one location, the team has expanded to more than 35 people spread across the world who wanted both structure and freedom in their lives. Walter brought Devin and her team on to run this company, and by providing the space these leaders need along with a solid infrastructure in place, the business took off and major growth happened just within the last year. \xa0 Quality work is so important in this business, so Animalz takes several approaches to be sure this can happen. They invest heavily in their people, within the company, and with their clients. For Animalz, it was important to create a repeatable structure to follow.\xa0 And with training, a lot of investment into the clients, and digging into each subject matter, quality is then built into the process. Animalz will model their work as if they are embedded in each company, as a content marketer working there. They also do everything possible to align with the customer throughout the entire process. \xa0 For anyone building up their agency, this is a great episode to listen to! Devin dives into the importance of having a repeatable process in place, keeping the creatives within your company motivated to produce high-quality work, and how to keep your clients engaged throughout the process. Hear how she ensures a relationship is built with the client and how to get them to commit to the process before even starting on content.\xa0 Here we go… | On this episode, I speak with Jessica Mehring, CEO and Senior Copywriter at Horizon Peak Consulting, a content marketing agency that produces very technical and difficult work for companies focused on enterprise sales. \xa0 Jessica started her copywriting career in the corporate world, and though she was good at what she did, she eventually hit a plateau, so she took the necessary steps to discovering exactly what her niche was. She is now an expert at what she does and has very high standards for her team and for the work her business provides to huge-brand clients. \xa0 Horizon Peak Consulting offers each client a high level of trust and very high-quality work. Right off the bat, companies can see measurable results on her website, and with Jessica focusing on the end-customer, putting in the research needed and above-and-beyond efforts needed to be able to write superior quality content, she can help her clients hit their targeted goals and KPIs. \xa0 Listen to this week’s episode to hear how far Jessica has come in her career, as well as the specifics on Jessica’s detailed onboarding process and how she sets expectations from the get-go.\xa0 | In this week's episode, I talk with Nat Eliason, CEO & Founder of Growth Machine. Using a “systems-first” approach and by producing great content, he quickly grew this business from zero to 2 million ARR in less than 2 years and now has a 10-person team working around the U.S. \xa0 Growth Machine is an SEO-focused content marketing agency that mostly works with eCommerce and tech companies by managing their blog content production.\xa0 \xa0 With ad costs increasing, more businesses are looking for someone who can create, optimize, and promote content, while also giving them the best chance of ranking high in Google searches. With high-quality writers that consistently meet deadlines and by following a very structured system, Growth Machine delivers great results for their clients.\xa0 \xa0 Listen in to hear a robust episode full of valuable information.

It’s about using a strategy to get you onto the correct platforms and using your unique voice within all of it, especially when there is so much noise on the internet. What will make you stand out and how do you make it clear who you are online? Jason shares here what the 3 R’s are when trying to reach your goal audience and why they’re so important. \xa0 Tune in to listen to some great tips from Jason and what his thoughts and recommendations on how to market yourself using the right content and the right channels are. \xa0You can learn more about what Jason does through JasonVanOrden.com.\xa0 | In this episode, I speak with Lacy Boggs , director of The Content Direction Agency -writing high quality content and creating bespoke content marketing strategies for online entrepreneurs. Determined to stay home with her baby about 8 years ago, Lacy quit her regular job as a journalist, started writing a food blog and eventually started ghostwriting for some big authors. She has an amazing talent of being able to write content from each client’s own tone of voice, so this led her to starting her own agency. She started as a solo freelance writer to growing into a team of 10 while only working 20 hours per week. Listen here to learn all about how Lacy grew The Content Direction Agency, how her incredible team is able to produce content that is used to its full potential, and why the agency model was the better decision for her to scale her business. | In this episode, I talk with  Kieran Flanagan, the VP of Marketing with Hubspot- an inbound marketing, sales, and service software company. After helping many Saas businesses grow their traffic, users, and revenue, Kieran joined HubSpot because he was a believer in the “inbound movement.” \xa0 For anyone who is a HubSpot agency partner, this is a must listen to. Even if you’re not, learn how you can build a relationship and partner with a larger tech company like HubSpot and build the dynamic to grow on the back of a partner program. \xa0 Tune in to learn why some agencies have done really well versus ones that have struggled. One thing we speak about is being fully committed and focus on becoming a partner rather than dabbling in other platforms. In addition, Kieran speaks about the 3 stages in customer experience, what makes you more authentic in the way you do business, and what can differentiate you from the competition when it comes to content creation and publishing as well.\xa0You don't want to miss the valuable information in this episode. | On this week's episode I sit down with Meryl Johnston\xa0of Bean Ninjas,\xa0a productized service focused on bookkeeping i.e. tracking day-to-day transactions in Xero. \xa0 Meryl came from a background in accounting where she worked on a lot of custom projects that took a lot of time to scope and scale. From this experience, she was able to look back on all the flaws and backtrack to create processes solving those problems. \xa0 There are some great tidbits on systemized scaling in this episode. Meryl and I agree, it's all about going to market and then figuring out how to deliver. Generating leads and making sales isn't so much the problem - it's working out how to deliver the service and having the right teams members and processes in place to deliver well. \xa0 Tune in to hear about the evolution Bean Ninja, from the early stages of figuring out what types of customers to market to, through to delivering great experiences for people they enjoy working with.", 'chan_desc': 'Working Without Pants is the podcast for agency owners and consultants who are wanting to win more clients and better clients for their business.Each week, Jake Jorgovan brings you interviews with industry leaders and experts on how to win more clients for your agency or consulting practice.Past guests have included Brennan Dunn, Brent Weaver, Kai Davis, Philip Morgan, Brian Casel, Blair Enns, and many more.

Cheers. | Embodied carbon is carbon that is emitted in the production of materials, and the building industry is responsible for 40% of global annual emissions. Buildings are the problem AND the solution and understanding the immediate impacts of embodied carbon is absolutely vital. We define the critical difference between operational and embodied carbon, and explain why net zero energy buildings simply aren\'t enough at this moment in time. We take a pass at understanding the numbers behind them. We also spend the second half of the podcast talking about the materials that we either must, or absolutely should not specify.

Phil and Chris talk about Living Building Challenge, a certification program that aims to transform the market place, with all it\'s joys and challenges. Collaborating for the first time, their firms are working on an LBC project, The Ecology School in Saco, Maine.

Before their split in 2011, they were essentially one and the same, where PHIUS was the American “branch” of the European PHI. But due to irreconcilable differences, sadly, our “parents of passive house” got a divorce and now you have to choose which one you will stay with for the holidays. | We’ve come to realize that we all want simple rules of thumb to guide our design process. Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule of thumb for everything and we’re going to have to rely on some common sense, good advice, and good old-fashioned engineering to get this balanced ventilation system right.Our cocktails are refreshed and we’re ready to go. | In this episode we are assuming that you are preparing to design or build a super-tight house and you’re interested in the best way to provide fresh air for its occupants.In the old days, you’d just “let the house breathe” [shudder].

Our topic this episode has a fairly unsexy name but is thoroughly intriguing — innovation-based trend forecasting. This isn’t currently a common methodology in UX today, but it’s something that could definitely be a game-changer for your organization.My guests are experts in trend forecasting: Lillian Pontius-Goldblatt is a senior strategist and brand storyteller at Carbone Smolan Agency, and Jennifer Passas is a brand strategist at Gensler. In this episode we’re talking about applying trend forecasting to your design practice. And this is not just focused on the design of a digital product though it can include that - but design as it applies to the larger human experience -- built environments, or workplace design, physical or organizational design, systems, services. And it includes all the roles that contribute to the creation of an experience, designers, researchers, PMs, developers and business leaders of all kinds.Lillian and Jennifer conducted a workshop at this year’s South by southwest about how individual’s and teams can incorporate the practice of innovation-based trend forecasting into their own process. They talk through the process in practice, as well as how they condensed the process into a workshop time-frame. Lillian will be presenting this process at this year's Radical Research Summit in Vancouver, BC, on Sept. 27th.

After Melanie left a 13-year career at IBM, she wrote a book called Uncovering Truffles, a book about the scarcity and value of Women in Stem. And something she wrote about in her book stood out to me as really relevant to many people UX, across genders. In researching her book, Melanie found that certain cognitive styles can make it more difficult to get ahead in tech and leadership, and that contributes to holding many women back in STEM fields.And here’s the interesting connection to UX. Thinking styles that are more thoughtful, observational, perhaps more empathetic... the people with these cognitive styles can have a hard time fitting into tech teams, and in leadership roles especially. And, ironically, these cognitive styles — largely intuitive, an interest in people and behavior, and highly empathetic, are a common denominator in the discipline of UX, as I mentioned, across genders. So that’s what we’re digging into today - what can someone do if they find themselves in this place - a place where they feel like to they don’t fit in, or they feel undervalued or misunderstood?

Torrey is not only an expert at UX Writing, she’s an expert at getting the right words into the experience — which is half the challenge sometimes, even if you’ve determined what the right thing to say where is, getting the rest of the team to see the value can be harder than it should be. So of course, we talk about that. Her book has so many great tips and techniques and tools to help you determine the right words for your experience. We talked about how to incorporate that into your or your team’s process, how to measure the effectiveness of that, and how to prove out the value of effective UX writing to your stakeholders.This topic is so important for anyone who is involved with creating user experiences, because so many people in a team contribute to the words that a user sees.About Torrey Podmajersky:Torrey Podmajersky uses UX content to help teams meet business and customer goals.

We took a short break and now we're back on our regular publishing schedule. In this episode I\xa0talked with Tamara Adlin, a UX strategy expert, speaker, and author, who was a guest in season 1, episode 10, talking about creating alignment personas. This time we're talking about a really important topic that plagues many of us and that she is really passionate about, she’s been sharing her wisdom in meetups and conferences in Seattle, and I wanted to make this available to the larger UX community. Negotiating a salary or title in UX in in general is not easy, a lot of people struggle with translating their value in UX into business metrics. So it can be challenging for anyone, but many women especially have other internal hurdles to jump. Research has shown that women are much more likely to discount their own experience and value when it comes to salaries and titles. Tamara has some really great, specific and actionable advice for you, and although we’re talking about women in UX primarily, a lot of this is applicable to anyone who feels they aren’t great at negotiating.In this episode we talk about how to find your superpower and assign a value to it, how to prepare for a successful negotiation, and a few key steps to remember when you’re going through the negotiation process. Also some really great advice if you're asking for a raise or promotion.\u200b\u200bAbout Tamara Adlin\xa0Tamara Adlin is the President of Adlin, Inc, a one-woman Customer Experience Strategy consulting company in Seattle, WA. She works with early-stage startups, and big companies trying to act like startups, to bring customer focus to the business teams and business savvy to the design teams.\xa0She has\xa0written several books on Personas, including her latest website on Alignment Personas.

It’s been a common complaint for the past couple of decades most agile processes don’t allow time for ux research and design. Teams that want the best human-centered design outcomes have to be intentional about that and it means adjusting their agile processes in some way, so they can use ux resources more effectively. But many teams don’t even know they need to do this, or if they do know they have issues with their UX, they don’t know how or what to change. Today we’re talking with Shayna Atkins who is an agile expert and a big proponent of incorporating UX into Agile.Shayna is an agile coach and founder of Atkco Inc in Chicago. she's worked with organizations large and small, from corporations and startups to universities and non-profits, and she has success stories that prove that the most successful agile framework is one that incorporates UX research and design in the process from the start, where it brings high value. She’s got great examples of what this approach looks like and techniques to accomplish it. and She also has some great ideas about how anyone in an organization can advocate for these kind of changes, to see more effective outcomes.Oh, and if you enjoy this content, please, take just a moment to rate and review us in iTunes or apple podcast, it would mean so much to us.

Chances are pretty good that if you produce user research in your work, at some point you will feel like your research is just not making the impact it should be. Or you may have trouble making a case for doing more research — and the number one way to get your organization on board with doing more research is to make sure the research that IS done is super effective. So, how can you get more effective?We spoke with expert researcher Danyell Jones, and she’s got a recipe for making research more effective for in-house teams.\xa0Danyell is\xa0a User Experience Research Lead\xa0at ZS Associates, a management consulting firm in Chicago, and she’s giving a talk at the upcoming Convey UX conference called A Recipe for In-house Research. We caught up with her recently where she was working from home while Chicago was in the middle of the Polar Vortex.\xa0Danyell Jones oversees and conducts research across 5 different verticals in the Software Development group at ZS Associates. Danyell works with teams to develop reusable and efficient processes for conducting and analyzing research while increasing the visibility of the research practice and user experience team.\xa0In addition to working in user research, Danyell teaches graduate-level classes in the HCI program at DePaul University as well as at the Illinois Institute of Art in the Web Design and Interactive Media department. She is also a runner, an avid reader, a Whovian, and a video game lover.Follow Danyell on Twitter @danyelljonesWondering how to ask better questions to avoid the mistakes we talked about? We recommend this book for every level of experience: Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights by Steve Portigal\xa0 | A UX Cake Pop is like a bite-sized piece of UX Cake.\xa0In this Cake Pop, we're talking about being more effective through getting buy-in early. We interviewed a few UX pros who were attending the Interaction19 conference while we were there, and got lots of great responses to our question: What's the biggest challenge you've been dealing with in your work lately? We got a great response from\xa0Marie Williams, who’s the founder and CEO of Dream Networks CIC in London, about both the difficulty and the importance of getting buy in. This is something that’s often at the root of why something might be either a success or a failure, and it’s also something that can be easy to forget about when we’re in the throws of a project and trying to move quickly and maybe not thinking about who we need to bring along.\xa0So if you’ve struggled with how to get buy-in, know that you are not alone.We’ve at least touched on it in many UX Cake episodes, because it’s so core to getting anything important done. And there’s not a one-size-fits-all answer for how to get buy in, but, there has been a lot of great advice from the pros I’ve talked with on UX Cake. Way back in\xa0episode 2 I talked with long-time executive Eva Manolis about getting buy-in for UX, and she shared how her teams got buy-in for design & research at Amazon. Then in\xa0episode 10 Tamara Adlin shared her technique of creating personas with executives, which creates alignment up-front but also brings those executives into the process of defining who you’re solving problems for, and what their needs and motivations are. And most recently in\xa0episode 28, Marty Neumeier talked about a framework which puts everyone together in framing the problem and identifying solutions, which is crucial for getting buy in from the team and from each decision maker. If you’re having trouble getting buy-in, you might also check out\xa0episode #14 with Fiz Yazdi - she created an approach to selling your ideas that’s based on a consulting selling strategy — and has a lot to do with understanding what those you want to “sell” to are motivated by, and what their objective is.TQWQvZv54Ev5vW2a7L7uConnect with UX Cake!Website:\xa0uxcake.co\xa0Facebook\xa0Twitter\xa0Instagram\xa0Subscribe to our newsletterDonate to UX Cake to keep the podcast going\xa0Subscribe to UX Cake:\xa0iTunes|\xa0Stitcher\xa0\xa0|\xa0Email", 'chan_desc': 'Helping you become more effective in your UX work and career.

Finding time to grind on your side hustle.I’m hella qualified to talk on this topic because I’ve gotten pretty damn good at:carving out pockets of time in my dayto knock out my top prioritiesthat align with my main goal/vision.In five years, I’ve been able to build Perspective-Collective, freelance, and handle a weekly podcast all outside of my full-time job. Not to mention, I’m a husband and father to the dopest little dude this side of the Mississippi.This shit isn’t easy, and I’m not trying to brag. I’m just trying to convince you that if I can do it, anyone can.If finding time to grind is one of your biggest pain points, I feel the following system can improve your productivity immediately.Note: I also have this available as a guide in the Side Hustler’s War Chest. In case you missed that, you can download it here.#1. Take One Bite at a TimeIt’s easy to feel like you’re not doing enough when you see someone else crushing it. Often, our ambition is larger than our reality, and we feel we have to eat the full pizza in one bite.While it’s great you want to start a weekly podcast, vlog, and newsletter all at once, biting off more than you can chew can set yourself up for failure if you:Attempt to do all of this outside a day jobHave family responsibilitiesDon’t have a defined process built into your routineI started posting consistent drawings on Instagram in the spring of 2014. I then took on weekly blogging in June 2015, then added a newsletter in October 2015. I began the weekly podcast in August 2016. In between, I’d sprinkle in some freelancing, public speaking, teaching workshops, and selling products.There’s no way in hell I’d still be trucking along had I attempted to do all of this right from the jump.I suggest taking things slow and steady, as we’re looking to accomplish long-term consistency.Start with one bite at a time by setting ambitious (yet realistic) expectations and taking action.Once you lock down your process, take a bigger bite by slowly baking the next thing into your routine.#2. Plan Your AttackI’m discovering the most successful people I look up to don’t roll out of bed and shit productivity—they schedule their success.When I stopped winging it and planned my daily attack, it made decision-making so much easier.Here’s how I plan my attack:1. MAKE A WEEKLY TASK LIST ON SUNDAYYou can list these by hand or with digital apps like Wunderlist, Notion, or Evernote. Update your list accordingly as things pop up during the weekCarry over the remaining tasks from the previous week.2. PRIORITIZE THEM WITH MY CREATIVE GRIND (ABC) SYSTEM*List up to 7 tasks per each letter (7 days in a week = 1 task a day)A1-A7: High Priority Tasks to Attack that move the needle forwardB1-B7: Medium Priority Tasks that are cooking on the Back Burner-C1-C7 Low Priority Tasks that would be Cool to get done or should be delegatedD: Insignificant Tasks should be Destroyed*Those in my coaching program get to be the first guinea pigs for a basic and more advanced version of my Creative Grind System.3. PLAN YOUR FOLLOWING DAY’S TASKSHere’s a quick glimpse of how I list my next day’s attack:Each night, I plan out the next day’s blocks of time I have to grind (morning, lunch, breaks, evenings)I’ll create fields for tasks A1-A3, B1, and C1I’ll then pluck from the top weekly tasks list and plug them into the designated fieldsWhen you knock out your A1 task, cross it off your daily attack and weekly list. Then proceed to A2 and A3.Sometimes, you may only have a small window of time so knocking out the B1 task makes sense.Only knock out the C task if you get through all A and B tasks for that day.THE GOALThe goal is to knock out and cross off AT LEAST one A task a day.Crossing that A task off your list becomes a productivity habit-forming addiction!Depending on your schedule and goals, tweak this and find what works for you!#3. Eat the WormI’m a night owl by default, but waking up early and eating the worm has been the catalyst for the growth of my side hustle.There are three reasons why mornings are my jam:It creates more time to grind:It prioritizes my dream firstI put a large dent in my A1 task before going to the day jobFor me, productivity lies in doing the most important task first—the one that will scale my business. These big tasks typically require the most willpower.Oddly enough, the most important tasks that move my business forward and require the most willpower have nothing to do with drawing—they have everything to do with writing.Writing is the backbone to my side hustle. I write practically every day with the podcast, the coaching program, workshops, speeches, Instagram captions, product details, landing pages, email campaigns, etc.Working a day job and opening myself up to the world’s distractions takes a massive toll on my willpower. There’s no way I have the focus or desire to do my best writing after I clock out from work or after I put my son to bed.Getting up early and eating the worm sucked in the beginning and still sucks today.I had to adjust by using the hack of getting up 10-20 minutes earlier each week.This significantly helped me adjust instead of making the switch from 6:30 am to 4:30 am. This is an example of a bite-sized change mentioned in #1.Grinding before the world wakes up provides the best focus for me, and maybe it could for you.To get the results you’ve never had, you have do something you’ve never done.I’ve made hard changes in my routine to chase that productivity-high. It gets easier to adjust when you begin to see the progress.I realize there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to this, as everyone’s schedules and responsibilities are different.Start by determining when you have the most willpower in the day. Then carve out time and act on your A1 task.#4. Play UNOPlaying Uno ties into #2 and is my way of saying “focus on doing one thing each day that will help get you the best results.”Looking at that massive to-do list can be overwhelming. It’s hard to know where to start, so you become paralyzed from taking action.This is why we take that weekly task list and prioritize it to create a plan of attack.Focusing on the one thing you planned the night before (the A1 task) makes the game winnable and easier to manage.Note: to reiterate #2, when you knocked out the A1 task for the day, you then shift your target to A2.It’s hard not to feel accomplished and experience progress when you knock the main thing off your list each day. You and momentum become best friends when you optimize your system for maximum badassery.#5. Eliminate DistractionsIt’s so easy for us to get distracted because we’ve become glued to our phones, computers, smartwatches, and TVs. We’re “too connected” and don’t want to miss out on anything and everything.I’ve had to discipline myself to eliminate distractions.When it’s grind time, I have to prepare my environment so I can get into the zone.KILL SOCIAL MEDIA NOTIFICATIONSFor me, I kill all notifications on my phone except for texts and calls in case of an emergency.I personally have a strong belief that you do not need social media notifications on your phone. That shit will distract you from keeping the main thing the main thing.USE DND MODEI always have Do Not Disturb Mode set on my phone from 9 PM–6 AM, so nothing distracts me before bed until after I eat the worm and play Uno. I’ll even turn on DND Mode when I need to practice a speech, record the podcast, or get lost in a drawing.SET APP LIMITS & NOTIFICATIONSOn iOS, you can set App Limits to put time constraint reminders on apps you tend to overuse.You can also enable notifications to let you know how much screen time you’ve been using to keep yourself in check.OPTIMIZE YOUR ENVIRONMENTFor me, having a clean desk/office, closing the door, and having one screen on for willpower tasks like writing helps me find my zone.As much as I love my cats, having them crawl all over me and knocking shit over on my desk while I work is a no-go.Overall, protect and value the time you’ve carved out for yourself to grind—no one else will do that for you.#6. Say NO, so You Can Say YESYour secret weapon for creating more time is a muscle you don’t flex often enough.You gotta learn how to say NO, NOPE, and NAH, I’M GOOD.If you constantly use the excuse of “I never have time,” it’s times to switch your language to “I haven’t made it a priority.”I should know because this excuse was my default for everything. Any margin of time I had got filled up because I was a professional over-committer who didn’t understand the power of saying NO.Of course, you can’t make something a priority because you said YES to something else when you should’ve said NO!It’s really simple: saying YES fills your time and saying NO creates more time for what’s most important.THE HELL YES FILTERCreate a filter for yourself—if an opportunity comes your way, and it’s not an instant HELL YES that aligns with your main vision, then it’s an immediate HELL NO.THE HELL NO LISTAnother step to help you frame your Hell-Yes filter is by creating a list of No’s and Hell-No’s. That way, you have set guidelines to stick to when decent opportunities come knocking.This filter and list will clamp down on letting people and stupid, non-essential tasks steal your time.Take Yourself SeriouslyEveryone has what it takes to execute their side hustle outside their day job.The problem is that people struggle to grind on their side hustle because they lack a system and some discipline.Regardless if you’re a night owl or early bird, make notes of these ideas—I know they can help you see results ASAP.It all boils down to—how badly do you want it?

Prepare to take some notes!Hopefully, there\'s a missing piece here that gets you one step closer to putting your peculiar yet promising puzzle together.1. Have a Plan & Show Up with IntentionHow comfortably can you answer the following questions with conviction?What do you want to accomplish in life and why?Who do you want to become and why?Who do you want to serve/make an impact on and why?Figuring out the answers requires a lot of time, soul searching, and uncomfortable dialogue in your head.Once you\'re able to tap into that vision, reverse engineer that dream so you can pinpoint the steps you need to take.From here, you\'re able to layout short-term and long-term S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound) goals that align with the vision.A goal without a plan is just a wish, so knowing what you want and developing a gameplan are crucial.When you know what you want and have outlined your steps, there\'s less room for guessing on what you should be working on each day.Having a plan makes it much easier to attack the top task that moves you closer to your goal each day.Note: If you lack a plan or system for making time to work on your side hustle, you\'re going to love next week\'s part 3 episode. I\'m giving you 6 Ways to Carve Out Time to Grind & Execute Outside Your Day Job.2. Be ConsistentMy favorite quote about consistency comes from Sean McCabe (Seanwes)."Nobody notices announcements, people notice consistency.It\'s time for a hard dose of reality and some tough love.There\'s no way you should be complaining about the promise of your side hustle when you\'ve only:been doing it for a few weeks to a few monthsinvested an hour or two a weekposted a few times on social media here and there and told a few friendsPeople won\'t notice shit until you consistently stay in front of them and make it crystal clear what you\'re doing.You have to remind people that you exist, and you do this with—you guessed it—a plan.One of the best ways to do this is to lock down a systemic routine of when you\'ll create and when you\'ll post.FrequencyI recommend sharing AT LEAST once a week, as we tend to be creatures of weekly cycles (e.g. weekly episodes of our favorite TV shows or Monday Night Football).Daily output is going to get your faster results, of course. This isn\'t realistic for many people and can easily lead to burnout.Weekly is a manageable output that anyone can figure out. Start with something small and add more to your plate as you build it into your routine.DurationIf this is something you\'re good at and it lights you up, I feel a minimum of six months of pursuing it with maximum effort is the least you can do. I\'d highly recommend pushing it easily to 1-2 years if it\'s bringing you any of the 9 benefits I mentioned in last week\'s episode.It took me in the 1-2 year range to really start finding my footing. Currently, my fifth year is when I\'m really finding my stride.It. Takes. Time.It\'s not always about reaching the most people in the beginning, but the right people slowly over the years.3. Be PersistentI wanted this one to rhyme with Be Consistent because I like to have a good time and unwind with a rhyme outside design.News Flash: it\'s not easy pursuing something that\'s important to you—it\'s a straight-up rollercoaster ride, as you\'re being tested at every turn.You\'re going to experience plenty of shitty moments along your creative grind. There will be plenty of people that will attempt to rain on your parade. You gotta keep pushing to bathe in those sunny days when you\'ve tapped into your creatively-fulfilled zone.I don\'t\' have enough fingers or toes to count how many battles of self-doubt, depressed funks, haters, financial emergencies, etc. I\'ve faced when pursuing my side hustle. I do know that every shit storm I\'ve weathered has made me stronger.Every time you get knocked down, it\'s your responsibility to get back up and keep swinging. It\'s called responsibility because you have the ability to respond.Each time you get back up, you\'re adding a new bruise or scar that you can add to the "hard lessons learned jar" and use it as fuel.As cliche as it sounds...if it was easy, everyone would do it.It\'s not easy, but gritting it out because it\'s important to you will always be worth it.Don\'t find yourself on your death bed wondering, "What would life look like had I gotten back up to fight another day?"4. Stop Trying to Be PizzaWhat fun would this be if I didn\'t include something pizza-related?My life motto has become, "You can\'t make everyone happy, you\'re not pizza."It\'s my filter that I run everything through when I show up each day.It\'s insanely hard to gain traction when you feel you have to reach every human in every pocket of the planet when you hit publish.The harder you try to reach the masses, the harder it is to land on that one soul who needs what you have to offer.Attempting to please everyone usually means you\'re riding the fence and playing it safe. You\'re scared to have a strong opinion, as it could drive someone away.James Victore on episode 117 would call this being "Oatmeal." Don\'t be Oatmeal.All it takes is one person at a time to attract that like-minded tribe of freaks who vibe to your flavor of weird.Instead of going for width, go for depth.Embrace who you are, share what\'s true to yourself, and keep the perfect person in mind when you hit publish (even if it\'s yourself).More importantly, disregard the thoughts and opinions of the haters. What you put into the world wasn\'t meant for them anyways.5. Find Your Secret SauceWhat\'s the secret sauce, and how do you make it?The starting base to your secret sauce: find the overlap of your greatest strength and greatest passion. This is called your sweet spot, and it\'s something I learned from Ken Coleman of The Entreleadership Podcast.You\'re going to have a hard time finding success with your side hustle if it\'s:something you\'re good at but don\'t enjoysomething you love doing, but you suck ass at it doingThe quick way to go about this is to make two-circle Venn Diagram.StrengthsOn the left, list your strengths.These could be things you can naturally thrive in that others find difficult.It could be skills you\'ve acquired for hours you\'ve spent learning a trade or craft.Taking a StrengthsFinder2.0 test can help you peel back another layer and reveal some deeper answers.PassionsOn the right, list your passions—the things that light you up and leave you feeling fulfilled.These are the things you zone out and lose track of time doing.It could be the thing that keeps you up at night because your mind is bursting with ideas.At the same time, it could be the thing that gets you jazzed to get out of bed each day.Bonus Points: ask friends and family to list out what they feel your greatest strengths and passions are so you can locate patterns.Secret Ingredient #3It takes some time and a lot of experimentation to find your secret sauce, but once you do, you can add in the third and final ingredient.That third ingredient is your market. I\'m talking about your target audience or perfect follower that your sweet spot provides value or a solution to.Now that\'s a whole other can of worms, but hopefully, it has you thinking of the value you bring to the table with your secret sauce.Note: I highly recommend Seth Godin\'s book This is Marketing to go deeper on this topic. Get his audiobook for FREE here.Putting it All TogetherIt\'s easier said than done, but implementing these tips into your side hustle is no doubt going to help you maximize your efforts and see results.Yes, everything starts with a plan. However, practicing self-discipline, having some grit, and understanding the value you provide is crucial for taking your side hustle to the next level.That\'s all a part of the process, but the energy and effort is worth it once you find your stride.Need Some Extra Help?

In fact, I\'d say the majority of people don\'t go this route.You were sold the dream of the traditional route of getting student loans to fund college, so you can land a good job.You then get married, get a mortgage, have kids, and do the same routine day-in and day-out.The goal is to pay your dues at your day job to help someone else’s dream come true in hopes of retiring around sixty. Supposedly, that\'s when your life begins?If you\'re like me, you\'ve realized this isn\'t your dream at all.Something deep inside you craves to go against the grain and blaze your own path.I\'ve had this internal craving since college where I was creating tattoos, logos, etc. to pay for video games and 30 packs of Busch Light.This craving has only grown stronger as I\'ve spent over five years building Perspective-Collective outside my day job.Trust me when I say I\'ve invested thousands of hours and two power plants worth of energy into finding ways to transform my hobbies into a monetized side hustle/side business—all outside a day job.I’ve figured out what works through A TON of trial and error (extra emphasis on the error part).No doubt, it\'s been a lot of work to navigate this ship to where it\'s sailing today. Regardless of the storms and choppy waters I\'ve dealt with along the way, every ounce of effort I\'ve invested in my dream has been worth it.Pursue Your Gift & Make an ImpactIf you’re not fully convinced nor confident that you’re ready to invest in the long haul, I have 9 super-convincing benefits of side hustling to share with ya.Before I begin, I feel it\'s important to note that there\'s nothing wrong with having a day job.You may have landed one that you love and have no desire to do your own thing full-time. That\'s totally cool!You also may be in a position where you\'ll be in your day job for a while due to personal situations like mine. That\'s cool too!This episode is solely fuel for satisfying that inner craving to do more with your gift. That\'s it!Without further ado, the following benefits are based on my experience, as well as anecdotal evidence from my juggernaut creative friends and podcast guests.#1. Find Your PurposeThis is #1 for a reason because I know what it\'s like to feel like you have nothing to offer the world.If you go to bed each night without something to look forward to, something is wrong. It’s time to change that with a side hustle that feels like play.I\'m jazzed to get up each day because of my side hustle of helping other creatives build their killer side hustles.I look forward to putting in the work and reapings these 9 benefits that come with it.Life is dull and unfulfilling when you lack a purpose—side hustles can change that.#2. Cultivate Killer RelationshipsYou may have heard the phrases, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know” or “Your network = your net worth.” I believe both of these are 100% true.I also believe in the quote from Jim Rhome, “You’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”Relationships are everything. Your side hustle can help connect you with like-minded people who have similar goals, work ethics, and values.Two things to keep top of mind:Always focus on giving more than you takeCreate as many win-win scenarios as possible for both partiesYou’ll be surprised by the genuine and abundant friendships you’ll build through your side hustle over time.#3. Attract a Tribe of Like-Minded Freaks"Embracing your weird" seems to be the storyline of 2019 and I\'m all for it—the weirder the better.Starting a side hustle or a passion project allows you to go deep on things that interest YOU.It\'s a playground to experiment and embrace the YOU in YOU-nique.Chances are you\'re not alone—your weird quirks and qualms are most certainly shared by other weirdos.When you publicly share and own your YOU-niquness, you increase the odds of attracting a like-minded tribe of freaks who vibe to your unique flavor of weird.Then you circle back to Benefit #2 and cultivate killer relationships—it\'s a win-win.#4. Add New Skills to Your ArsenalThis one is obvious but important to stress. My side hustle has allowed me to learn skills that I’ve been able to leverage for raises at work, charge more in freelance, and attract more opportunities.Pursuing Perspective-Collective has taught me how to:become a better artist/designeradvance my lettering/illustration skillsmarket myself on social mediagrow my email listimprove my writing through bloggingedit audio and video through the podcastmanage projects and my personal timeattract an audience and communitypitch, price, and present my ideascommunicate and delegateI could keep going, but you get the picture. Whatever you want to learn, you can create a passion project around it.#5. Build Confidence & Overcome FearI had little to no confidence in myself or my abilities for about the first 24-25 years of my life...until I started Perspective-Collective.I was able to find my groove when I shared my work consistently on Instagram.Facing the things I feared the most—like sharing my work, speaking in public, asking for what I wanted in life, or saying NO to people—has resulted in some incredible breakthroughs in my creative career.Leaning into this fear has helped me unlock confidence in my purpose, my creative abilities, and my mission.Side hustling builds confidence when you\'re persistently getting uncomfortable. Period.#6. Turn Your Work into PlayHobbies are fun and having fun = play.There are no set-in-stone requirements that you have to turn that hobby into a side hustle, especially if your play begins to feel like work.If your side hustle isn’t fun, it’s just another soul-sucking job. Keep your inner creative child alive and enjoy the messy process.However, when your work becomes play, your potential is unlimited. The passion and fun will fuel you during the low moments.#7. Make an ImpactI used to chase the glory: more money, more followers, more engagement, etc. However, when I focused on serving people and the impact I had on them, I found a lot of these manifest as a byproduct.Creating for impact means contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater whole.Making an impact leaves a legacy far after I\'m buried six feet deep.I’m hoping the podcast and the Side Hustler\'s Coaching Program are things my son can be proud of and people can find value in for years to come.#8. Generate Extra IncomeWho doesn’t love to make a little extra money on the side?For me, money isn\'t the focus anymore, it\'s become a byproduct of Benefit #7 and serving people like you.I\'ve learned that money and opportunities will come your way when you\'re ready and prepared for them.Here are multiple ways you can make supplemental income with your side hustle: freelancing, slanging merch, creating digital products, consulting, coaching, teaching, influencer marketing, social media marketing, content creation, affiliates, etc.For me, I’ve done a little bit of everything. The extra income I\'ve generated over the years has helped me pay off credit cards, put a down payment on my wife\'s whip, cover emergency medical expenses, take vacations, donate to charities like Inch x Inch, and even buy special gifts for the lovely lady in my life.Even if extra income isn’t your intent with your side hustle, just know there\'s a good chance you could probably monetize what you’re doing.#9. Win Your FreedomAgain, maybe you’re not looking to take your side hustle full-time, and that’s totally okay. I know tons of powerhouse creatives who still hold down a day job like Brian Steely and Nick Slater.If you\'re like me, you eventually strive to do your thing full-time.I have a game plan to get there, but I\'m still a few years away from taking that leap.However, I’ve seen how side hustles and passion projects has unlocked financial and time freedom for my friends like Pandr Design, Lauren Hom, Musketon, and Elizabeth Gray of The Grayter Good.When they started to take their side hustle more seriously, they were able to evolve them into lucrative creative careers.Why can’t this be you and me too?Share Your Gift with the WorldMaybe you\'re ready to transform your hobby to a side hustle.Maybe you\'re ready to take your side hustle to the next level?Whatever it is, I hope you see the crazy benefits a side hustle can yield when you tap into your gifts and share it with the world.So what if you have a day job? Don\'t let that hold you back from building a side hustle.Leverage your day job to fuel your dream job, and have some fun in the process!Need Some Extra Help?

AbdelnourI\'ve been side hustling for a hot minute now. One of my bigger side hustles was right out of college when a buddy and I started a clothing brand called Daydreamin\' Clothing Incorporated. We quickly changed it to Company because we were far from a corporation, but it just sounded cool.Well, before lettering was a thing on Instagram, I was making hand-lettered logos and graphics for our brand back in 2010.We started off with our logo on a few shitty Gildan logo tees, then ordered some business cards through Vista Print and called ourselves a business.While our original launch was hot garbage, I\'m proud of it because we were young dreamers taking big action.Those first few logo tees evolved into more complex designs as we filed an LLC.Two years into it, we were sponsoring rappers, skaters, motocross bikers, and local "influencers."Three years into it, we were hosting events at clubs, doing pop-ups shops, and getting in brick and mortar and online stores like Kazbah.We were making shit happen and figuring it out along the way.My partner was the point-of-contact string-puller, accountant, and fulfillment manager.I was obviously the artist, designer, and the marketing/promo lead.We balanced each other out well and brought in help for extra support.In our fourth year, we were getting serious and ready to elevate our product offerings.We lined up a huge investor and locked down a warehouse for creating custom threads and patterns for whatever we could scheme up.This was the turning point—it became a shit or get off the pot kind of thing.The Banana SplitMy partner was all-in and ready to quit his job to pursue this.I was in the middle of changing day jobs, had a new mortgage, and was sitting on a pile of private student loan debt. I wasn\'t as eager to take the risk and wanted to keep doing this as my secondary "full-time" side hustle.Things went sour when we discussed splitting shares of the company if we went with the investor. We didn\'t see eye-to-eye on percentages and my partner felt like he could make this dream happen on his own. We ended up making like a banana and split.That\'s when I started Perspective-Collective in 2014. I had made up my mind I was going solo, and I thought I didn\'t need anyone\'s help to get to where I wanted to be in life.I spent the first year obsessively learning hand-lettering and posting daily on Instagram. I slowly began developing my style, finding my voice,  and growing an audience.I hit a wall the second year.I felt called to do more than just share pretty polished Instagram posts. However, I was trapped in my little Cedar Falls, Iowa, bubble and had no idea what the next step was.I felt so isolated and stuck, but the cure was doing something radical to rattle my comfort cage.Rattling the Comfort CageI found the Creative South Conference through Instagram and made a decision I was going to find a way to attend.After my successful proposal to my day job, I flew to Columbus, GA, for a life-changing experience in April 2015.This conference allowed me to attach myself to people doing things I didn\'t know were possible. It revealed the next steps and provided answers to questions I didn\'t even know I was seeking.Most importantly, it showed me the power of getting around like-minded people who knew more than I did. This is the power of community.I went home on fire and immediately joined the Seanwes community. They welcomed me with open arms at the conference and eliminated the feeling of isolation. It was a pricey investment, but definitely worth it in the grand scheme of things.Find Your Wolf PackFrom there, I joined an accountability group for the next level of connection.Along the way, I would pick up mentors like Jason Craig and Brian Manley, who took me under their wing in regards to public speaking.Every year, my side hustle evolved as I added something new to the tool belt. Drawing turned into blogging. Blogging turned into speaking. Speaking turned into a podcast. Somewhere in between, I started teaching workshops and selling products.Doing all of this outside my day job has helped me build my own community. It\'s put me in a position where I can pursue coaching other creatives to build something of their own outside their day jobs.The point I want to make? None of this would have happened if I thought I had all the answers and had been too prideful to ask for help. I\'ve had help at each step along the way.Yes, sometimes, you have to to be the lone wolf and make mistakes in order to learn and push forward.In my experience, seeking out a wolf pack and asking for help allows you to bypass obstacles and get on the fast track for growth much quicker than being a lone wolf.Wolves survive and thrive by being in packs.If you\'re tired of feeling stuck and isolated on an island, I have a few levels for finding your wolf pack.Level 1: Find CommunityFinding community was the spark I needed to get off my island.Going to a conference—where I didn\'t know a soul—and leaving with people I considered family changed the game.I can\'t stress enough how important it is to get around like-minded people who are doing or strive to do the same thing you\'re trying to accomplish.Finding a community doesn\'t have to revolve around money. If you can\'t afford a conference or an online "gated" community, don\'t sweat it.There are free communities on Facebook, Slack, Instagram DM Groups, Online Forums, etc. that you can start with.In fact, it\'s the main reason I created The Perspective-Collective FREE private group. I want hungry side hustlers like you to be able to access like-minded creatives across the world sharing feedback, resources, and encouragement.This could be a great wolf pack to start with and we\'d love to have ya.Level 2: Join/Create an Accountability GroupOnce you join a community and start building a rapport with people, you\'ll notice there are certain individuals whom you most vibe with.These are perfect candidates to start an accountability group with.Think of this as your tightest homies in the wolf pack. You guys form your own mini wolf pack.When I was in the Seanwes group back in 2015-2016, I had a lot in common with people like Colin Tierney, Eric Friedensohn, and Terence Tang.We were all lettering artists who focused on kicking out content, producing products, and growing an audience.We formed a little accountability Slack group where we\'d do weekly Google Hangouts.This consisted of sharing:weekly progress updatesshort-term and long-term goalsbig winsareas for improvementthings we could use some extra accountability onWe slowly expanded our circle with more unique and like-minded people.Our group is still going and growing, and it\'s like a family reunion when we link up at conferences.Level 3A: Join a MastermindIf you\'ve outgrown what your community and accountability group can offer, a Mastermind could be what you\'re looking for.It\'s typically an exclusive niche group of high-performers in the same focus as you. You\'ll usually need an invite or have to pay to become a member.For example, someone like Lewis Howes has a gated community called the Inner Circle. If you want more access to him, extra accountability, and greater exposure to people who are doing what you do but at a higher level, you could pay and apply to join his Mastermind.This isn\'t always the case though. If you and a few from your accountability group are all hyper-growing in the same direction, you could evolve and create a tight-knit Mastermind that\'s laser-focused on helping each other scale your businesses.However, sometimes you may want something more intimate, hands-on, and more direct to someone. You just may need a coach or a mentor, which is where I am today.Level 3B: Hire a Coach or MentorThere\'s a bit of a difference between coaching and mentorship.Coaching is more of a short-term structured relationship while a mentor is a long-term relationship that could expand from coaching.Hand Holding & Holding FeetIn 2019, getting a coach has single-handedly elevated my side hustle business to the next level.Back in episode 101 last year in October, I talked about how my gut was telling me to take my business and podcast in a different direction.I knew I was ready to niche down and make a bigger impact in a focused direction, but I wasn\'t sure which steps to take.In February this year, I was fortunate enough to link up with Tom Ross, CEO of Design Cuts. In May, I started meeting with Hand Lettering Educator and Coach, Mye De Leon.Both immediately started helping me shape the bigger picture and held my feet to the fire to take action.I was stumbling in the right direction on my own, but progress was slow. However, getting help from coaches helped me gain clarity and traction quickly on this new path.These two have already accomplished what I strive to do and have helped others achieve similar results. I desperately needed them to hold my hand and teach me the ropes.Tom helped me embrace my identity as the Side Hustle Guy and how to communicate it to others. He also helped me build the Side Hustler\'s War Chest and explode my email list in the first month.Mye De Leon has been teaching me email marketing, copywriting, and setting up this 3-month Side Hustler\'s Coaching Program.Both have played pivotal roles in helping me lay the new foundation of Perspective-Collective moving forward.Not going to lie, coaching and mentors are an investment. However, you\'re able to easily get your ROI plus more if you find the right fit and apply yourself.The Biggest Names You Look Up to Invested in HelpThe people you see making the biggest waves in the creative industry have all sought out help one way or another.The following friends of the podcast are making huge waves. However, investing in business coaches or creative mentors sparked their breakthroughs. Read through their testimonials to see how a coach helped guide them to success.Pandr Design Co.After the first few months of starting our business, we knew we didn\'t know how to run it, what to charge, or how to get clients. Investing in a coach was the best choice we made for our business.The first 6 months we had an hour-long call every week, and the last 6 months we had an hour-long call once a month.Working with our coach helped us set bigger goals, get consistent clients coming in, have a pricing structure, etc. It built the foundation for the 6-figure business we run today.Lisa QuineI was just starting to think about life as a full-time freelancer. I knew nothing about running a business, so I knew I would need to do something to educate myself.I hired a coach running a summer special for two 1-hour phone calls for $500. She helped me get my thoughts aligned, pushing out the negative ones, and making sure my thoughts were on things like my goal, salary, marketing, etc.After our coaching sessions, she’s also hired me for 3 mural projects and gives me great exposure across Cleveland.Mye De LeonMy progress was slow. I wanted to move forward faster and leverage the knowledge of someone who’s been in the trenches and can teach me how I can reach my goals sooner.I found community first and then was recommended the right coach. We met twice a month and regularly chatted via Slack.Coaching helped me massively increase my email list, where I was able to pre-sell my course for $17k. I recommend getting a coach because it helps you achieve clarity and focus and gets you to where you want to go faster.Tom RossI had grown a large audience on my old design blog, but it was very disengaged and felt hollow. I was relying on advertising income and felt like I hadn’t built something truly long-term and meaningful.Meeting with my mentor once a week led to the biggest win of gaining clarity. I dropped all the annoying ads. I focused on engagement over vanity metrics.Truth be told, success came further down the line, in the form of my current company Design Cuts and my personal brand. But none of this could have happened without getting that earlier foundational clarity.Accelerate Your Growth & Provide ClarityTo summarize, being the lone wolf is hard. It\'s a lot easier to survive and thrive when a wolf pack of like-minded savage beasts has your back.It\'s doable, but side-hustling solo is hard. Attaching yourself to a community, accountability group, mastermind, coach and/or mentor will accelerate your growth and provide clarity.Don\'t be too proud to admit that you don\'t have it all figured out. The answer is always no if you don\'t ask for help!Having people help wall you through the forest is way quicker than blindly stumbling through it on your own.Get off your isolated island and find your wolf pack.Need Some Extra Help?

It’s easy to burn out and feel like you don’t have anyone in your corner during hard times.I tried doing it solo and shouldering the load by myself. It led to a lot of creative funks and wasted time.The people I did surround myself with couldn’t provide me any value or insight, so I continued to blindly try to find my path.I know I preach this often, but finding a creative community has been one of the biggest keys to my creative transformation. I wouldn’t have become the “side hustle pizza podcast guy” if I continued to pretend that I could figure it out on my own.Going to conferences is what opened my eyes to the power of relationships. They gave me a glimpse of my future potential and allowed me to attach myself to people who were doing what I strived to accomplish.Community is everything, and today’s guest is someone who’s building community and providing transformative experiences for creatives like you and me day-in and day-out.Today, I share the story of my buddy Josh Horton, and no, not the professional juggler.This Josh is the mastermind behind the conference, events, and workshops hosted by Creative Works, rooted in Memphis, TN.Josh and the Creative Works team bring in some of the biggest names in the world to help inspire, connect, and empower our creative community.He’s assembled an Avengers: End Game-like cast of juggernaut speakers and workshop leaders like Lisa Congdon, Lincoln Design Co., Adé Hogue, and Ty Mattson (to name a few).Plus, you know by now that your boy is doing a Live Podcast, and I’m bringing on the stage some past friends of the podcast.

Wouldn\'t it be weird as hell if they didn\'t celebrate that accomplishment?Now, think of this on a smaller scale—like getting a small $.50 raise or landing your first online sale. Isn\'t that something worth recognizing too?You\'d think that having any type of win, whether small or big, would be cause for some type of celebration.However, when you\'re wired like I am, a lot of these small wins gets shoved to the side because there are bigger mountains to climb.If you listened to last week\'s part one of this two-part episode series, you know the blessing and the curse that comes with being a mountain climber.It\'s great to constantly chase becoming the best version of yourself, but at the same time, you can\'t lose sight of life in between the mountains.Part two of this Climbing Mountains & Popping Bottles series is all about celebrating W\'s (wins), no matter how big or small they are.The L\'s From Not Acknowledging W\'sI\'ve mentioned this in the past, but back in April 2016, I had a life-changing speaking opportunity at Creative South Conference.It was the second talk I had ever given—opening for a Draplin keynote in front of a packed Springer Opera House of around 800 creative souls.This was by far the biggest thing I\'ve ever done. I came prepared and absolutely crushed it, which resulted in an overwhelming standing ovation.I proceeded to go backstage, take a shot of Jameson to calm my nerves, then party the last night away.I\'m bringing this up because this talk exploded my creative career —yet I can barely remember it.My biggest regret is failing to make time to be alone and reflect on it. Instead, I spent the next day hungover on my flight home working on an online presentation I was giving later that week.While my full talk is on my YouTube Channel, I\'ve still never been able to fully recreate that moment to soak up and appreciate.Avoiding the L\'sThis is the driving catalyst for why I\'m writing this today.The message I\'m trying to hammer in your head? You gotta pop bottles and acknowledge when good shit happens in your life.From my experience, when you constantly ignore when things go right in your life, you make it easier to get wrapped up in negativity when taking an L (loss).Not acknowledging wins:leads to burnout because nothing is ever good enoughincreases the odds of falling victim to comparisonstrengthens the inner critic\'s voiceLet\'s pivot into how we can avoid these atrocious, negative scenarios with two simple yet effective action steps.2 Ways to Celebrate W\'sAction Step #1: Acknowledge Them (duh)This is pretty self-explanatory, and I assume you saw this coming.Popping bottles is just a fancy metaphor for celebrating wins. Celebrating wins is just a more extravagant word for acknowledging the good things in your life.If you\'re not going to figuratively or literally pop bottles to celebrate, the least you could do is acknowledge those good things.From now on, it doesn\'t matter if I crush another speaking gig, celebrate a podcast download milestone, or pay off a small debt, all scenarios get acknowledged and/or celebrated by some form of:ordering pizza or having a glass of wine with my wife (not so much these days with my low carb, intermittent fasting lifestyle)doing a stupid ass little dance with my son Little Scotty the Thirdwriting down at least one thing I\'m grateful for each day in my Creative Grind plannersharing the win with my family in The Perspective-Collective Private Facebook Grouptexting my parents/best friends or posting it in my Slack Mastermind Groupgiving myself the day off to reflect or unplug (need to implement this one more)Yes, all of these are minor things and most don\'t require any form of blowing cheddar.More importantly, they allow me to press pause, appreciate the moment, and celebrate with other people.Acknowledging W\'s helps you time stamp these milestones in your noggin, so you can easily go back and relive that moment.THE CHALLENGE: Recognize your top win of the day by using one of my tactics or coming up with your own. Bonus points for taking a screenshot and sharing with me on your Instagram Stories.Action Step #2. Hoard Your VictoriesThis tactic has been a lifesaver for me!Some brief context: around the end of 2017, I was starting to slip into a depressed funk.People were posting their Instagram Top 9\'s, and it felt like everyone:created doper work than I didaccomplished bigger goals than I didmade more money than I didlived a bigger, more perfect life than I didThe inner critic was beating me down and convincing me that I was a worthless turd.The thing that snapped me back to reality was a little something I started doing at the beginning of February that year called Hoarding My Victories.I had recently pulled myself out of another depressed funk, which you can hear all about back in episode 25: Dealing With Creative Funks & Feeling Invisible. I don\'t know what inspired me to do this, but I started a little running tasklist in my Wunderlist App called Good Things in 2017.I wrote any type of positive thing that happened to me in this list.Most of my accomplishments were small like speaking to my mom\'s small women\'s group on "How to be Resourceful & Exercise At Home When You\'re Over the Age of 50."Other things I listed were huge—like selling out 400 Deneen Pottery UFO Cat mugs in under 25 minutes.Looking back on this list of accomplishments snapped me out of my funk.Hoarding my victories showed me that I did a lot of cool shit that year I should be proud of. It also reminded me I\'m running my own race at my own pace like as mentioned back in episode 132.I\'ve since revisited and marked wins from 2016 to and kept this hoarding momentum going in 2018 and 2019.Be a Wannabe Champagne PapiTo summarize this series, life is short. Be ambitious, never settle, and squeeze as much juice out of your limited existence as you can.At the same time, don\'t be afraid to be a wannabe Champagne Papi and pop a bottle or two in between climbing those mountains.Celebrate and hoard those W\'s. A win\'s a win and deserves to be acknowledged.Enjoy This Episode?If you enjoyed and found this episode value, I need your help spreading it!

Whenever he accomplished his main mission, he immediately set his sights on an even bigger target.Ya, it was cool that he accomplished something like being on the Warped Tour, but what\'s next?You know the phrase, "There are two sides to every coin?" To me, to be able to climb mountains and relentlessly pursue the next big accomplishment is no doubt a blessing. At the same time, it\'s a curse.The BlessingThe mountain-climbing business is a blessing as it enables you to:Tap into your potential.Cultivate a killer work ethic.Not gonna lie, I naturally gravitate towards people who operate in this fashion and love to observe them.I\'ve learned that these mountain climbers never settle—they\'re hungry, focused, inspired, and always pursuing the next peak to tame.They see the world through a different lens.Their pupils are glued straight ahead and upward. There\'s no time to break their gaze by looking down or behind them.Like a kid driven to dig out the prize buried in the bottom of a 90\'s cereal box, nothing will distract them from getting that prize.Does this sound like you or anyone you know?How to Know if You\'re a Mountain Climber ChecklistYou\'re a mountain climber if you:realize that life is short and you have to take matters into your own hands.have accepted that no one is going to deliver your dream to your front door like a fresh and hot pizza from your favorite local joint.welcome adversity and use failure as your fuel.aren\'t afraid to kick your own ass and show up when it\'s not convenient.Doesn\'t this sound like a fucking glorious modern-day creative Chuck Norris lifestyle?How could this mindset be any other than a blessing?If you haven\'t guessed it by now, I\'m a mountain climber.Trust me when I say this roundhouse kick approach to your creative grind comes with a cost.The CurseSeduced by "Success" & Blinded by ComparisonI transformed into a mountain climber when I got a little taste of what I thought was "success" back around 2013/2014.I became tunnel-visioned and borderline-obsessed with my side hustle when:My artwork started gaining traction on Instagram.Internet people started following my art and sending me praise.People started to pay me for my work.I\'d get asked to speak or teach at big creative conferences.While cool shit was happening in my life, the comparison trap made it impossible to appreciate any progress I made during my climb.I was convinced that I had gotten such a late start to the game compared to my creative peers and idols.This eliminated my need to live in the moment and soak up wins, whether big or small.What was the point when someone else had more followers, bigger clients, or bigger keynotes on bigger stages?I couldn\'t appreciate what I had or was doing because I needed more—I was too focused on "what\'s next."I thought being obsessive about climbing bigger and better mountains was the key to surpassing all these people.The "Hustle Culture" SyndromeAnother downside to this "what\'s next" mentality is becoming jaded by the "Hustle Culture." You begin to believe that you have burn the candle at both ends to advance.To ascend and dominate the next mountain, you sign your permission slip to lose sleep by working early and grinding hard late into the night.You tell yourself it\'s okay to eat shitty for convenience, skip the gym, and blow off people (even loved ones) because you begin to think these things are distractions.Next thing you know: you\'re burnt out, feeling like shit, have zero energy, and have no support.Working Smarter + Self-Awareness = Smart HustleBy all means, work your ass off. Don\'t let anyone tell you can\'t climb a mountain, as I\'m all about going against the grain and making shit happen for yourself.However, I\'ve learned this lesson the hard way. I\'ve gone through burnout, ruined relationships, and hating the way I felt when looking in the mirror.Five years into my side hustle, I\'m still a constant work-in-progress.My failures have taught me that there can be a beautiful balance of working hard and not working at all."Cool" vs. "Not Cool"To find this beautiful balance, I think it\'s important to establish "cool" vs. "not cool" scenarios.Hitting a big milestone is "cool", but\'s it\'s more "cool" to have people in your corner to celebrate with (more on that in part two of this series).I understand that, once in a while, you may have to do an all-nighter to hit a deadline...but accepting this as the norm is "not cool."What\'s "cool" is getting sleep, taking care of your mental, physical, and even spiritual being to have the energy to work smarter, not harder.What\'s "not cool" is digging yourself an early grave because you work non-stop with no light at the end of the tunnel.What\'s "cool" is learning how to take breaks, delegating the non-essential, disconnecting, and having hobbies that let you recharge and refuel your inspiration tank.If you\'re a mountain climber like me, these "cool" areas tend to be our biggest struggles.This is why I\'ve been implementing a week off from the podcast every seven weeks, so I can inject reoccurring lights at the end of the tunnel.I\'m still early into this, but it\'s already helped immensely. I\'m not feeling as overwhelmed, and I give myself a well-deserved day off.Be Cooler Than Chuck NorrisYes, Chuck Norris is cool. He has his own genre of jokes, and even though the dude is almost 80, he can still kick almost anyone\'s ass.However, what\'s cooler than being a modern-day creative Chuck Norris is kicking ass on your creative grind while still being able to see the bigger picture: the importance of health and relationships.What I\'m really trying to say is, when you\'re climbing mountains, don\'t forget to look down and live in the in-between moments.Don\'t let life pass you by because you\'re too focused on "what\'s next." You can have your cake and eat it too with some "Smart Hustle."Stick with me as Part 2 is all about popping bottles and learning how to celebrate all W\'s, big and small.Enjoy This Episode?If you enjoyed and found this episode value, I need your help spreading it!

The comparison trap and burnout.Often, one fuels the other and vice versa. You compare your work and consistency to those who seem to be doing more, and it\'s all-too-easy to burn yourself out.Or you get burnt out because you\'re not living the curated life people seem to be living on your phone.Those are just a few examples, but I\'m sure you could think of 50 more scenarios off the top of your dome in less than a minute.That\'s because we all struggle with these dilemmas. I personally feel it\'s because many of us, including myself, haven\'t defined success for ourselves. We\'re wrapped up in what success is for others.Today\'s guest, ever since she was a curious young girl trying to figure out her place in the world, has been blazing her own path and defining what success means for her.I\'m talking about my talented friend Lauren Dickens. She is the All-Star of Type, the MVP of Branding, and the reigning Player of the Year when it comes to Illustrations.She slays work from her home court of Austin, Texas, for some of the biggest brands in the world like Facebook, Target, and SXSW (to name a few).Today "El Dick" and I go deep on:Tips and process for client relationships, pitching, and presentingHow constraints breed creativity with your workHow to defined your own successHow to light your spark when you\'re burnt outTypography, the NBA, chickens with old lady names, and more.Enjoy This Episode?If you enjoyed and found this episode value, I need your help spreading it!

If you don\'t have a plan, strategy, or ability to show up regardless of what people will think, it’s practically impossible to take action.When you don\'t value your time, it\'s hard to know when to say no, when to charge more, or when to create boundaries.I personally believe you won\'t succeed in transforming your hobbies into a monetized side hustle or business without cultivating these two skills.Cultivating those two skills will no doubt help you fail faster, overcome adversity, and maximize your progress.Hailing from Memphis, Tennessee, Allie and Clare of Pretty Useful Co. crush these two areas in their personal lives and side hustles. They make clever goods for fun people that are...pretty useful (like their notorious pin keeper).They\'ve turned a passion project into a monetized side-business, and I feel their experience and knowledge will definitely help you figure out your next step in your creative grind—whether you pursue merch or not.Today, Pretty Useful Co. and I talk about:Protecting your timeTaking action, which leads to inspiration/motivationStarting your own merch businessSetting boundaries for yourselfCorgis, Vendors, Processes, Pizza, and moreEnjoy This Episode?If you enjoyed and found this episode value, I need your help spreading it!

His theory on positive ageing stated that life consists of Four Ages, with the Third Age being that period immediately after retirement,generally characterised by health, vigour, on-going personal achievement and a positive attitude to life.  The truth is that we all want to remain living well and independently into our Third Age for as long as we can. How can designers approach the design of interior spaces, both public and private, that will allow people to enjoy every aspect of their lives to the full, for the longest possible time?Lori Pinkerton-Rolet, Principal at Park Grove Design, a Past President of the British Institute of Interior Design, and an expert practitioner in this field joins us to explore the challenges and the opportunites of designing for the Third Age.This episode is recorded in the Clerkenwell showroom of Hitch Mylius. Our thanks to series partners, Trade at Houseology, for making this recording possible. | More than half of all design projects fall outside of the private residential realm. In the workplace, healthcare, education, hospitality and residential development sectors, interior designers are frequently creating schemes for 'clients' that they never meet.Dean Keyworth, Principal at Armstrong Keyworth and a Past President of the British Institute of Interior Design, is our guest as we explore this important and challenging aspect of design. We look at the pressures facing designers on projects where commercial success, or, indeed, failure often rests on the designer’s ability to accurately predict the needs and aspirations of the imagined end user. We also unearth the tricks of the trade that can be employed to achieve the right design and commercial goals. This episode is recorded in the Clerkenwell showroom of Danish furniture brand, NORR11. Our thanks to series partners, Trade at Houseology, for making this recording possible. | In the latest episode, we’re looking at the relationship between architects and interior designers. Do architects and interior designers get on? And, if not, why not? Some architects are known to dismiss interior designers as mere cushion fluffers whilst interior designers can see architects as patronising at best and bullying at worst. Do these views still hold sway today? Have designers and architects learned to collaborate effectively? And, is there room in today’s challenging construction industry for them both?Susie and Jeff are joined in this frank disussion by John Tehan, Director at the renowned London practice, Smallwood Architects. Founded by Christopher Smallwood in 1976, Smallwood Architects was set up to provide a very personal service to clients, delivering beautiful buildings of the highest quality.This episode is recorded in the Farringdon showroom of modular furniture specialist, USM. Our thanks to series partners, Trade at Houseology, for making this recording possible. | We examine the secrets of successful sourcing in another live audience special. Once upon a time, interior designers were only as good as the contents of their “little black book”. Favoured suppliers and specialist tradespeople were jealously guarded secrets.In today’s age of the internet and globalisation, we’re in a different place but one where designers can still add value to their client’s projects through clever sourcing. But how?Sharing their insights with co-hosts Jeff Hayward and Susie Rumbold are Jim Hamilton of Jim Hamilton Design and Creative Director of the internationally acclaimed consultancy, Graven, alongside BBC Scotland’s Home of the Year judge, Anna Campbell-Jones from Habitus.This episode is brought to you from the magnificent Charles Rennie Mackintosh-designed Billiard Room at the Willow in the heart of Glasgow.Jim, Anna and Susie also take questions from our audience of designers as part of this wonderful and wide-ranging conversation. Thanks to series partners, Trade at Houseology, for their valued support in making this event happen. | Susie and Jeff are joined by Charles Leon of Leon Black, a Past President of the British Institute of Interior Design, to examine the fee proposal. As a designer, your fee proposal should speak volumes about you, your approach to design and your practice. Typically, it’s the first piece of written information that your client will ever receive from you. It should showcase your professionalism and present you as the safe pair of hands who they can trust to complete their project. Most importantly of all, it should clearly set out the design services that are included for the stated fee. But how should you put a fee proposal together? What assumptions and exclusions should you consider? How can you make sure it’s as ironclad as possible?    We also hear Charles’s take on the strangest request that he’s ever received from a client. This episode is recorded in the Bulthaup Holland Park showroom. The Interior Design Business is a Wildwood and Alfi Media production. | In our first ever show recorded in front of a live audience, we examine social media for professional interior designers. Interior designer, Simone Suss, founder and CEO of London-based practice, Studio Suss (17.8K followers on Instagram), together with well-known interiors influencer and the uncontested queen of colour, Sophie Robinson (78.4K followers on Instagram), join us to share their secrets in this specially extended edition. How can social media help you build your brand and your business profile? Is it all about Instagram and, if so, why so? How should you use social platforms to grow your business? What content works best and where and when should you use it? Simone and Sophie also take questions from designers in our audience as part of a lively discussion that's choc-full of great advice.Recorded at the Roca London Gallery in Chelsea Harbour. | We're in Manchester to explore the chemistry between interior designers and private residential clients. It can be hugely satisfying and fun to work on private residential projects. Indeed, interior designers can have a massively positive impact on the lives of clients and their families. All designers dream of working for delighted, grateful, non-quibbling, fee-paying, private clients, but, in reality, how easy is this to achieve? And, what can you do to avoid some of the possible pitfalls?Fiona Watkins of Fiona Watkins Design joins co-host Susie Rumbold, Head of Tessuto Interiors and a Past President of the British Institute of Interior Design, to share their experiences and offer practical advice. We also take the temperature of business in the North with the help of Natalie Holden from NH Interiors and Melinda Kiss of Keyhole Interiors. Natalie and Melinda are the founders of Concept North, the region's fast-growing community for designers. We find out what Concept North is all about and the type of events, activities and support that they offer to help interior designers in the North. This episode is recorded in the Havwoods Manchester Showroom, located in Deansgate, the Design Quarter of the city. The Interior Design Business is a Wildwood and Alfi Media production. | In this episode we take a look at the state of design education with expert help and insight from the Principal of the KLC School of Design, Jenny Gibbs, and co-presenter, Susie Rumbold, Head of London-based design practice, Tessuto. We ask if design education is preparing graduates successfully for real-world employment. We also consider other important questions. How is interior design education changing to meet the needs of the construction industry? What are the key skills that interior design practices look for in graduates? And, what can be done to ease that, sometimes, painful transition from education into professional practice?Susie reveals how, even when qualified, the learning process never stops and Jenny takes us right back to the beginning of her career in design education to explain the origins of KLC. This episode is recorded in the offices of KLC. The Interior Design Business is a Wildwood and Alfi Media production. | The latest episode is all about hard hats and hard knocks. Kia Stanford of London-based practice, Kia Designs, joins co-presenter Susie Rumbold, Past President of the British Institute of Interior Design and Principal of Tessuto to look at how designers can successfully manage contractors. What constitutes a good contractor, how do you find one and how do you keep them on the straight and narrow to deliver great projects and good profit? We also examine the problem situations that can arise with contractors and hear from Kia and Susie on ways that they’ve dealt with real issues on site. In a wide-ranging conversation, we also find out about Kia’s pathway into the profession and how she’s able to keep her sanity, reduce stress levels and switch off from interior design in her spare time.This episode is recorded in the luxury cinema beneath the Experience Centre of Ideaworks. The Interior Design Business is a Wildwood and Alfi Media production. | In this episode, we get our teeth into one of the most talked about topics for professional interior designers: fees. How do you go about pricing a project? What value should you place on design? How should you deal with FF&E? How does pricing affect the perception of interior design as a profession? And, ultimately, we also look at the steps you can take to ensure your client pays for the service you provide.Listen in for insights and practical advice provided by two Past Presidents of the British Institute of Interior Design, co-presenter Susie Rumbold of Tessuto and Lori Pinkerton-Rolet of Park Grove Design.

In this episode, Jon and Jen are sharing their process, and breaking down how they made sure this tramp has the best bounce in the neighborhood.Jon’s notes: We purchased our trampoline from Pitcher’s Sports.For a steel retaining wall like we used, I recommend you find a local steel supplier and ask for their help sourcing pieces to fit your trampoline and space.\xa0The post In Ground Trampoline Tutorial Ft.

The fence Jon installed in the backyard of the #StaggReno is a perfect example. From the word, “go”, we faced problem after problem. From contractors standing us up, to posts literally snapping in two, and even mislabeled cans of stain (yes, it was as bad as you’re thinking), this project faced a lot of setbacks. While this might sound like a tale of warning, there is a light at the end of this tunnel. The good news: we did finish, and we couldn’t be happier with the end result.

We spoke just days before he and his family embarked on their latest adventure — moving to China!Isaak and I talked about how he first fell in love with design, and he discussed his early career as a UX designer, his work at Salesforce and RealCrowd, and how that prepared him for this current stage in his career.

Outside of work, Jeremi\'s keeps that same charitable energy going, paying it forward to his community through mentoring and tutoring in his community.I started by asking Jeremi what drew him to Salesforce, and from there we talked about his past work experiences at Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes, growing up in South Los Angeles, and how DJing became a gateway into working on the Web.

From compensation and company culture, to responsibilities and job title, what matters most? The answer, as Tanner and Jasmine discuss in this episode, depends on you. Your career ambitions, your skills and knowledge, and where you want to grow as a designer. Listen to hear personal experience and lessons-learned from Jasmine and Tanner's more than 20 years of product design, their suggestions on how to identify what matters most to you, and how to seek out the most important information in any job interview process. | When it comes to your career: how do you set expectations for yourself? How does setting your own expectations for a project differ from that of setting them for a promotion? When it comes to expectations we can often misguide ourselves, much to our detriment. In this episode of the podcast, Tanner and Jasmine chat about lessons they've learned over the course of their careers about how to set expectations and measure career growth without feeling overwhelmed or like you're an imposter. | What are soft skills and why do they matter for product designers? How do you identify what soft skills matter most for a specific role and how do you improve your soft skills? In this episode Jasmine and Tanner discuss soft skills: strong communication, negotiation, prioritization, self-awareness, and more. To set yourself apart from the competition in the job market you need to not only invest in the hard skills to do your job, but also the soft skills that enable you to work better with others. | What makes mentorship valuable, and should everyone have a mentor?

In this episode of New Layer, Jasmine and Tanner talk about the different types of rejection designers often face when applying to or interviewing for a job and how to cope with each.

Where do you look for guidance if you aren't really sure why you aren't getting the job? All this and much more in this episode. | What skills go into product design? At its core, product design consists of: product strategy, interaction design, and visual design, but how do new designers demonstrate each of those skills? And what about supplementary skills like user research, programming, and content strategy; should product designers know how to do those things as well? The answers—and more—in this episode of New Layer. | To do our best work we need to get feedback. For that reason critique is a fundamental part of the role we play as product designers. And yet, critique can feel intense for many designers, especially when done poorly. What does the best critique look like and how can we as designers and peers ensure each time we review work it's beneficial for everyone involved? What are the warning signs of a poor critique? How can you get feedback on your work if you work in a small team or if you're the only designer on the team? In this episode Jasmine and Tanner answer these questions and more. | What is the design process? There's a universal, time-tested, overarching process for design that many of us are familiar with, but when it comes to applying that process to any project, you may find it needs to be adapted. In this episode of New Layer, Tanner and Jasmine talk about the different ways the design process must be used to meet specific project needs; including how to identify what part of the process should be changed and how to ensure your process is fluid, not rigid, to ensure you and your team get the best results from your design work. | When it comes to showing your work in an online portfolio: how do you decide what goes in it? How much information is too much and how much is not enough?

When it comes to collaborating with business partners or clients, how do designers help others understand what design does as a function?

We spoke to him as a visitor of the Service Design Global Conference, as a regular guest, as a winnen of and SD award and now as an organiser of the conference in Toronto. As always, Chris has many valuable insights to share and will get you excited for this year’s edition of the conference. | In anticipation of the Service Design Global Conference in Oktober we spoke to Shannah Segal, one of the local organisers of the conference. Shannon is Senior Manager, Experience Design at Ontario Digital Service and was Principle, Design and Research Director at Usability matters. Listen to find out about the theme of the conference, what to look forward to and where to visit in Toronto. | A couple of months ago, we noticed an interesting video on Linkedin. In this video Playmobil announced their new toolkit for professionals. We spoke with Victoria Dobbie, project manager at sub-brand Playmobil Pro. She introduced us to the tool and the process of designing and bringing it into the market. | Increasing automation in our workplaces, demographic shifts and a customer-based economy are drastically changing the way we work. In order for people to keep up we will need a very different set of skills, particularly those that are unique to humans: imagination, creativity, curiosity, emotions and social relationships. How will we bring this skills transition into our jobs, and which implications will this have for employees, employers and organisations? In our 34th episode of our podcast you can listen to the ARENA round table discussion, i.e. an interview with the speakers of the evening and questions from the audience. | Tesco Bank and Modern human won the ‘best in private sector’ service design award for their project Phoenix. We spoke with Amjid Rasool, head of service design at Tesco Bank and Paul-Jervis Heath from the Service Design agency Modern human. Together with their whole team they redesigned the customer complaint experience of Tesco Bank clients. Read the whole story | Fjord en West Midland Police won the award best in public sector for their project ‘Developing a police force’s digital experience for citizens’. We spoke with Giulio Fagiolini, who is visual design at Fjord and Kostja Paschalidis who was senior service design at Fjord and is now working as a freelancer. | Innovationsguiden won the Professional Non-Profit/Public Sector award. Innovationguiden is an ongoing project that aims to support and reinvigorate the Swedish public sector in collaboration with citizens through service design. This was done by providing various forms of support to municipalities, county councils and regions to work with user-driven innovation in their development work. | Cork County Council is the second largest local authority in Ireland. They offer over 600 services to the civilians of Cork. This means they have an all-time challenge to deliver the best possible services for their customers. A few years ago, they came across Service Design, and started experimenting. They formed the Service rePublic team, and never looked back since. | As we shifted from a product-based economy into a service-based economy, customers are more and more pampered with good services. To be successful, companies more than ever need to offer services that exceed the expectations of people. So in order to offer the best services, companies can do two things. On the one hand they can work closely together with external professionals. On the other hand, they can expand their in-house expertise by training their own employees to think more human centred. To introduce and present both ways of working, we invited two international speakers who shared their knowledge. | We went to the Service Design Global Conference in Dublin where we attended lots of inspiring talks and hands-on workshops. Again, it was a truly amazing edition! It’s surprising how this conference manages to touch new topics & give new inspiration every year. Hats off to the organisation!\xa0 We also really enjoyed the social aspects of this conference.

We also discuss all things craftsmanship and colour, building communities, the ups and downs of running your own creative practice and how to grow your business. And we have a laugh too. \xa0 Presented by Justyna Green Music and production by James Gre | Anna Murray and Grace Winteringham are founders of Patternity - a ‘conscious creative organisation’ which works with pattern\xa0to inspire more curious, collaborative and connected ways of living. In our conversation, you\'ll discover Patternity\'s origins as an image archive and find out more about Anna\'s and Grace\'s pre-Patternity days in art direction and pattern design. What will truly inspire though, is how the company has evolved over the years together with its founders\' philosophies, ways of perceiving the world and noticing patterns not only in the visual sense but also in our behaviours, thoughts and even spirituality. \xa0 Presented by Justyna Green Music and production by James Green | Sam Jacob is principal of\xa0Sam\xa0Jacob Studio for architecture and design, also known to many as previously the\xa0founding director of FAT Architecture. In our conversation, we discuss Sam\'s education and varied approaches to architecture, his work at the nexus of art and architecture, the inspiration and design process behind the newly opened London\'s Cartoon Museum and\xa0the remodelling of the V&A’s Cromwell Road entrance. \xa0 Presented by Justyna Green Music and production by James Green | Camille Walala is an artist and designer,\xa0expressing joy and happiness through vibrant colour and bold pattern. Known for her bold style, Camille works on projects ranging from large installations to urban landscapes and 3D items.  In our conversation, Camille tells me about her early inspirations, her first discovery of the Memphis Movement and thoughts on arts education. She also openly shares with me the story of her career path, which creatives at every stage of their practice will find encouraging.\xa0 Presented by Justyna Green Music and production by James Green | Adam Nathaniel Furman is the last guest of the second season of the Justyna Green podcast. We meet at his apartment in the vicinity of Regent\'s Park and before we start our recording, Furman explains that he only recently moved in, hence the place is still looking a bit bare. It does so by his standards, but most of us would find it generously decorated, with Furman’s sculptures, prototypes, posters and mugs scattered throughout the rooms and shelves filled with design and architecture books. In our conversation, we discuss Furman’s multicultural upbringing and its effects on his notions of identity. We dive into the relationship between maximalist and minimalist styles and their connections to Calvinism and Catholicism. Furman also explains the differences between the Zen methodology and Shintoism and how these spiritual practices inform Japan\'s creative culture. A prolific architecture commentator and designer, Furman ends our conversation with an insight into his current projects and how he translates the notion of objects telling stories, into his practice. \xa0 Presented and produced by Justyna Green Music by James Green \xa0 | “Are you a dancer” is the question that Alistair Spalding gets asked the most.  Understandably so, as he runs London’s most successful and internationally renowned dance theatre – Sadler\'s Wells.\xa0 In our conversation, we discuss communicating ideas through movement, the rock-concert-like creations from Hofesh Schechter and Akram Khan’s tender stories of belonging and identity as well as\xa0Sadler\'s Wells collaborations with creatives such as sculptor Antony Gormley, fashion designer Hussein Chalayan, musician Jamie XX, and artist\xa0Olafur Eliasson. \xa0 Presented and produced by Justyna Green Music by James Green \xa0 | Max Cooper is an electronica and techno music producer. He recently released the remixes of his 2018 album One Hundred Billion Sparks and is working on his forthcoming project for the Barbican Centre,\xa0Yearning for the Infinite. You’ll enjoy our discussion whether you’re an electronic music fan or not, as for Cooper music is almost a by-product of his lifelong interests in maths, science and computational biology. His multidisciplinary approach led him to a long-term collaboration with the Architecture Social Club,\xa0a project with\xa0Zaha Hadid Architects. Throughout our conversation, we discuss science, maths, and philosophy and how these disciplines inform Cooper\'s work, enabling him to create multisensory, immersive experiences, which explore concepts such as hope, identity, singularity or indeed infinity. \xa0 Presented by Justyna Green Production and music by James Green \xa0 | Ben Branson is on a mission to change the way the world drinks. He’s the founder and CEO of Seedlip - a nature company producing distilled, non-alcoholic spirits. In our conversation, he shares with me his fascination with herbs and biodiversity, the increasing need for high-quality non-alcoholic spirits, coping with a rapidly growing business and building a laboratory in a 19th-century barn on his farm. \xa0 Presented by Justyna Green Production and music by James Green', 'chan_desc': "The Justyna Green Podcast brings you insightful conversations with the arts & design's most inspiring figures - from designers to musicians, dancers to architects and everybody in between.

I want you to count up every time you’ve had furniture delivered on a hospital or healthcare project, and the product fell short of your expectations. Do that on one hand. Now, on the other hand, I want you to count up how many times you’ve had to compromise the integrity of a project because you’ve been limited by furniture options and budget. Now, that was kind of a trick question because I know all of you need more than two hands to count up these situations. Here’s a solution: Stance Healthcare. Stance specializes in furniture for the hospital and healthcare setting, and they pride themselves on working with designers who need to modify furniture for a variety of end users. Here’s a great example. At the request of a designer, Stance modified their popular Legend chair to create a closed arm panel and they made the seat depth adjustable for different sized residents in an assisted living facility.

In part one of Cheryl’s conversation today with Tama Duffy Day, you will learn:  How healthcare design can and does have an impact on solving the health and wellness crisis in the US. Since 2013, The Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University has mapped life expectancy in the US in 21 different cities. Tama shares the results of this very powerful study. Why it isn’t your DNA that determines life expectancy in the US, but rather your zip code. Why it’s important to look at design through social and community issues and how design can increase the impact of change. The story of how a much younger Tama helped a friend in a wheelchair create a friendlier home, and how this experience informed her perspective on design and the human experience. Tama’s surprising answer to the question, “What makes a project successful?” Learn about one of Gensler’s envisioning tools used with clients that’s different from anything you’ve ever heard before. What does creating a legacy look like for Tama after 30 years of work. How Tama envisioned and then created a platform for interior design voices to be heard at Contract Magazine. Tama’s advice to interior design students of today. Is Gensler hiring?  Featured Product Porcelanosa’s KRION® Solid Surface Material is made out of two-thirds natural minerals and a low percentage of high-resistance resins. KRION® is available in an array of colors, can be thermocurved or backlit, and is antibacterial – making it a perfect product for the healthcare industry. KRION® is also highly resistant to impacts and external elements (such as fire, chemicals, and frost), and is easy to clean and maintain.\xa0 Inspired by the properties of photocatalytic materials, Porcelanosa has evolved their KRION® Solid Surface material called K-LIFE. When K-LIFE comes into contact with light, it will be able to purify the air, expel harmful bacteria, and more. K-LIFE can easily be integrated into many applications – from wall coverings and claddings for ceilings, to custom tables, bars, sinks, shelving units and furniture. The application of K-LIFE in areas with high daily traffic, such as waiting rooms or reception areas, can assure a gradual decontamination of germs and lead to ongoing ecological benefits. Some research performed with KRION® K-LIFE, which has photocatalytic properties, proved that the material can significantly reduce the presence of bacteria. This revolutionary process has led to a patent pending, innovative, and exclusive product that will have a direct effect on our quality of life.

It’s cute as all get-out, right? It’s the end of 2019, and as healthcare thinking and design moves away from a one-size-fits-all, institutional mindset, towards a more personalized, individualized care model, you are looking for ways to move away from one-size-fits-all thinking in your hospital, healthcare & senior living projects. Here’s a great example from one of our podcast guests, Sara Parsons with Gallun Snow Associates.\xa0 Sara shares, “Different patient populations need different art and graphics. A still life of fruit will not comfort a surgery patient checking in on an empty stomach and a mountain stream may be uncomfortable for an ultrasound patient arriving as instructed with a full bladder.” Art Addiction understands your unique challenges when it comes to selecting the very best artwork for your project. They offer a library of over 15,000 unique, gorgeous images, an in-house studio that can produce everything from small-scale yet durable and cleanable prints to mural-sized acrylic wall installations and their design support team is superb.

In part 1 of the episode you will learn:  What is special and different about one of HDR’s latest projects at Hartford Hospital Bone and Marrow Institute and what designers can learn from this innovative project about the future of healthcare design. The integration of cutting-edge technology and hospitality in healthcare projects in a brand new way. How physicians are getting more involved in envisioning new design projects to include the clinician’s perspective. How new healthcare design projects include empowering patients through technology and community building. How HDR’s Kaiser Grande Chino project is totally different than other Kaiser hospitals, and how Kaiser is leading the way in new healthcare design models through its program, “Reimagining Ambulatory Care.” When Kaiser calls its patients “members”, the experience changes for patients. What it means to the future of healthcare design when HDR helped Kaiser reimagine its Chino location by transforming the existing waiting rooms into community classrooms, self check-in kiosks, and wait time calculators given to members. How HDR’s Focal Point Community Chicago project sets the bar higher for community care and wellness prevention with the hospital as the core anchor of the 33-acre campus. How mixed-use spaces are now being built in some of the lowest income areas (with the example of Focal Point Community Chicago) so low-income families can have access to healthy food and great medical care. The increasing desire of hospital clients to integrate with the surrounding neighborhoods and invite communities onto their campus through things like cooking classes and walking trails,\xa0and how this is changing the face of healthcare design.

What makes a project successful. How HDR helps their hospital clients with fundraising. Are healthcare systems in New York different then the rest of the United States and is New York a trendsetter in healthcare interior design? How are color palettes in healthcare design different on the east coast? How does empathy play a role in healthcare design and has that changed in the past 10 years? How Amy’s brain surgery two years ago gave her a completely different perspective on the way a healthcare space should be designed. Amy’s internship and love of pediatric healthcare design influenced her decision to move permanently into the field.

The growth of consumer based medical care and how this will affect patient centered care.     The growth of mixed use spaces will help busy Americans get the wellness prevention they need, and revolutionize healthcare and wellness care as we know it today.     What current projects Sara and Gallun Snow are working on in collaboration with HKS and BSA Life Structures and common goals to create a “uniform” design.     The new healthcare design idea of creating a landing location in a community so the intellectual property of the specialist can come and go to benefit the community without the building having to be uniquely outfitted to each speciality.     The advantages of building your brand in an aesthetic way.     How to select art in a healthcare setting that is specific to a region and a patient demographic.\xa0     The importance of going to the community (where the healthcare space is built) and finding what resources are local.     The stories Sara overheard about the artwork in a healthcare space Gallun Snow designed from the end users of the building.

Episode Show Notes http://www.peachandpinehome.com/shownotes/10 Instagram.com/peachandpinehome Instagram.com/lovewhereyoulivepodcast | Today we want to help you answer a question that we’ve often seen client’s ask themselves: “What Is My Design Style?” We received the request for this episode topic from someone on Instagram actually, and she asked: “How do I figure out my design style and create a cohesive look for my home?”\xa0 This is such a great question for a couple of reasons - First: narrowing down your “style” in advance can really help you make better design decisions long term and help you create a space that you really love. Secondly: a cohesive house is so important. Gone are the days of decorating every room in a different theme (although, if you want a jungle themed living room and nautical dining room, more power to you). Nowadays, people are much more drawn to homes that are cohesive throughout. \xa0 IG: www.instagram.com/peachandpinehome IG: www.instagram.com/lovewhereyoulivepodcast Podcast Page: www.peachandpinehome.com/podcast Shownotes: www.peachandpinehome.com/shownotes/9 | Kyle Levy is a Nashville-based woodworker and craftsman who has done AMAZING work for many of our clients.

Last solo episode we told you guys the story of our most recent renovation. There are a lot of highs and lows when you’re changing spaces in your homes, and while DIY is great, sometimes you just need help.\xa0I’m sure this won’t surprise any of you, but we think that if you’re looking for help, an interior designer should be your first thought. Obviously we are a little biased, but we want to take some time today to shed some light on what exactly interior designers do and explain how they (we) can help the renovation process flow from beginning to end. | If you haven\'t listened to part 1 of our interview with the Lavenders, be sure to check that out BEFORE listening to part 2 here. On this episode, we chat about how the Lavenders\' love for design and renovation didn\'t change with Derek\'s accident. They were able to specifically design their new home to be accessible, which allowed it to be named as one of Dwell\'s "top 9 accessible homes that champion inclusive design." LeAnne has also started helping other families create beautiful and accessible designs. | Part 1 of our interview with Derek and LeAnne Lavender. As newlyweds, Derek and LeAnne\'s first home was a 400 square foot garage which they renovated into a loft-style apartment. While renovating another home on the same property, life was flipped upside down when Derek was in an accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down. In this episode Derek and LeAnne talk about the beginning of their renovation journey and the accident that has shaped the last 3 years of their lives.', 'chan_desc': 'Does the thought of a remodel get you jazzed, or does the word “renovation” give you the heebie-jeebies?

[sc name="pod_ad"]Are you aware of all the things you can claim as business expenses when running a home-based design business? You\'ve heard the saying, "You need to spend money to make money"? People quoting that often neglect to inform you that some of the money you spend running your design business, can be recuperated as business expenses. If you are running your own design business, you really should enlist the help of a professional when it comes to filing your taxes. If not, you could be losing out on entitled money. The cost of hiring an accountant or bookkeeper is a wise investment when it comes to doing business. With that said, I am not an accountant or bookkeeper. I\'m going to share some often overlooked expenditures that may qualify as business expenses for you. Please verify with whoever prepares your business taxes if you are allowed to claim any of the following. People In the course of running your design business, you may need to hire external help. The money you pay these people may qualify as business expenses.  Virtual Assistants Business Coaches Contractors (illustrators, programmers, developers, designers, etc.) Massage Therapists / Physio Therapists (after those long days sitting in your chair) Counseling Accountant / Bookkeeper  Subscriptions As a designer, there are plenty of reoccurring expenses when it comes to your design business. You can claim many of them on your taxes.  Design Software Wordpress Plugins Software Addons Membership / Club fees Magazine subscriptions  Business Expenses You can claim the costs involved with running and promoting your design business as business expenses.  \xa0Advertising fees Delivery and Shipping Costs Legal, accounting and professional fees Tax prep Bank fees Processing fees  Travel Expenses You can claim business-related travel expenses, whether it\'s to a conference or to see a client, on your taxes as business expenses  Conferences costs (travel, hotel, ticket fees, meals) Networking event fees Travel Expenses (fuel, parking, rental, car wash, maintenance) Vehicle expenses, including interest on loan or lease payments.  Home Office Expenses  Office Decorations Work Clothes (must be branded to your business) Cleaning (house, yard) Office Supplies  Personal Expenses  Computer Glasses Cellular phone Computer Tablet Smart Watch Training / Courses Child Care  These are only a few of the hundreds of things that may qualify as business expenses. In some cases, you won\'t be able to claim some of these items. It all depends on your situation, your business, and where you live. Check with your accountant. They\'ll know what you can and cannot claim. I go into more detail on each item on the podcast. Be sure to listen to the episode for the full story.

Tip of the week Entrepreneur Mindset I heard someone quote Tony Robbins on a podcast recently. To paraphrase the quote, "Being an entrepreneur is 80% mindset and 20% mechanics." I couldn\'t agree more. Without the confidence and proper mindset, you will not succeed. And when you do have the appropriate confidence and mindset, the actual running part of your business should come easily. As Henry Ford put it, "If you think you can, or you think you can\'t, you are right." So when it comes to running your design business, make sure you have a "CAN" attitude. It will make things so much easier. Listen to the podcast on the go.

You can reach me at\xa0feedback@resourcefuldesigner.com | There\'s wisdom in all of us. I chose the title "With Age, Comes Wisdom" for this episode not because I believe I’m very wise, but because it’s inevitable that as time passes, all the ups and downs, the successes and failures, the roadblocks and overcome hurdles all add up. And whether you realize it or not, each one of them helps in its own way to shape you into the wise person you are now. As I approach my 50th birthday, I can’t help but reminisce and ponder the choices I’ve made in my life, the paths I’ve followed, and of course the journey that’s still ahead of me. And I’ve come to appreciate better something I’m sure you\'ve known for a long time. And that is, that with age comes wisdom. And what use is wisdom if you can’t share it with people? I’m not talking about being a know it all. Please, don’t be a know-it-all. I’m talking about using the knowledge you’ve gained over time, whether you’re 20, 50 or 80, to help the people you serve. Including your family, your friends, people in communities you frequent, and yes, your design clients as well. I\'ve said it before on the podcast but let me repeat it. No matter what stage you’re at in your design career, to everyone out there who knows less than you, you’re a professional.\xa0Even if you’re fresh out of school and have never worked on a real client project, when it comes to designing, you are a professional compared to the majority of people out there. Hold on to that thought every time someone questions your prices or tries to negotiate a “special deal for exposure” with you.\xa0You are wiser than that, because of the time you’ve put in to get to where you are. Nobody can take that away from you, and nobody has the right to devalue what you’ve learned during that time. Have I ever told you that Resourceful Designer is the third name I chose for this podcast? I first came up with the idea of doing a graphic design podcast in 2014, shortly after I turned 45. I had just passed the threshold of the early 40s to late 40s. I know there’s the whole mid 40s thing but face it, once you hit the five mark, you’re on the downward side of that hill. As I realized I was in the latter part of my 40s, I started looking at my future. I began having thoughts in my head saying, “who’s going to want to hire a 45-year-old designer, let alone a 50, 55 or 60-year-old designer?” Especially with all the tremendous young design talent that is emerging these days.\xa0Not to mention the up and coming generation that\'s seeing business owners, managers, CEOs in their early 30s if not their 20s. Wouldn’t they want to partner with someone closer to their own age? Luckily I didn’t stay in that funk for too long.\xa0sIn fact, it didn’t take me that long to appreciate that at 45, I had accumulated a lot of useful knowledge and skills.\xa0Wisdom if you will, that could be very useful to that same younger generation of businesspeople.\xa0I had 15 years of experience working at a print shop, plus another nine years running a successful design business. At that time, I had already been podcasting about TV shows, so I knew what I was doing, so I decided to start a design-related podcast.\xa0I was going to call it The Aging Designer.I even designed the logo and website.  I was going to use the podcast as a platform to talk to 40, 50, 60-year-old designers and remind them that we still have a lot to share with the younger generation.\xa0I recorded an introductory episode but never published it. I sat on that podcast idea for quite a few months, not doing anything with it because something didn’t feel right about the whole concept. I ended up sharing my frustrations with some trusted podcast friends, and they told me that the knowledge and wisdom I wanted to share, although useful to people my age and older, might better serve a broader audience. That’s when I switched gears from how to survive as an ageing designer, to how to grow and thrive as a home-based or freelance\xa0designer.\xa0So with renewed enthusiasm and a clearer path for the podcast, I renamed the show The Wise Designer (I never designed the logo). However, I soon started thinking that calling the podcast The Wise Designerpeople might think I was pretentious.\xa0So after some more contemplation, I settled on Resourceful Designer, and I’m glad I did. The word "resourceful" has helped me stay on track and navigate the direction of the show.\xa0The podcast allows me to share my experiences and knowledge, you can call it wisdom if you want, with designers like you. I\'m talking to you, designer to designer.\xa0I don’t know how old you are.\xa0I don’t know at what stage of your design career you\'re at or what discipline of design you are pursuing.\xa0I don’t know where in the world you live, your background, your heritage.\xa0None of that matters in the context of Resourceful Designer. What does matter is that you’re a designer who cares enough about your current or potential business to listen to my podcast.\xa0That’s what counts. Since I launched Resourceful Designer,\xa0I’ve probably gained more value from doing it than you have from being a listener.\xa0It keeps me rejuvenated.\xa0It keeps me curious.\xa0It keeps me informed. And it makes me feel relevant. I’m turning 50 this week, and I’m ready to embrace it. I’m prepared for whatever lies ahead on my journey. Those doubts I felt turning 45 are way behind me.\xa0I have more today to offer as a designer than I have at any part of my career to date.\xa0And I hope you feel the same way, no matter what stage of life or your career you’re at right now. Embrace ageing. Appreciate the skills you’re accumulating, the knowledge you’re gaining, and package it all up in that ball we call wisdom.\xa0And use that wisdom to benefit those around you.\xa0Even if it’s just to explain to a client why making the logo bigger won’t help.

Resource of the week\xa0Resourceful Designer Community The Resourceful Designer Community\xa0is an active community of designers with a common goal, a goal of improving and growing their design business. The Community is for designers of any levels. Current members include designers just starting their business, members with agency experience, members with knowledge of web design and print design, all willing to share what they know. The Community interacts via a private and very active Slack group, with new conversations happening every day. There are also regular video meetings. These video chats are where the magic happens. By seeing each other’s faces and interacting directly with each other, members become closer and more invested in what each of their fellow members is doing with their business.\xa0If a member can’t make the live video chats, they can view the recording which is archived for members to watch at their convenience. If have your own design business or are thinking of starting one, regardless of your skills as a designer, and you are looking for a tight-knit group of designers to help you by being mentors, confidants, and friends, then you need to be part of the Resourceful Designer Community.

Whether it was an app on your phone, a website plugin or theme or an application on your computer.\xa0When you updated it, did you look at why it was being updated by reading the release or change notes? There are three main reasons why a piece of software requires an update.  Bug Fixes Security improvements New Features and Functionality  Do you know which of these reasons each update you perform is for, and why it was released? We\'ve been taught to update without thinking about the reason. It’s become so easy these days to update software.\xa0Our phones have a convenient “Update All” button, so we don’t have to scroll and update each app individually. There are convenient services that allow you to manage and update multiple WordPress websites from a single dashboard. Even the software on your computer makes it easy. Most of the time, a popup will appear informing you of a new update and asking if you want to update the program right away or do it later. In some cases Later will happen in the background without you needing to be there. What added new features and functionality do those apps, plugins, and software you download offer?\xa0By not paying attention to why there\'s an update to a piece of software, are you being left behind? Are you missing out on functionality that may improve your processes and your abilities as a designer? I remember back in the day when physical floppy disks or CDs were required to update software. In those days, software companies would mail you promotional material showcasing all the great new features they were adding to their program hoping you would purchase it. I also remember reading magazine articles leading up to the new releases describing how each new feature would make my life easier. With today\'s subscription models, software companies don\'t need to sell us with the hype of new features, they already have our money. I remember reading about the upcoming version 3 of Adobe Photoshop with the introduction of great new features, including one called Layers. I just had to have it, no matter the cost. By the time I received and installed the latest versions, I knew every new feature available to me and whether or not it was something I would use. Nowadays, there isn’t as much fanfare with software releases as there used to be. We\'ve been conditioned to automatically click when we see a little red dot without giving it much thought.\xa0Maybe it’s just me not being on top of things or following the right blogs or social media accounts, but I don’t think I’m the only one in the dark. Are you’re like this too? It makes me wonder what other features programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop have that I don\'t know about that could benefit me. Adobe regularly releases a major update for all their programs each October. Many Adobe users, myself included have absolutely no idea what new features Photoshop, Illustrator and all the other CC programs will have. There are probably articles highlighting what new features to expect. But unless you search for them, there\'s a good chance you\'ll update your software without giving it much thought. What will you be missing out? If you want to improve your productivity, increase your skills, and add to your toolbox, the next time you update an app, plugin, or software, read the changelogs or release notes. Learn why the update was released and what possible new features and functionality they offer. So let me ask you again, when you perform a software update, do know why? Let me know by leaving a comment for this episode. Questions of the Week Submit your question to be featured in a future episode of the podcast by visiting the\xa0feedback page.

My client is unable or unwilling to provide me what I need to complete the site. The copywriter I hired is demanding full payment for her services even though there’s still some outstanding copy to be written that’s dependent on what the client still needs to provide me.\xa0Should I be paying the copywriter her full fee even though not all the agreed upon copy was written?

What have you done today, this week, this month that will help propel your design business? How are you moving the needle towards future growth and sustainability? Isn\'t that a funny saying; "Moving the needle"? It means making a significant difference, having a measurable statistic that will change as a result of an action. So let me ask you again, how are you moving the needle for your graphic or web design business? What actions are you taking that will produce a measurable change in the statistics of your business? Statistics such as:  Getting more clients. Increasing your revenue Streamlining your processes.  What are you doing to move your business forward?\xa0\xa0 Businesses are like sharks. Just like a shark can\'t sit still or it will die, for a business to prosper, it needs to make advancements. it needs to look forward towards the future, It needs to evolve. Think of car companies such as Ford or Honda. They don\'t just develop a new car and let it be. No, every year they make advancements and evolve each one of their models. The 2020 Ford Edge or Honda Civic is better than the 2019 models which were better than the 2018 models. Subway, the biggest restaurant chain in the world, even larger than McDonalds, did not get to where they are by riding the status quo and always offering the same sandwiches.\xa0 No, all these companies grew, because they evolved with the times, they experimented, they introduced new options and features. These companies are continually moving the needle. Now I don\'t expect your design business to compare on the same levels as Subway, Ford or Honda. But if you\'re not consciously trying to improve your business, there\'s a good chance others who are will surpass you. Even if you are happy with the current state of your business, if you\'re lucky enough to be making a decent living and you have plenty of clients to keep you busy, that doesn\'t mean it will always be that way.\xa0 If it did, your town or city would have a family run general store instead of a Walmart or other big-box chain. No matter how great your design business may be right now, you can never forget that even the best clients can shut down, reduce their design budget or even find another designer. New technologies and software are always emerging, that makes our jobs easier, but they also make it easier for clients to do things on their own, requiring less and less of our services. And as time goes by, you\'ll need to adjust your income to accommodate your ever-changing lifestyle, not to mention inflation who\'s steady pace seems to be a sprint. It\'s great to be happy with the current state of your business, as long as you don\'t get complacent. Avoid getting into habits and routines that keep you in the status quo. If you do, you\'ll find that eventually you\'ll become out of the loop and be outdated. So how do you move the needle?  Make sure you stay up to date with technology and trends.\xa0 Learn a new skill that makes you more valuable to your clients.\xa0 Find new avenues to promote your business. Become more involved with your existing client\'s business. Streamline your process and become more efficient. Build a team that can help you evolve and grow.  Once again let me ask you. What are you doing to move the needle for your design business? Take one step today that\'ll help you in the long run. That\'s what moving the needle is all about.\xa0 Growing a business is a journey; you need to do it one step at a time. Even a baby step still counts. How do you plan on moving the needle for your design business? Let me know by leaving a comment for this episode. Tip of the week Professional Head Shots Clients always prefer dealing with a person over a faceless company. Having your photo visible on your website creates that sense of intimacy clients seek when hiring a designer. Seeing your face gives them comfort that they are dealing with a real person. Since you only get one chance to make a first impression, why not give it the best shot you can by having your photo taken by a professional photographer. Not only will a professional photographer capture the best you, but visitors to your website will see that you take your business seriously enough to invest in professional photos.

You can reach me at\xa0feedback@resourcefuldesigner.com | Do you have a YES attitude when it comes to accepting design projects? If you want to grow as a designer, you need to embrace a YES attitude when it comes to dealing with prospective design projects. I’m hearing more and more designers, both graphic and web, who turn down projects because the job doesn’t fit their skill set.\xa0It frustrates me when I hear this.\xa0It frustrates me because I’ve been there and I’ve done that. When my design business was still relatively new, I turned down several projects and several clients because I didn’t know how to do what they were asking. I turned down a $50K website project because I wasn’t comfortable enough with my knowledge of PHP and MySQL. I wasn’t sure I was capable of doing the job and was afraid to try. I’m not an illustrator, so when projects requiring illustration came my way, I would turn them down. It frustrates me now knowing how much work I turned away, and how many possible great clients I ended up not working with because I didn’t have the skills for the job, so I turned them down. I wish I knew then what I know now. Running a design business as a solopreneur, all by yourself doesn’t mean you have to do everything yourself. Yes, you should take every opportunity to learn and expand yourself as a designer, but in some cases, the best option is to team up with someone proficient in the skills you lack. Every independent designer requires a team. In episode 77 of the Resourceful Designer podcast, I talked about how being a self-employed designer requires a team effort, how every independent designer needs to have an arsenal of peers and associates with complimenting skill sets to fill in the gaps that they have.\xa0 That’s where embracing a yes attitude comes in. And it’s simple. When a client asks you if you can do something, say yes even if you don’t know how to do it. Saying yes to one of these projects can open incredible doors for you. If it’s doable, use the project to learn the skill you are lacking and add it to your repertoire. If it’s not something you can or want to learn, find someone who can do it for you. When I started embracing a yes attitude, it propelled my design business by leaps and bounds. I embraced a yes attitude and stopped turning down jobs on the pretense that I wasn’t sure I could do them. This doesn’t mean you should take on every single job presented to you. There are still plenty of valid reasons to turn down design projects. What I’m saying, is to embrace a yes attitude for projects that sound great but that you’re not sure how to do. Then figure out how to do them yourself, or figure out who can do them for you. Grow as a designer. Since embracing a yes attitude, I’ve had a client ask me if I could add their logo to a photo and make it look like a neon sign. I’ve had a client ask me if I could create a realistic-looking 3D type heading and make it look like it was on fire, with realistic flames. I’ve had a client ask me to create a title heading for their poster with the words made out of stacked ice cubes. I didn’t have the foggiest idea of how to do these things when I took on the jobs. But when they asked me I readily said yes, I could do that. And you know what? I figured out how. You don’t need to know how to do something beforehand to get it done. Learn along the way. Grow your design entourage. Since embracing a yes attitude I’ve had clients ask me for e-commerce websites, I’ve had clients ask me for illustrations, for video. In each case, I found someone who could do those things for me and delivered the job. Saying yes to a client doesn’t mean you have to do it yourself. It just means you can get the job done. Solve the problem. Remember, as a designer; you’re a problem solver. It’s your job to provide a solution to what your clients want or need. Solution, that’s the keyword. A solution indicates that the answer is unknown and you must discover it. This challenge applies to every design project. So the same way the answer is unknown, the skills and knowledge required to complete a project may be unknown at the start as well. Part of finding that solution may be trying to figure out how you’re going to get something done that you don’t know how to do.\xa0Say yes, and then find the solution. When you say yes to one of these design projects, you end up adding to your skill set, your repertoire, possibly to your portfolio, and of course, to your reputation. Clients will appreciate you. I know some designers feel like this is being deceitful to their clients. However, a client doesn’t care if it was you or someone you oversaw that completed the work as long as they are happy with the outcome. Think of it this way, whenever someone is having surgery, they want to know who the doctor operating is. But surgeons never operate alone. They have a team assisting them and doing things the doctor can’t or shouldn’t be doing themselves. The same goes for your design business; you’re the “design surgeon”; the client is hiring you. They don’t need to know who your team is because they’re putting their trust in you. As long as you deliver, they’ll be happy, and they’ll keep coming back. All because you embraced a yes attitude.

Questions of the Week Submit your question to be featured in a future episode of the podcast by visiting the\xa0feedback page. This week’s question comes from Christie  I have a question. Many times when I’m asked to do a new project, there are elements of the project that I don’t know how to do. One guy needs a video along with his marketing, another needs illustration, etc. My experience is designing websites, brochures, email, mailers and I don’t feel I’m very good with logos. I also don’t know video, have a great camera or know how to do the backend of a website. All of these things would have been done for me at companies I’ve worked at before, and my freelance projects have been so random that I’m continually learning new skills. It’s nice, but sometimes I don’t know what to do in those scenarios since I don’t know a lot of other freelancers. Can you recommend some resources or best practice? I’m just starting out.  To find out what I told Christie you’ll have to listen to the podcast. Resource of the week Your Local Library Your local library can be an excellent opportunity for you and your design business.

You can reach me at\xa0feedback@resourcefuldesigner.com | Finding clients at niche conferences  I had planned a different topic for this week, but after attending Podcast Movement\xa0last week, I want to share my experiences hoping they can help with your design business. Here’s a little background. I’ve attended five out of the six years Podcast Movement has been around. The first year I couldn\'t attend, but I did purchase a virtual ticket so technically I\'ve been part of all of them. The first one I went to was in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2015. That was before I launched Resourceful Designer. At that time I was a TV Show Fan podcaster, in fact, I still am. If you’re a fan of the science fiction television shows Killjoys or The Expanse you can check out my fan podcasts on my network at Solo Talk Media. In 2016 I attended Podcast Movement as both a TV Show fan podcaster and as host of Resourceful Designer. But my attendee badge still listed me as Mark Des Cotes from Solo Talk Media.\xa0I changed that In 2017 and 2018. When I attended those conferences, I made sure Resourceful Designer was front and center since it was my main podcast.\xa0 Attending the conferences as the host of Resourceful Designer started to get my name out there as a designer. After all, I was doing a podcast related to the design industry, so I must be a designer, right?\xa0 What started happening was whenever the topic of podcast artwork or websites came up, my name got passed around.\xa0It would be in the context of, “you need artwork, or you need a website? Mark is a designers, maybe he could help you.”\xa0Sure, my name was shared, but so was every other designer out there. A change of strategy. This year I did something different. In February 2019, I launched Podcast Branding; a company focused on providing professional design services to podcasters. I’ve talked about niches in episodes 54\xa0and episode 93\xa0of the Resourceful Designer podcast. Not to mention my interview with Craig Burton in episode 174\xa0where we talked about his work in the School Branding niche. I decided to take my advice and started a company that focused on the podcast niche. Podcast Branding was born. Attending the conference. At a podcast conference, the icebreaker question whenever you meet someone new is, “do you have a podcast?” After all, the majority of attendees either have a podcast or are thinking of starting one. So at Podcast Movement, when someone asked me, “do you have a podcast?” I answered, “Yes, but I’m here promoting my company Podcast Branding,” and the rest of the conversation focused on their branding needs and the services I offer. Before I knew it, my name was being passed around to anyone interested in podcast artwork or websites.\xa0People were tapping me on the shoulder, saying, “so-and-so said I should talk to you.” In some cases, I didn\'t even know who the "so-and-so" who referred me was.\xa0 These conversations usually ended with them asking me for my business card so they could reach out to me after the conference. Throughout the four day conference, I quickly gained recognition, not as Mark, the graphic designer who can possibly help you.\xa0But as Mark, the guy who specializes in artwork and websites for podcasters. I was the "podcast designer." It just goes to show you that being available to a niche and actively focusing on a niche are two different things.\xa0For years, I was available to podcasters for their design needs. It wasn’t until I decided to focus and target podcasters that things took off. And for the record, I landed several new clients at the conference, and even more emails with “Hi Mark, I met you at Podcast Movement." are starting to come in. I put my money where my mouth is and took my advice. I attended a conference where my target market was. I promoted a business that focuses on that target market, and my name is now slowly spreading amongst that market as THE person to talk to when it comes to their branding needs. It could work for you. If you target a particular niche, even as a side gig, the best thing you can do is go where your target market is.\xa0After all, what better place to network, than a large gathering of your ideal target market? Find a conference in your niche market and try to attend. Before you know it, your name may become known as THE designer for that niche. Clients know the added value of working with a designer who specializes in their industry and are willing to invest more in hiring them. Have you ever attended a conference to pick up clients?

Tip of the week Dealing with stubborn or difficult clients. Sometimes, it’s easier to make a client happy by doing what they ask, even if it goes against your better design judgement. It\'s not worth arguing with them and possibly pushing them away just to make your point. The client is always right, even when you secretly know how wrong they are. Listen to the podcast on the go.

You can reach me at\xa0feedback@resourcefuldesigner.com | Are you competing with discount designers? Let me start by saying that I\'ve never lost a client to discount designers. I\'ve had clients question my higher prices, but in the end, they ended up hiring me. I know that many designers have difficulty justifying their costs to their clients so I thought I would share what I do when a client asks "Why should I hire you when I can get that designed cheaper elsewhere?"\xa0 This is a follow up to last week\'s episode - Stop Competing On Prices. In it, I explained why lowering your design prices to compete with discount designers is not a sustainable way to run a design business. If you haven\'t listened to that episode, I suggest you do before continuing with this one.\xa0 I don’t have a ready-made checklist or prepared response for when a client questions my prices compared to discount designers. Instead, I follow these guidelines. Encourage the client to inquire about discount design sources. I never tell a client with my true feelings about these discount design services. Doing so would seem petty and expected. After all, of course, I want their business, so why wouldn’t I badmouth the “competition?” Instead, I encourage my clients to look into whatever service they mentioned. Even if it’s another local designer.\xa0Here’s something I might say: “I think you would be better off with me because I’m going to take the time to get to know you and your business before designing anything for you.\xa0By getting to know your business and its pain points, I’ll be able to direct my creative energy to find the perfect design solutions for your problems. I understand if you need to consider your budget and decide to look into (insert cheap designer source here), however, if you do decide to hire them instead of me, I want to make sure you get what you truly need.” This response shows the client that I have their best interest in mind even if it means losing them as a client. Coach the client on what to look for. If I were to send a client off without any instructions, I would probably lose them on price alone. After all, why pay multiple times the price for what you believe is the same service. However, by coaching the client on what to look for and what to look out for, I help them make a more informed decision.\xa0Here’s a conversation I might have with them: As you’re looking into (discount designers platform) for your design project, here are some things you’ll want to know before deciding who to hire. 1) Are they using clip art? According to most licenses, clip art is not allowed to be used in logos. Not all, but many of the discount designers on these platforms use clip art to speed up their process and keep their costs down. You can run into legal problems if the designer you choose uses clip art. Don’t take their word that they don’t. Once you see the initial proof of your job, it’s your responsibility to check it against the various clip art catalogues to ensure you can legally use the design. 2) Is it copyrighted material? Clip art isn’t the only thing you need to watch out for. Make sure that whatever they design for you is not stolen from someone else, or that there isn’t something almost identical out there that could again, lead to legal troubles. Some of the designers on these platforms have been known to steal other people’s designs and pass them off as their own. 3) What files are they providing? Make sure you are getting the proper files and resolutions for everything you need now, and for everything you may need in the future. Some discount designers only supply you a screen resolution JPG file. You’ll want to ensure you choose someone who will also provide you with hi-res and/or vector files. 4) Are they willing to talk to you? For a designer to do a good job, they need to know their client. Try to have a conversation with the designer you want to hire so they can fully understand you and your business. You’ll know a good designer because they’ll want to get to know you a bit before designing anything for you. Anyone who doesn’t want to talk with you first, doesn’t care about you or your business, all they care about is pumping out a design as fast as possible, because the quicker they can do it, the more money they make and the quicker they can forget about you and move on to the next client. 5) Do they charge for extras?. Be careful of prices and add ons. A lot of discount designers advertise inexpensive designs and then charge you extra for things that professional designers include at no additional charge — items such as vector files or higher resolution files needed for print. In the end, you may end up paying multiple times what you thought it was going to cost. Make sure you find out all the prices upfront and ensure you are getting everything you need. If you keep these things in mind when you’re choosing your designer, you shouldn’t have a problem.\xa0I’m here if you have any questions. Good luck. By providing this list of things to look out for, I\'m helping the client make a better decision and ensuring they are not losing out. It shows that I have their best interest in mind. Results As I said at the start, I’ve had several clients question my prices and bring up Fiverr or 99 Designs. And yet I’ve never lost a client to those or any other discount design platform.\xa0The trick is to be helpful and even encourage them to have a look.\xa0 If you take a defensive position and start bad mouthing discount designers, the client won’t take you seriously. They’ll think you’re only saying those things because you want their business. Which they are correct in their thinking, regardless of how truthful you are about those discount graphic design services. You do want their business, after all. But by being helpful, and encouraging them, they see that you have their best interest at heart, and that is a HUGE influencer in their decision-making process.\xa0A known relationship, even an unstarted potential one, is way stronger than an unknown faceless person at the other end of a text chain to who knows where. In all my years, I’ve only had one client follow through and try to get something done on 99 designs. A couple of months later, he hired me after his failed experiment.\xa0For everyone else, they quickly dismissed the idea and hired me.\xa0Maybe I scared them with all the things to look out for, or perhaps they just appreciated the way I handled myself.\xa0Regardless, they all became my clients in the end. So that’s how I usually handle the question of “why should I hire you when I can get this done cheaper over there?” How do you handle it with clients challenge your prices vs. discount designers?

I was talking to a fellow designer recently who is concerned about competing on prices. He asked me what I do if a client says they can pay less for a logo at Fiverr, Upwork, 99 Designs, or any other discount design platforms. This isn\'t the first time I\'ve heard this concern from a designer.\xa0You may have experienced this exact thing with your clients questioning your prices compared to discount design sources. The fact of the matter is, competing on prices is a no-win scenario. There’s no way that you can compete with the prices these places offer.\xa0Ok, maybe that’s not true. Sure you could lower your price to their level, but what would it accomplish?\xa0You would be selling your services for a pittance, and cementing yourself in a rut that would be difficult to escape. Competing on prices is not a sustainable way to run, let alone grow, your design business. I’m going to make this a two-part series. Next week I’m going to explain how I respond to clients who say, “I can get it cheaper elsewhere.” For now, I want to explain why competing on prices is a harmful and unsustainable way to run your business. It all comes down to this. If you offer rock bottom prices, you will never be taken seriously as a designer, let alone a business owner. If you try to match the pricing found on places like Fiverr or Upwork or 99 Designs, You’ll end up developing an unfavourable reputation that will be extremely difficult to overcome. You\'ll have a tough time trying to raise your prices in the future, which you will need to do if you plan on making a decent living at this design life. Are you familiar with the concept of a “dollar store”? There’s probably at least one, if not many around where you live.\xa0The premise of a dollar store is that just about everything they sell costs between one to three dollars. They\'re known as cheap discount stores. Dollar stores have a reputation for selling cheap merchandise. Not just in price, but in quality as well. After all, just how good can a $2 butcher’s knife or a $1 mini speaker be? And These stores are ok with that reputation. They make no claims that they are anything but what they are. Dollar stores don’t make their money by selling quality products; they make it by selling quantities of products. They make their money one dollar at a time. Could you imagine if all of a sudden a dollar store decided to sell a crystal wine decanter for $50? Their customers would question the validity of that product. There must be something wrong with the decanter, or it must be sub-par in some way. Nobody would take them seriously, let alone believe the decanter is worth $50. It’s a dollar store, after all. And their reputation for selling cheap merchandise for low prices would hurt them. That’s what happens to your design business when you try to compete by lowering your prices. Nobody will take you seriously as a designer, especially if you later decide to raise your rates. So how do you deal with discount designers taking clients away from you?\xa0The answer is easy; stop competing with them.\xa0In fact, and this may sound weird to you, but if you feel discount designers are your direct competition, the best solution is to raise your prices. Wait; what? How can raising prices help in this situation? I’m glad you asked. I talked about this in an early episode of Resourceful Designer. In it, I explained how Raising your prices can lead to getting better graphic design work\xa0and more committed clients. Recently I was listening to Tom Ross’s Honest Entrepreneur podcast, episode 87, to be specific.\xa0Tom is the founder of Design Cuts.\xa0He was on episode 155 of Resourceful Designer\xa0where we talked about supplementing your income by selling design products.\xa0 Tom mentioned an excellent point in episode 87 of his show.\xa0The biggest issue with pricing low is that the lower your price, the more designers you’re competing with. Tom permitted me to use this image, depicting his idea.\xa0\xa0  Looking at this hypothetical chart, would you want to be competing against 10 million designers for a client that will pay you $10?\xa0Or would you prefer to compete against 50,000 designers for a client that will pay you $1,000? Because there are so many designers charging lower prices, a client has more leverage over you. If they’re not happy with what you’re offering, they can very easily find a different designer for the job at the same or even lower price.\xa0And since the cost is so little, the client doesn\'t care where they get it from, as long as they get it. However, clients with a $1k or $10k budget have much fewer designers from whom to choose. So when they find one they like, they tend to stick with them. As you can see, offering low prices not only diminishes your income, but it drastically increases the number of designers you’re competing with.\xa0Why would you want to be in that situation? By ignoring all the discount designers and raising your prices, you diminish your competition, increase your income, and you earn the respect of those clients who hire you. Paraphrasing what Tom said on his podcast,  “Increasing your prices goes way beyond just earning more money; it makes everything else about running and growing your design business easier.”  Now you know why you shouldn’t be competing on prices, and why, if you find yourself doing so, the answer is to raise your design prices. Unfortunately, your clients don’t always understand these same reasons. Next week, I’m going to share how I handle it when clients bring up the option of discount designers.\xa0And I’ll give you a little tease. You may be surprised by what I tell them. Have you ever raised your prices and discovered you had less competition and better clients. Let me know by leaving a comment for this episode. Resource of the week\xa0Resourceful Designer Community The Resourceful Designer Community\xa0is an active community of designers with a common goal, a goal of improving and growing their design business. The Community is for designers of any levels. Current members include designers just starting their business, members with agency experience, members with knowledge of web design and print design, all willing to share what they know. The Community interacts via a private and very active Slack group, with new conversations happening every day. There are also regular video meetings. These video chats are where the magic happens. By seeing each other’s faces and interacting directly with each other, members become closer and more invested in what each of their fellow members is doing with their business.\xa0If a member can’t make the live video chats, they can view the recording which is archived for members to watch at their convenience. If have your own design business or are thinking of starting one, regardless of your skills as a designer, and you are looking for a tight-knit group of designers to help you by being mentors, confidants and friends, then you need to be part of the Resourceful Designer Community.  | Turning down design work. The idea may seem foreign to you. Especially if you’re relatively new to running your design business. If you’re at a stage in your freelance career\xa0where you’re trying to establish yourself, you’re trying to get your name out there; you’re trying to make ends meat and pay your bills, then you might not be ready for this concept. Turning down design work may not be in your best interest right now. However, if you plan on growing your design business to be more than a commodity, more than selling your time for money, then there will come a time when you will need to stop and think, “Is this a design project I want to take on?” You see, the goal for most home-based designers is to become successful enough to be in high demand.\xa0The type of demand where you are booking new clients and new design projects weeks, possibly months in the future.\xa0The kind of demand where a client is willing to wait several weeks for you instead of finding a designer that can start on their project sooner. When I was hand-coding websites, there were times when I was booking two to three months ahead.\xa0I don’t see that as much these days since WordPress makes it much quicker to design a website, but demand is still there.\xa0And when there’s demand, it means there’s an abundance of work coming in. And when there’s an abundance of work coming in, you can afford to be choosy in the type of projects you take on, and which projects you turn down. But how do you choose? I’m going to give you three criteria. Each criteria is made up of a few simple yes or no questions. Asking yourself these questions can help you decide “is this a design project I want to take on?” Criteria # 1 Yes or no?  Does this project sound fun or interesting? Will it be challenging? Will it push me? Will it make me learn new skills?  Is the project to design an event poster for a new upcoming festival, or is it to format a company’s 80-page code of conduct manual? One of these two projects sounds fun and challenging and can push you to learn new skills. The other, not so much. You need to decide if the project is a YES or a NO. Criteria # 2 Yes or no?  Will this project get me a foot in the door? Will it lead to other work? Will it lead to more interesting work? Will it connect me with people I want to connect with?  What will the future hold for you by taking on this project? If it’s an entry to bigger and better things, then it’s a definite YES. Otherwise, it’s a NO. Criteria # 3 Yes or no?  Is this project profitable? Will I make money on it? Will it bring me recognition or reward? Is it worth my time?  Note:\xa0Being profitable and making money are not always the same thing.\xa0Profitable can mean the project is advantageous, or helpful to you in some way besides monetary income.\xa0If you’re trying to break into a particular niche, maybe adding a niche related project to your portfolio is worth more to you right now than the money you’ll make on the project. Adding up the answers. Ask yourself these criteria questions before every new design project. If you answered YES\xa0to all three criteria, then the design project sounds like a dream job and you should accept it. If you answered YES\xa0to two of the three criteria, then you should highly consider taking on the project. It sounds like an ideal job for you. If you answered YES\xa0to only one of the three criteria, you should be leary of the project. Chances are, it’s not a project worth taking on. And of course, if you answered NO\xa0to all three criteria, take a hard pass on the project, it’s not for you. Go with your gut. These three criteria to accept or decline design work are just guidelines. Always follow your gut when it comes to working with clients and on new projects. If you’re hesitating about a job, even one that passes two or even three of the criteria, then the best course of action is to turn it down politely. Never take on a project you don’t feel right about. Are you in a position where you can afford to decline design work? Let me know by leaving a comment for this episode.

My name is Aaron Dowd. This show is for anyone who wants to make a great podcast.If you\'re interested in learning how to start a podcast, grow an audience, or improve at all the various skills that are a part of being a podcaster, this show is for you.In this trailer episode, I\'m going to share my back-story and talk about why I decided to start this podcast, who this show is for, and what topics I’ll be covering in future episodes.Little bit about me:I\'m a podcast producer and editor from Fort Worth, Texas. I started helping people make podcasts back in 2013. I was a full-time editor, producer, and consultant for a small podcast network and a bunch of independent shows for several years before joining Simplecast in late 2017 to be their customer success lead.My job for the past 6 years has basically been to answer questions and help people make great podcasts.I started this podcast in 2015 to share everything I\'d learned about podcasting. After producing 75 episodes, I took a break to finish a couple of online courses about podcasting called Successful Podcasting, Logic Pro X for Podcasters, and GarageBand for Podcasters.Topics I\'ll Be Covering in This ShowAs I\'m recording this trailer episode in September of 2019, I\'ve actually already published 80 episodes about a wide range of topics related to podcasting, including:How to Start a PodcastThe Best Affordable Gear for PodcastingHow to Grow Your AudienceHow to Outline a Podcast EpisodeHow to Record Audio That Sounds GoodHow to Write Great Show NotesHow To Sound Natural When Reading a ScriptHow to Make Money with a PodcastHow to Streamline Your Podcast Production WorkflowHow to Get a Job Producing Podcastsand moreMost of these episodes were recorded between 2015 and 2017, when I was working as a podcast editor and producer for my friend Sean McCabe.While a lot of the advice and tips I shared in these episodes are still helpful, a lot has changed in podcasting since I recorded them, and I\'ve improved as a podcaster as well, so I\'m going to re-write and re-record a lot of these episodes.I hope you find my podcasting journey helpful and inspiring (remember, you don\'t have get everything perfect the first time).My Story (How I Ended Up a Professional Podcast Editor and Producer)My story really starts with music. My mom is a classically trainer singer who also plays guitar and piano, she taught me (and my siblings) how to sing and gave us piano lessons when we were very young, and I started learning how to play drums when I was 12. Pretty soon after that I decided I wanted to be a professional drummer, but I wasn’t sure how to make that happen or if I could even make any money with it.As I got into my late teens and into my college years, I didn\'t really have a plan for how to achieve my dreams, so I ended up just kinda drifting for awhile, working lame jobs and wasting a lot of time and money.I woke up one day when I was 21 and realized I hated the life I had, so I decided I\'d make a big change, set some goals, and start pursuing my dreams. I wanted to be in a band and tour, but I knew that most musicians don’t make much money, and I didn\'t have much money, so I wasn\'t sure what to do.I had started working in an automotive parts factory around that time, but the work sucked and didn\'t pay much, and I didn’t want to be broke my whole life. I got the idea in my head that I could find a job I could do on a laptop so that I could make money while traveling with a band.Hey Google, How Do I Make Money From a Laptop?So in my early twenties, I googled "how to make money from a laptop". I found some articles about how it was possible to start a web design business and work from anywhere, so I started trying to learn how to be a web and graphic designer. I discovered podcasts around this same time too, and started listening to shows like Radiolab and This American Life, but also independent shows about business and marketing and web design and audio engineering, all kinds of interesting shows. This was all between about 2009 and 2012.How I Got Into Podcasts and Podcast Production and EditingPodcasts played a huge role in my self-education because I could listen to shows while working, driving, or doing chores. I was learning valuable things constantly and being introduced to ideas and potential opportunities I wouldn’t have known about otherwise.Around this same time, I also started studying audio engineering. Being a musician, I was interested in recording, mixing and mastering because I wanted to make demos for my bands.I started a podcast with some friends I met on a now defunct social network called App.net (the show was called Social Converse). I knew the most about working with audio, so I volunteered to be the editor, and that’s where I learned how to record audio, get audio from all the co-hosts, edit it together, and get it published in an RSS feed and out into the podcast apps/directories.Around that same time, I noticed that a lot of my favorite independent podcasts didn\'t have terribly great audio quality. There was a show I really liked called the Shoptalk Show. Back then, they were recording their Skype conversations and using the raw audio from that for their podcast. This was a pretty common practice back in 2012, and is actually still pretty common.There would occasionally be problems with their audio (levels all over the place, dropped calls, stuff that could have been edited out). I really liked the show and thought I could help, so I sent them an email and said, “I\'m a big fan, and I’d like to help you by taking over the editing for the show. If you can get everyone on the call to record a track on their computer and send the files to me afterwards, I’ll put them all together, so some editing and mixing, and make it sound good.”They agreed and even offered to pay me a little bit of money for each episode (which was super exciting for me). So that was really the start of my career as a podcast editor and producer.Around the same time I started working with the Shoptalk Show guys, I saw a job posting on Authentic Jobs from Dan Benjamin (founder of the 5by5 network) who was looking for an audio engineer for his podcast network. That planted a seed in my mind: Maybe podcast editing could be a full-time, remote job for me. (I didn\'t get the job then, but I did end up editing shows for 5by5 for awhile in 2014.)I had also joined a band around that same time, so I was traveling around, playing shows, working weird hours and filling all my free time either listening to podcasts or editing them.The guys from the Shoptalk Show kept referring people interested in starting podcasts to me, so I had a few more weekly clients and I was answering a lot of questions about podcasting and helping people start shows.I really enjoyed helping people make podcasts and answering questions, but I got tired of writing responses to the same questions over and over, so I put up a page on my personal website offering podcast editing services and also wrote a few blog posts to answer some of the most frequently asked questions. After a few months, my site showed up in the #1 on Google if you searched for “Podcast Editor”. That brought more questions, but also more clients.I started getting more and more podcast editing clients, and eventually I had enough to quit the day job I\'d landed a few months before as a junior front-end web developer.All this happened between about 2010 and early 2014. Around that time, I met a hand lettering artist from San Antonio who wanted to start a podcast network and online community for artists and entrepreneurs. I ended up helping him start a show and a small podcast network, and that was around the time I started this show too. A few years later, I joined my favorite podcast hosting company, Simplecast, to help them with customer support, education, and more.You\'ll be able to hear the original episodes of this show until I re-record them and replace them with new versions, but the original versions of all the episodes are available at https://seanwes.com/podcastdude-archive/.If you want, you can go listen and hear what I sounded like when I was first getting started with podcasting. You can also check out all the original show notes I made as well.Anyways, that\'s a not so quick introduction to me. Thanks for listening!You can check out thepodcastdude.com/episodes to see a full list of the available episodes for this show.If you have a question that I haven\'t answered in one of those episodes (or if you just want to say hi and introduce yourself), you can reach me via email at aaron@thepodcastdude.com, leave a voicemail at 8173818219, or drop a comment on my YouTube channel.I hope you enjoy the rest of the show, and happy podcasting.Aaron DowdSeptember 2, 2019Cool Stuff to Check Out:Recommended Podcasting GearThe Podcast Dude WebsiteSubscribe On YouTubeSuccessful Podcasting CourseSimplecast Blog (Helpful Articles About Podcasting) | Cool Stuff to Check Out:Recommended Gear: https://kit.com/thepodcastdudePodcast: https://thepodcastdude.simplecast.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/thepodcastdudeYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/thepodcastdudeSuccessful Podcasting: http://successfulpodcasting.comTwitter Thread: Podcast Producer Job PostingsWithout Fail: Ira Glass: The Man Who Launched a Thousand Podcasts (That Gimlet podcast interview I mentioned, real good)Most Jobs Don\'t Have An Official Job PostingNot everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. - Anton Ego, RatatouilleThe best jobs are never advertised. - UnknownThe jobs I linked to in that Twitter thread just the ones I found easily on job boards with a quick Google search.I know there are more podcasting jobs that aren\'t being shared on job boards because I\'ve landed a few of them myself over the past 5 years, and that was before the big podcasting boom of 2017.Podcasting is still a relatively new field, and many people, companies, and brands are only now beginning to think about starting a podcast.They might want to hire someone to produce a podcast, but they may not know how to put together a job posting, or they may not want to. They might not know which skills are required or what kind of person they need to hire in order to end up with a good podcast.This is a time of opportunity for motivated podcast producers at all levels.Q: If I want to be a professional podcast producer, what do I need to know and be good at?I took a look at the job postings again to get a sense of the most commonly listed skills and requirements, and here\'s what I think are the essential skills for podcast producers.Essential Skills for Podcast Producers:Content creation and direction: You should have experience developing shows and episode content, writing scripts and stories, participating in brainstorming sessions, etcAudio recording and editing: You should know how to record audio that sounds good, how to put a project together and edit it in audio software, how to write narration (if necessary), add music, mix and master, and whatever else the production requiresWorking well with others: You should be able to work with—and possibly manage—producers, writers, audio engineers, editors, freelancers, guests, and so onAbility to work under deadlines: You can get stuff done and shipped on schedule (time management skills)Proactive problem-solving skills: There\'s going to be stuff they don\'t know, stuff you don\'t know, so you should be able and willing to figure it outLeadership skills: This means you have opinions and taste and are comfortable with setting goals and identifying how you\'ll measure successQ: What if I don\'t have all those skills yet?That\'s ok, I didn\'t have all those skills when I started producing podcasts either, and I\'m still working on getting better at all of them.Study those podcast producer job postings for insights into what you should study, but remember that you don\'t need to be a master of everything to produce a great podcast, and the best producers are always learning on the job anyways.The important thing is to have a firm grasp on the basics and a willingness to work hard, experiment, take feedback and criticism, and keep learning.But since this is a prescriptive advice podcast, here are a few things I believe you should focus on if you want to increase your chances of landing a job producing podcasts.How to Increase Your Chance of Landing a Job Producing Podcasts1. Learn everything you can about recording and working with audioStudy all the various options for capturing audio in studio and live environments: Microphones, audio interfaces, soundboards, etc.Practice recording with different gear and in different locations. Learn how the gear and the room or environment changes the sound of a recording.Learn everything you can about how to manipulate and work with audio once it\'s been recorded. Learn about editing and post-production: EQ, compression, noise removal, limiting, and loudness metering.Learn how to organize and share your audio files, and how to backup and archive your finished projects.You can learn the basics in a few hours, but mastering recording and working with audio is a life-long project. That might sound intimidating, but I promise that it\'s actually a lot of fun (doing the same thing every day sucks).2. Learn pro audio software like ProTools, Logic Pro X, or AuditionMany people get started with podcasting using the free or easy tools like GarageBand or Audacity, but if you want to be a powerhouse podcast producer, you should acquire and master a professional DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like ProTools, Logic Pro X, or Audition.While it\'s true that you can make a successful podcast with almost any editing program, the professional DAWs have useful (maybe even essential) features that the free or cheap DAWs don\'t, including non-destructive and multitrack editing and other features for tweaking or enhancing audio once it\'s been recorded.Professional production studios and other podcast producers are also likely using the one or more of these pro DAWs, so if you\'re serious about producing podcasts, try to master at least one of the three DAWS I listed above (Pro Tools, Logic, or Audition).3. Learn the most popular technology and software tools used by podcastersIn addition to your DAW of choice, you should also learn and be familiar with (if not good at) all the various apps and software used by podcasters and podcast producers.That includes:Recording gear & softwareWriting apps and other collaboration software for communicating with co-workers, developing episode ideas and scripts, show notes, and so onGraphic design apps for developing visual assetsContent management systems (websites) and podcast hosting software (like Simplecast)Social media platformsand whatever else podcasters are using to make or grow their showsYou don\'t have to master every single app or software in each of the categories I listed above, but you should be able to learn and use them quickly if needed.If you tell yourself you can\'t (or don\'t want to) learn new software tools, you\'re right, and you\'ll probably have a hard time being successful as a podcast producer. Keep an open mind and be willing to learn.4. Study and learn from other producers (especially the great ones)Producing great audio is a craft, and there are many great audio producers to learn from.Keep your eyes open for them. Seek them out. Follow them on social media, subscribe to their shows, read their articles and books, and take their online courses.Ask them questions when you get the opportunity, but analyze their work either way. It\'s a great way to learn about how things are done and may give you some ideas about things to improve or how to do things differently (and hopefully better).5. Don\'t wait to get hired, start your career as a producer todayDon\'t wait for someone to hire you: Go out and start your own show, or help your friends start shows and try to figure out how to make them successful. Do the best you can and try to make work you can be proud of.A good self-initiated portfolio will go a long way towards convincing other people to hire you, and you\'ll gain more experience (and probably even learn more) by doing instead of just reading or watching tutorials.Q: What if I don\'t live in one of the big cities where these jobs are?Good news! While it can certainly help to live near a large city like New York City or Los Angeles where there are podcast companies or businesses looking to hire podcast producers, you can help produce podcasts from almost anywhere.The internet has made it possible to connect with people all over the world and the rise of broadband and fast internet means you can collaborate in real time or easily send audio files back and forth over Dropbox or Google Drive. And you can certainly learn everything you need to learn about podcast production as long as you have access to the internet and a library.If you\'d like to land a gig producing podcasts, I\'d encourage you to invest time in developing the skills I listed earlier, but also in networking and connecting with other people in the industry or similar industries. For example, I\'ve learned a lot from writers, web designers, programmers, marketers, managers, folks who work in the film and book industries, and many other kinds of professionals.Again, don\'t wait to get hired as a producer. Start studying and producing shows today.Have a question, or just want to say hi? Send an email to aaron@thepodcastdude.com. I love connecting with other podcasters.Happy podcasting! | Q: What is an RSS feed?An RSS feed is a formatted text document that contains all the important information about your show. It\'s hosted on a server somewhere (usually public) and has a URL so anyone can view or access its contents. It contains info about your show and your episodes: Things like your show’s title, description, episode titles, and links to the audio files for the episodes.It is possible to write and update an RSS feed yourself, but it’s time consuming and errors or typos can break things, so managing the RSS feed is usually handled by a podcast host.Q: Why do I need an RSS feed?The RSS feed is basically your show. Without it, you’ll just have blog posts or audio files, but no way for people to subscribe and get new episodes unless they visit your website (or SoundCloud page or Youtube channel, etc).Your show’s feed is what podcast apps and directories (like Apple Podcasts, Google, Spotify, and so on) will use to display your show and episodes in their apps.People can also bypass the podcast directories and subscribe to your feed directly using any compatible app. Since RSS is an established standard, there are many apps that can subscribe to and display info from RSS feeds. In fact, I use a mac app called Reeder to subscribe to the RSS feeds for multiple blogs and websites.Q: How do I make sure my new episodes get into Apple Podcasts and the other directories?In order to get your show into Apple Podcasts and the other podcast directories, you’ll need to submit your show’s RSS feed URL to them. This is almost always done via a web portal, like Apple’s PodcastsConnect website or Spotify’s Podcasters.Spotify.com portal.Once the podcast directory approves your feed (most places will within 48 hours), they will use the info in the feed to display your show in their directory. They’ll also check the feed regularly for changes and new episodes.Here\'s how it works: Your show has an RSS feed and you’ve already submitted the feed url to the directories. You publish a new episode in your podcast host, and some new lines that contain info about the episode are added to your show\'s feed.Since the directories are checking your show\'s feed for updates and new episodes, they see that a new episode has been added, and they use that info in the feed to display the episode in their app.As soon as the directory gets the new episode and adds it to their app, anyone who has subscribed to the show through that directory will get the new episode as well.Q: What do I do if my new episodes don’t show up in the directories right away or at all?As long as you included the required info about your episode when you published it, the directories and apps should see the changes and update pretty quickly, although Apple says it can take them up to 24 hours to update their podcast directory.If you can’t see the new episode in any of the podcast apps or directories, then it’s likely an issue on your end. Check with your podcast host or whoever manages/updates your show’s feed.If you can see the episode in all the apps/directories except one, then it’s likely an issue with that directory and not anything wrong with your feed. If you’re concerned, reach out to that directory’s support team and ask if they would mind taking a look.Q: Can I change podcast hosts or RSS feeds without breaking things or losing my show’s subscribers?You can move hosts anytime, although it’s easier with some hosts than with others. Most hosts will copy an existing RSS feed and audio files over to their service.After you have the URL for the new feed that was setup for your show, you’ll need to update the podcast directories so they check your new feed for updates and new episodes instead of the old one. This is usually done through the same web portal that you used to submit the show, although some places require you to send an email. Your host should be able to help if you have questions.You can check out this article for links and instructions for submitting and updating feeds.Q: What is a 301 redirect?The 301 redirect directs anyone who visits the old feed URL over to the new feed URL for your show. It’s kind of like setting up a mail forward.Your podcast host should allow you to add a 301 redirect to your old feed if you’ve moved your show to a new host and gotten a new feed for your show. If your podcast host doesn\'t make it easy for you to easily redirect your feed to a new feed, your host sucks.Q: I’ve read or heard about an iTunes new-feed tag that needs to be added to a new feed. What’s that?The iTunes new-feed tag just lets Apple know that this is a new feed URL for your show. I’m not sure why they ask for this if you also have to log into PodcastsConnect and update the feed URL for your show there, but they do. Your host should handle this for you (Simplecast adds this tag automatically whenever a show is imported).Recap:You don’t have to be afraid of RSS feeds. They are just formatted text documents that contain info about your show. You can access or copy them anytime.If you move your show to a new host and get a new feed, you’ll need to redirect your old feed over to the new feed, and also update the podcast directories so they check the new feed for updates instead of the old one. You won’t lose any subscribers if you follow these steps.Cool Stuff to Check Out:Recommended GearPodcastTwitterYoutubeSuccessful PodcastingSimplecast BlogA Podcaster’s Guide to RSS (from Apple)Have a question, or just want to say hi?

After launching my Successful Podcasting course and joining Simplecast in late 2017, I immediately dove head-first into my customer success and support role there. In addition to traveling to multiple podcasting conferences and meetups in 2018, I also answered questions for thousands of podcasters about pretty much everything you could imagine.It was super fun but also more challenging than I was anticipating, and didn\'t leave me with much creative juice for working on my show, so I would like to apologize for the lack of consistency over the past year (2018). I am going to continue working on this show, but it will be more of a side project for now as I\'m putting 110% of my energy into helping Simplecast and our customers be successful.That being said, the Simplecast team has been making some incredible tools and educational content for podcasters, so I\'d encourage you to check out the links I\'ve included in the episode notes.I\'m super excited to share what we\'ve been building for podcasters over the past year, and I hope you\'ll follow along.

There are many reasons to stop doing something, and many reasons to keep going even when it’s hard.In this episode, I want to share why I’m pausing my show, and hopefully give you some clarity if you’ve been thinking about quitting or putting your show on hold as well.Highlights, Takeaways & Quick Wins:If your relationships or your personal health are suffering, it’s time to stop your podcast.Tell people what you’re doing and why.There’s a huge benefit to sticking with something for a long time, because it takes people time to notice you.Once you’ve had a strong impact on someone, it’s okay to take a break and step away for a while. People won’t forget you.If you want to make massive progress on one project, say no to everything but that one thing.Why Am I Pausing My Podcast?A lot of you know that I’ve been working on podcasting courses this year. I’m pausing my show to focus on finishing them and getting them launched. At the beginning of 2016, I said, “I’m going to get these courses done this year.” I started writing this big master course called Successful Podcasting.I wanted to teach everything you’d need to know to start a podcast: planning a show, recording a show, getting good gear, getting the hosting set up, interacting with your audience, and everything that goes into making a great podcast. I wanted to do videos, screencasts, PDF downloads, checklists, and more.I got it done (well, almost). I worked really hard on it this year, especially in the springtime. Cory McCabe (the video guy at seanwes) came up from San Antonio to help me shoot all the video lessons in the last two weeks in July.I wrote something like 30,000 words for the course, and finished shooting all the videos in July (we ended up with 75 video lesson). The next thing was recording a short screencast course called GarageBand for Podcasters. That was six or seven screencasts about how to get started using GarageBand for podcasting. I got that done, too. The very last thing was my Logic Pro X for Podcasters course.I knew my Logic Pro X course was going to be challenging. I knew it was going to be anywhere from 30 to 50 screencasts about everything I know about editing podcasts in Logic. I’m not quite done with that yet. I’ve recorded 90% of the screencasts and I have the other ones outlined, but life got crazy.There’s so much I’m still doing: Editing shows on the seanwes network, trying to produce content, interacting with my audience, trying to answer questions for people, making videos, playing in a band...It’s hard to do big, important work when you’re also doing lots of shallow work. I was trying to do a whole bunch of things and I wasn’t making much progress on the course as a result.The primary reason for me pausing The Podcast Dude is so I can finish the Logic Pro X course, get it edited, and get all of these things launched. That way, people can invest in them and go through all the lessons at their own pace, on their own time.I’m not going away completely. I’m pausing my podcast to free up time to finish my courses and get them launched. I’ll be returning to make more podcasts after I’m done with that.I want to interact more with my audience and create more content that helps them specifically.When is the Right Time to Pause a Podcast?The biggest reason to stop podcasting is if your podcast no longer aligns with your long term goals.If the thing you\'re podcasting about is no longer something you\'re passionate about, if you want to do something else, it’s okay to stop the podcast. It’s okay to change, to go from caring intensely about one thing to caring intensely about something else. You’re supposed to evolve as a human.Don\'t Sacrifice Your RelationshipsI asked my friend Cory, "What would cause you to stop doing a podcast?"Cory said, “If my wife came to me and said, ‘I feel like our relationship isn’t good, like you’re investing a lot of time in this podcast and you’re sacrificing family time or personal time with me to do this podcast,’ that would cause me to quit the podcast.”If your relationships or your personal health are suffering, it’s time to pause your podcast.You might be doing too much. This is a trap a lot of people fall into, at least in America. We fill every second of our time with doing stuff, trying to get to the next level. At some point, you wake up exhausted, you’re out of shape, you don’t feel good about yourself or your life. If your relationships or things that are important to you are suffering, pause the podcast. Put your podcast on hold.If your audience isn’t growing and you don’t see a way to make money from it, if it’s a huge time investment and you’re not enjoying it anymore, it might be time to quit.You can change the format so that it takes less time to produce, or you can admit that the investment isn’t worth it for you, and that’s fine. Maybe you should be doing five minute YouTube videos instead. Maybe you should be writing instead.This comes back to knowing your audience and what they want. I was listening to a writing podcast the other day, and they had their podcast editor on to talk about podcasting. Their guest said that she started a podcast for vapers (people who love electronic cigarettes). She thought, “There’s a huge, strong vaping community. They’re going to want to listen to a podcast.” She started a podcast about vaping and got no response.She didn’t understand why the show didn’t get any traction. It might have been because she wasn’t well known enough, or maybe she hadn’t done it for long enough (she did it for four episodes and then cancelled it).She said she realized that her target audience really wanted videos. They wanted to show off their gear and their clouds of smoke (it’s the dumbest thing in the world, but people get excited about blowing these huge clouds of smoke when vaping. Ridiculous.) She said that they wanted video, and the audio podcast just didn’t work for them.There are some circumstances where video works better than audio.Some topics just aren’t right for podcasts. For example, it’s really hard to explain how to do audio mixing and mastering on a podcast. It’s so much easier to record a screencast so your viewer can see what you’re doing.Don’t Quit Just Because You’re BoredPodcasting is a long term investment. You have to be thinking in terms of years rather than months when doing a podcast.There are lots of benefits to podcasting: Meeting awesome people, growing your network, building an audience, and even getting clients (depending on what kind of show you’re making).You’ll learn a lot of valuable skills, but in most cases, podcasting won’t make you a lot of money right away. You won’t get to 10,000 listeners and $5,000/month in sponsorships overnight. Many podcasters won’t ever get to that point, and if that\'s your only reason for podcasting, you\'ll probably end up disappointed.If you’re looking for a quick return on your investment, podcasting is not the way to go. This ties into what I said earlier about your podcast not aligning with your long term goals: If your heart’s not in it, if you don’t really care about this thing that you’re podcasting about, it’s okay to shut it down.Be Careful of Shiny Object SyndromeCory and I talked about this too. He said, “There’s one guy I know who always starts stuff and then stops and goes to something else.”That’s Shiny Object Syndrome: You get excited about doing a new thing, and then it’s not as fun as you thought it would be or you get bored with it, and you move on to the next new thing. You bounce from thing to thing and never get really good at anything.I see that happen in podcasting a lot. People get really fired up about the idea of starting a podcast, so they start a podcast. When it doesn’t turn out to be everything they dreamed it could be, when they don’t get Tim Ferriss levels of money coming back from it or tons of people talking to them and investing time in their show, they quit. They forget that getting good at podcasting and growing an audience takes time.It takes time for people to notice you. You can announce, “Hey, I have a podcast,” one time, and most people aren’t going to notice.You know what they’ll notice? They’ll notice if you post about your new podcast episode every single week for a year straight.They’ll notice if you consistently talk about the same subject all the time. There are authors who don’t get noticed until their 10th, 20th, or 100th book.Sometimes it’s hard to know when you should keep going or when to quit because the thing you’re working on just isn’t working out. Just be careful of Shiny Object Syndrome.Quit Permanently, or Just Pause for Awhile?You don’t have to quit permanently. It’s okay to take breaks, like I’m going to do. Bands take long breaks all the time.There was a band I used to listen to when I was 14 (I think they were called Johny Q. Public). They put out a great CD in 1995, one of the first CDs I ever got, and I loved it.5+ years later, I was browsing through the CDs at a record store and I came across a new record from this band (I hadn’t thought about them in years). They released a new record and I bought it, because I’d loved their first album many years before.Once you’ve had a strong impact on someone, it’s okay to take a break and step away for a while. They won’t forget about you.People don’t forget the people who\'ve had an impact on their life. Momentum is important, and a track record of consistency is great, but sometimes you need to take a break to plan your next move.Thank You for Listening!Thank you for coming along with me on this journey. This podcast been one of the coolest and most rewarding things I’ve ever done. I want to say thanks to you for listening, sharing my show online, and for all the encouragement.I hope I’ve had an impact on your life, encouraged, helped, or inspired you in some way. That’s why I do this.Finally, I would really appreciate an iTunes review if you haven’t done that yet. It helps other people find the show, and I really appreciate it. Thanks again, and I’ll talk to you again soon! | My guest this week is professional audio engineer Ryan Monette. Ryan graduated from Berklee College of Music with a degree in Music Production & Engineering. For the last 4.5 years he\'s been the Post-Production Audio Engineer on staff at Elevation Church, in Charlotte, NC, where he mixes their global TV show, and has many other responsibilities (boom operator, field recorder, sound designer, audio editor, etc.). You may have heard some of his work, as he sound-designed and mixed the opener video for the Circles conference for the past two years. He even had his own podcast for a short while (TheQueuecast.com). I asked Ryan to come on the show to share his journey towards becoming a professional audio engineer (a job that I\'ve always wanted), and to get him to share some tips for anyone interested in working in audio/video professionally.Highlights, Takeaways & Quick Wins:Think long term and dream big.If you want to do anything with audio, start by getting a cheap USB microphone.Take advantage of free online courses to learn more about audio engineering.Get started with whatever you have.Your mix may sound completely different in a different environment, so listen with different headphones/speakers in different locations.Master the basics and keep going back to them.If you’re mixing a podcast, make sure your levels are consistent.When mixing, always use a reference track.Show NotesAaron: You graduated from Berklee College of Music with a degree in music production and engineering. For the last five years, you’ve been the post production audio engineer for Elevation Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. You have a lot of jobs there: boom operator, field recorder, sound designer, audio editor, and you mix their global TV show. Do you mix that live?Ryan: Not necessarily. We can get into that later. There’s a process for that.Aaron: Some of the creative people here might have heard of some of your work. You sound designed and mixed the opening videos for the past two years of Circles Conference, which I was at. Have you been there for the past two years?Ryan: I haven’t been personally, no. I have wanted to go. I love it from afar, and I want to go in person.Aaron: I wanted you to come on this show because when I first got started, I had dreams of being a professional audio engineer. I thought, “How cool would it be to work in audio and get paid for it? That’d be awesome!”I fell backwards into it by doing podcast editing as a hobby first, then for money, then I met Sean McCabe and ended up working for him full time. I edit podcasts and help out with a ton of other stuff. I asked you to come on the show to share your advice for anyone who’s interested in working in audio/video professionally, and to talk about how you got there yourself. So tell me a little bit about how you got into audio. When did you first realize that this was something you wanted to do?Ryan’s Journey to Becoming a Professional Audio EngineerRyan: I love listening to your podcast, Aaron, and what I love about it is I feel like you and I have a lot of similarities in our backgrounds. You’re a musician, a drummer, and I’m also a musician. I play several things. My primary instrument is bass, but along with that, I started on piano. I picked up bass, and with the bass I picked up guitar. I took some drum lessons here and there as well.I sing as well. I dabbled in a little bit of everything. I’m kind of a jack of all trades, master of none. I’m okay at a lot of things, but I’m not superb at one thing. Anyway, right around junior high or high school, I started playing the bass. I started playing in little bands here and there. When it came time for college, I had no clue what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I loved music.Aaron: Same here!Ryan: I was living in Las Vegas at the time, so I decided, well, everyone has to have that college experience, and I didn’t want to go to college in the same city, so I decided that I needed that “being away from home” experience. I went to the University of Nevada, Reno. I took your basic, general classes, not knowing what I wanted to do. At this time, for my high school graduation, I had received a graduation present of a Macbook Pro.With that, of course, you get the wonderful iLife suite, including Garageband. As a musician, a whole new world was opened up to me. When I was in a band in high school, I was the gear head—I loved the PA and putting cables together.I was drawn to that. Once I had this Macbook Pro with Garageband and I had my bass and my guitar in my dorm, I was like, “I can create music!” I figured out how to work it and record myself. I bought a USB microphone, and that world was opened up. When I was there, I had a friend, and her brother went to this school where all they learned about was music. I was like, “Wait, you can do that? You can go to school for just music?”That’s how I found out about Berklee School of Music. I applied, and you have to audition as well. I applied and auditioned, and the first time I tried, I actually didn’t get into the music school I wanted to go to.Aaron: This sparks something in my mind. I feel like I might have read an article about Berklee or looked into it and thought, “No, they’re really strict on who they accept, based on your performance.” That was intimidating to me at the time, because I never felt like I was that good of a drummer.Ryan: It was intimidating for me, too. Clearly, I wasn’t up to par.Aaron: Yet you went for it. That’s more than a lot of people would do.Ryan: Yeah. After I finished my first year at UNR, I moved back to Vegas and went to UNLV, the University of Nevada Las Vegas. I took all music classes, forgetting the general ed stuff you need to get a degree. I took all music classes—music theory, because I had never had actual music theory classes, so I thought I needed that. With that, there were some audio classes that I took as well. I was like, “Hey, I like this audio thing.”At the University of Nevada Las Vegas, I had my first exposure to a formal audio class, where I learned all the proper techniques. Later on that year, I applied and auditioned again for Berklee. I got accepted, and the next year, I moved to Boston and went to Berklee for about three and a half years. Then I graduated. When I went to Berklee, the only thing that drew me as a major was Music Production and Engineering. I naturally loved the gear side of things. I fell in love with recording. I was like, “This is what I want to do.”Aaron: You got to spend three and a half years there, studying and learning?Ryan: It is non-stop, 24/7, music, audio, and to be honest, I miss being in that environment so much.Aaron: That sounds fantastic. I always love setting aside time to take online classes, read books, and listen to interviews about audio.Think Long-TermAaron: You were drawn to the audio engineering stuff, and then you graduated.Ryan: I can remember a specific time in my life, and I’m pretty sure it was my last semester at Berklee. They went by semesters instead of years. It was in one of my capstone classes. Our instructor asked us the typical, “Where do you see yourself in five years?” question.Aaron: I love that question now. I hated it when I was 22.**  Think long term and dream big**Aaron: Plan out where you want to be, because if you can envision it, then you can figure out how to get there. But you have to start by saying, “I want to do this thing someday.” For me, it was, “I want to do work from a laptop. How do I get there?” Now I’m there. So you were 22 and someone asked you, “Ryan, where do you want to be? Where do you see yourself in five years?”Ryan: At that moment, I was trying to figure that out, naturally, as you do when you’re approaching the end of college. While I was at Berklee, I loved music. I loved recording music, but my absolute favorite class—they only had one of them, but it was the class I yearned for, that I wanted to take and put in all these extra hours for—was audio for visual media, audio for video.By far, that was my favorite class. The whole class, we were working toward our final project. You choose a five to seven minute clip from a well known movie, and all the audio is completely stripped. You have to recreate everything. That’s all the dialogue, all the foley, all the ambient background, all the hard effects, and so on. You have to connect with a film scoring student there at Berklee, and they have to provide the score. I absolutely loved every aspect of that project and the process. When it came time to decide what I wanted to do with my life, it was between audio engineering at a recording studio, working at Disney as an Imagineer, or doing audio at a church.I have always been involved with church, playing on worship teams and whatnot, so I also saw myself doing audio for a church. Long story short, I was really privileged to dip my feet in all of those things after college. After I graduated, I moved back to Las Vegas. Eventually, I found an incredible recording studio, probably one of the top two recording studios in Las Vegas, and I landed an internship.First Audio Engineering JobsRyan: I say “internship” loosely, because your typical studio internship is all the stereotypical grunt work—taking out the trash, doing the coffee, and whatnot. I showed up, and they were like, “You went to Berklee? Berklee guys are cool. Here, hop in this session and help us out.” It was open to me, thrown at me, and next thing I knew, I was assisting on sessions with huge clients, I won’t name drop.Aaron: You can drop a couple of names if you want.Ryan: I had a pretty fun time helping out with a session with the famous engineer Eddie Kramer, who is engineering for Carlos Santana.Aaron: Dang, man! That’s awesome.Ryan: That was pretty incredible. But while I was there, I had this gut feeling inside of me saying, “This isn’t it.”Aaron: It’s fine, but it’s not quite right?Ryan: I could see myself staying there and working my way up, but it didn’t feel right. A few months after I realized that I didn’t want to stay at the studio, I applied and was offered a job at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.I packed my bags, moved to Orlando, and I was working as a stage technician at the Epcot park. There, they found out that I was an audio guy, so they pushed me toward the live audio side of things. I was mixing shows and bands at Epcot and what was at the time Downtown Disney, now Disney Springs, area. Same thing. Almost as soon as I got there, the same gut feeling came in.I was like, “This isn’t it. I’m more of a studio engineer. I definitely don’t want to do live stuff.” Although I love Disney, it just wasn’t sitting right. I was only there three months before the next great opportunity came up, which is where I am right now. One of my friends told me about a job opening for this church in Charlotte, North Carolina, Elevation Church. I had actually been following them because of their podcast.At the time, I was kind of like, “I’ve got a job, whatever.” For some reason, I ended up on their website, looking at the job. I was reading, and I was like, “Wait a minute, they’re looking for someone to do audio for video. That’s what I really want to do!” On a whim, I threw out my resume. Next thing you know, I’ve been here going on five years.Aaron: Did you mention that you were a podcast listener when you sent in your resume?Ryan: Yeah.Aaron: The connections you can make through podcasting is really incredible.Ryan: It is. And I’ve been working there for 5 years now.How to Get Into Audio EngineeringAaron: I want to jump into what you do at your job at Elevation, but let’s pause and do a section on what advice you would tell someone who’s wanting to get started. I wrote a couple of things down here. I think it’s hilarious that you got a Macbook and your first microphone was a USB microphone.Ryan: Which was the Blue Snowball, by the way.Aaron: That’s the worst microphone!Ryan: I had no idea how to use it, either. If I find some of the earliest recordings I did, there are times I’m clipping to the max, square waves.Aaron: Probably bad mic technique, too. But hey; it got you started!If you want to do anything with audio, start by getting a cheap USB microphone.Any USB mics will work for getting started. I like the Blue Yeti, but it’s like $100. The ATR-2100 is fine, too. You just have to get something that can record some audio and start playing with it.Start playing with Garageband. Start playing with the free programs. Learn how to enable recording on a track, how to set your input device to the microphone, how to set your output device to wherever your headphones are plugged into, whether that’s your mic or your computer. It took me so long to figure that stuff out. I was like, “Why can’t I hear the audio in my headphones? What is going on?”Ryan: Same here.Aaron: You have to set input and output, then you have to record enable or do the input monitoring, all that stuff. But start with the USB microphone. Take some basic classes. There are so many great online classes. If you don’t have any money at all, if you’re super broke like I was when I started, watch some free YouTube videos. Read a book.Ryan: If you go to Coursera.org, they’re a website where you can pay to take online courses and get certifications and whatnot, but they also offer free online courses. They even offer free online courses from Berklee. I’ve seen a music production class there. I’ve taken a free online song writing class.Check out free online courses, because they can be a pool of incredible knowledge.I took a photography class on there. Coursera is a great place. They’re great if you want to take free online courses.Aaron: There are places where you can learn all this stuff. You just have to invest some time. You really just have to start: Don’t wait until you have $500 for an interface and $200 for some professional headphones and microphone. Whether you want to start a podcast, start recording audio for a video, or record and mix a demo for a band, start doing something.Stop spending all your time thinking about how you can’t do anything because you don’t have certain gear or you’re not in the right place. You’ll learn as you do, especially in audio. You’re going to make a ton of mistakes.Ryan: That’s how you learn, though! That’s one of the most valuable things I’ve learned in life. You learn from your mistakes.Aaron: You don’t really learn when everything goes well.Just StartAaron: Any other advice you would give somebody, thinking back on how you got to where you are right now?Ryan: Honestly, you hit the nail on the head with “just start.” It’s as simple and cliche as Nike, “Just do it.” There is always going to be the next latest craze, the gear, and we’ve all been susceptible to that. We say, “Oh, well, I could do this if I had X.” It starts with the drive and determination, wanting to do it. There’s knowledge out there everywhere. You just have to dig for it.Chances are, you have at least something you can start with. Record something on your phone.Aaron: I have a friend who makes some awesome music on his iPhone.Ryan: Oh, totally. It’s as simple as getting an adapter. You can plug your guitar or whatever into your phone.Aaron: Kids these days have it so easy!Ryan: You have Garageband on your phone. I remember when I was figuring this out in high school, and we actually had a four track tape recorder. That was my first start. Get started with whatever you have.Aaron: What kind of stuff do you do at the church? What’s your day to day life like? Are you there every day, or is it just a couple of days a week?Ryan: Oh no, I’m definitely there every day. It has been a whirlwind for sure. In the past five years, I have probably played every audio role that there is to be played here. My main thing now is audio for broadcasts, pretty much anything that leaves the church. Our biggest output is the sermon, which goes to a lot of places.It also goes in the TV episode, which we talked about, which goes locally, nationally, and, I believe, globally as well. That’s a lot of what I’ve done. We also create a lot of films, short films, for our worship experiences, anything you can imagine that’s video and audio related. Audio post production, like we talk about. I’m constantly on video shoots using field recorders, the boom op, anything you can think of. Audio for video, I’ve done it.The Gear Ryan UsesAaron: Let’s talk about your gear a little bit. What kind of stuff are you using most in everyday life? I’ll do a quick recap: I have the Shure Beta 87A Mic as my main podcasting microphone. It’s attached to a Scarlett 18i20 USB Interface (update: I’m now using my Zoom H6 exclusively), which is plugged into a quadcore iMac that’s a couple years old.Nothing super fancy, but I’m really happy with where I am. I remember wanting all this stuff back in 2011, thinking how awesome it would be to have it. I have a Zoom H6 portable recorder and a couple of SM58 microphones. I’ve been pairing down my gear collection because I’m planning on moving in the spring.What kind of stuff are you working with? I use Logic Pro X for editing, and then Izotope iZotope RX 5 for cleaning up background noise or fixing clipping. What about you? What’s your day to day favorite gear?Ryan: We use a lot. There’s a bunch of gear for field recording and then in my office, which is where I’m at right now. I’ll start with my office. Right now, I’m talking into my personal mic, which is a Rode NT1A. It’s very affordable.The Rode NT1A is a nice beginner mic which works and sounds great, and I use it for a lot of voiceover projects.Aaron: I like those mics.Ryan: I’m talking into that right now. We also use the Shure SM7B. We have a nice Neumann that we’ll use for bigger projects. We like to use Universal Audio Interfaces, so I’ve got one of those. They’re great. They’re rock solid. You really can’t beat them.At our main recording/editing audio work station, we use Pro Tools. That’s very standard, and I’ve been using that for years and years. I use a lot of plugins. I use a lot of the Waves Plugins. I do use RX as well, and that’s the bulk of it. I do a lot of processing, depending on the project.I have a really huge sound library for if I’m doing narrative pieces that involve sound design, sound effects. I have a great app called Audio Finder, which a lot of electronic musicians use to help them find sounds. I use it to help me find sounds. It’s a nice way to catalogue sounds if you’re a sound designer or anything like that.You can basically tag all these audio files with meta data, and you can search for sounds by their title. Or, if you type in a word in the search bar, it can pull up things based off the the metadata. If you have notes on something, it can find it. Audio Finder is a great way to find sounds.I have some other things in here. I have the Artist Mix Controller made by Avid. I use those if I’m automating stuff. I use those a lot, actually, when I’m mixing the sermons. I do a lot of automation for that. If I’m mixing a piece with a music bed or something, I like to automate the music by hand.It feels more natural, as opposed to clicking and making little dots. That’s the bulk of it here in the office. All of our audio engineers have a nice pair of Focal monitors. I also have another set of monitors I built myself. When I mix TV episodes, I have an output routed to a TV here in my office so I can hear how it translates on TV speakers.Recording Audio for VideoRyan: On the front end of things, if we’re doing shoots for videos, we use Sound Devices field recorders. We have three different models: the Sound Devices 788T 8 Channel Recorder, a 702 2 Channel Recorder, and then a 633 6 Channel Recorder. That last one is one of their newer models, which is great.Sound Devices are steep in price, but they are rock solid.One of the most trustworthy, well known field recorder brands on the market. That’s what you’ll see on pretty much every big budget shoot in some way. I do a lot of freelance on the side, which gives me the opportunity EPK shoots or BTS shoots for, recently, a show on HBO called Outcast.Aaron: Outcast? I’ve been seeing that (I watch Westworld).Ryan: I’m pretty sure it’s the same writers or producers or something. I know it’s the same writer as The Walking Dead. They shoot here in North Carolina, so with a local production company, we’ve done some interviews with some of the cast and crew. It’s been really neat to be on set and see what they’re using. It’s cool to see how similar their world is to what we’re doing day to day, just with more money and more resources.It’s the same thing. Most of their audio guys have some sort of Sound Devices. A lot of them use the 788 as a backup recording rig, and they’ve got larger multitrack recorders as well, that are also made by Sound Devices. Sound Devices is a great brand. They’re crazy expensive, but when you buy that, you know you’ve basically got it for life.Aaron: Yeah, I’m looking at the Sound Devices 788T SSD 8 Channel Portable Solid State Audio Recorder. It’s almost $7,000. I love that! So fancy.Ryan: That SSD does have an internal hard drive. Ours has a hard drive as well, so it’s great, because it has the internal hard drive, but you can also use CF cards. You can record on two different mediums. In case something runs out of space, you have it in two places.Aaron: This is super professional stuff.Ryan: Yeah. It is. It’s top of the line.Aaron: Fantastic. For all the rest of you, just go with the Zoom H4N or the H6.Ryan: Hey, we do have a Zoom H4N, and we do use that every now and then. Before I came on staff, our first field recorder was the Zoom H4N.Aaron: If I could start over and go back to before I had any kind of interface at all, I think I would buy myself an H4N or an H6. Not only are they portable field recorders so you can walk around with them—they have little stereo condensor mics on them—but they work as audio interfaces, too. You can plug it into your computer with a USB cable and record straight to your computer if you do any kind of podcasting or stuff like that.It’s good for the price. Otherwise, the little two channel interfaces are great. They’re about $100 for a good one, but they aren’t portable. You can’t take them to a show or out to a video shoot the way you can an H4N or an H6 or something.Ryan: Speaking of Zoom, they’ve recently come into the more professional field recording market. About a year ago, they releases the F8, I believe, which is an 8 channel field recorder with 8 mic pres. It’s $999 for something very comparable to a Sound Device. It’s not quite as high-fidelity, but for anyone starting out, you’re really not going to notice the difference.Mixing On Expensive Headphones or MonitorsAaron: I was going to ask you this earlier. You mentioned that you had Focal monitors. Did you listen to the episode I did a few episodes back where I talked about mixing on headphones (Episode 69: Do You Need Expensive Headphones to Mix a Podcast?)?Ryan: Yes, I did.Aaron: I mix on $10 Panasonics. What do you think about that? You can be totally honest with me. You can tell me that it’s a stupid idea or that it’s okay.Ryan: I agree to a certain extent. I agree that you should be listening to what you’re making on whatever the majority of people are going to be listening to it on. For a lot of audio engineers mixing music, that’s iPod earbuds, those standard earbuds you get. Something like that. When I mix TV, I have an output routed to a TV in my office, so I can hear it on TV speakers.I do also believe in mixing on something with some sort of higher fidelity type of monitoring environment, whether that’s nicer speakers or nicer headphones. Naturally, you’re going to hear things differently. The main thing to take away is how things translate.If you’re listening to something on one source and you make it sound good there, that’s great, but in a different environment, it may sound completely different.iPhone earbuds may not have the bass that a car stereo has. You want to hear how it translates from one thing to another. That’s why it’s good to at least listen to it on two different sources and not just narrow yourself down to one cruddy thing. That’s good in theory, but again, the key takeaway is translation.Aaron: Maybe it’s a little bit different for me and I can get away with it because of the consistency of the microphones and the recording environment set we use.Ryan: Yeah, totally.Aaron: I think if I was doing more stuff like you are, with videos and clients and all that kind of stuff, I would absolutely be using my higher fidelity headphones.Ryan: Very true. The bulk of your work is dialogue, podcasts.Aaron: Yeah, that’s really it. Just dudes talking into a microphone.Ryan: Yeah. I have done a lot of work here where I’m working in a small studio, but a lot of my mixes have played in auditoriums and arenas.If you’re working on projects like music or film that have different audio frequencies and spectrums, remember that sound will be perceived differently in different places.Aaron: How do you even test for that?Ryan: Here, I at least have a sense of how our auditorium sounds, so I’ve trained my ear to hear in advance and understand how it’s going to translate. For something like when we did a live recording in the biggest arena here in Charlotte, we had a video opener piece. I was on point for mixing that, so basically, I had to work with tech and production to find a time after setup where I can bring my session, copy it onto a laptop, and play it through the PA.Then I can make any final mix tweaks there in the auditorium or the arena. I perfected it in my studio, and any small tweaks I was able to do in that actual environment. Granted, a lot of the times, we may not have that luxury. There are also great plugins you can buy that simulate different monitoring environments, like Sonarworks.If you have certain pairs of headphones, you can tell the program, “I have these headphones, now make my mix sound like it’s coming through these headphones or these speakers,” so you can hear how it might translate. In that program, they have a final output like the Beats headphones. You can hear how it might sound on there, super bass heavy.Aaron: I hear they’re getting better, but I still have never bought any Beats headphones. I probably should (just for testing purposes).Ryan: There are definitely programs out there to help you see how things translate to different monitors.On Location GearRyan: We were talking about the gear we use for on location recording. Sound Devices would be our main recorders. For our mics, we use Schoeps. It’s a shotgun microphone, so it’s a narrow polar pattern with good off axis rejection. Schoeps is a great brand. Again, you’ll see this on professional movie sets.That’s the mic we use. We have some Sennheiser shotguns as well, the ME66, we have a couple of those, which is more their entry shotgun mics. Recently, I rented some of the MKH416.Aaron: I would like one of those. The Sennheiser 416 is well known as the classic TV shotgun mic, right?Ryan: Exactly. I rented those out because I wanted to try it out for that reason. The Schoeps is very good and very well known on set as well, but so is the 416. I rented it to try it out. It’s a trusted mic that a lot of people use for these professional things, and it doesn’t really break the bank for what it is.Aaron: They’re like $1,000, I think.Ryan: Yeah, and it sounded great.Aaron: The next mic I get is either going to be that or the Rode NTG 3.Ryan: I’ve heard a lot of great things about that. I haven’t tried one myself.Aaron: That’s the shotgun mics we shot my podcasting courses with.Ryan: Yeah, I know that Sean uses that for all of his videos.Aaron: I’m excited about getting to go work with those (I’m moving to San Antonio in March or April).Master the BasicsAaron: That’s a pretty good run through of your gear. I’m sure you could keep going and discuss a lot more, but I don’t think we need to go into that. It seems like you guys are at a super professional, high quality. You have made big investments in professional gear, which is fantastic. I encourage everyone to strive for that, to aim for that, but like we said earlier, use what you have right now. I don’t have anything close to what you guys have, but I’m still doing my podcast. I’m doing the best I can with what I have.Ryan: It still sounds great.Aaron: Thanks! It’s mostly just knowing how to set gain levels and not having a noisy room. It’s crazy how far the basics will get you— everything else is just icing on the cake.I’ve been watching this video course called Zen and the Art of Work, which I really recommend to everybody. It’s mindfulness training mixed with productivity training, which is such a great combination.In this course, he says, “So many of the masters continually revisit the basics.” Mastery is staying on a path. It’s not reaching some final goal, it’s more about being with the work and investing in getting better, but also revisiting the basics. He was talking about playing piano. He was like, “A lot of times, I just start by touching the keys, pressing the keys, and then doing basic scales over and over again.”It’s true. When you get so good at the basics that you don’t have to think about it, that’s when you start to expand and get to that level where people say, “Wow, you’re so good at that. How did you get so good?” You’re like, “That was just doing the basics. It’s not anything fancy.”It’s so important to master the basics and keep going back to them.Learning MoreAaron: What’s next for you? How do you invest in yourself and improve? Or are you working so much that you always have more learning opportunities? Do you buy books or courses or follow any websites to learn more about this audio stuff?Ryan: Honestly? We had a shift at work to where my role has shifted to mainly just broadcasts. That has enabled me to have a little bit more flexibility and free time, so I’ve been doing a lot more freelance work. That’s great, because it energizes me and keeps me engaged. It keeps me from routine. Routine is great.I love routine, that’s very much my personality, but freelance work keeps things interesting.For me, it’s all about where and how I can get inspired and constantly feeding that. It’s about feeding my desire for creativity. We’re all creatives. We like to create. We were designed to be creators, really. Everything I try to do is about how I can become a better creator and what I can create next. It’s about finding things that inspire me, really. We touched lightly on a few of the resources that I like, things I’ve learned and places I’ve picked things up.If you’re interested in audio for post production, there are a couple of great books by Ric Viers. I have two books by him that are really great. The first one is The Sound Effects Bible, and it’s not just sound effects in there. He talks about everything from gear to microphones, basics, setting proper gains, compression, some mixing techniques, etc. He also has The Location Sound Bible.There are a lot of similarities, but there’s also a lot of talk about gear, shotgun mics, lop mics, recorders, and then he also dives into some of the basics when it comes to mixing, proper gain staging, and so on. Those are a really great pool of knowledge in book form. There are a lot of other books out there, but I have found those two to be really helpful.Other than that, when it comes to audio for video, it’s a very small, niche field. There isn’t a crazy amount of stuff out there, like there might be for mixing music. For that, you’ve got tons. You’ve got Pensado’s Place, all these people on YouTube putting out channels on mixing, mixing from home, mixing on a budget, etc. There’s plenty of that.Aaron: Graham Cochrane and Joe Gilder are pretty awesome resources for anyone who wants to start a home studio.Ryan: YouTube can be a pool of knowledge for anything and everything, too. You have to dig a little bit and do some searching. On the inspiration side, for me, since I love audio for video, Sound Works Collection is a great place. They’ll do mini videos interviewing the sound people that did sound for X movie. Whether it was the last Harry Potter or anything and everything, big budget films, they’ll sit down with the recording people, the sound designers, the mixers…It’s really cool, because they’ll show footage of them doing stuff on location or the foley artists. It’s cool to see their process. For me, that helps me stay inspired. It gives me ideas to do other things. They have a podcast as well, and that’s great. The videos can be kind of short, maybe 10 minutes or so, but the podcast will go on at length, talking to the audio guys who have made sound for videos possible.It will also be music composers for movies as well. That’s really great. I found that great not only as inspiration, but to know what and how audio professionals for big budget films get inside their minds, how they’re thinking, and what their process looks like.It’s neat to see stuff about sound engineers for big movies and realize that we’re not so different.Dealing With a Broad Loudness Spectrum (Dynamics)Aaron: I have a nerdy question here. This is about normalizing and compression, I think. Aiya had asked, “I’m so torn about normalizing sound clips. If I’m working on a longer project in segments, would it be better to adjust my peaks manually for the sake of consistency? It’s for a video project.” I’m hearing that there are differences in video volumes. How do you deal with that? Do you do compression? Do you do automation for the different parts? How do you deal with dynamics?Ryan: It depends on the project. I’ll talk about how I would mix a sermon, because that’s very dynamic. Our pastor will go from whispering, holding his handheld mic close to his stomach, to screaming, holding the microphone, cupping the capsule. Power and respect to him, because it creates a certain atmosphere, which has a powerful effect. That’s what I’m dealing with on a weekly basis.That dynamic range is tremendous. Keep in mind, this is going to TV eventually. TV has very strict restrictions. It’s not so much on level, but on perceived level. There’s a difference between what you see meter and what you’re hearing. I can talk at length about that, too.Aaron: Could you give us a super short version? I’m kind of aware of that, but since I just mix in Logic, I’m not sure how to measure it. Is there a way to measure it in Logic? Do you know? Is there a plugin you use?Ryan: I use a plugin from Waves. It’s a loudness meter, and its just that. It has a lot of presets, so I’ll use the TV standard preset. I’ll use it for ATSE85, and I’ll use it for a dialogue bus. They’ve also got one for a master bus. The standard right there is your average level around -24 dB LUFS, so that’s full scale. If you have a classic meters, your peak would be zero, so that would average metering right around -10. At least for TV, I’ve got a hard limiter at -10 dB, to where nothing can go above that.The difference between levels on a meter vs. perceived loudness is the differences between what we hear and the actual energy.In our TV program, we’ll have the sermon, but we’ll also have a talking heads segments, which is dialogue and a music bed. We’ll also go into segments where they’ll go into worship from our live album, which had been mixed and mastered as an album. That thing is slammed. If you look at the wave form, it’s a sausage. If I’m setting all that by the meters alone and they’re all hitting -10, it may look right, but if I look at my loudness meter, that worship segment is going to be off the charts.There’s so much more content in there. There’s so much going on with all the different frequency ranges as opposed to a dialogue track, which is a narrow field in the frequency spectrum. That’s the gist of it. When it comes to my technique for controlling dynamics, for something like mixing a sermon, if I’m going down my plugin chain, the first thing I naturally have is a high pass filter. I’m rolling off those unnecessary lows that are hogging energy.The next thing I’ll do is use a compressor, and I’ll set the attack to right in the middle, so not fast or slow, and I’ll have the release time at fast. We don’t want to hear it pumping, letting go. That’s catching my peaks. It’s not doing a crazy amount, but it kind of is. That’s helping do a lot of the bulk compression. Before anything really hits the compressor, I will go through, and as I work my way through the mix, I will clip gain the wave form, so that, say, if he’s whispering somewhere, I might keep that, depending on how I have my compressor set.Then, if we go up to a part where he’s screaming and my wave form is huge, I will take that down and create those nodes, those dots in the wave form, and drag the actual clip volume down, that gain down. That way, it’s not going into the compressor at this high gain level. It’s hitting the compressor evenly as the rest of it would. That way, it’s not driving the compressor crazy. Then I’ll go through and do some EQ and DSing and whatnot. I might add some more compressors in there, just to grab some of those little things coming through. After that, it’s subtle, just smoothing it out.Aaron: It is a little bit of both. If she has access to an audio editing program—I don’t know what she’s using for editing. If you can put a compressor on the track, do that. It’s not exactly the same, but I did a YouTube video about how I process podcast vocals, and it’s very similar. For podcast vocals, I start with a Logic noise removal plugin.Ryan: I actually have my noise suppressor, and I’ll use that later on down in my signal chain. My way of thinking is that if I’ve got all this compression going on, the compression is narrowing that dynamic range, so it’s bringing up that noise floor. I tend to do my noise suppression after the bulk of that compression, because the noise floor is higher and it’s easier to work on a supressor. If that makes sense.Aaron: I’ve thought a lot about whether you should do the noise removal before or after you add a bunch of gain with a compressor or something, and I can’t think of a good reason that it matters. You can take out the noise before you add a bunch of gain, or you can add a bunch of gain and take out the noise afterwards. Which is better? I don’t know. Anyways, after the noise removal plugin, I put an EQ with a high pass filter, a peak compressor, an RMS or an average level compressor, and then a limiter.Ryan: Like I mentioned earlier, before I had my long-winded answer, it also depends on what it is you’re mixing—whether it’s music, or a podcast, or something for film.When it comes to dialogue for film, you want it to sound as natural as possible, but you also want to be able to hear if someone is whispering.When it comes to that, I’ll still use a compressor, but it will be very, very light. If there’s anything I need to do to meet loudness, that I will automate the volume on my dialogue bus. I’ll bring that up. That way, it sounds a little bit more natural, instead of solely relying on a compressor to do all the work for you.Aaron: That makes sense. For podcasts, if I notice that there’s a section where someone was talking much quieter, like if a guest backed away and talked like that for four or five minutes and then went back to the normal distance from the microphone, in Logic, I’ll turn that into its own clip. I make a cut on either side of the quiet part, and then, in Logic, you can double click on it and change gain by hitting Control G. Then you can add 3, 4, or 5 dB to it.That works out pretty well. If it’s every five seconds or I have to do it more than five or six times in an episode, I won’t do the clip gain changes, I’ll just use a compressor.Look at the overall audio file and see if there are long stretches where you can use automation to change the gain, or change the clip gain.Common Audio Mistakes Podcasters MakeRyan: You asked a question that I think would be good to talk about in regards to podcasting. You had asked, “What do you like about podcasts? What common mistakes do you hear people make?” Initially, I read this and thought, “I don’t know,” but I spent some time thinking about it. This is great, because it piggybacks off the loudness thing.A lot of the mistakes that I hear when it comes to podcasts in regards to audio is the levels and loudness aspect. I’ll listen to some podcasts that sound great, and I’ll put on another podcast where the whole thing is super quiet. Then they start laughing, and it’s really loud. There are some, like mine, where they have a music bed underneath the entire thing, and then sometimes the music bed is so quiet that you hardly know it’s there.You’re like, “What the heck is that noise in the background?” Sometimes, it’s the opposite. Sometimes, the music bed is way too loud. That’s a few of the things I’ve noticed. A lot of the fixes relate to what we just talked about. It helps to have knowledge of levels and perceived loudness.If you’re mixing a podcast, make sure your levels are consistent.One of the biggest things I can recommend for anyone mixing anything, whether it’s music, movies, a podcast, is the importance of having a reference track.Aaron: Yeah, I don’t talk about that enough.Ryan: That is huge. Professional audio engineers who mix platinum records still do this. They will pull in a track from a different song that is mixed well and is mixed how they want theirs to sound, and they’ll have it muted in their session. When they want to have a reference to listen to or train their ear, they’ll un-mute it, and they’ll go, “Oh, okay.”I’m sure you’ve done the same thing as me, where you’ll be so involved in a mix, you’re in it, and you think it sounds great, and then maybe you go away. You go home, sleep, and maybe you come back, and you open it up and you go, “Woah! What was I thinking!” You can get so involved in it that the blinders go up. You get tunnel vision, and you’re not aware to some things.It’s good to have a reference track or get an outsider’s opinion on a mix.The main takeaway here is the reference track. That would help with anything, whether it’s the timbre, how you’re EQing, or the loudness. You pull in their track and it’s far louder than yours, and you automatically know that you need to do something about it.Aaron: That’s a great idea. You can kind of do this before or after. You go through and you edit your whole podcast, get everything set up the way you want, create an extra track, and then find a podcast that sounds really good—This American Life or pretty much anything by NPR—download an episode, drop it into your editing program, and play it, mute it, and see what the difference is. Maybe you need to add some gain with an adaptive limiter or with a compressor, or maybe you can tell that your track sounds way sharper or harsher.Are there are too many high frequencies or too much bass compared to your reference track? You can adjust those things. I’m so glad you mentioned that. I’ve never thought of that before, and that’s such a good idea.Ryan: It’s one of those things you don’t think of much, but once you do it, you’re like, “Oh my gosh!” It’s really eye opening and really helpful.You can find Ryan online at ryanmonette.com, and follow him on Twitter @RyanMonette.More Links:Gear: https://kit.com/thepodcastdudePodcast: https://thepodcastdude.simplecast.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/thepodcastdudeYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/thepodcastdudeSuccessful Podcasting: http://successfulpodcasting.com | Highlights, Takeaways & Quick Wins:For big projects, you need long stretches of uninterrupted time to think and work.Work on building your focus muscle.The first five minutes of focus time are the hardest.Pick a task, pick a time, and do the task at that time.Show up every day and do your best creative work.If you can’t overcome fear, push through it—fear is a sign that you’re doing something that matters.The way you feel about a product doesn’t change how much it’s worth, which is how much the market is willing to pay for it.Protect your morning productivity time and your mental energy by setting out your clothes the night before.Don’t undervalue your products.Pick one thing, do it for two months, and allow yourself to suck at all the other areas of your life—after that, pick a new thing.Pick one action you can do tomorrow morning that will get you closer to the most important goal.Show Notes:Aaron: We both really loved Cal Newport’s Deep Work book. When did you get interested in the idea of intense focus and structuring your life in a way to make sure you get your best creative work done? When did you find that book or that idea and really start working on that?Shawn: I think I found the idea years ago. When I was a creative marketing director, like I mentioned, I was doing 80 hours a week. Part of my schedule was that on Fridays, I would come home and work from home. I wouldn’t be on email or answer the phone. I had an assistant, and anyone who needed to get ahold of me needed to go through my assistant. She would screen anything and see if it was urgent or important for the day. If it was, she’d let me know.I set up this distraction-free work time for myself on Fridays, because as the director for the marketing and all the creative stuff we were doing, it was on me to make sure that our marketing campaign for this big, end of the year, 25,000 person conference was going to happen. It was all on me. I had to drive that. You can’t do that in 10-minute time blocks scattered throughout your day.For big projects, you need long stretches of uninterrupted time to think, process, come up with ideas, and work on stuff.That was my first experience of going, “I have to have this. If I don’t, I won’t be able to do my job, and I will always be in reaction mode.” That was my first experience, and that was in 2008 when I came across that idea. It was born out of necessity for me. Obviously, that’s not new to the world, but it was new to me. When I quit my job and started blogging for a living, I came to that same spot of saying, “I need to set aside time every day to write without distractions, intentionally.”That has evolved as we’ve had kids, schedules have changed, and seasons of life go up and down. I need uninterrupted stretches of time on a regular basis to do my most important work and to focus on the stuff that’s not urgent today but is very important. If I neglect it, those things will become urgent, or the needle is going to start going backwards and I’m going to start losing ground.Why Deep Focus MattersShawn: Focused time has always been important. Then I came across Cal’s book, So Good They Can’t Ignore You. I read that in 2015. That’s a fantastic book. There was this chapter in there on intentional practice, and that resonated with me so much. It’s very similar to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s book, Flow.He has a lot of books on very similar topics on finding flow, getting in the flow, whatever. He has one book called Flow and another one called Finding Flow. It’s the idea that not only do you need those times of uninterrupted work, but when you’re in that moment, if you can get into the flow, it’s challenging, it’s hard, etc, but you feel more rewarded. You feel better. You have a higher motivation about the work you’re doing. You feel like you accomplished something.I don’t know if anyone listening can relate to this. You spend your whole day in reaction mode, bouncing around between your email inbox, your Twitter feed, your Facebook feed, your Instagram feed, back to email, back to Twitter, back to Instagram, back to Facebook, back to email. You’re bouncing around all these inboxes, and then you’re like, “Wow, I just spent four hours. I haven’t done anything.”Aaron: You read a bunch of short emails, maybe you replied, maybe you sent some tweets, maybe you saw some articles.It’s so easy to spend all day doing short, quick tasks that don’t really change anything.Shawn: Exactly. They don’t change anything, and you feel zero satisfaction afterwards. You don’t feel like you got anything done, as opposed to if you took those four hours and, instead, spent it focused on something intentional, something that was challenging. If you set aside time to do deep work, when you come out of that time (even if it’s just one hour or half an hour), if it was distraction free and you’re focused and being intentional, you come out feeling better.After spending intentional time working on something without any distractions, you feel more motivated and you have more energy. It’s this muscle. You have a focus muscle that you have to work on, as opposed to the distraction muscle.Why is Creating Focused Time So Hard?Shawn: The hardest thing for getting into that focused work time, getting into the flow, is called the Activation Energy, just getting started. The first five minutes of focus time are the hardest. Something I like to do is have a set time every day when I am going to have my focused writing time, and before I even get there, the day before, I write down what my single most important thing is that I’m going to be writing about. I have the time on my calendar, and I have the challenge, project, or task that I’m going to be working on.As Cal Newport would say, what’s the artifact that I’m going to try and get from that focused time? Then I come, sit down, and do the work. I know that the first five minutes will be hard and I probably won’t be into it. I have to power through those first five minutes, and then you get into that flow. Time begins to get lost. Anyone who has been a painter, artist, musician, whatever, you can usually relate. You say, “I was just in the flow. I was in the zone.” That’s where your best work is going to be created.That’s where you’re going to feel the most satisfaction with your job. That’s where you’re going to increase your skill level as a creative person. You’re going to level up your ability to do stuff. Sean has talked about this so much with his Learn Lettering course: he did 9,000 hours of intentional practice! That’s what he was doing every day. He had this focused time where he was practicing letters. You have to put in the time.How to Stop Procrastinating and Do Your Best WorkAaron: Everyone should read Cal Newport’s books, So Good They Can’t Ignore You and Deep Work. Both of those books are phenomenal. It’s so important as podcasters to pick a day to outline and record an episode, and write the topic in advance. Say, “I’m going to spend 30 to 45 minutes at this time writing about this thing, and then I’m going to record an episode.”Otherwise, what ends up happening, and this is true of so many areas of life, is that you will spend a lot of time thinking about how you should do a thing. I’ve been thinking about how I should record a screencast for three weeks now. “Hey, I have to record that ‘introduction to limiting’ screencast for my Logic course,” and I’ve been thinking a lot about it, but I haven’t done it yet. It’s so silly, but that’s how procrastination works. You spend more time thinking about how you should do a thing instead of just doing the thing.Pick a task, pick a time, and do the task at that time.That’s such a simple version of an idea presented in Deep Work that is so life changing. I talk about that book all the time because I love it, and I know there are still some people who haven’t read it yet. It is a book that anyone who wants to create stuff for a living professionally needs to go listen to. Shawn, you should do a whole series of videos or interviews where you talk about deep focus for creative people.Shawn: I do. I did some stuff, like the TheFocusCourse.com/margin page. I interviewed Cal Newport, and we talked about this. I interviewed a few other folks and wrote some articles, and it was on this topic of having margin in your life, the breathing room, so that you can do your best creative work. That’s our mantra over there at The Focus Course: Show up every day and do your best creative work.I think margin is a huge part of that. The deep work, the focus, it’s a huge part of it. Otherwise, you’re just working on your email inbox all the time. That’s no fun.Push Through FearAaron: The first question I want to talk about is this one from Mariali. She asked, “How did you overcome the insecurity of giving birth to a new idea you weren’t sure people would respond well to?” I think this was about a book but it could be about anything, really.Shawn: I didn’t overcome the fear. I put it out there and stuck to the plan. The way that worked with my Delight is in the Details book, was that I had done it as a podcast mini series for my members only. It was a little five part podcast, and I got a lot of positive response from people. I had teased it out, and I got a positive response, so I thought, “I should sell this for maybe like $5 as a sample for the Shawn Blanc membership thing.”I thought, “I should rewrite it, so it’s a little bit more structured. I’ll rerecord it so it doesn’t have the welcome in it, so it’s a little bit more of its own product.” As I’m doing that, it goes from five episodes to like 12. There were all these extra chapters that I ended up writing. Then I thought, “Gosh, if I’m going to to this, I might as well interview some other people, and then I can charge more for the thing.” Instead of charging $10, I could charge like $20. That would double what I’d make from it.So I made the book, and when I was getting ready to sell it, that was the hard part. That launch day, I just felt super insecure. I felt bad and sick to my stomach. I texted a few friends of mine. I was like, “This book is coming out in an hour. People are going to hate it.” Everyone was like, “Stick to your plan. Put it out there.” The people I trusted, who’s opinions I cared about, all said, “You’re fine, keep going.” I listened to them, and I did. I kept going and it. I pushed through that fear.I never overcame the fear—I just pushed through it.I kept going. You begin to learn that the fear becomes this mile marker for you, a sign post that you’re probably doing something that matters and creating something that matters. Now I’ve learned that when I feel that, “This might not work,” or, “Holy crap, what am I doing? I’m in over my head!” I should probably keep going, because I might be on to something that matters at this point.Aaron: That’s fantastic advice.The Market Decides What a Product Is WorthAaron: I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I talked about this in the Fired Up Mondays podcast this morning, which is that the market decides what’s valuable. People will complain when they see a product that they don’t think is worth as much as the company is charging for it. Let’s say that you look at a Lamborghini, and you’re like, “I don’t know why anyone would ever pay $400,000 for that car. Why would you want that car? You could just buy a 1999 Toyota Camri that has 140,000 miles on it for $4,000.”“This ’99 Camry works great. It gets me everywhere. Good gas mileage, pretty comfortable. Not the most amazing sound system, but it does have a Bose sound system in it, so it’s fine. Why would anyone spend $400,000 on a Lamborghini?”The way you feel about a product doesn’t change how much it’s worth, which is how much the market is willing to pay for it.There’s somebody out there willing to pay that much money. They have that much money, and it doesn’t matter what you think about that product. Somebody else went out and made that, and they’re going to make money from that while you’re at home complaining about how somebody else is spending $300 for a picture book from Apple. How you feel about the price of a product doesn’t matter.Shawn: It’s how the people that are buying it feel that matters. To say, “I’m not going to start a Lamborghini company because used Toyota Corollas exist,” that’s silly, but that’s how we feel.Aaron: Relating to my courses, which I’m getting close to wrapping up, pricing is interesting for me. If I hadn’t met Sean and the people in the seanwes Community, I think I would have charged a fraction of what I’m planning on charging. I probably would have charged closer to $20. I would have put all this time and energy into it and not priced it high enough, because I didn’t realize that there are people out there that sell courses for $1,500 and $10,000.Don’t Undervalue Your ProductsShawn: I bought a course recently that cost me $2,000.Aaron: So many people don’t know that. A lot of us still think that $2,000 is a ton of money. For a lot of people, it is. That doesn’t mean that you have to apply such a low price to the product that you’re making, just because you feel like $50 is a lot of money.Don’t charge too little for your product because you feel like a higher price is a lot of money—that’s an easy trap to fall into.Shawn: That’s very true. You have to step back. This course I bought, for me, it was a no brainer. I bought the book that was written by the guy, and I went through the book and implemented some of the stuff in there, and it helped me launch my time management class. That did $20,000 its first launch week. I spent something like $18 on this guy’s book, and it helped me make $20,000. So his $2000 course was a no brainer for me.This master class version of that book, the online course version of it, that was a no brainer for me. There were a ton of videos, all this implementation stuff, coaching, and all this stuff that was involved in it. There were all these things you can do that can increase the value of your stuff. Don’t increase your price just because. Start with your basic price and then double it and double it again. Now you’re probably at a decent starting point.You’re so prone to under-valuing your own work. You don’t just jack the price up because people say so. You need to look objectively and say, “Alright, am I providing the value?” If someone comes in and takes my Focus Course, for example, we charge $350 for it. It’s not a lot, but it isn’t a little, either. If someone spends $350 and goes through this course, are they going to be able to walk away with at least, ideally, $700 worth of value? I want them to get at least double the value they’re paying for it.Can I get it to be even more? Can I get them to walk away with $3,500 worth of value, 10X the amount of value that I’m providing? You charge that, and if people take it seriously, they’ll walk away with something that wil literally change the way they spend their time with work, family, health, and finances. This is across the board for their life, and you can’t put a price on that.Objectively ask yourself if you’re delivering on your promises and providing the value that you say you are.With your stuff, Aaron, with podcasting, if you can help people get a podcast off the ground, they can turn that into a full time business. That’s worth $50,000 or $100,000. Someone could say, “Thanks to your stuff, I started a business that’s now thriving. I do this as my job.” That’s worth so much money! To charge $20 for it? Don’t undervalue your stuff.First Steps to Improve Your FocusAaron: I want to answer Kyle’s question here in the chat. I’m going to read his question and I’ll let you take a stab at it, Shawn. Kyle asked, “Is there a best first step to improved focus? I can think of so many directions I should go: exercise more, eat better, write down what I’m doing the next day, sleep better, etc. Trying to do all of it at once isn’t sustainable. What should I start with?”Shawn: This is great, Kyle, excellent question. I feel like there are two best first steps (which obviously doesn’t make sense, you can only really have one first step, but play along). We talked about this in the Focus Course. On the very first day of the Focus Course, there’s this super dorky assignment. You have to set out your clothes for what you’re going to wear tomorrow. Tonight, when you go to bed, pick out tomorrow’s outfit. It’s super dorky. You can do it in two minutes. In the morning, you have to wear the outfit you picked out the night before.You have to actually follow through with your commitment. You set this thing out, and you say, “I’m going to wear these pants and this shirt,” etc. In the morning, you wake up, and you have to wear it. You’ve made a commitment to yourself the night before. In the morning, you wake up and you follow through on that commitment. It’s a small step towards strengthening your personal integrity, which is your ability to follow through with your commitments to yourself. That’s super powerful.The other component to setting out your clothes the night before and then putting them on is that it’s your current self helping your future self. You’ve saved your future self five minutes in the morning. The quality of my time in the morning is super valuable. My mind is fresh, it’s the beginning of the day, there are no fires happening yet. That’s my best chance to get my best work done, early in the morning.Protect your morning productivity time and your mental energy by setting out your clothes the night before.It’s this idea of helping your future self. Once you get your toe in that water, you begin to see all the other areas of your life where you can begin to help your future self. We were talking during the podcast about this. Kyle says, “Yes, I’ve done this.” That’s awesome. As Aaron and I talked about earlier, when you have that deep work focused time, try to decide ahead of time what that focus is going to be. This is your current self helping your future self.It’s so powerful. For me, I write down my topic that I’m going to be writing about tomorrow when it’s time for me to write. I have the topic ahead of time, so I know what to write about. Then, when I sit down, I don’t have to think about. I have the singular focus to write about this topic that I’ve already chosen. That can really help with improving focus.Be ahead of your own curve and help your future self.Those of you who are registered for the Creative Focus Online Summit will get to hear Josh Kaufman and I talk about this. He talks about the importance of going on a walk in the morning and having 30 minutes where you leave your phone at home. You go outside, you’re moving, you’re getting sunlight, but also, it’s 30 minutes of thinking time where you can be undistracted. You can just think. He calls it “noodling.”You let your mind “noodle.” He talks about how when you have a productivity system and a focus system that gives you space to think and to be uninterrupted for a little bit, you’re going to be far more productive than if you have a system that doesn’t give you space to think. For him, he says that that is the number one, single most important component of being more productive and focused—actually having carved out time on a regular basis where you can just think.Be distraction free. That’s why he says to take a walk. You can combine that with movement, being outside, getting sunlight, and things like that. It’s easier than sitting on your couch and staring at the wall for 30 minutes. I don’t say that to put that idea down, but it can be easier to be undistracted when you’re outside walking around and you leave your phone at home. As opposed to, you put your phone next to you on the couch and you hope that it doesn’t buzz.You can put it in airplane mode, obviously, but it’s still right there. You want to grab it and take it off of airplane mode. So coming back to Kyle’s question: You have so many directions you want to go. Exercising, eating, writing down what you’re doing the next day, sleeping better. Right? People say, “I want to improve my relationship with my spouse. I also want to get better at budgeting my finances. I also want to get better at budgeting my time. I also want to read these books.”You look at it, and there is so much stuff that you want to do. You can’t do all of it right now, so pick one thing. What’s the one that’s most exciting?Build One Habit at a TimeShawn: Kyle, you listed exercise as the first thing on your list, so I would start with that. Not to pitch my course, but I’m going to pitch my course. We go through all the core areas of your life: your job, your relationships, your finances, your “down time,” your physical health, and your inner or spiritual life. These are the six areas of your life. We go through each one of those and spend time on each one, where you list out what’s important to you in this area of your life.What’s a goal that you want to have or a lifestyle practice that you want to implement, and how can you move the needle forward toward that goal? You come up with six goals and six action plans, one each for the main areas of your life. Spoiler here, at the end of the course, you pick one.Focus on improving one area of your life for six months and ignore the other ones.Don’t ignore them in terms of ignoring your wife for two months while you’re focusing on work, but you pick one area to build a habit, a routine, a lifestyle practice, that has you making meaningful progress in that area of life. A lot of people say that it takes 21 days to build a habit. Actually, if you’re a habit building master, you might be able to do it in 21 days, but it takes most people 60 days to build a habit. That’s the average. That’s two months!I think a lot of people are probably familiar with the Jerry Seinfeld productivity tip with the calendar. You write a joke every day and you put a big X on your calendar, and you don’t want to break the chain. It’s the same with this new habit of yours. Say, “What’s one thing I can do on a daily basis that’s going to help me move toward my goal of exercising more, of being more physically active?” What’s the minimum dose, the smallest thing you can do?You’re going to go walk for 20 minutes, or whatever it is. Do that every single day for two months. It’s a small start, but now you’ve done it. You’re two months in, and now, instead of it being this thing you are trying to get the motivation for to move forward, you’re doing it. It has become routine for you, which requires far less activation energy, far less mental energy. It has moved into your life. It’s there. It’s something that you’re doing on a daily basis.Now, you pick the next thing. “Okay, I have the exercise thing.” Keep that and layer the next thing on top of it. You’re doing that for your physical health. What about for your inner life, your spiritual life? What’s something you would want to layer on top of that, something you could do? Now, during that walking time, maybe you’re going to think about something. If you read a Bible or something like that, you could say, “I’m going to have a Bible verse that I think about during my 30 minute walk.”Maybe you’re trying to improve your relationship with your spouse. Bring them along on your walk. Now, you can incorporate this. Say, “I’m going to do this on a regular basis,” and you do that for two more months. Then you pick the next layer. Maybe it doesn’t build on that 30 minute walk itself. Maybe it’s an entirely different part of the day, but the core is the same.Pick one thing, do it for two months, and allow yourself to suck at all the other areas of your life—after that, pick a new thing.This is why New Year’s resolutions never work. We say, “I’m going to go to the gym for five hours a day every day starting on January 1st, and I’m going to start budgeting, and I’m going to stop eating chocolate, and I’m going to go on date nights every week, and I’m going to read a book a week.” January 1st, go! It’s so much. You’re going to run up and try to push a truck, but you don’t have the energy, the strength, to move and change that much that quickly.With the truck analogy, if you’re driving a car and you want to try and tow another car, you don’t gun it with all this slack on the tow line. You’re going to rip both of the bumpers off. You start super, super slow. You slowly build up that speed. That’s how you do it without getting in a wreck. You actually make that momentum. Start with just one thing.The hard part is giving ourselves permission to pick one thing and focus on that for two whole months.That’s the hardest part, really. It’s not in the doing. It’s in the not despising those small beginnings. That’s the crash course of the Focus Course right there. This is the value. If you stick around for the after show at seanwes, this is what you get.Aaron: I’ll agree with Shawn and say this: pick one action you can do tomorrow morning that will get you closer to the most important goal. I know how many goals you have right now. I know, because I have that many goals, too. Pick one thing and write it down. Get a little calendar. Make a big X. Do that every day.You’ll get other stuff done, too, but you need to think about doing one important thing first thing in the morning right after you wake up. Get that thing done, and then pat yourself on the back, feel good about it, and move on to the next thing.You can follow Shawn Blanc on Twitter @ShawnBlanc, and be sure to check out his website at www.shawnblanc.net.More Links:Gear: https://kit.com/thepodcastdudePodcast: https://thepodcastdude.simplecast.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/thepodcastdudeYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/thepodcastdudeSuccessful Podcasting: http://successfulpodcasting.com', 'chan_desc': "Hi!

During the interview we discover what it was like leaving Istanbul for London in the late ’80s; how he started his career in clothing on the floor of his uncle’s factory as a presser; the problem of running his own business; and why he became disillusioned with the world of cheap fashion and decided to open his own restaurant instead.\xa0Incidentally that all happened before he started his small but perfectly formed company in Walthamstow that not only wants to make the best jeans in the world but is also attempting to persuade consumers re-think how and why they buy things.\xa0It's wonderful stuff that encompasses the importance of repair and how memory can be stored in the materials we wear.\xa0 | Once every series I dispense with the show’s material-based format and devote an episode to someone with an overview of the field. And I can think of few people with more knowledge about design and architecture than Deyan Sudjic. The former Blueprint and Domus editor is currently director of the Design Museum London, as well as being a prolific author, essayist and curator.Over the course of our chat we touch on an array of subjects including: becoming an Oz Kid in the ’70s and the obscenity trial that ensued; growing up with his Yugoslavian parents; why he was a useless architecture student; starting Blueprint magazine from his Docklands flat; taking over the Design Museum in controversial circumstances; the decision to move the museum; and how our arts institutions should be funded in the future.\xa0It is by turns eclectic, insightful and fascinating stuff from a man who really knows his design onions.\xa0 | The award-winning sculptor Kate MccGwire talks about her fascination with feathers.\xa0Not only that but during the interview we also unpick her profound interest in mythology, water and the human body, discovering how they have become threads through her sometimes dark but always extraordinary pieces.In a remarkably frank interview the artist explains how she only realised she was dyslexic in her late-thirties; what it was like growing up in Norfolk; her decision to drop out of design and become a fine artist; and why her pieces have nothing to do with taxidermy… | Designer and co-founder of Ting Ying, Peter Ting, talks about his life-long relationship with Blanc de Chine, as a new installation on the material opens at London’s V&A Museum.\xa0And it transpires he has quite a bit more to say too.\xa0We talk about what it was like to grow up in Hong Kong and move to an English public school at the age of 16; how he discovered clay in the first instance and why he decided to work in Stoke-on-Trent. Not only that but he explains the craft behind manufacturing and how you can ‘hear’ if a factory is working efficiently.\xa0Arguably most importantly, he discusses identity and an epiphany he had at a crossroads in Shanghai that led him to re-discover his Chinese heritage. Oh and did you know that his father used to be Bruce Lee’s dentist? Trust me, there’s loads to enjoy here.\xa0Support the show | This week Material Matters goes to Paris to chat to up-and-coming designer Marlene Huissoud about her relationship with Propolis\xa0 (or bee glue) – a substance made up of wax and resin that bees collect from vegetation and use to seal to the honey frames inside their hive.\xa0Working the material a little like glass, the Central Saint Martin’s graduate has created a series of cooly dark, vaguely threatening, vessels as well as a number of other objects.\xa0During our chat we discuss what it was like growing up with her beekeeper father in the Alps; why she decided to leave London for the French capital (without wishing to get into our current constitutional and political crisis here but her explanation does involve the B word); the reasons behind her decision to train as a nurse; creating pieces from her kitchen; and what she’s up to at this year’s London Design Festival.\xa0 | In this episode designer Tom Dixon talks about his background in welding and quite a lot else besides.\xa0There’s his appearance on Top of the Pops, for example. And the time when furniture he’d produced for shoe designer Patrick Cox fell apart at a dinner party. We hear what London used to be like in the ’80s and why he might have been the bass player for Pink Floyd.\xa0He also talks about his decision to join Habitat, setting up with his eponymous brand, and the importance of food to his practice… as well as answering the biggest question of all: what exactly is the scent of Tom Dixon?\xa0Support the show | In a special bonus episode of Material Matters with Grant Gibson, designer, author, activist and social media phenomenon, Adam Nathaniel Furman, takes the chair in our critics’ corner slot to discuss a panoply of issues. \xa0Topics include: the Notre Dame blaze and the importance of heritage, the need for queer aesthetics in architecture, the problem with unpaid internships.. and why he really loves Nando’s. To describe it as wide-ranging would not be doing it justice.\xa0Support the show | In the latest episode of Material Matters with Grant Gibson, Mourne Textiles’ Mario Sierra discusses how he grew up surrounded by hand-weaving in Northern Ireland, living through The Troubles, the legacy of his extraordinary grandmother Gerd Hay-Edie, and how his family firm has re-emerged with the help of companies like Margaret Howell and Pinch Design… Oh and we have a quick natter about Brexit as well but don’t let that put you off.\xa0 | In this episode of Material Matters with Grant Gibson, artist and sculptor Laura Ellen Bacon discusses her relationship with willow.\xa0She talks about growing up on a fruit farm in Derbyshire, her childhood obsession with building a two-storey tree house, her fear of failure, and why she has never woven a basket. We also discover how her work has inspired a new piece of orchestral music.\xa0 | In this episode of Material Matters with Grant Gibson, artist and designer Simone ten Hompel talks about her relationship with metal.\xa0She discusses her ‘alternative’ East London studio, getting her first tool box at the age of six, how her profound dyslexia allows her to look at the world in a different way, why teaching matters, and her fascination with spoons.\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Material Matters features in-depth interviews with a variety of designers, makers and artists about their relationship with a particular material or technique.

Fun times! And in our house, that means one thing; Spring has arrived! Well, that and the yellow tinge that everything has from the coating of abundant pollen. But Spring is a happy time, and I do love this season, even though my sinuses hate it. I start dreaming of days that are warm and sunny early in the year; like while I’m taking the Christmas tree down. Thankfully in the weird little part of the world where I live, the winter is short, and spring and summer are nice and long. I kinda have a ritual every spring of trying to make the inside of our home feel as fresh and new at the budding trees outside. Here is a rundown of things that can make your home feel like spring has sprung in your neck of the woods, even if winter has long overstayed its welcome.\xa0See more design ideas at http://www.confusedroom.com | This week’s design challenge comes from a family, in our neck of the woods, that is having a little trouble thinking outside the box. They had found themselves in a situation where they inherited a cabin that they want to rent out nightly for visitors to the area. The problem is that their cabin is literally exactly like every other cabin in their resort neighborhood. So, what they want to do is figure out a way to make their cabin stand out against the rest, to people searching online for vacation rentals. Only catch is that the outside CAN NOT be altered in any way due to community restrictions. This sounded like a great opportunity to push my design boundaries and have a little fun in the process.Because this is a vacation rental, and not a permanent residence, there is a little more room to play with the design. The risk of “getting tired” of a design is a little less when it is not a space that you are 1\\. Spending a lot of time in, or 2\\. Seeing on a daily basis. The cabin was built in the mid 2000’s and the bones are good. But the interior is dated and kitschy, and not in a good way. The design played on the “mountain lodge” feel, mixed in with a little bit of “southwest” and “cottage”. It’s a little confused, but that could be from attempts to update the décor over the years, and never quite getting it right. The owners would like us to focus on the main living / kitchen area, as that is where the most photos will be taken and where the first impression will be made. They want WOW factor.When I spoke to the owners, they were completely open to any possible “feels” (I say feels instead of themes. I hate themes) that I thought would work, and not feel wrong. They weren’t too big on the thought of “mountain lodge”, but I asked if they would just humor me, and let me present it in a modern way. I think they thought I was going to throw in a bunch of log furniture and call it a day. I immediately thought of what draws visitors to the area (outside of corny comedy and classic country music). The lakes, the mountains, and the hometown feel. I knew these were going to be the basis for each design I presented.So, what the cabin looks like right now isn’t too bad and would probably get a fair amount of interest if it was the only cabin of its kind, but as I stated above, it doesn’t stand out at all. The walls are a pale-yellow cream, and that plays upon the yellowed maple floors and the yellow pine tongue and groove vaulted ceiling. The cabinets are pine, and the trim is pine. Its basically a sea of yellow. The light fixture over the dining table is black iron with moose soldered on. Just to be clear, we do not have moose in southern Missouri. The corner fireplace has oversized river rock below the mantle and shiplap above the mantle to the ceiling. Its cute, but I think it could be improved as the mantle is an orange-yellow beam. The kitchen is a small galley style that has a wall at one end. It probably is five feet wide at most, with beige laminate counters and a 12x12 tile backsplash that probably was a rust color once, but now has a pinkish hue. Below are the key elements of the five designs that I presented.Just like your favorite HGTV shows, get Fixer-Upper and DIY ideas on how to reclaim a room or space and make it how you always wanted.

Submit your room picture through their facebook page or at http://www.confusedroom.com and they may give your space a free digital makeover on a future episode of Confused Room! | I thought I was being sooooo smart! Really, I did!! Finally, I had a house with a dedicated laundry room! And, being that the laundry room was next to the garage entrance, I thought “what a great place to sneak in a mudroom too!” Great idea, if your laundry room is 12 feet by 12 feet. Not if your laundry room is 6 feet by 8 feet. And on top of that, I built the “mudroom” wall the week we moved into the house. That was a mistake. I figured out after living in our house for about 6 months that not only do we never park in the garage, because the weather is mild 95% of the time (so we never enter the house from the garage) the 6 foot by 8 foot laundry room becomes a battlefield every morning with two little girls and myself trying to get in there, put on shoes, grab bags, purses, etc. and get out the FRONT door (on the other side of the house) every morning. A space that I initially was very excited to have, quickly became a dreaded hole where everybody’s junk gets thrown at the end of the day. And did I forget to mention that it is a 1999 special, complete with golden oak cabinetry and ugly linoleum. Ugh! And laundry sucks to begin with; who wants to go into the cramped, cluttered space to do laundry, let alone stand in there and blissfully fold clothes (like I imagine women do when they have the laundry rooms ala Pinterest). This MUST change. So, I am working on a plan to make this 6 foot by 8 foot laundry room become just that A LAUNDRY ROOM, and only that. Plus, there is no way to expand this space (believe me, I investigated that). Don’t get me wrong, this is actually a perfect size for a laundry room, if that is its only purpose. So, the “mudroom” will soon be relocated to a more logical place in our house (which will be in an upcoming episode). Now the hard part begins, deciding what I want MY laundry room to look like and feel like. And what features do I want it to have, that it currently lacks. Since this will be a gut job, I can make it anything that I want, and that almost makes it harder for me to decide. Sometimes too many possibilities are more difficult for me than having to work with a certain item, or parameter. So, I got busy, and sketched several different laundry rooms, and I feel that they are all dreamy. I have narrowed down the options to 5 completely different laundry room styles, and I thought it would be fun to highlight the different styles and do an episode on what makes each style feel the way it does. This is essentially a series of recipes to capture the elements of 5 different design styles. I found one that makes my heart happy and cannot wait to have a more efficient space. Maybe one of these styles will speak to you and inspire you to make the dreaded task of washing socks and panties a little more bearable in a space that speaks to you.Find out more at https://www.confusedroom.com/2018/05/30/5-laundry-room-design-layouts/ | When you think about changing things up in your home, people often overlook their bathroom(s) and opt for a more “visible” space to spruce up. Truth is, we spend time in there; a lot of time. With home owners and home buyers today looking to maximize every square foot of space in their home, the bathroom has come into the equation. Bathrooms are no longer being looked at as a completely private space, and a trend of incorporating more furnishings traditionally found in other areas of the home, is changing the purpose of the bathroom.Here is an overview of some ways that bathrooms are feeling less like a sterile space and are becoming a player in the area of where we want to spend our time.1\\. Technology. Everything has a “smart” feature these days. Whether it is a fridge that can compile a shopping list for you or cars that can parallel park themselves (which is great because I still can’t do that), technology is a bigger part of our lives than ever before. But one place where we are seeing a great shift is how to make a bathroom a smart bathroom. Products are now coming on the market to do just that. There are mirrors that have integrated lighting that can adjust based on what you are doing. So, if you just rolled out of bed, and are brushing your teeth, maybe a softer light versus the ultra-bright lighting that women use for applying makeup. Toilets are now coming out with a technology that makes them self-cleaning (thank God), and sterilizing. But the biggest change you are going to see is in the shower. Imagine while going to the loo, you can use your phone (because apparently 90% of us look at our phone on the toilet) to turn on your shower to a pre-programmed setting of your preferences. You enter the shower and on a shower TV is your favorite program, and a calming shade of light encompasses the shower in whatever hue you need for a personalized light therapy session. And when you are done, just grab a warmed towel from your integrated towel warmer. Not sure how to make my small shower have all these bells and whistles, but I can dream.2\\. His and hers everything. Ok, part of me thinks this is awesome, but then part of me says this isn’t really a great idea. And by everything, I mean everything! We are way past just a his and hers vanity (if you’re lucky) and we are talking about separate showers and separate water closets. I think it would be more feasible to just have separate bathrooms, but buyers are looking for a Master bedroom with separate facilities for both attached. It was mind blowing when I began to see model homes with a his and hers separate walk-in closets. But now, I think we are just getting silly. And we all know that ONE will keep their vanity, water closet and shower clean, and the other will not. Thus, leading to twice as many showers and toilets to clean. I like the idea of a single separated water closet, for obvious reasons that I don’t need to address, but really, two of everything?3\\. Bolder colors (especially shades of blue). Hooray!!! I love a clean white space as much as any designer out there, but I am really loving the trend of incorporating color back into our homes. I just flat out got sick of the beige, greige, gray everything trend. I did it (actually, overdid it) and now it can go to die with other home décor trends like avocado appliances. We need color, people!!! Especially if you are affected by colors emotionally; gray is not your friend! So, I was super excited to see that bolder jewel tones, especially blues are coming into play in bathrooms. And I’m not just talking about wall color either, although that is the cheapest and biggest bang for your buck. Cabinetry in shades of sky blue and navy are all over the place. Or if you are super bold, try tiling a floor to ceiling shower in a bold hue. Just make sure it’s a color you love, even when its not the latest trend, because you don’t want to get sick of it. And my biggest piece of advice is to make sure there is balanc... | Just because you have a house, doesn\'t mean it will sell.Just because you love your house, doesn\'t mean others will too. These are two thoughts that seem to be significant hurdles for many home sellers.It all comes down to "looking at something from another\'s\xa0perspective." In the case of selling a house, it\'s about seeing your home from the prospective buyer who isn\'t you, and may or may not like\xa0your taste in decor, color or design.You undoubtedly can\'t "be everything to everyone", but its good to at the very least pick a direction for your home design before putting it on the market and doing it well. In the 90\'s and early part of the 2000\'s, this meant to make everything vanilla and beige. Today that is not the case. Home buyers want to be "wowed".Home shoppers want to walk into an HGTV style home.If you don\'t have a massive budget to put into the property you\'re trying to move, don\'t worry. Staging and creating a presentable and appealing home doesn\'t have to be impossible.Here are some mistakes to avoid when staging your home for sale. Watch our\xa0video in full to learn about each one of these points and how to implement them into your home sale plan.Bad Photo\'sHire a professional photographer that understand how to use a wide-angle lens and can color correct as needed for the MLS listing pictures. If your real estate agent\'s idea of getting shots for the MLS listing involves 5 minutes walking around with a camera phone... Get a different real estate agent.Outdated Staging MaterialsStage correctly and with what people want TODAY. It doesn\'t matter what you "like" from 1998, you need to speak to the potential home buyer of today. Are you selling a "first-time home buyer", are you selling a "forever home" or are you selling a "vacation home"? Understand the demographics of who is most likely to be looking at your home (Age, income, interest, style) and stage to speak to those people.Kill the Personal\xa0StuffI\'m sure your proud of your degrees, vacations, awards, family gatherings and everything that says your name on it. But guess what... No one else is. No one will buy your home based on those vacation\xa0photos from \'03 that are lining the hallway to the master bedroom. Take down ALL personal effects and make the house "buyer friendly" to help other picture their lives being lived in your home.Smell That?\xa0You likely have no idea what your house smells like. It may not smell bad at all, but I\'m sure it has a "smell" to new people coming in. Be sure that smell is not a turn-off. Get an outside opinion on what the "smell is", and if needed - fix it or mask it. Fresh baked\xa0goods when people visit is a great temporary fix, but there is no amount of chocolate chips that will ever mask an uncontrolled pet or other problem. Those need a permanent fix, including new carpet if need be.Too much stuffWe all love our stuff. But if there\'s one thing buyers don\'t want to explore is a cluttered house. Most, also don\'t want a completely blank slate either. Find a balance between to two that fit the tastes of today\'s home buyer. | Tony & Jenny take a hallway guest bathroom and give it personality and charm.

Why then has creativity been given a back seat in our culture? No longer.Creativity is a force inside every person that, when unleashed, transforms our lives and delivers vitality to everything we do. Establishing a creative practice is therefore our most valuable and urgent task – as important to our well-being as exercise or nutrition.The good news? Renowned artist, author, and CreativeLive founder, Chase Jarvis, reminds us that creativity isn’t a skill—it’s a habit available to everyone: beginners and lifelong creators, entrepreneurs to executives, astronauts to zookeepers, and everyone in between. Through small, daily actions we can supercharge our innate creativity and rediscover our personal power in life.Whether your ambition is a creative career, completing a creative project, or simply cultivating a creative mindset, Creative Calling will unlock your potential via Jarvis’s memorable “IDEA” system:Imagine your big dream, whatever you want to create—or become—in this world.Design a daily practice that supports that dream—and a life of expression and transformation.Execute on your ambitious plans and make your vision real.Amplify your impact through a supportive community you’ll learn to grow and nurture.About ChaseChase Jarvis is an award-winning artist, entrepreneur, and one of the most influential photographers of the past decade.He has created campaigns for Apple, Nike, Red Bull and others, was a contributor to the Pulitzer-winning New York Times story Snowfall, and earned an Emmy nomination for his documentary Portrait of a City.

A self confessed ‘hobbyist’ Ian has developed a fast growing YouTube Channel where he covers all aspects of Drone use ranging from tips and best practice for successful flights and capturing stunning video and still images, do’s and don’t’s, travelling with drones, qualifications and much more.Ian carries with him a wealth of knowledge gained through experience and as a CAA qualified (PfCO) Drone Pilot, so if you have a drone, are thinking of getting a drone or are simply curious, you’ll get lots from what he shares in this episode.

Jack served with the Royal Corps of Signals for the entire duration of the War and was captured and held as a POW for 4 years being made to carry out forced labour.

This is a story of making the very best of a bad situation and a story of risk versus reward. Check out the 3945portraits.com website where Glyn has shared the video version of this interview too, along with the portraits taken of Jack. | This week\'s interview is with celebrity portrait and lifestyle photographer, Drew Gurian.

What We Talked About  Pete first went to a technical college for welding, then he got a job as an apprentice was with an industrial blacksmith at the Ipswitch railyards in Queensland, Australia. There he forged a lot of industrial tools for mines, alloy steel forging. Pete decided to go to art school and received his Bachelor of Fine art. He then received a scholarship for his master’s in fine art. Pete talks about his apprentice journey through the United States, which included working with Albert Paley, Mountain Forge and included a research residency at the Metal Museum. We talk about his design process which he includes 3 basic things: additive process, subtractive process and material displacement. When Pete works with clients for commissioned pieces, one of the things he asks for is 3 words from the client that encapsulates what they envision. About 80% of the time Pete sandblasts his sculptures first and then adds a chemical called Black Fast. Also follows up with beeswax. One of Pete’s goals this year is to convert his gas forge into a veggie oil burning forge.

In exchange for Anna being able to use the school’s resources to make her tools during her residency, she helps out around the school, cleaning and assisting in other classes. The school’s blacksmith shop has 12 student coal forging stations, an instructor coal forge, each with an anvil and post vise, a room full of tongs and hammers, 2 power hammers and gas forges. In years past Anna has worked at the school as a studio technician and was able to assist some top-rated instructors that have taught there such as Tom Latane and Mark Aspery. She has a BFA from Pratt Institute, she focused on jewelry and also became interested in weaponry. This interest led her to take a bladesmithing class at the Peter’s Valley School of Craft, this opened up the world of blacksmithing to her. Anna ended up taking an assistant position in the blacksmith shop at Peters Valley for a summer and this helped her grow her skills at the forge. Another stepping stone for Anna was her winter apprenticeship with Atlas Forge where they focused on production blacksmithing.  \xa0 Guest Links  Website - https://www.annarkoplik.com/ Instagram is @arkoplik  | This is the monthly Blacksmith Buzz Bulletin.\xa0 Where you get the low-down about upcoming classes and events that are happening in the following month, I’ll be telling you about classes and events happening in October 2018.\xa0 If you have an event or class you would like to submit, send an email to info@blacksmither.com and I will send you the details I need for the press release.

We fell in love with her island vibe on Instagram and had to have her on the show. Annie creates amazing skin care and home products from her home. She tells us about her journey as a biz owner, how shows and wholesale have helped her grow her business and why connecting with others is so important. We know you will love this conversation as much as we did! \xa0 About Annya: Born and raised on the beautiful island of Jamaica, Annya (Annie) is no stranger to the nourishing, healing power of oils and herbs. She has always been a creative soul, with an eye for all things bright \'n\' bold (can you tell by her packaging?). She also loves plants and a huge glass of wine (Merlot please!).  Annie’s first daughter Tiffany was born with Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, and Annie turned to natural remedies to help Tiffany’s skin, as prescribed medication did not work. After trying a variety of natural butters, essential oils, and other natural oils, we finally found the remedy to her daughter’s skin issues. Essential oils and herbs are some of the most ancient and powerful remedies available, so Annie started to think about how they could be utilized in skin and hair care. Annie’s passion and knowledge grew, and in 2014 she decided to channel them into developing her unique brand. And NaturalAnnie Essentials burst into life! Today, NaturalAnnie Essentials is your island-inspired, one-stop shop for uniquely scented, handmade soy candles and bath & body products.
