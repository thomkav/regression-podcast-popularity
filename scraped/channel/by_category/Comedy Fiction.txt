Camera. Action! I believe it was this critic’s favorite, other, critic, Anton Id, who said that “In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.” Indeed, a theatre critic’s work is easy when presented with a piece that is, at once, deeply daring, deeply discerning, and deeply debatable… “Spiderman: Turn Out the Dark” comes to mind, as does 2002’s “Dance of the Vampires” (featuring this critic’s favorite popular song, “Total Eclipse of the Heart”), and Frankie Muniz’s one-man take on “Shrek: The Musical.” Catfishes: The Rock Opera is the next in this long, storied line of theatrical titans, playing now at Albacore Quay’s own Grand Gargoyle. Lloyd Webb-Andrews’ vision will stare deeply into your soul, begging the immortal question: “Why do I feel this way?” This critic says: this is good. This. Is art. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for this critic’s favorites: “I am More than the Sum of my Scales”, an impassioned, 30-minute solo, “Are We Catfishes, or Catfish?”, a thoughtful meditation on grammar, and a delightful — and lengthy — water & crotales solo in the third act. Thank you, as always, for reading Blog’s Office, authored by yours truly, Cardamom Rigby. EDIT: “Catfishes: THE Rock Opera” has closed. Let us rage, rage against the passing of the light. \xa0 This week on\xa0The Unexplored Places, the long-awaited finale of\xa0a group of obnoxious musical theatre adults playing a disastrous group of obnoxious musical theatre adults in this three-part Fiasco.

The show's orchestra features local experimental percussionist St. John Holiday, known for his work with crotales in water, as well as insta-famous drummer The Sticc, and lighting design by long-time Gargoyle technician and first-time designer, Bishop St. John.\xa0 Still, I can't help but wonder if The Gargoyle would have been better served by selecting a less ambitious, or more relatable show for their first ever rock opera.\xa0Les Mis, for example, which is a reliable crowd-pleaser, would perhaps be easier for audiences to fully immerse themselves in, as the identifiable human characters might make it easier for audiences to relate to the story being told. While judgement should likely be withheld until the show finally opens, one inside source who asked to remain anonymous let\xa0this reporter in on a secret: infighting between the orchestra and technical crew, as well as some financial issues, have led the show down a precarious path, with some involved doubting whether the show will even go up at all!\xa0 All in all, the show is slated to be the experience of a lifetime, whether for better or for worse. You heard it here, folks, from\xa0The Daily Albacore Quay Gazette: be sure to get a ticket so you don't miss your chance. It'll be a story worth telling either way.\xa0  Catfishes!: The Rock Opera opens for previews on September 17th, with opening night on the 24th.

The short version is that we have no idea when we\'ll be able to resume recording. It\'s a bummer situation all around.\xa0This all comes at a really challenging time for two other reasons:\xa01) Ghostbusters: Resurrection just went on an unscheduled hiatus for completely unrelated circumstances.\xa0And 2) a large shift in our Patreon funding has put us in a position where if D&D were still on schedule, we might not be able to afford for it to come out monthly anymore.\xa0Again, details in this accompanying audio bulletin.

Our goal as a group of diversely marginalised people is to fund, promote and create content around games written and designed by marginalised creators.Tabletop Roleplaying Games, or TTRPG are a type of game designed specifically for people to get together and tell stories with. These stories can range from the magical worlds of tolkein-esque fantasy to the grittiest noir thriller. It\'s a hugely diverse genre that is dominated in the popular narrative, by a tiny handful of overwhelmingly big names. Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and Shadowrun are the ones you\'ve probably heard of.These games, however good they may be, are designed to tell very specific kinds of stories. They can certainly be adapted to tell others, but there are hundreds of games out there that are specifically designed to tell different stories! Voices at play aims to use them to do so.The "Voices at play" project goes beyond simply focusing on games though; we want to focus on the people behind them. As with a lot of classically "nerdy", "niche" hobbies; the face of TTRPG is largely lead by straight white men. In a genre so heavily dominated by the big names at play, we want to work to create space at the table for everyone.To do that, Voices at play focuses on games by marginalised creators and our project is run entirely by marginalised people. We want to demonstrate the value in diverse, inclusive gameplay and introduce you to as many new games and creators as we can along the way.Our podcast and ongoing efforts are funded entirely by our generous supporters. You can learn more about our project, through our website https://ttrpg-voices.com or our patreon page https://patreon.com/VoicesAt where you can pledge, for as little as $1 a month, and join our ever growing community, helping us to raise our voices.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/12/24/7a/12247a17-1744-23bd-8115-ee462bff44d9/mza_5366653013045393245.jpeg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-01'}}

Lo único que le calma son las rayas de coca que le pinta Don Cande. El narco está tranquilo, al fin y al cabo su día a día consiste en rendir cuentas a los demás. Ya comienza a sospechar de Lino, siempre estaba en otro sitio en los momentos más inoportunos... demasiadas casualidades.Llegan a casa de El Mochuelo, el plan es el siguiente: Uribe entrará sólo en la casa de El Mochuelo mientras Sandra, don Cande y Lino le esperan en el coche. Tendrá que ser firme, convincente y no ceder nada ante los matones que le esperan. Entregará el dinero y el trato quedará cerrado. Sandra se quedará con Uribe.Pero, ¿conseguirá el licenciado salir ileso de esta vida peligrosa? | El episodio empieza calentito... Sandra en la cama con el profesor Uribe.El desayuno norteño ya está listo en casa de don Candelario Quintana. Don Cande le recomienda a Uribe que lo mejor que puede hacer es ir a hablar con el Mochuelo, mirarle a los ojos y explicarle que Sandra se queda con él, \xa0así, "a lo macho". No le asegura que pueda salir vivo de esa casa, pero deben hacerlo, es la única solución: debe pedirle disculpas por la ofensa. Y para calmarle, le pondrá encima de la mesa un buen fajo de dólares que el mismo Cande le presta a Uribe como muestra de su agradecimiento por haberle salvado la vida.En ese momento aparece Lino Esparza... No había aparecido en toda la noche y casualmente llegó la gente del Mochuelo a la Taquería disparando contra Sandra y Uribe. ¿Qué coincidencia, no?Don Cande se ofrece a acompañar a Uribe hasta la puerta de la casa de Mochuelo y ya, una vez dentro... el profesor tendrá que ingeniárselas él solito. | Élmer Ortega acoge en su casa a Sandra y al profesor Uribe pero él conoce bien al Mochuelo y sabe que no puede protegerles sin que su familia corra peligro. Élmer les recomienda que vayan a casa de don Candelario, él será el único que puede ayudarles.Estaban a punto de salir de casa de Élmer cuando Uribe recibe una llamada de teléfono... es Lino, el sicario de confianza de don Cande. Uribe lo ve como la única salida y le cuenta que Sandra y él necesitan ayuda. "No te fíes de ese pinche matón", le susurra Sandra. Los tres quedan frente a la Taquería Avilés un pequeño restaurante que, aún estando cerrado, está en una localización perfecta para ver quién llega desde cualquier punto.¿Habrá sido buena idea avisar con Lino? ¿Te fiarías verdaderamente de alguien de Ciudad Jiménez?\xa0 | Sandra acude por la noche a la habitación del profesor Uribe y le pide que la lleve con él a España, que si se queda la van a matar, que la ayude. Está asustada pero a la vez decidida. La joven bailarina sigue metida dentro de la vida peligrosa, la coca, los problemas en el Viva Zapata. Sandra le dice al gerente del téibol que deja todo para irse con el profesor Uribe. Y el gerente le amenaza con contárselo al Mochuelo, un hombre de negocios muy pero que muy peligroso.Uribe está entre la espada y la pared. Sabe que si el Mochuelo se entera no sólo irá a por Sandra sino que también podría ir a por él. Pero no tiene salida, Uribe decide llamar a su amigo Élmer Ortega y le pide que le acoja en su casa. Pero el trayecto casa de Élmer se complica más de lo esperado... | Lino Esparza no puede soportar que Sandra se haya encariñado del Profesor Uribe y ha enviado a sus sicarios a que se "encarguen" \xa0de ellos. En Ciudad Jiménez cualquier conflicto se resuelve pistola en la mano. Pero los negocios de Esparza siguen en la cuerda floja, anteriormente alguien desde un helicóptero les comenzó a tirotear y ahora Lino quiere asegurarse de que aquello no vuelve a ocurrir. Por eso, invita a sus enemigos a una bonita jaula de tigres para que solucionen el problema entre ellos.El profesor Uribe sigue de fiesta en el téibol Viva Zapata con Don Candelario Quintana y sus secueaces. Después del tórrido encuentro con la bella Sandra, Uribe está aturdido, borracho... acude al baño cuando escucha el click de una pistola... Todo volverá a dar un giro inesperado... \xa0 | Lino Esparza visita la zona que le convertirá en el nuevo capo de la droga. Controlará la frontera hasta Cinco Ríos, se quedará con las minas, la coca... La zona es estrecha y los caballos casi no caben, de repente, suena el ruido ensordecedor de un helicóptero. Alguien les empieza a disparar desde las alturas.Nuestro protagonista, el profesor Uribe anda... ocupado en otros asuntos. Se encuentra a solas en el téibol Viva Zapata con la bella Sandra. Bailes, toqueteos, "chichotas". Sandra se sincera con el profesor, ella quiere ser actriz pero entrar en a trabajar en el Viva Zapata le sumergió de lleno en la vida peligrosa. Sandra no puede vivir sin su perico y le debe dinero al dueño del téibol, el \'Mochuelo\'. Hasta que no le pague lo que le debe, Sandra no puede irse de allí. Y aún así... no será tarea fácil. Los bailes y los juegos de seducción se ven interrumpidos por el sonido de una pistola cargándose... | Lino Esparza sigue haciendo negocios con la coca a espaldas de su jefe, don Candelario Quintana. Quiere convertirse en el nuevo gran narco de Ciudad Jiménez y jubilar a Quintana.El profesor Uribe ha sido invitado al téibol Viva Zapata. Don Candelario quiere agradecerle que haya ayudado a su hijo a aprobar el examen de filosofía. Las copas de tequila, las rayas de coca y las mujeres semidesnuda van fluyendo por las mesas del Viva Zapata. Uribe, por no ofender a don Candelario y a su séquito, acepta todo lo que le ofrecen.\xa0"Mejor 5 años como un rey que 50 como jornalero", éste es el leit motiv del narco. No dudará en ser inmoral, violento e, incluso, asesino para poder mantener su imperio del narcotráfico.\xa0 | "A Candelario Quintana le queda poco" dice Lino Esparza. Y es que parece que el secuaz se ha cansado de estar bajo la sombra del narco y tiene intención de quitárselo del medio para convertirse en el nuevo dueño y señor de Ciudad Jiménez.Don Candelario Quintana asegura que Lino es "perro ladrador, poco mordedor", pero el profesor Uribe no se fía ni un pelo de él. Uribe se encuentra esperando en la mansión de los Quintana mientras esperan conocer la nota del examen de filosofía de Beto, el hijo del narco. La mujer de don Candelario, Silvina, y el profesor Uribe pasan la mañana hablando de las reglas no escritas de Ciudad Jiménez: "Aquí en México, a la gente no la matan, solita se muere". Uribe no puede creer lo que escucha. Aquel lugar, aquella casa, va aumentando en peligrosidad. La mañana se hace larga y el profesor cuenta los minutos para salir de ahí.Al mediodía por fin reciben la nota. Beto ha aprobado. Parece que todo por fin ha terminado pero don Candelario es un hombre tan vengativo como agradecido. Y el agradecimiento de don Candelario, nadie lo rechaza. Uribe se ve obligado a acudir esa misma noche al \'Viva Zapata\', un téibol mexicano en el que conocerá al motivo de todos sus problemas: Sandra. | En el mundo del narcotráfico no existe nada limpio, puro y sincero. Las frases tienen doble sentido, los amigos son enemigos y la inocencia siempre está manchada. El fiel y siempre dispuesto <strong>Lino Esparza</strong> puede convertirse en uno de los mayores rivales de don<strong> Candelario Quintana</strong> si éste no le vigila de cerca. En Ciudad Jiménez tampoco el Gobierno es honesto, allí todos tienen algo que ocultar y Esparza será el que se ancle a estos secretos para chantajear, amenazar y asesinar a cualquier político que sea amigo de don Candelario.En la superficie todo es diferente, las cloacas del narcotráfico desaparecen para que la vida de don Candelario Quintana luzca en todo su esplendor: una increíble mansión; <strong>Silvina</strong>, su preciosa mujer y <strong>Beto</strong>, su hijo adolescente que podría ser también perfecto si no suspendiera tanto en el colegio. Don Candelario no está dispuesto a permitir que algo estropee su mundo ideal. Después de conseguir que el profesor de Beto le dijera el temario que entrará en el examen de filosofía, el narco ha contactado con el profesor Uribe para que le dé clases particulares sobre <strong>Heráclito</strong>.Uribe está aterrado, sabe que si el niño suspende las consecuencias serán mucho más graves que un simple capón en la nuca. Si Don Candelario quiere que Beto apruebe el examen, aprobará y lo hará por encima de cualquier cadáver. Literalmente. "A Candelario nadie le rechaza una copa y menos en su casa", dice el narco. El profesor Uribe no tiene más remedio que tragar. Sean chupitos de tequila o peticiones de ayuda. | En Ciudad Jiménez a los que guardan silencio se les castiga. Y a los chivatos, también. En Ciudad Jiménez los oídos de don Candelario Quintana, un poderoso y respetado narcotraficante, están en todas partes.Jaime Uribe, un tímido profesor de Filosofía español, llega a la ciudad invitado por su amigo y catedrático de Literatura, el profesor mexicano Elmer Ortega, para dar una conferencia en su universidad. Lo que Uribe no se imagina es que pronto se topará con unas imponentes botas de piel de serpiente, tan características de los norteños. Son las botas de Lino Esparza.\xa0Lino Esparza, mano derecha de don Candelario Quintana, tiene una propuesta importante que hacerle. El profesor Uribe no tiene más remedio que acompañarle y acudir a un table, una sala de fiestas, donde le espera el capo mexicano. Éste no acepta un "no" por respuesta: en Ciudad Jiménez dicen que cuando don Candelario Quintana estornuda, al resto de la raza le da cáncer.Quintana le pide un favor: necesita que ayude a su hijo adolescente a aprobar el examen de filosofía. El profesor Uribe no tiene más remedio que aceptar. Lo que comienza siendo un inocente gesto de ayuda de profesor a alumno se convierte en toda una peligrosa aventura. Bienvenido a Ciudad Jiménez, profesor Uribe.\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'El profesor Uribe llega a México para dar una conferencia sobre filosofía en la universidad.

When the Richards family is called back to Earth to be the Fantastic Four again, they left behind the Future Foundation — a think tank of the most brilliant young minds in the universe — with one mission: to find the pieces of and rebuild their friend Molecule Man. But that’s proved harder than imagined as this crew of young geniuses, Atlanteans, Mutants, Moloids and androids have run into every problem in the Multiverse.

Instead, we have some really good character beats and moments, and a scene where Jack grabs Dagger.\xa0But mostly, this is about families and dads. Which is good, because we got two big daddies bringing you this fantastic Power Pack action.\xa0And there is also this moment where Alex seems to have forgotten talking to Katie back in issue number 13....During the thank you portion of our show, we mentioned Stephen Gray and the really cool Friday 3D printed model he made.

There is just a lot of brimming going on around here...and we do not like it... OK, we like Katie brimming with power, but not Jakal.We actually like a lot n this book. This is a fantastic issue with a mess of stuff going on. The writer and artists are swinging for the Snark equivalent of the fences, and they are connecting.

Rick was not feeling well, so we can just blame it on him.And it is a shame too, because this is a pretty good issue. Sure, it starts off in a dark cave with Katie drowning in a pool of water, and the other Power kids are still captured, and Franklin runs away from home, and Kofi is shot at……Hang on…..this sounds horrible! \xa0Why would anyone do this to a bunch of kids! I thought this was supposed to be a happy, silly, kids book!?!? \xa0What is going on with all of this capturing, torturing, maiming, and war!Don’t worry folks, low energy Rick or not, this duo of daddies will dust themselves off and deliver you, our listeners, a delightful detailed description of these deeds.

Released weekly every Sunday at 10:30AM BST.Hosted and Game Mastered by Ray Stevens,\xa0accompanied by his players, Tom (Erbak), Liz (Tobe), Vinny (Mhurren) and Nina (Myx), with occasional guest appearances, he invites you into a world both familiar and strange, these adventures take place in a home-brew alternate version of the Forgotten Realms.The core cast of Tails from The Dark Dragons Inn\u200b features a diverse group of players who've come together from across the country to tell the shared tale of “The Scales of Justice”, a band of heroes (though some would call them mercenaries).Our story is told through improv and tabletop role-play, however, for the purposes of the show, much of the mechanical aspects of this are removed, cutting the fuss and leaving the story and character interactions behind.What starts as a simple 'muscle for hire' job, brings the party together to aid a city under siege and the civilians within. A cult, known only as the Cult of the Dragon, seek to unleash Chaos in the world and as our heroes learn of their plans, the race is on to put a stop to their ambition. In classic high-fantasy fashion, the overarching problem of the plot is seemingly almost insurmountable in scale and by extension, each character is dealing with their own personal goals and issues which we develop throughout the show.You can find out more about the characters, the world and what's going on through our website https://tailsfromthedarkdragonsinn.co.uk.

You are treated to the prisoner lifestyle right away, and are brought to the cafeteria with the other "Talents" to enjoy lunch. As you witness the prison guards gang up on an older prisoner, you decided to distract the guards by picking a fake food fight with David, who flies into a rage upon contact! You are both brought back to your cell by Sheriff Maddock, but not before speaking to Officer Vendari who offers a cryptic message about one Trilobaine\'s army. | The adventure continues! You\'ve learned about the missing patient, Sasha Ickert and have decided, with some push from Professor Kelleher, that you should go assist Sheriff Maddock with his search.

As you are escorted by Officer Vendari to the prison block you\'ll be working most closely with, something striking comes up in conversation regarding Kelleher Labs\' interaction with the Circo Talent- more pointedly- why prisoners are being subject to private execution within the walls of the lab? | The adventure continues! Your first full day in town and things are going... strangely. After turning down a big promotion at your brand new job you are informed that fugitive Sasha Ickert has vandalized your home! Upon investigation with Sheriff Maddock, you see that Sasha not only burglarized your new apartment, but took the time to write you a rather... personal message. With seemingly no where to turn to Sheriff Maddock has escorted you back to labs to put you into the care of the stoic and professional Jeanine Kade. | The adventure continues!
