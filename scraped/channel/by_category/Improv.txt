You guys are truly the backbone of what we do, and I can\'t wait to celebrate with all fo you on Wall Street in a few weeks for our ten year anniversary. It\'s not about us - it\'s about you! And Tom and I are doing everything that we can to make sure that we shower all of you with gifts and make this the most "listener-centric" live show that we have EVER done! I\'m stoked. On behalf of all of us here at T&D Media, we love you and we\'ll see you on Monday for more and more shows! d', 'chan_desc': 'Tom and Dan were once sitting in a hotel room in Daytona Beach, Florida where the air-condition didn\'t work, they were out of beer, and the cable only had 2 channels that came in static free. One of their friends suggested that they leave and attempt to find something better to do to which Dan replied "Why would we want to ruin a mediocre time?"If you were to ask "Tom and Dan" what the meaning of life is, they might tell you that there is none. Born from a feeling that nothing in life truly matters and that for the most part we\'re all surrounded by scumbags, "Tom and Dan" figured out that there\'s only one true constant in life; laughter. How did they come to that conclusion? It\'s all they have. You see, just like the mass majority of us, "T & D" have day jobs and it was at said day job where they cued in on the fact that some of the greatest laughs came at the end of the day. There\'s just something about the relaxed feeling of knowing that you have very little time left at work to put in. Maybe it\'s the "punch drunkenness" of still being at work; no one is quite sure. There they sat in their office, the door shut to their co-workers and management, only making each other laugh to the point of tears. Finally they realized that it might not be such a bad idea to roll tape on these conversations. Why not? They would be having them anyway, taped or not, and it was fun. Both of them come from rather lengthy broadcasting careers so setting up a home studio wasn\'t so hard to do. And with the addition of Ross, the consummate straight man and "News Dad", things got even more "mediocre." Broadcasting since 2009 has garnered a rather extensive following for "T & D" with loyal "scumbags" (as their listeners are affectionately known) checking in from all across the world. Hundreds of shows under their belts and winners of the Orlando Weekly\'s "Best of Orlando 2011" for "Best Kept Secret" reassures them both that yes…no one is listening! (Best Kept Secret?

We examine unusual weddings around the world, talk over the matrimonial ceremonies of the insanely rich, and swap stories about our own experiences at getting-hitched get-togethers.

Yes, the one subject that Gordo has been banned from talking about within our friend group is finally broached, and despite Gordo\'s best efforts to make the discussion as uninformative and unhelpful as possible, our guest\'s knowledge and expertise surrounding the little flying machines makes this one of the most legitimately educational episodes of the podcast so far. Gross, right? We also discuss the cuteness factor of Ziploc bags, our idea for a drone racing bar, and the permitted ceiling heights of bar mitzvah venues as dictated by the Torah.Articles:Listverse- 10 Crazy Things Drones Are Being Used For Right NowDroneGuru- 7 Most Exciting Drone Business OpportunitiesThe Telegraph- Pointing the way: how medical drones are saving lives in Africa | Guest: Elena (elenapanyard.com)On this episode of the No Zone Layer, we realize that we may or may not already be running low on words that rhyme with zone, and therefore come up with a hastily cobbled-together topic that we can pass off as an episode. Yes, it’s the No Postpone Zone, all about the dreaded—and, for many including ourselves, all too familiar—experience of procrastination.

Within these borders there have been a series of strange events. Disappearances of people, boats, and planes have happened in the triangle without explanation or a trace. | The Nazca Lines are a group of very large geoglyphs formed by depressions or shallow incisions made in the soil of the Nazca Desert in southern Peru. They were created between 500 BC and 500 AD. | On the night of February 24, 1978, a group of five young men from Yuba City, California, all with mild mental or psychiatric issues, attended a college basketball game played at California State University, Chico. Afterwards, they stopped at a local market for snacks and drinks. Four of them were later found dead; the fifth one, Gary Mathias, has never been seen again. | Five mummified humanoid bodies were found in a tomb in Peru. The bodies appear extraterrestrial or even reptilian. The bodies do not display the same characteristics as humans in that they are around 27 inches tall, odd rib structure, three-fingered-five-knuckled hands, with large heads and small mouths. They date back 6,500 years and no one is sure who they are or how they came to be. | Man of the Hole is a nickname used by officials and the media to describe a man who is indigenous to Brazil and lives alone in the Amazon rainforest. He is believed to be the last surviving member of his tribe. It is unknown what language he speaks or what his tribe was called. | There are an arrangement of standing stones in Scotland that were erected in the late Neolithic era, and were a focus for ritual activity during the Bronze Age. The stones weigh several tons, their purpose and who built them remain a mystery, though it has been said that they could be anything from a marker for aliens to giants that were turned to stone. | In the 4th part of a 5 part series we examine the deals made with the devil by artists. Christoph Haizmann commonly depicted his dealings with the devil through his art. He even underwent exorcisms in order to win back the contracts that he signed with the devil. Guiseppe Tartini made a deal with the devil in order to compose one of the most beautiful violin sonatas called the "Devil\'s Trill".\xa0Niccolò Paganini was said to have been aided by the devil in order to be the most accomplished violinists to ever play. Philippe Musard was far from conventionally attractive, but despite his looks, became the first celebrity composer, his music would take audiences and cause them to lose control of themselves as if the devil was in the room. | There is a strange hum that can be found in certain areas of the globe and can only be heard by a certain number of people but in all of the cases, the explanation is a mystery. Holly focuses on the Windsor Hum, in Ontario Canada, and the Taos Hum in New Mexico. | Poland has a forest with a strange anomaly in which 400 of its trees grow in a strange manner, where they hook up at a 90 degree angle at its base. No one is certain how or why the trees took on such a strange shape, it is a mystery even to the locals. | Henry McCabe was a Liberian emigrant working for the Minnesota Department of Revenue when, after a night of drinking, he would disappear only to be found dead a couple months later in a lake several miles away from his home.

Anthony Thomas, anything but prolific. On his podcast, “S. Anthony Says”, S. talks about life… all of it, every week for the last 6 years (he will be celebrating 6 years of podcast gold on October 21st), and his no-holds-barred approach to the subjects he picks from his daily life is refreshing, fun, and often more poignant than you would expect. This episode was a lot of fun, because if there is one thing S. can do, it is talk and keep things interesting!  S. Anthony Thomas started out as a standup at an early age and caught fire immediately. Before the flood of other comedians that decided to go down the podcast path, S. started in the medium early and created a really fantastic format that is all his own. S. Anthony’s show “S. Anthony Says” is one part Moth, one part Andy Rooney and 100% S. Anthony. It is one of my favorite shows on the internet, and has been for years.Make sure to follow S. on Twitter, where he is really active! @santhonythomas @santhonysaysSketch: “THOSE Two Dads”Sketch Comedy Podcast show is an independent and completely improvised sketch podcast that is based on conversations with interesting people like YOU!

My intent with this show was to talk to someone who was an expert in tabletop gaming, but found a bank robber, author, filmmaker and a whole lot more!Steve Wollett started off as an idiot (his words, not mine) and progressed into an honest-to-god bank robber in his early years. No joke. This guy made hundreds of thousands of dollars walking into banks and spending about 2 minutes, then walking out with a sack full of cash! Eventually, Steve was caught, and ended up spending some time in prison where started a gaming party of 30 inmates. This is when things took a turn for Steve, and between gaming with his fellow prisoners and meeting a mentor that helped him see the error of his ways, he turned to gaming as a way to fill his time and his interest. Out of prison, Steve went to school, got a legitimate job, and continued to game. Eventually, he started working in the movie industry and currently sits on judging panels for a number of festivals. If you are interested in gaming and Steve’s filmmaking, you can go to Amazon Prime and look up “A Word from a Gamer”, his award-winning film about gamers spoken by gamers; it is a really well put-together and interesting film.These days, Steve spends time at his health food store and writing novels, which started out as a dare but has progressed into 10 different books! His latest, “The Gorgon’s Lament” is another thing I did not expect from Steve. (this is a REALLY interesting guy!)

Alisha had decided she did not want to do the show anymore, which was totally understandable. I, however, didn’t have the same feeling, so I wanted to keep it going. I needed to figure out how to do it, and I decided I was going to get a ringer for the show, and I did.Josh McCullough is a close friend, a fellow bandmate and is a fellow podcaster. Whenever we get together, we try to entertain each other with what we are talking about which was perfect for this episode.Currently, Josh is working WITH Alisha on the very popular and successful true crime podcast “Murder in the Rain” where Josh is the producer and makes everything sound so good!This is genuinely one of my favorite episodes of all time. It’s really just Josh and I chatting and then making one of the most epic sketches this show has ever produced.This week\'s sketch: "It\'s All in the Arm" about what happens when Pokemon Go gets out of hand. Special Guest: Josh McCullough | Book Editor and Co-Host of the "Shotgun and Scotch" Podcast. | Did I get your attention with that description? Good. Although that was my introduction to her, Amanda Richards is much more… SO MUCH MORE! Amanda is a 6-time Grammy Nominated member of Outlaw Country Music Royalty (according to her) and has been recording and releasing albums since 2004. Her songs are a combination of heartfelt country and lyrical whimsy… how many country artists would release an entire album of zombie-inspired tracks? Amanda did on 2011’s “Play Dead” (h). She also wrote the musical "Wiskey Dixie & the Big Wet Country" which is becoming a movie!Amanda is hard at work making her musical “Whiskey Dixie & the Big Wet Country” into a movie (check out this video for a taste: https://youtu.be/zcxAuX9IK7k). With songs like “Save a Cow, Eat a Cowgirl” you can bet that it lives up to her description of a “raunchy outlaw-country musical about a sexually frustrated cowgirl who finds herself on a tragicomic ride from Hell and will do whatever it takes to get off.” It is seriously the best thing I have seen on stage in a very long time and belongs on Broadway. It is really raunchy (it starts with the protagonist, Wiskey (played by Amanda) getting pulled over for masturbating while driving… and the show does not slow down from there. I hope everyone gets a chance to see this and hear the music, it is simply fantastic. So fantastic, in fact, that it has been optioned for a movie and she is currently in production on it as you are listening to it! You can totally support her on her IndieGoGo (as I have) and get some nifty swag with the support!We recorded 2 sketches.

This is a re-release of the fabulous first episode of the “New” Sketch Comedy Podcast Show. You’ll notice that the format wasn’t quite there yet, we didn’t know how to start the show or even how to have someone on the show with us. Despite being awful hosts, Dr. Kiki was great and we came up with not one, but two really good sketches!Dr. Kiki Sanford is an honest-to-goodness scientist and deserves being called “Doctor”. Every week, on her podcast “This Week in Science”, she talks about the goings-on in science news and gives perspectives on these stories for us, the common folk. As of this recording (in Summer 2016) she had also made appearances on “Chelsea” (Chelsea Handler’s show on Netflix) as well as other shows like “Food Science”. Dr. Kiki is also an award-winning podcaster and it was a fluke that she was willing to come and do this show.Make sure to check out Dr. Kiki’s really great content.

So, he started questioning the methods that people used to study and understand the Bible and spends his time sharing a message of love and selflessness as opposed to dogma. This is a conversation that does an incredible job of putting a lot of religions on notice and explaining God’s love in a way that is both welcoming and easily comprehensible. Billy is an author of two books, he is a singer-songwriter, and has also been very active in sharing his message of love and acceptance. We talk about the difference between selfish and selfless love, and which one most Christians tend to lean towards and why that is not very Christ-like. I really enjoyed this conversation with Billy and will likely invite him back on to discuss his philosophy, which is encompassing and not dismissive, again.Make sure to check out Billy’s websites for more information about his philosophy, to check out some of the artists that he is promoting for free, and to see how he interprets the Bible’s message, which I cannot suggest more.God’s On Trial: http://bit.ly/SCPSgodsontrialPublishing 4 the People: http://bit.ly/SCPSpublishing4thepeopleK.I.S.S.I.T.: http://bit.ly/SCPSkissitWe then record a sketch about the Garden of Eden and what those crazy kids might have been eating... hint: it isn\'t an apple.Sketch Comedy Podcast show is an independent and completely improvised sketch podcast that is based on conversations with interesting people like YOU!

She is also, and most importantly, the host of the “Not So Sexy, Sexy Podcast” where she picks a topic and will rant about that subject or has occasional guests on her show where they talk about things as well. The show is a fantastic blend of blog, confessional, comedy and what it is like being a female actress in LA (as opposed to being a male actress in LA). Liv talks about her writing talent, how terrible Seattle is, why she can never get any of her screenplays made into things, and mentions that her brother was killed in Peru and might have been a somehow connected to the mob. Also, we talk about where Italian-Americans end up when the move West in the US.This was an incredibly fun conversation, and I am tickled with how the sketch came out!Sketch Comedy Podcast show is an independent and completely improvised sketch podcast that is based on conversations with interesting people like YOU!

Stuart\'s 21-year-old step-daughter, whom he raised, got asked to do sexual acts, on film, for lots of money... and she did not say no.We talk about the situation, how she processed the information, asking random people walking into gas stations for life-advice, the lure of easy money, what life looks like as someone who does adult films for a living, and, ultimately, Amber makes a decision.If you are a parent, this is a great video to watch to see how to talk to your adult child about difficult subjects.

I saw him sneaking around the Ohio hot dog convention administrative tents. He is a notorious hot dog hater and so I am still tailing his latest efforts. I have found nothing too incriminating, other the multiple violent crimes he commits against defenseless hot dogs behind the Krogers.Are spirits trying to talk to us?

Where the hell is he and why is he going to buy vagina soap?\xa0 | A very strange tree at the end of a news broadcast and a president who decided that the best way to run a country was through the centre of the Earth. So many questions, so little... sense. It would be wise of you to listen as both of the answers may save your life someday.

My name is Jason Newland. I am a Hypnotist, Counsellor & NLP Master Practitioner. I’m also a proud Daddy to a little Ferret, called Andre. I have been providing this FREE Hypnosis Service, Online, since 2006. I have made hundreds of hypnosis videos & recorded over a thousand mp3 downloads. Everything I do is free for all to download and stream.This particular, “Let me bore you to sleep” podcast, has been running since January 2018. Each session is different, yet similar in the sense that its all aimed at helping you to relax your body, calm & slow down your mind and drift off into a natural, healing & safe sleep. I tell silly stories, talk about boring events in my life and just mess around. It’s not supposed to be taken seriously, but really can relax your body and mind and bore you into a lovely, peaceful sleep.Some people tell me that they listen to this podcast for company. They like the fact that I make regular recordings and talk about my life, as well as making up stuff. Sometimes its just really nice to hear a friendly voice once a day.Sessions last approximately 1 hour each, and of course I am incredibly BORING in every one. I genuinely hope that this Boring sleep podcast helps you to overcome insomnia and sleep easier.

And before there was nothing... there was Ikea. In today's episode, Jess realigns our molecules until we're ever-so out-of-phase.

You won't get uncut emotions like this on any other podcast. Except for Beautiful Anonymous, needless to say. Later, Jess then drags us back, VERY MUCH kicking and screaming, to the Grosser Green Grocer.\xa0Also, for today's episode, I'm experimenting with skipping the noise reduction that I usually run on our audio. This means more background hiss, but hopefully more natural-sounding voices.

This one's got big dudes, bigger bananas, a ski resort called Pine Knob, and a little dollop of Cat's Content, just for good luck.\xa0The audio quality on this one is a bit of a wild ride, especially in the first half. I huff into my mic a fair amount, which I know bothers some folks like myself. BUT I think I fixed most of it for our next ep?

The Step by Stapp 3rd anniversary show in April will also be the series finale. Yes, this podcast is coming to an end - but a new one is just around the corner! Announcement 2.) Scott Stapp has a new album coming out and the first single has been released.

Cause if you fuck with us, you’re a funny piece of shit as well. Are we cancelled? We have to be. Once again if you’ve gotten this far congrats, you’re coming to hell with us. :) This time if you wanna bail on us after listening to this one I get it. I mean we do not tread lightly and don’t plan too.In this episode the boys discuss,  meeting parents, having a daughter, going to jail together and what’s the most alpha thing a man can do to another man. Matt is pushing spanish remixes and Dom is into Tokyo Drift. They go in on girl’s IG bios and answer some leftover dating Q & A’s from last week. ENJOY | We try to mix it up on this podcast, a little masculinity here, a little there. Sometimes we get deep and personal, and sometimes we fuck around and review Iggy Azalea albums? Well! This week we are giving some dating advice…I think. Im not entirely sure what we did this week so much so that I wouldn’t be surprised if we got cancelled or If I wake up and theres a protest going down. My girlfriend already got mad at me for this episode and I didn’t even put it out. SHE DIDNT EVEN HEAR IT. SHE JUST KNEW THE VIBES AND GOT MAD AT ME. and then I paid for dinner and churros. Needless to say….Don’t listen to our advice.I mean LISTEN to it, but don’t like be doing the shit we say. THIS IS A COMEDY PODCAST. comedy. AHEM…..COOOOMMMEEEDDDDYYYYYYYY….enjoy. | Toxicity is funny man, if you don’t think so…you should probably skip this episode….actually how’d you make it to episode 20?….If you don’t think this shit is funny AND you’re still listening. Just Know. YOU…are an actual sociopath. In this episode the boys discuss toxicity, girls, toxicity, sex, toxicity & appreciating your life. enjoy. | I honestly think we may have peaked…or we just took shit way too far this episode. Either or, this one is worth listening to strictly for the fact of cancelling us. Like we are 100% getting cancelled this time I know I said that way back at episode 7 but THIS…ya man….we talked about dicks, more dicks, porn dicks, dick surgery, toxic dick….jesus. What were we thinking? I think we’re just getting too comfortable and we’re starting to show who we really are…a couple of overly masculine dudes that lift weights, talk shit and know nothing about anything but talk like they be knowing shit. BUT. if you’ve made this far, to episode 19…you love this shit don’t lie…you beautiful bastard you! In this episode, the boys discuss Matt’s new puppy, podcast haters and what movies to watch to set up the “smash”. Matt is pulling two things this week, pay-ton-rose & the cons of having a puppy. Dom is pushing all you can eats and pulling Dr. Miami’s new penis procedure. INDULGE BOYS & GIRLS! | Some feedback we hear is “I feel like this would be a lot funnier If I actually knew them” and on the other end of that we get “I relate so much to ya’ll, feels like I’ve known you guys for years”. So this is for both audiences, to get to know us or to get to know us even better. We wanted to be unfiltered and candid for an episode because “a joke isn’t a joke if it never gets real”. This week the boys put the jokes & bits aside (well some of them) and give ya’ll an insight into who they really are. Recorded semi-candidly after hours at the gym, Dom & Matt have an in depth 60 minute conversation about life, romance, and bullying. Theres a lot to digest and take in so whether you agree or disagree with what we discuss let us know! and thank ya’ll for even listening! We’ll be back to our regularly scheduled programming next week reloaded and levelled up don’t worry!! | WARNING OUR GROSSEST AND MANLIEST EPISODE YETAlright, so first off I’d recommend not answering that question before you listen to this week’s episode. Secondly, WE GOT OUR EDGE BACK. Ya’ll have been asking for weeks, where’s our favourite segment that wasn’t really a segment but it was funny and ya’ll never did again?! Well….I hope we’re thinking about the same thing cause if you listen and you were expecting some other segment that wasn’t really a segment to make a come back…..then…fuck. I guess you should just suck it up cause you don’t own me, I’m my own individual and I can do what I want with this podcast. Unless you unsubscribe and give us bad reviews then I guess I should listen….Ive never been great at taking orders from others, probably has to do with my lack of a father figure in my life and is deep-……what was I talking about again? Fuck I’m getting bad with these descriptions, I should probably plan these out. FUCK YOU DAD.sorry about that….so…..In this episode, the boys discuss, going solo to the movies, running and share some 5 star reviews. Dom is having issues with “Deload Weeks” at the gym and Matt is not feeling the new armpit hair trend. And URBAN DICTIONARY WITH DOM RETURNS. INDULGE, LOYAL/SINGLE BOYS AND GIRLS! | You ever be out, and meet a guy, but like your’e a guy and he’s cool and you’re like damn, this would be dope to hang again…stop, why are you laughing? don’t laugh while your reading this. This time i’m serious. Ya’ll read these descriptions and laugh at my trials and tribulations and I’m getting sick of it. I have plenty of friends I just wouldn’t mind another. ok Joban. Laters on the menjay.In this episode the guys discuss girls getting flown out, where to find decent girls & OPERATION 5  STAR. Matt wants you guys to stop trying to sell him OVO tickets and Dom talks about his amazing time at a Cannabis Party. They also deep dive into the question “why can’t guys ask guys to be friends?”. INDULGE LOYAL BOYS AND GIRLS!! | There comes a time in every podcasts life to level the fuck up.

Meanwhile, contending with his annoying secretary, Stonehand and brother N’dugu talk to the chieftain of the island about assurances of fealty and securing more funds. The difficult boatswain explains that it’ll take at least a week to get the Sea Fairy sea worthy so the group tries to speed up the process.

Sylfyr takes the time, in secret, to fill in Sir Rogney about their extra obligations. The first day out to sea and a dragonturtle attacks, why... just why. Somehow making it to the first island, one member less, our party is stranded until the the Sea Fairy is repaired. Following through with the mission Brother N’dugu and Stonehand decide to search for the leaders of this island known as Dante’s Reach. \xa0 \xa0 Find us: Website: CrudeCharacters.com OR Facebook: Facebook.com/CrudeCharacters Twitter: Twitter.com/CrudeCharacters And everywhere podcasts are played \xa0 Send us an email CrudeCharacters@gmail.com \xa0 Givaways, Free Stickers, Leave a Rating and Review:\xa0 https://www.crudecharacters.com/rateandreview/ \xa0 *MATURE CONTENT WARNING* The show you are about to hear contains but is not limited to: violence, inappropriate sexual language, and\xa0excessively offensive conduct.

Then a bunch of creepy priests in red robes give it to him in the worst possible way. Not having a good morning due to the wailing and howling Brother N’dugu goes looking for the secret library and finds exactly what he expected. Mostly partially recovered they prepare for the journey at hand, that they just now learn about.. Once again our masters of music and might find themselves sleeping at the bar where they fell drunkenly asleep. Sylfyr wakes up bound back to back with a snoring Sir Rogney. A deal was struck between Sylfyr and the seedy owner over the tab, tho it feels more like extortion. Consequences for everyone! this episode makes me sad on so many levels. The party comes back together. Our hungover debtors and crispy mummies gather supplies for a long journey across the sea. Also Stonehand has a good scene with an old woodworker that inhaled way to much sawdust over his lifetime. I was moved.. emotionally... and physically. \xa0 \xa0 Find us: Website: CrudeCharacters.com OR Facebook: Facebook.com/CrudeCharacters Twitter: Twitter.com/CrudeCharacters And everywhere podcasts are played \xa0 Send us an email CrudeCharacters@gmail.com \xa0 Givaways, Free Stickers, Leave a Rating and Review:\xa0 https://www.crudecharacters.com/rateandreview/ \xa0 *WARNING* The show you are about to hear contains but is not limited to: violence, inappropriate sexual language, and\xa0excessively offensive conduct.
