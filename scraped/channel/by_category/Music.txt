He started a job for his godfather\xa0unpacking meat along the docks of the Hudson River. Less than a decade later, he was starring\xa0alongside\xa0John Wayne and Robert Mitchum in El Dorado, just a few years from Coppola\'s giving him a lead in\xa0The Godfather. In his unmistakable Queens patois,\xa0Caan tells Alec the wonderful, unlikely story of his rise to stardom. That story includes his many marriages, even more fistfights, and\xa0heretofore untold details from the sometimes-violent set of\xa0The Godfather. Plus what sort of roles Caan wanted but didn\'t get because of typecasting. | Since 2004, 1300 towns across America have\xa0lost local newspaper coverage.\xa0 2004 was\xa0also the first full year\xa0David Rattray, the third generation of his family to own the East Hampton Star,\xa0served as the paper\'s editor.\xa0 It\'s a job for which Rattray gave up a\xa0very different life and career in New York City.\xa0 That was a good choice:\xa0 thanks in part to his stewardship, the Star thrives.\xa0\xa0It covers East Hampton\'s seasonal transformation into the center of an elite New York social universe, but other than that, the venerable weekly operates much as it always has.\xa0 Rattray makes sure\xa0Town Board meetings get covered\xa0and that\xa0the Fishing Report is up to date --\xa0as did his\xa0parents,\xa0and his grandfather before them.\xa0 Alec has been spending time in East Hampton for almost 40 years, so he and Rattray have much to discuss about the paper, and the changes they\'ve witnessed in town.\xa0 They also discuss\xa0the Star\'s\xa0long-term project to research and confront the Hamptons\' slaveholding past -- a past in which Rattray\'s own ancestors played a part. | The Reverend Donna Schaper of New York\'s Judson Memorial Church leads her flock of 300 through life\'s sacraments like any pastor.\xa0 But she has a national profile, too, appearing in print and on television to reject the idea\xa0that Christian values necessarily lead to\xa0conservative politics.\xa0 She tells Alec her story of spiritual awakening, from an abusive working-class home, to parting ways from the Lutheran Church of her childhood, all the way to\xa0Judson Memorial Church, a Christian outpost\xa0in Greenwich Village that ministers to sex workers, doubters, LGBT folk, the undocumented, and Village gentry alike.\xa0 Alec in return tells Donna about his own journey of faith. | Alec Baldwin and Matthew Landfield crossed paths\xa0one time before their Here\'s the Thing interview.\xa0 In early 2001, Alec was shooting a movie in front of 31 Desbrosses Street in New York\'s Tribeca neighborhood.\xa0 Matthew had grown up in the building in the 1980s, raised by a\xa0performance-artist mom and modernist-painter father.\xa0 Matthew and Alec said hello as Matthew walked\xa0in to visit his parents.\xa0 The bohemian scene on the block stuck with Alec over the years -- so much so that when in 2015 he was driving by and noticed that the building was gone, he researched what had happened.\xa0 Online, Alec discovered Matthew\'s\xa0labor of love: perhaps the best, most deeply researched article ever written about a single address.\xa0 The Lenape, the Dutch, the English, the factory workers, junkies, artists and bankers -- every\xa0stage of New York history\xa0had some brush with the land (or water) that is now 31 Desbrosses.\xa0 Alec was transfixed, and this funny, fascinating conversation is the result. | Six years ago the Board of the Manhattan School of Music faced a daunting decision: who would guide the school\xa0into its second century?\xa0 They turned to someone with a long history with the school, James Gandre.\xa0 Gandre joined MSM as an administrative assistant in the mid-1980s and rose through the ranks.\xa0 But before then, he\'d been auditioning for gigs as a tenor with symphonies and choirs.\xa0 He continued to do so even after he began in administration.\xa0 He tells Alec about his journey from small-town Wisconsin, to\xa0being an out gay man in San Francisco in the early 80s, to his long rise through the ranks at MSM -- and he shares his thoughts on the future of his venerable institution. | Brian Lehrer is a unique figure in the public life of New York City.\xa0 Beyond hosting the city\'s defining daily talk show, he\'s our conscience and our conciliator.\xa0 When New Yorkers want a fair mayoral debate, they often call Brian.\xa0 When WNYC needed someone to help us process our own #metoo moment, we called Brian.\xa0 The\xa0Peabody Awards\xa0honored The Brian Lehrer Show\xa0for\xa0"reuniting the estranged terms \'civil\' and \'discourse.\'"\xa0 Of course, civil doesn\'t mean soft:\xa0 he can be unsparing in his interviews because, as he tells Alec, "there\'s plenty that pisses me off."\xa0 Alec is fan of -- and a regular caller on -- Brian\'s show, so who better to turn the tables?\xa0 Alec interviews Brian about his path to prominence, and the two discuss their shared love of radio, and of New York. | Alexander Acosta has resigned from his position as\xa0Secretary of Labor in the Trump administration.\xa0 That\'s because of the sweetheart deal he cut politically connected financier Jeffrey Epstein back in 2008, when Acosta was a federal prosecutor.\xa0 In the swirl of news following Epstein\'s re-arrest, but before the Acosta resignation, Julie Brown\xa0stepped out of Acosta\'s press conference to speak to Alec on the phone.\xa0 We learn her reaction and that of Epstein\'s victims who called her up after the arrest.\xa0 That conversation is at the end of\xa0an extended cut of their live conversation at the Greene Space this spring and a phone call from Alan Dershowitz addressing the accusations made against him. | Corey Johnson wants to be the next mayor of New York, and the press seems to think he will be.\xa0 His\xa0plan to fix transit\xa0is the centerpiece of his platform.\xa0 Tom Wright is the CEO of the powerful Regional Plan Association.\xa0 That organization imagines\xa0the future and comes up with ideas for infrastructure and bureaucracy that could meet\xa0its needs.\xa0 Nicole Gelinas, a reporter and a Manhattan Institute scholar of Urban Economics, also believes in big, innovative projects.\xa0 But for\xa0the past 15 years,\xa0she\'s been reminding New Yorkers that\xa0we will not get a transit system worthy of our great city if we cannot get costs under control, and our financial house in order.\xa0 Combine these three experts with Alec\'s\xa0curiosity and strong opinions about all things New York, and you get a great conversation about congestion pricing, organized labor, the MTA, and\xa0future of transportation everywhere.', 'chan_desc': 'From WNYC Studios, award-winning actor Alec Baldwin takes listeners into the lives of artists, policy makers and performers.

A step into brand new territory, but which featured a killer list of musicians by his side including a couple of "kick-ass" drummers. | This episode covers one of the most epic Led Zeppelin songs as Robert reveals the story and personal trauma behind the mighty \'Achilles Last Stand\'.

But then, there they are, popping up in batches right out of thin air. Of course, behind each individual release sits months of decision-making by the artist: who to collaborate with and when, how to structure the musical product of that collaboration, what to call it, how to release it, when, and on what platform. The list is long, and each of those choices has a big impact on how we hear the song.The Verge’s Dani Deahl recently sat down with reigning Princess of Pop, Charli XCX, to discuss how she approaches those decisions, and how that approach is bucking long-established norms in popular music. In this special bonus episode of Switched on Pop, Dani rings up Charlie (not XCX) to recap that conversation and put Charli (XCX)’s artistry in context. Via Dani, we learn that for Charli collaboration is more than just an artistic choice; and release strategy is much more than a major label playbook. There’s a total freedom in the way Charli releases music, and we love it. Huge thanks to Dani for bringing us this peek into her world.Songs discussed:Charli XCX - Boom ClapCharli XCX, Christine and the Queens - GoneCharli XCX ft.

In the pre-chorus, the singer proudly expresses that she is a "sexual bender." Fans have embraced the song for breaking free of normative sexual expectations. But these non-binary statements aren\'t limited to the lyrics. The message is reinforced with musical concepts drawn from the blues, Prince and Michael Jackson. To help break down this track, Nate and Charlie are joined by singer/rapper Lizzo. She and Monáe both collaborated with Prince, making Lizzo uniquely qualified to unwind his influence on the song.

Certainly popularity, as measured by streams and radio play; not to mention that bewildering feeling that creeps up some time mid-July, prompting whispered exclamations of: “man, this song is everywhere.” But the most ubiquitous track isn’t necessarily the one you’ll have on repeat on those steamy summer commutes to work, nor is it the song you’ll want soundtracking this year’s vacations, graduations, summer flings and backyard cookouts. In this episode, we abandon the pursuit of a single song of summer, and ask the question we’re more interested in: What does summer sound like? To answer that question, we asked you, our listeners, and got some downright awesome suggestions in return.

Since the 1950s, the label has been used both as a genre and as a catch-all for the entirety of black popular music. Soul, funk, disco and even hip-hop have at times been covered by this "R&B" umbrella. On Chance The Rapper\'s new album, The Big Day, all of these influences come through—and he\'s not alone. On recent Kehlani records, 90s R&B and 2000s trap both play a role. But both these artists are a far cry from the 50s R&B sounds of Sam Cooke. To understand how R&B has changed over time, we consult with Trevor Anderson, manager of Billboard\'s R&B/Hip Hop chart. Then we speak with R&B super-producer Oak Felder to understand how R&B is progressing and what it might become.Songs DiscussedChance The Rapper - Hot ShowerChance The Rapper - I Got YouSam Cooke - You Send MeElvis Presley - Crying In the ChapelThe Temptations - I Can’t Get Next To YouMtume - Juicy FruitBiggie - JuicyToni Braxton - Breath AgainJanet Jackson - That’s The Way Love GoesBoys II Men - I’ll Make Love To YouLauryn Hill - Doo Wop (That Thing)Diddy - I’ll Be Missing You (feat.

This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with music historian Bruce Conforth about Johnson’s career, death and working to give the guitarist his identity back. They also share some of their favorite covers of Johnson\'s songs. | Back in the 1970s, punk was shorthand for a subculture that took pride in breaking the mainstream’s mold.

The challenge was following it up—and Jackson and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, didn’t make it easy on themselves.In 1989, they produced an ambitious album with a portentous title: Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814. But what could have been Control, Part 2 instead was a visionary LP that reinvented the socially conscious album from the era of Marvin Gaye for the ’90s, and envisioned what pop would eventually sound like in the 21st century. Rhythm Nation was a smash, generating more hits—and bigger hits—than any album in history. In fact, if Jackson and her label hadn’t pulled their punches with one final radio single, she could have set an all-time Billboard chart record that would have overshadowed any of the Jackson family’s historic achievements.Podcast production by Chris Berube.HostChris MolanphyFollow @cmolanphy on Twitter / https://www.twitter.com/cmolanphy\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

Imagine how the people of 1969 felt—specifically the millions who couldn’t go. Yet, in the age before YouTube and social media, the rest of America did catch Woodstock fever—weeks, months, even a year or more later—and they made stars out of many of the performers. By 1970, not only was the Woodstock movie dominating the box office; the soundtrack album and a constellation of Woodstock stars were crushing the Billboard charts.This month’s Hit Parade offers a new take on Woodstock: To understand its legacy, you have to look at the charts long after August 1969. Chris Molanphy counts down 10 acts—some of them music legends, some of them short-lived hitmakers—who were materially boosted by the festival: from a guy hanging out backstage who got shoved onstage by desperate show organizers; to the band who loathed the whole experience yet saw their albums reach new chart heights; to the young man who arrived with no discography but kicked off one of the longest hitmaking careers in rock history.

But the rise of rock and roll in the ’60s sidelined showtunes on the radio. And even when Broadway tried to rock—from Hair to Jesus Christ Superstar—a new generation grew wary of characters breaking into song (unless they were animated mermaids, teapots or lions). And yet, in the 21st century, Broadway music has staged a cultural comeback: taking over our movie screens, making shows out of jukebox hits, and raising a new generation to believe they can rap like Hamilton and Lafayette. In this Tonys month, Hit Parade dances down the Great White Way to chronicle the tangled history of the Broadway musical on the pop charts.\xa0\xa0Email: hitparade@slate.com\xa0\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

Except not only did the band survive—fronted by drummer-turned-singer Phil Collins, they got bigger. Then Collins went solo…except he didn’t ditch Genesis. In fact, his success made them bigger—one of the definitive pop bands of the 1980s, as Collins’s monstrous drum sound took over pop music. By mid-decade, current and former members of Genesis—even side projects from its guitarists—were all competing head-to-head on the Billboard charts. On Hit Parade, we explore the knotty family tree of Genesis, the unlikeliest group ever to become a Hot 100 juggernaut.Learn more about your ad choices.

Trust us, you\'ll regret it.For some reason, there are a lot of people who see a podcast about their terrible taste in music as an invitation to contact the hosts and, y\'know, say things... Yeah, it\'s pretty inexcusable behavior but, since we don\'t seem to be able to put a stop to it, we may as well share some of the best/worst specimens.Here\'s the first YFBS mini-episode! Mark and Tyler give their no-holds-barred, completely uncensored responses to fan mail. (And, let\'s be clear, every e-mail we get is fan mail, especially the rage-fueled, typo\'d-at-3am-half-drunk-in-your-underwear emails. You\'re a fan. We don\'t like it either but you\'re a fan. Deal with it.)Enjoy! | Clint Eastwood should sue these clowns.Anyone remember when cartoons were for kids and nobody on the planet would dream of confusing the soundtrack with, you know, music? Gorillaz make albums for adults who still eat bowls of cereal for breakfast. The favorite band of Eloi everywhere.It\'s offensive that anyone thinks we\'re supposed to take this seriously. Gorillaz suck. | Alright, here\'s your proof.Oasis is hard evidence that talent and work ethic have nothing to do with "making it" in music. If millions of people bought this, they\'d buy anything. Liam Gallagher is maybe the worst singer that\'s been discussed on our show so far. Noel Gallagher has probably been sued for plagiarism more times than Madonna. It\'s a miracle he\'s never tried to pass off "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as an original composition. BONUS: every single jerkoff cover of "Wonderwall" that you\'ve ever had to hear is this band\'s fault.But, hey, we\'ll admit the Gallaghers seem like very nice guys! | You\'d think a band with this many songs about drugs could be more than a one-hit wonder but that\'s just how much Queens of the Stone Age sucks. Someone should invent time travel just so we can send these guys back to prehistory for more guitar riffs.Queens fans think it\'s impossible to dislike this band. Press play. We\'ll show you how it\'s done. | From a music business standpoint, here\'s a textbook example of what not to do. Those of you who remember how this all went down (and, boy, did it go down), you know why this hilarious history lesson is necessary, even though The Strokes never actually did a single thing that mattered, one single thing to deliver on the hype fabricated around them. Just like they requested, The Strokes are well on their way to ultimately being forgotten. Dig out your fave vintage t-shirt that you bought on eBay and wear it one more time while we take this little trip down memory lane... | Phil Collins sucks so much that it almost feels mean to make fun of him. But we are mean, so who cares? We\'ll admit that it\'s honestly pretty impressive how much of a douchebag this guy is but that\'s not enough for us to excuse the sheer amount of terrible music he\'s created. If the only song he ever made was "In the Air Tonight," then he\'d probably still deserve an episode because that\'s among the actual worst songs that has ever been made by anyone. And that\'s only one Phil Collins song. It\'s terrifying to consider how many more episodes of this podcast we could make about him but that\'s only to be expected when Ringo Starr is the only drummer in history who is more overrated than Phil.\xa0 | This is the best Canada can do, huh? You know what? Have this one back. No, no. We’re fine. Honestly. Yes, you seem very polite but you\'re clearly trying to convince us that Rush is something other than a Trojan horse to brainwash Americans into acting like even bigger jerks than normal. Get someone smarter than an 8th grader to write the lyrics next time, thanks. The only thing we\'re still wondering is why anyone thinks any member of this band is great at their instrument. | Last episode, we went in on Madonna’s lack of originality and talent. Today, we try to understand the why of it all. To what end, all this thievery and stirring up of controversy?Maybe the answer lies somewhere deep inside “Like a Virgin.” Of course, her illustrious acting career cannot be overlooked. There\'s the groundbreaking Ray of Light album. And there\'s always, always, some recent example of Madonna doing something even dumber than ever before, such as releasing new music in the year 2019. Madame X needs to X-cuse herself from the spotlight and retire. | She can’t sing. She can’t dance. She can’t act. She has no personality of her own. There’s a 90% chance anything anyone thinks she deserves credit for is just something they don’t know was done by someone else, first and better.Can’t figure out what so many people see in Madonna? Trust us, you’re missing nothing. Here\'s what it takes to be a Madonna fan: you had to be there and you had to have no awareness that Madonna is the bluntest object in the cutting edge drawer.\xa0Listen and learn. | This might be an episode on Daft Punk and it might not. There\'s really no way to know... Okay, fine, it is an episode about how much Daft Punk (or whoever\'s underneath those helmets) sucks. Spoiler Alert: it comes down to way more than the helmets.People who have strong opinions about which Daft Punk album is better than other Daft Punk albums are the same people who have strong opinions about whether Shake Shack burgers are better than In-N-Out burgers.

You’ll hear Fleming’s performance from the Metropolitan Opera’s 1999 production of Susannah, as well as Rhiannon Giddens’ version from her new album, there is no Other.The GuestsOne of the most celebrated singers of our time, soprano Renée Fleming has used her voice to break down the barriers between different genres of music. From opera to Broadway to jazz, and even the movie soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings, this fourteen-time Grammy nominated artist has sung it all. \xa0Stage director and writer Thomas Holliday practically became a member of the Floyd family when he embarked on five years of research and interviews for the comprehensive biography Falling Up: The Days and Nights of Carlisle Floyd.Feminist writer Leora Tanenbaum has been writing books and articles about slut-shaming and the sexual double standard for over 20 years. When she’s not fighting the good fight for gender equality, Leora can be found at Columbia University, where she is Director of Communications.Special thanks to the Metropolitan Opera, Boosey & Hawkes, and Nonesuch Records for the music in this episode.\xa0 | You hear the message over and over in pop culture: love overcomes everything. But when Don José sings “The Flower Song” in Bizet\'s Carmen, you\'re reminded that love has a dark side, too.In the Season 1 finale, host Rhiannon Giddens welcomes tenor Roberto Alagna, critic Anne Midgette and psychologist Andrew G. Marshall to consider the crazy, possessive side of love and the importance of experiencing art that doesn’t have a fairy-tale ending. Then, you’ll hear Alagna sing the role of the passionate and violent Don José onstage at the Metropolitan Opera.The GuestsTenor Roberto Alagna first performed as Don José when he was 35. Twenty years and many performances later, he thinks he “judged” José a little too harshly in the past and now feels more empathy for the character\'s misguided and obsessive love.As a teenager, Washington Post critic Anne Midgette dreamed of living in Europe with a boyfriend who sang opera. When she moved there after college and dated a tenor who sang “The Flower Song” on a train platform, she thought, “Oh my god, my dream came true.”When writer and marital therapist Andrew G Marshall took his parents to see Carmen, they expected to hear some familiar tunes and a sweet love story. Instead, they got “horror and bloodshed.” Pro tip: always read the program notes. | A picture may paint a thousand words, but nothing compares to the intimacy and immediacy of a handwritten letter. Hearing the "Letter Aria" from Jules Massenet\'s Werther will prove it. From an opera based on the Goethe novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, this scene finds the tortured heroine Charlotte re-reading the letters of the doomed poet.In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens welcomes soprano Isabel Leonard, pianist Mary Dibbern and author Peter Bognanni to explore why the words we write to each other have so much power – sometimes even more than the ones we say aloud. They\'ll reflect on Massenet\'s talent for showing Charlotte\'s deep connection to Werther and you\'ll even get a real-life story about how email brought two people together. Then you\'ll hear Isabel Leonard sing the complete scene onstage at the Metropolitan Opera.The GuestsMezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard can handle many different roles\xa0– this season she\'s sung everything from Nico Muhly to Claude Debussy – but describes Charlotte as one of her most challenging. "The vocal writing is relentless," she says. "Massenet had a way of expressing a very deep understanding of Charlotte\'s complex struggle." Pianist Mary Dibbern began her love affair with French opera began in Paris more than 30 years ago. Since then, she’s translated a biography of Jules Massenet and is currently the Music Director of Education for the Dallas Opera. Minneapolis-based Peter Bognanni fell in love with his wife over email. He is also the author of Things I’m Seeing Without You, a modern-day story about two teens who fall in love over text messages and email.  | When the Voyager spacecraft set off to explore the galaxy in 1977, it carried a recording to represent the best of humanity. The “Golden Record” featured everyone from Bach to Chuck Berry, but there was only one opera aria: the rage-fest from Mozart’s The Magic Flute.In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests consider why the Queen of the Night’s big moment – “Der Hölle Rache” – is an out-of-this-world achievement, how Mozart created a profound fairy tale for adults and what it takes for a soprano to reach the stratosphere. You’ll hear Kathryn Lewek hit all those high notes onstage at the Metropolitan Opera and talk to Timothy Ferris, the man who produced NASA’s “Golden Record.” The GuestsSoprano Kathryn Lewek describes singing “Der Hölle Rache” as throwing darts with your eyes closed. But after performing the part more than 200 times, she certainly knows how to hit the bullseye. Harvard University professor Carolyn Abbate once took her son to see The Magic Flute and he declared it to be “bad, but not in the way I expected it be bad.” Her latest book is A History of Opera: The Last Four Hundred Years.Composer and author Jan Swafford was a graduate student when he spent his last $50 to buy a copy of The Magic Flute\xa0and immediately regretted it: he hated the opera. To say he’s warmed to Mozart over the years would be a wild understatement.Timothy Ferris produced the Golden Record that went up with NASA’s Voyager space probes in 1977. It was the only record he ever produced, but he\'s written many books including\xa0Coming of Age in the Milky Way, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. | You’ve probably been there: in love for the first time and enchanted by the very sound of your sweetheart’s name. The problem for Gilda in Verdi’s Rigoletto is that her new love isn’t who he says he is. The worst will come (it’s opera), but for a few brief moments in Act I, Gilda’s innocence sweeps you away. She’s young and head over heels and obsessing over the “caro nome,” the “dear name” of her new love.\xa0 In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests consider the dizzying thrill of your first love, Verdi’s brilliant powers of orchestration and why Gilda’s infatuation rings so true even today. You’ll hear soprano Nadine Sierra reminisce about her own formative experiences and then fall in love with the so-called “Gualtier Maldè” onstage at the Metropolitan Opera.The GuestsBefore Nadine Sierra could be accurately described as one of the most talented young artists in opera, she was a self-described “opera nerd.” She had a protective family – like Gilda – but that couldn’t stop her from secretly riding to high school in her boyfriend’s car.Paul Thomason has combined his lifelong passion for music, colorful storytelling skills and a knack for mid-century slang to become one of the most insightful writers and lecturers on opera. He’s written for far too many publications to list.Carl Pickhardt is a psychologist and author who has spent decades helping parents and children navigate the challenges of adolescence. His most recent book is titled Who Stole My Child? Parenting Through the Four Stages of Adolescence.\xa0 | Singing even one high C can be an event for the tenor and his audience. Everyone in the room knows how easily it could go wrong. Multiply that pressure by nine? You get “Ah, mes amis.” Gaetano Donizetti wrote this high-stakes aria for his opera La Fille du Régiment. The young hero Tonio has just enlisted in the army and received permission to marry the girl of his dreams. “Ah, mes amis” is his celebration: Tonio’s bursting with so much joy that the guy sings nine – count ‘em, NINE – high Cs. In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests consider the sheer athleticism it takes to pull off “Ah, mes amis” and reflect on the power of love to make us do crazy things. And after surveying this Mount Everest of tenor arias with a singer, a vocal coach and a former NFL player, you\'ll hear tenor Javier Camarena scale its heights from his base camp on the Metropolitan Opera stage.The GuestsRenowned tenor Javier Camarena made his professional debut singing the role of Tonio, but remembers it as both exciting and terrifying: as a young singer in Mexico, he didn\'t really speak any French. "I think it was like, Spang-French or something like that," he says, laughing about it now.When Lydia Brown first came to New York, she used to line up on Saturday mornings to get cheap seats to the Met Opera. Now she\'s working inside the building as a vocal coach to some of the world’s top singers. \xa0Ta’u Pupu’a is a former defensive end for the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens. After a career-ending injury, he attended Juilliard Opera Center and transformed from a tackler to a tenor. He now performs at opera houses across the world. | She seduces, she traps, she destroys. She\'s a femme fatale and her signature aria is the dangerously alluring “Mon coeur s’ouvre a ta voix” from Samson et Dalila by Camille Saint-Saëns. "My heart opens to your voice,” sings Dalila, "like the flowers open to the kisses of the dawn."\xa0It sure sounds like a love song, but just below the surface it’s simmering with seduction and betrayal. In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests reflect on the Biblical story of Samson and Delilah, the trope of the\xa0femme fatale and how Saint-Saëns created this unforgettable moment that sounds as if Dalila’s slowly removing her clothing, one note at a time. Plus, you\'ll hear mezzo-soprano Elīna Garanča sing the complete aria from the Metropolitan Opera stage.The GuestsMezzo-soprano Elīna Garanča made her Met debut a decade ago, but the role of Dalila is relatively new to her: she first sang Samson et Dalila at the Vienna State Opera in May 2018. But judging from her recent appearance at WQXR, the part of a Biblical seductress suits her just fine.James Jorden is the founding editor of the world\'s first (and still very popular) opera blog Parterre Box. He\'s written for many other publications, including Opera News, The New York Times and the New York Observer. In another life, he used to sing “Mon coeur s’ouvre a ta voix."Dr. Caroline Blyth teaches religious studies at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and studies Biblical themes in contemporary culture. She spent eight years researching the Delilah story for her book Reimagining Delilah’s Afterlives as Femme Fatale: The Lost Seduction.\xa0 | When things go from bad to worse for Tosca, Puccini’s tragic heroine, she turns inward and prays. “I lived for art,” she tells God, “I lived for love.” What did I do to deserve all this? Tosca\'s despair and the moving way Puccini captures it musically speak so directly to artists, to audiences, to all of us, that "Vissi d\'arte" has become one of the most famous arias in opera.In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests consider what it means to "live for art" and how Tosca\'s lament has given them much needed strength, whether facing personal struggles, the darkest days of the AIDS epidemic or the persistent sexual harassment that sparked the #MeToo movement. Plus, you\'ll hear soprano Sondra Radvanovksy sing the complete aria from the Metropolitan Opera stage.The GuestsSondra Radvanovsky\xa0first sang Tosca in Denver and didn\'t quite anticipate how the high altitude would leave her even more breathless than the music! In the many years since, she\'s established herself as one of the great Puccini (and Verdi) singers and returns to the Met as Floria Tosca in March 2019.Rufus Wainwright comes from a famously musical family, but his curiosity took him far beyond his singer-songwriter roots. As a child, he used to stage operas at home with his siblings and, as an adult, he\'s written the two operas, Prima Donna and Hadrian.Vivien Schweitzer is a pianist and the author of the new book A Mad Love: An Introduction to Opera. She worked for ten years as a classical music and opera critic for the New York Times. She has also written for the BBC, the Moscow Times, and The Economist.\xa0\xa0 | The legendary Plácido Domingo says he\'s not a jealous guy, but he must know something about it because he\'s played the part of Othello more than 200 times. Shakespeare called jealousy the "green-eyed monster" and no opera captures what happens when that monster takes over better than Verdi\'s adaptation of the tragedy.In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests consider how jealousy always seems to know where to find us: at work, in our friendships, and of course, in love. Plácido Domingo takes you through his career-defining role, sharing the tragedy of a man undone by his demons, plus you\'ll hear him sing the complete aria "Dio mi potevi Scagliar" from the Metropolitan Opera stage.The GuestsPlácido Domingo is not only Rhiannon\'s favorite singer, but he is also one of the most influential artists in the history of opera. He just celebrated fifty years of performing at the Met and has played the role of Otello (by his count) 225 times.Robert L. Leahy\xa0is teaches at Weill Cornell Medical School and is the director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy in New York. He\'s written 27 books, including The Jealousy Cure.Ruben Santiago-Hudson is an actor, playwright and director. He may best known for his work on TV and on Broadway, but this year he directed Othello for Shakespeare in the Park at the Delacorte Theater.Virginia Mason Vaughan is a member of the faculty at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. For more than three decades, she\'s studied the construct of race in Shakespeare\'s time and is the author of Othello: A Contextual History. Thanks, too, to Justin Cunningham who read the part of Othello. He\'s a Julliard-trained actor and you\'ll see him next in the new Netflix series about the Central Park Five.The TeamAria Code is produced by WQXR in partnership with the Metropolitan Opera.

Original music by Hannis Brown. | Love at first sight is not just a cliché of romantic comedies: more than half of all Americans say they’ve experienced it. Can this explain the timeless appeal of Puccini’s La Bohème? In this episode, host Rhiannon Giddens and her guests consider what love at first sight is really all about, sharing perspectives on the music, the history and, yes, the brain science. Plus, you\'ll hear tenor Vittorio Grigolo sing the complete aria "Che gelida manina" from the Metropolitan Opera stage. The GuestsVittorio Grigolo started singing as a young boy, when the Italian press gave him the nickname Il Pavarottino (“The Little Pavarotti”). Today, he is one of the world’s leading tenors. He debuted as Rodolfo in La Bohème at the Met in 2010.James Kuslan is a lecturer and writer on opera and culture.

Deborah warns us to not first hear “The Murder Mystery” in the In-n-Out drive-thru while your infant daughter is in the back seat. Joel reveals how very very passionate his high school band was about not playing a particular song. They talk about primitive art, the art you make as an undergrad and how accidentally close it is to comedy. They gush about the super-cool, bold, arty, primitive drummer Maureen Tucker and how she’s such a revelation on this album and how she later surprisingly becomes a Tea Party supporter. “Nobody is just one thing” - Deborah Tarica. These particular songs are Wolf Parade’s “I’ll Believe In Anything” and “Sundown” by Gordon Lightfoot. Subscribe, Listen, Enjoy, Rate and Review! | Carl Tart sits down and embarrasses himself by singing the praises of Pretty Ricky’s debut album, Bluestars. Well “embarrassed” is the term he uses but we simply must give the man a break. This album came out when he was 16! After he came back to his high school looking trim following a weird 6 months in Mississippi! When there were now parties to go to and girls were starting to look at him, you know, differently! Yep. “Grind on Me” time. And AIM time too! What a time to be alive! They talk about school parties, horny songs, Carl’s mom driving him from Altadena to Culver City (yikes) every morning to fail to arrive on time for Jazz Band. Sux if you’re on Sax! Can’t sneak in late when you’re in the front. Also, Joel’s a cop. (SFX: AIM DOOR CLOSING) These particular songs are Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek” and O-Town’s “Every Six Seconds.” Subscribe, Listen, Enjoy, Rate and Review! | Lauren Lapkus sits down with Deborah and Joel to share her love of Sun Kil Moon’s Ghosts of the Great Highway. They talk about the weirdness of starting college, having no friends in college, making new friends in college or if you should break away from previous high school friends in college. They talk about how it’s wrong to shame a person who hasn’t yet seen or heard a particular movie, book or album - very important to the premise of this podcast!\xa0 But wouldn’t you know literally seconds later Deborah and Lauren shame Joel for never seeing Home Alone. Lauren shares how she started long-form improv classes in Chicago while she was in high school!\xa0 Ya’ll, she went to prom while she was in level 5! What was on your wall growing up? Was it stuff you enjoyed or stuff you felt you were supposed to enjoy? What blanket was surprisingly perfectly designed for Joel? Did you know Lauren was the model for the Statue of Liberty? These particular songs are “Like A Friend” by Pulp and “More Than This” by Roxy Music.

It’s glorious, it’s weird and not a little problematic from time to time. He reveals the sexual confusion he had while in Catholic school and how he connected with his not-cool-enough-to-be-a-hippy father over musicals. Wait. Not cool enough? Grant’s Dad rode his bike with his twin brother all the way from Ohio to New York City to see the original Broadway production of JCS. That may not be “Hippy” but that is pretty cool! They talk about seeing musicals as a kid and how the best roles are the ones where you go out, steal the show and then go backstage to “have a jacuzzi.” Inevitably the discussion turns to favorite/least favorite musicals and then we get to....Cats. I mean what the hell is that musical about? These particular songs are ABBA’s “I Am The City” and Yvonne Elliman‘s “If I Can’t Have You.” Subscribe, Listen, Enjoy, Rate and Review! | Deborah and Joel sit down with the great Jamie Denbo and hear about her love for Carole King’s Tapestry. Man what an album! Deborah and Jamie bond over how it all really started with Really Rosie. We learn that Jamie inadvertently (well, advertently) bullied Deborah into having a baby and why Carole King’s voice makes us all feel good and safe. We discover the pressure to like something in college, even Ska! There was a STARK difference between Deborah and Jamie’s (Jewish) summer camp and Joel’s (Christian) summer camp. One had scorpions! Bet you can’t guess the true prequel to The Handmaids Tale! Tune in to find that out as well as how “Jewish” Jamie Denbo’s happy place is.

She explains how she escaped walkable Eagan, wound up in very un-walkable downtown LA and later found herself making out with her (yellow-tinted sunglasses sporting) future husband in his very drivable Camry (We don’t take any money from Toyota...but we will). We discover a brand new hilarious take on a very very important moment in Deb’s history we’ve discussed before. Sorry Deborah’s mom! Learn how nine-year-old Joel stunned his parents with his album pics when the whole Spence family decided to do that Columbia records eleven records for one penny thing. We discuss the joy of making playlists and current concert going strategy when one is in the...”current situation we’re all in.” Tune it to find out what that is!

Subscribe, Listen, Enjoy, Rate and Review please! | Season Two starts with the great Al Yankovic (weird ex-college DJ) sharing his love of Devo’s third studio album, Freedom of Choice. **Almost coincidence alert** Deborah almost went to the same college as Al but when visiting the campus got turned off when she saw other students wearing...shoes? Too fancy for our Deborah! Joel shares yet another memory about learning about love from Air Supply and that isn’t even the most embarrassing thing he admits in this episode. That nice girl caught him doing what? Tune to find out! Also, what does one do when one finds out the drummer of one of one’s favorite bands is now an electrician? Al asks him to make a bid on work on his house, naturally. Guys, we know “Hey Jealousy” came out in the early to mid 90s and not the late 90s. Get off our back. Also, sorry for being so defensive about this. For reals, Al Yankovic is a national treasure and Deborah and Joel feel fortunate they were able to spend time with him.

Radiohead’s 1997 album got him through a tough, life-changing year. Deb likes Radiohead but is happy to give his ticket to Joel.
