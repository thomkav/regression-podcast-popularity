He started a job for his godfather\xa0unpacking meat along the docks of the Hudson River. Less than a decade later, he was starring\xa0alongside\xa0John Wayne and Robert Mitchum in El Dorado, just a few years from Coppola\'s giving him a lead in\xa0The Godfather. In his unmistakable Queens patois,\xa0Caan tells Alec the wonderful, unlikely story of his rise to stardom. That story includes his many marriages, even more fistfights, and\xa0heretofore untold details from the sometimes-violent set of\xa0The Godfather. Plus what sort of roles Caan wanted but didn\'t get because of typecasting. | Since 2004, 1300 towns across America have\xa0lost local newspaper coverage.\xa0 2004 was\xa0also the first full year\xa0David Rattray, the third generation of his family to own the East Hampton Star,\xa0served as the paper\'s editor.\xa0 It\'s a job for which Rattray gave up a\xa0very different life and career in New York City.\xa0 That was a good choice:\xa0 thanks in part to his stewardship, the Star thrives.\xa0\xa0It covers East Hampton\'s seasonal transformation into the center of an elite New York social universe, but other than that, the venerable weekly operates much as it always has.\xa0 Rattray makes sure\xa0Town Board meetings get covered\xa0and that\xa0the Fishing Report is up to date --\xa0as did his\xa0parents,\xa0and his grandfather before them.\xa0 Alec has been spending time in East Hampton for almost 40 years, so he and Rattray have much to discuss about the paper, and the changes they\'ve witnessed in town.\xa0 They also discuss\xa0the Star\'s\xa0long-term project to research and confront the Hamptons\' slaveholding past -- a past in which Rattray\'s own ancestors played a part. | The Reverend Donna Schaper of New York\'s Judson Memorial Church leads her flock of 300 through life\'s sacraments like any pastor.\xa0 But she has a national profile, too, appearing in print and on television to reject the idea\xa0that Christian values necessarily lead to\xa0conservative politics.\xa0 She tells Alec her story of spiritual awakening, from an abusive working-class home, to parting ways from the Lutheran Church of her childhood, all the way to\xa0Judson Memorial Church, a Christian outpost\xa0in Greenwich Village that ministers to sex workers, doubters, LGBT folk, the undocumented, and Village gentry alike.\xa0 Alec in return tells Donna about his own journey of faith. | Alec Baldwin and Matthew Landfield crossed paths\xa0one time before their Here\'s the Thing interview.\xa0 In early 2001, Alec was shooting a movie in front of 31 Desbrosses Street in New York\'s Tribeca neighborhood.\xa0 Matthew had grown up in the building in the 1980s, raised by a\xa0performance-artist mom and modernist-painter father.\xa0 Matthew and Alec said hello as Matthew walked\xa0in to visit his parents.\xa0 The bohemian scene on the block stuck with Alec over the years -- so much so that when in 2015 he was driving by and noticed that the building was gone, he researched what had happened.\xa0 Online, Alec discovered Matthew\'s\xa0labor of love: perhaps the best, most deeply researched article ever written about a single address.\xa0 The Lenape, the Dutch, the English, the factory workers, junkies, artists and bankers -- every\xa0stage of New York history\xa0had some brush with the land (or water) that is now 31 Desbrosses.\xa0 Alec was transfixed, and this funny, fascinating conversation is the result. | Six years ago the Board of the Manhattan School of Music faced a daunting decision: who would guide the school\xa0into its second century?\xa0 They turned to someone with a long history with the school, James Gandre.\xa0 Gandre joined MSM as an administrative assistant in the mid-1980s and rose through the ranks.\xa0 But before then, he\'d been auditioning for gigs as a tenor with symphonies and choirs.\xa0 He continued to do so even after he began in administration.\xa0 He tells Alec about his journey from small-town Wisconsin, to\xa0being an out gay man in San Francisco in the early 80s, to his long rise through the ranks at MSM -- and he shares his thoughts on the future of his venerable institution. | Brian Lehrer is a unique figure in the public life of New York City.\xa0 Beyond hosting the city\'s defining daily talk show, he\'s our conscience and our conciliator.\xa0 When New Yorkers want a fair mayoral debate, they often call Brian.\xa0 When WNYC needed someone to help us process our own #metoo moment, we called Brian.\xa0 The\xa0Peabody Awards\xa0honored The Brian Lehrer Show\xa0for\xa0"reuniting the estranged terms \'civil\' and \'discourse.\'"\xa0 Of course, civil doesn\'t mean soft:\xa0 he can be unsparing in his interviews because, as he tells Alec, "there\'s plenty that pisses me off."\xa0 Alec is fan of -- and a regular caller on -- Brian\'s show, so who better to turn the tables?\xa0 Alec interviews Brian about his path to prominence, and the two discuss their shared love of radio, and of New York. | Alexander Acosta has resigned from his position as\xa0Secretary of Labor in the Trump administration.\xa0 That\'s because of the sweetheart deal he cut politically connected financier Jeffrey Epstein back in 2008, when Acosta was a federal prosecutor.\xa0 In the swirl of news following Epstein\'s re-arrest, but before the Acosta resignation, Julie Brown\xa0stepped out of Acosta\'s press conference to speak to Alec on the phone.\xa0 We learn her reaction and that of Epstein\'s victims who called her up after the arrest.\xa0 That conversation is at the end of\xa0an extended cut of their live conversation at the Greene Space this spring and a phone call from Alan Dershowitz addressing the accusations made against him. | Corey Johnson wants to be the next mayor of New York, and the press seems to think he will be.\xa0 His\xa0plan to fix transit\xa0is the centerpiece of his platform.\xa0 Tom Wright is the CEO of the powerful Regional Plan Association.\xa0 That organization imagines\xa0the future and comes up with ideas for infrastructure and bureaucracy that could meet\xa0its needs.\xa0 Nicole Gelinas, a reporter and a Manhattan Institute scholar of Urban Economics, also believes in big, innovative projects.\xa0 But for\xa0the past 15 years,\xa0she\'s been reminding New Yorkers that\xa0we will not get a transit system worthy of our great city if we cannot get costs under control, and our financial house in order.\xa0 Combine these three experts with Alec\'s\xa0curiosity and strong opinions about all things New York, and you get a great conversation about congestion pricing, organized labor, the MTA, and\xa0future of transportation everywhere.', 'chan_desc': 'From WNYC Studios, award-winning actor Alec Baldwin takes listeners into the lives of artists, policy makers and performers.
