CANtrolls is a company focused on using CAN interface hardware to make engine swaps easier… but it goes way beyond that! Vadim taught himself to program at age 13 and has since worked on medical devices, oil rigs (doing CAN-based Networking) and most recently with Zero Avia an electric aviation startup. Vadim is a standout in the automotive aftermarket for his ability to get things done. I know him personally to be an ambitious self-starter so I thought we could all learn what makes him tick, and maybe he’ll teach us some things along the way. | Reid has been very busy lately managing several businesses. He still has KSTuned which is the Honda racing side and then has Kaizen Speed for the domestic cars. But his new venture is a weatherproof. solid-state relay that can handle heavy current and is interconnectable. This makes it very easy to daisy chain additional relays without having to run more power wires. He also made it so that you can attach a CAN control module as an option. This gives the customer the ability to keep it very simple or more complex with the CAN module. Reid has entered the relay into the 2019 SEMA Launch Pad Competition presented by the Young Executive Network. Reid needs your votes to move onto the finals. So, follow this link and go vote!

He really didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life and began messing with cars and going autocrossing. He worked a short stent helping at a friend’s shop and then got a job at PFC Brakes doing sales and technical support. This job took him all over the world supporting various racing platforms. His next job was at OG Racing selling safety gear and brakes. He was also making custom seat inserts for race teams. He began working with Elan (makers of the NP01) making seats and started looking at the extrusion they had for their wing. Eventually, they gave him one and he did some testing against a typical carbon wing. Turns out, the Elan profile added several MPH down the back straight and in turns at Road Atlanta. Right then, he knew he had something that works. He made a kit for the BMW M3’s and started making wings for all different vehicles. Now he has 7 people and they help all sorts of teams with the aero needs. On top of creating wing kits, Nine Lives Racing can also do CFD analysis and provide information and parts to complete the aero package. | Jonny Mill grew up in a small town in California and moved to LA as soon as he graduated high school. He worked at a talent recruiter and had various jobs in the entertainment industry with advertising and marketing. He always enjoyed cars, but things really took off when he developed The E-Stopp (an electronic parking brake). It was intended for handicap vans but soon found an amazing niche in the automotive restoration market. He was approached by Bryan Harrison of SEMA to compete in the first SEMA Launch Pad competition and took first place. After that, he started an innovation company and then began doing marketing/advertising for various TV shows and networks. He recently took a position at WheelWell.com where users can showcase their car builds. It has grown to an online hangout for car enthusiasts to share reviews, link to all the products used in their build, and even facilitate selling their vehicle. WheelWell’s latest push is their marketplace which allows users to purchase the parts they see on the user’s build. They have even introduced a “mod score” which rewards users for generating their own content and provides discounts in the marketplace. To check out all the builds, or even add your own ride, check out WheelWell.com | Charlie Eklund moved down to Houston, TX to attend Tuner School in 2017. The people at Hennessey Performance saw something special in Charlie and offered him a job in the admissions department for the school. Since then, Charlie has been the face of Tuner School to narrow down the applicants and help them get jobs after graduation. To further help them out, Charlie helps students find part time jobs while taking classes and they even offer a house where the students can rent a room and not have to worry about furniture. John Hennessey started Tuner School because he was getting multiple inquiries on how to work on cars and tune them. So, he just decided to meet that specific need and develop a curriculum with various industry experts. The classes are capped at 15 students to focus on providing the best education possible. | Richard Tomlin owns a paint, restoration, and fabrication shop south of Houston, Texas called\xa0Apex Auto Works. He made a name for his shop by building cages for Spec Miatas and was cranking out one a week. The shop is located on the way to a road course so he catered to the weekend racers and was able to do anything they wanted from complex fab work to paint and body.\xa0 He recently embarked on a new venture by developing an absorbent powder called\xa0White Pony Dry. It is far superior to kitty litter at quickly soaking up spills so that you can clean up and get back to work.\xa0 | Bob grew up working on Fords by building engines and going drag racing. He got turned on to the Buick Grand National and became obsessed with going faster! After some frustration with trying to fine tune their setups, Bob decided to start diving into the actual electronic tuning. This opened a whole new world of going faster and picked up a bunch time at the drag strip. He had a couple computer businesses and a shop but was always helping people tune. So, he decided to make it a real business in 2007. The demand for their services kept growing and they focused efforts on the teaching side. They offer online courses and in-person teaching. They also provide support to past students to make sure they can be successful in tuning whatever platform they choose. They currently rent a 5,000 sq ft facility in Florida and have 15 people on site and around the world. They specialize in teaching students how to use a particular tuning software and give their students experience in tuning a stock car, basic bolt ons, and forced induction. This gives the students real world experience on the platform they want to tune. Be sure to check them out at car shows and trade shows as they look for helping more individuals and businesses learn to tune! | Dave grew up in Austin and has lived there his whole life. During middle school, he played in a punk rock band (look up The Snobs – Schools Out, Let’s Skate) in the early 2000’s. They organized a tour on the east coast and recorded a couple 7” records. While touring and playing shows, he got turned on to street racing. Having no affinity to school, he dropped out of High School and decided he wanted to play music and race rally cars. After some coaxing, he convinced his dad to “invest” in an Integra Type R rally car. Eventually, Dave decided that this was his future and started instructing others on how to drive a rally car. There have been a lot of hiccups and various partners, but he has finally settled down and got things figured out. He now leases 140 acres outside of Austin and holds various types of classes. He has 1, 2, and 3-day classes, personal training, and group events. And there are various types of vehicles including FWD Hyundai’s, side-by-sides, Evo’s and STI’s, and even Ford Raptor events. Dave runs the place on his own but has about a dozen instructors who help when needed. | Dan lived in a house of car enthusiasts in southern California. Both his dad and grandfather owned their own businesses, so Dan was kind of groomed to have his own business as well. In high school, Dan bought a 1968 Mustang Fastback and spent 2 years restoring it with his dad. Once they finished it, Dan went out and took some “professional” pictures of the car, wrote an article, and sent it to every magazine he could find. He was able to get this car featured in some magazines and even on a few covers! Being a true entrepreneur and knowing what he wanted to do, he took classes in journalism and photography, so he could create better content. Purely by chance, his neighbor ran a business that had several small niche magazines that included a couple car magazines. Dan took the job there during college and worked his way up the ladder to become the editor. He worked at several other publishing jobs in cars and tech. He started to see an opportunity with the new social media growth in the mid 2000’s. So, he pitched a large proposal to his boss to begin changing how they do marketing and focus on the new social side. Well, things didn’t go to plan, so he made the calculated risk to go out on his own and do it himself! \xa0\xa0 Since 2008, Kahn Media has grown from his spare bedroom to a 7000 square foot office space and 20 plus people. They offer a full suite of marketing and PR and can cater the package to fit your needs and budget. | Joe grew up in Oregon and stayed there through college and went to Oregon Tech for Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Business. He never really saw himself owning his own business, so he spent several years working for other companies as an engineer. He spent all his extra time playing with and modifying offroad trucks. He soon realized that he could take a pretty good tax write off if he created a business to research, develop, and sell various parts he was making. In 2008, he made a simple web page and began making wheel centers to utilize the Hummer H1 wheels on other vehicles. 2 years later, he was shopping around for a tube bender and couldn’t find anything he could afford that he liked. So, he decided to make one himself! He slowly transitioned out of a full-time job by moving to part time contracting. This allowed him to ramp up Rogue Fabrication while tapering down the time at his other job. He continued to do consulting part time until finally doing his manufacturing business full time. They continue to bring more operations in house and currently employ 6 people. Their product focus is for chassis fabrication tools that include the tube bender, notcher, dimple dies, drill press reduction kit, and a press brake for taco gussets.', 'chan_desc': "DO IT FOR A LIVING is a podcast where YOU, the performance racing industry enthusiast and shop owner can hear from the best minds in the performance racing industry talking about business and tech.

Every year around this time Luke goes full out NERD on the NHRA Sportsman. | KC Pesnell broke the internet.\xa0 So, we had to talk about the 14-year-old who won $50,000!\xa0 In that discussion, Luke and Jed debated whether KC (or any 14-year-old) should be driving a 140+ mph dragster alongside grown men and women at the highest level of our sport.\xa0 In addition, Jed put his reporter hat on and broke some news about the situation.\xa0 It\'s as much of a "must listen" podcast as we\'ve ever published!\xa0Once we wrapped up our thoughts on that situation, we brought on Rex Simmermaker, host of the “Fast Brackets Podcast”on the eve of the first U.S. Nationals featuring the two fastest pure sportsman categories: Top Dragster and Top Sportsman.\xa0 | Jed sits down with Stephen “Champ” McCrory, they talk about Champs history in the sport, his accomplishments, and how he feels about the direction the sport is going. \xa0\xa0 | Luke and Jed return for an entertaining and slightly “off” regular episode, featuring a discussion about house cars, and their opinions concerning them. JJ’s Top 10 (15) returns with July’s picks, and some light results talk. \xa0 | On this week’s interview Jed gets to dive into Mia Tedesco’s head and find out about her start into drag racing and what keeps her going week after week. Faith and family are vitally important to Tedesco. She began drag racing when she was 8 at Pittsburgh Raceway Park (renamed Keystone Raceway Park), a track owned by her father Michael Tedesco. It was her Uncle Carmen who convinced his niece to grab a helmet and fire suit and to get behind the wheel of a race car. A lifelong drag racing fanatic, Uncle Carmen was Mia\'s biggest fan until his passing in 2015. | Luke gets to dive into the Andy Schmall racing world.', 'chan_desc': "Are you a sportsman drag racer or fan?

He headed into college knowing he wanted to work in engineering but was not sure what. He added his Bachelor in Business later so he could know how to be a better brand manager. Kevin mentioned that the brand manager position is like being at the center of a wheel where all of the aspects of a brand radiate out and the manager is facilitating the connections making sure everyone communicates.Classic cars have always been an extension of ones personality and the current line of muscle cars is no different. Kevin noticed that many people make their twitter handles or email addresses a description of their car and think that owners love and identify with their vehicles on a basic level. Dodge is working hard to keep the personal choices coming with eye catching colors like GoMango or Plum Crazy and performance options like the Hellcat and wide body packages.   | This weeks show is with Jordan Zlotoff, the Chief Executive Officer of the M1 Concourse in Pontiac Michigan. Perhaps just a few years ago not many people had heard of the M1. Today however, times have changed! Thanks to a multiple great events and it\'s strategic placement near the automotive capital of the world, the M1 is gaining international attention. We were onsite at the recent (and massive) Roadkill nights event there as mentioned in Episode 403. Jordan is leading the way on the high visibility of this fantastic place and I wanted to find out more about it.   | This weeks show is with WyoTech President and CEO Jim Mathis along with the VP of Admissions Troy Chaney. Founded in Laramie in 1966, WyoTech provides concentrated training programs\xa0 such as Automotive Technology, Collision Refinishing Technology, Diesel Technology, Interior, Restoration and performance, and other areas as well. Jim is a graduate of WyoTech and previously held the office of President up until 2002. Wyotech has changed ownership over the years, but Jim was able to purchase the school just a few years ago and returned back into family owned hands. He intends to keep it that way. For those that have ever considered attending an automotive trade program this will be a MUST LISTEN TO interview.   | This weeks show is with Dan Cheveralls, an engineer at a tools company and a fellow Dukes of Hazzard fan. His experience as a product development engineer brought him into the fold of using 3D printing for the development and evaluation of new products, and he has successfully integrated this into his personal life by creating "one-off" parts for his own restoration projects. Since the viability of 3D printing has been a common question as of late I asked him on the show to share the process!On this edition of Ask Rick we dug into the\xa0opposite side of the 3D "one off" discussion and jumped full bore into the process, timeline, and (frankly) large expense of mass market restoration part manufacturing! I wanted to know about some of the intricacies surrounding the creation and sourcing of a new part.   | In this weeks show we sent The MuscleCar Place staff writer Scott Stap to Pontiac, Michigan to attend the amazing Roadkill Nights event, presented by Dodge! Listen in for feature interviews with Kevin Hellman (Dodge Brand Manager), John Hammer (Dodge Experiential Manager), and Roadkill\'s own David Freiburger & Mike Finnegan!   | This weeks show is with Cody Young, owner and operator of Cody Crafted specialty shop. Cody grew up with a passion for cars and speed, which led him into racing and building race cars. He traveled around and did some wrenching or sales as well as stand in racing for some teams. After years of living life in the fast lane, it was time to settle down and pick a reliable job to support his family. Cody started working in a dealership and after a few years there, he realized that the Saturday hours were causing him to miss his boys growing up. His realization that life was slipping through his fingers, he knew it was time to start his own business so he could call the shots. After working in a fab shop, to learn how to do the work, he started Cody Crafted and is able to spend time with family while still building vehicles that fire his passion.Check out Episode 359 where I talked to Jeff Teel from Holley regarding the Terminator Stealth fuel injection system. This system looks like the old school Holley carb just like what was used on the General Lee. I have been talking about installing this injection system since even before the Kibbe Lee was purchased. Cody, being the consummate listener, noticed that I had a lot going on and he thought that this is his time to step up and lend a hand. He has installed a few different injection systems in various cars and trucks and knew that he could help out with a little expertise. I greatly appreciate the offer to help and thought I should have him on the show to learn more about CodyCrafted.If you would like to know more about Cody and what CodyCrafted can do for you, check out his page at CodyCrafted.com or on Instagram.com/codycrafted. You can keep up with the latest happenings on Facebook.com/CodyCrafted.   | This weeks episode features a full show dedicated to a catch up on e-mails as well as our popular "Ask Rick" segment to discuss the two best things in car life: road trips, and buying cars on road trips!That led to the discussion of purchasing two of his dream cars as well; his \'67 GTO and his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. In the case of the Boss, it was his lifelong dream car. He had a feeling that prices were only going up so he borrowed some cash from his sister and put the deal together. Listen in to find out how prophetic that decision was....for both the GTO and the Boss!   | This weeks show features the return of Jeff Allison, Owner and operator of Allison Customs, Airline Pilot, and You Tube sensation. I asked Jeff to be on the show as a fitting tribute as to how far the show (and Jeff) have come in the last 400 episodes. Back in episode 72 (Feb 2011) I announced that the Chevelle was going to be built and that Jeff had offered to build it for me. Since then it has not only been an amazing experience with the car but a fun journey with a great friend.\xa0For a long time Jeff Allison ran a construction company as his main source of income and flew airplanes as a side business and had dreams of owning a hot rod shop. Jeff eventually moved up to captain and dropped building houses but now had time to work on cars as the side job. He said that eventually he wants to retire from flying and go full time in the custom business. The automotive jobs he takes are never rush jobs and the customers understand that it may take awhile since this is not the main source of income.Jeff Allison, Scott Bowers, Rob Kibbe, in the Ron Francis BoothAs a car enthusiast, Jeff liked to fill his down time with automotive information and The Muscle Car Place became one of his main sources of entertainment. In January of 2011 Jeff offered to help bring my Chevelle dreams to life and so began a great friendship. The build was featured start to finish on The Muscle Car Place and over the next four years it went from mostly rust to a stunning SEMA show car that attracted attention for TMCP and Allison Customs as well as Ron Francis Wiring who hosted the car in their booth. Today I use the Chevelle as intended as an autocross car and it attracts attention where ever I drive it.   | This week our guest was Seth Withers, our brand new sales director for The MuscleCar Place Network of shows. After ten years of building our network shows the shows to an amazing level of production and content, I knew that to achieve our goal of "big time" it would require a full time Sales Sales Director to place over the entire network. This person had to have a sales track record, be a real car guy or gal already, be a fit with out existing team, and (most importantly) be a true believer in our podast network already. As always, I asked my existing listeners for help....and Seth was the fit we needed. He is a long time listener of both The MuscleCar Place and the Kibbe and Friends show\xa0and he is anxious to start working with the team.\xa0He began a few months ago and we\'re now going public with it!Pro-Touring Update with Larry Callahan: Good Guys Columbus and Des Moines results, APOLLO Astronaut Corvette\'s, and the never ending saga of his \'68 Camaro!   | Happy 4th of July, 2019!

More details soon! 😍😃👍🏻  A post shared by Overland History (@overland_history) on May 17, 2018 at 5:48pm PDT   | On session 9 of the Overland Roundtable, we discuss a topic that we have all dealt with but maybe not given much though; when to change plans. \xa0There frequently comes a time during an adventure that we have to make a decision. \xa0We can either act sensibly or push on and conquer\xa0whatever lies in front of us. \xa0Pushing on can be the first idea in a string of bad decisions. \xa0The Overland Roundtable panel gets together to discuss their lessons learned, give some recommendations, and share some stories surrounding the tales of when we altered course...or should have.  We mentioned some other links that you might find helpful or interesting. \xa0  Brandon mentioned using the Garmin maps to identify public vs private land. \xa0A blog post from Garmin regarding their mapping that would serve this purpose can be found here. Dan mentioned onXmaps as a cross platform mapping product that can also help differentiate\xa0public and private land. \xa0This may have been mentioned on a past session by someone in the audience, but its worth mentioning again. Brandon also mentioned a book titled Beetle Drive\xa0by Fiona Easterby as inspiration to get out and explore using whatever means you have available. \xa0   \xa0 Our guest panelist this session is Jason Hamasu ("J" on here since Jason Spect is on the show) from Outlaw Xpedition Overland (OX Overland, formerly Oregon Trail Overland). \xa0Jason and his team just recently finished their adventure that retraced the Oregon Trail from finish to start; a trip that was more than two years in the making. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0    \xa0 Flashback 3 years ago, almost to the day. This is where it all began. Jays #f150 and my other #fordranger. It\'s been a long crazy road thus far: from the team changing, to different rigs, bearing a New Name with a New Purpose. What started off as two kids skateboarding and pushing against the grain, has become two brothers planning and executing these Historic expeditions in contrast to what "Overlanding" really is. We are Purpose driven. The goal is as much The destination as it is the Journey. Somehow we found a way to push against this grain as well....And we\'re proud of our path and where it has led us. Thanks to ALL OF YOU who support our craziness.

Entire industries have been built around its consumption, and the engines, parts, and repairs that power our machines in the direction of the future.

After waiting years to prepare we finally did a full review of the 2005 Dukes of Hazzard movie. This was a $50Million dollar big screen production of our favorite TV show, featuring our favorite car doing the best big screen performance any car has ever performed, ever (we\'re looking your way, Bullitt).

He completes restorations to concours level. Donnie has worked on pretty much every Ferrari model made including 512 BBs, 365 2+2s, TDFs, James Coburn’s California Spyder, and many, many others.

In 2010, Cameron attended an apprentice-style program at the Nicholas G. Hayek Watchmaking School in Miami with a Swiss curriculum. The ten years of passion drove him to fine-tune his designs and goals before launching Weiss watches in June 2013.
