CANtrolls is a company focused on using CAN interface hardware to make engine swaps easier… but it goes way beyond that! Vadim taught himself to program at age 13 and has since worked on medical devices, oil rigs (doing CAN-based Networking) and most recently with Zero Avia an electric aviation startup. Vadim is a standout in the automotive aftermarket for his ability to get things done. I know him personally to be an ambitious self-starter so I thought we could all learn what makes him tick, and maybe he’ll teach us some things along the way. | Reid has been very busy lately managing several businesses. He still has KSTuned which is the Honda racing side and then has Kaizen Speed for the domestic cars. But his new venture is a weatherproof. solid-state relay that can handle heavy current and is interconnectable. This makes it very easy to daisy chain additional relays without having to run more power wires. He also made it so that you can attach a CAN control module as an option. This gives the customer the ability to keep it very simple or more complex with the CAN module. Reid has entered the relay into the 2019 SEMA Launch Pad Competition presented by the Young Executive Network. Reid needs your votes to move onto the finals. So, follow this link and go vote!

He really didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life and began messing with cars and going autocrossing. He worked a short stent helping at a friend’s shop and then got a job at PFC Brakes doing sales and technical support. This job took him all over the world supporting various racing platforms. His next job was at OG Racing selling safety gear and brakes. He was also making custom seat inserts for race teams. He began working with Elan (makers of the NP01) making seats and started looking at the extrusion they had for their wing. Eventually, they gave him one and he did some testing against a typical carbon wing. Turns out, the Elan profile added several MPH down the back straight and in turns at Road Atlanta. Right then, he knew he had something that works. He made a kit for the BMW M3’s and started making wings for all different vehicles. Now he has 7 people and they help all sorts of teams with the aero needs. On top of creating wing kits, Nine Lives Racing can also do CFD analysis and provide information and parts to complete the aero package. | Jonny Mill grew up in a small town in California and moved to LA as soon as he graduated high school. He worked at a talent recruiter and had various jobs in the entertainment industry with advertising and marketing. He always enjoyed cars, but things really took off when he developed The E-Stopp (an electronic parking brake). It was intended for handicap vans but soon found an amazing niche in the automotive restoration market. He was approached by Bryan Harrison of SEMA to compete in the first SEMA Launch Pad competition and took first place. After that, he started an innovation company and then began doing marketing/advertising for various TV shows and networks. He recently took a position at WheelWell.com where users can showcase their car builds. It has grown to an online hangout for car enthusiasts to share reviews, link to all the products used in their build, and even facilitate selling their vehicle. WheelWell’s latest push is their marketplace which allows users to purchase the parts they see on the user’s build. They have even introduced a “mod score” which rewards users for generating their own content and provides discounts in the marketplace. To check out all the builds, or even add your own ride, check out WheelWell.com | Charlie Eklund moved down to Houston, TX to attend Tuner School in 2017. The people at Hennessey Performance saw something special in Charlie and offered him a job in the admissions department for the school. Since then, Charlie has been the face of Tuner School to narrow down the applicants and help them get jobs after graduation. To further help them out, Charlie helps students find part time jobs while taking classes and they even offer a house where the students can rent a room and not have to worry about furniture. John Hennessey started Tuner School because he was getting multiple inquiries on how to work on cars and tune them. So, he just decided to meet that specific need and develop a curriculum with various industry experts. The classes are capped at 15 students to focus on providing the best education possible. | Richard Tomlin owns a paint, restoration, and fabrication shop south of Houston, Texas called\xa0Apex Auto Works. He made a name for his shop by building cages for Spec Miatas and was cranking out one a week. The shop is located on the way to a road course so he catered to the weekend racers and was able to do anything they wanted from complex fab work to paint and body.\xa0 He recently embarked on a new venture by developing an absorbent powder called\xa0White Pony Dry. It is far superior to kitty litter at quickly soaking up spills so that you can clean up and get back to work.\xa0 | Bob grew up working on Fords by building engines and going drag racing. He got turned on to the Buick Grand National and became obsessed with going faster! After some frustration with trying to fine tune their setups, Bob decided to start diving into the actual electronic tuning. This opened a whole new world of going faster and picked up a bunch time at the drag strip. He had a couple computer businesses and a shop but was always helping people tune. So, he decided to make it a real business in 2007. The demand for their services kept growing and they focused efforts on the teaching side. They offer online courses and in-person teaching. They also provide support to past students to make sure they can be successful in tuning whatever platform they choose. They currently rent a 5,000 sq ft facility in Florida and have 15 people on site and around the world. They specialize in teaching students how to use a particular tuning software and give their students experience in tuning a stock car, basic bolt ons, and forced induction. This gives the students real world experience on the platform they want to tune. Be sure to check them out at car shows and trade shows as they look for helping more individuals and businesses learn to tune! | Dave grew up in Austin and has lived there his whole life. During middle school, he played in a punk rock band (look up The Snobs – Schools Out, Let’s Skate) in the early 2000’s. They organized a tour on the east coast and recorded a couple 7” records. While touring and playing shows, he got turned on to street racing. Having no affinity to school, he dropped out of High School and decided he wanted to play music and race rally cars. After some coaxing, he convinced his dad to “invest” in an Integra Type R rally car. Eventually, Dave decided that this was his future and started instructing others on how to drive a rally car. There have been a lot of hiccups and various partners, but he has finally settled down and got things figured out. He now leases 140 acres outside of Austin and holds various types of classes. He has 1, 2, and 3-day classes, personal training, and group events. And there are various types of vehicles including FWD Hyundai’s, side-by-sides, Evo’s and STI’s, and even Ford Raptor events. Dave runs the place on his own but has about a dozen instructors who help when needed. | Dan lived in a house of car enthusiasts in southern California. Both his dad and grandfather owned their own businesses, so Dan was kind of groomed to have his own business as well. In high school, Dan bought a 1968 Mustang Fastback and spent 2 years restoring it with his dad. Once they finished it, Dan went out and took some “professional” pictures of the car, wrote an article, and sent it to every magazine he could find. He was able to get this car featured in some magazines and even on a few covers! Being a true entrepreneur and knowing what he wanted to do, he took classes in journalism and photography, so he could create better content. Purely by chance, his neighbor ran a business that had several small niche magazines that included a couple car magazines. Dan took the job there during college and worked his way up the ladder to become the editor. He worked at several other publishing jobs in cars and tech. He started to see an opportunity with the new social media growth in the mid 2000’s. So, he pitched a large proposal to his boss to begin changing how they do marketing and focus on the new social side. Well, things didn’t go to plan, so he made the calculated risk to go out on his own and do it himself! \xa0\xa0 Since 2008, Kahn Media has grown from his spare bedroom to a 7000 square foot office space and 20 plus people. They offer a full suite of marketing and PR and can cater the package to fit your needs and budget. | Joe grew up in Oregon and stayed there through college and went to Oregon Tech for Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Business. He never really saw himself owning his own business, so he spent several years working for other companies as an engineer. He spent all his extra time playing with and modifying offroad trucks. He soon realized that he could take a pretty good tax write off if he created a business to research, develop, and sell various parts he was making. In 2008, he made a simple web page and began making wheel centers to utilize the Hummer H1 wheels on other vehicles. 2 years later, he was shopping around for a tube bender and couldn’t find anything he could afford that he liked. So, he decided to make one himself! He slowly transitioned out of a full-time job by moving to part time contracting. This allowed him to ramp up Rogue Fabrication while tapering down the time at his other job. He continued to do consulting part time until finally doing his manufacturing business full time. They continue to bring more operations in house and currently employ 6 people. Their product focus is for chassis fabrication tools that include the tube bender, notcher, dimple dies, drill press reduction kit, and a press brake for taco gussets.', 'chan_desc': "DO IT FOR A LIVING is a podcast where YOU, the performance racing industry enthusiast and shop owner can hear from the best minds in the performance racing industry talking about business and tech.

Every year around this time Luke goes full out NERD on the NHRA Sportsman. | KC Pesnell broke the internet.\xa0 So, we had to talk about the 14-year-old who won $50,000!\xa0 In that discussion, Luke and Jed debated whether KC (or any 14-year-old) should be driving a 140+ mph dragster alongside grown men and women at the highest level of our sport.\xa0 In addition, Jed put his reporter hat on and broke some news about the situation.\xa0 It\'s as much of a "must listen" podcast as we\'ve ever published!\xa0Once we wrapped up our thoughts on that situation, we brought on Rex Simmermaker, host of the “Fast Brackets Podcast”on the eve of the first U.S. Nationals featuring the two fastest pure sportsman categories: Top Dragster and Top Sportsman.\xa0 | Jed sits down with Stephen “Champ” McCrory, they talk about Champs history in the sport, his accomplishments, and how he feels about the direction the sport is going. \xa0\xa0 | Luke and Jed return for an entertaining and slightly “off” regular episode, featuring a discussion about house cars, and their opinions concerning them. JJ’s Top 10 (15) returns with July’s picks, and some light results talk. \xa0 | On this week’s interview Jed gets to dive into Mia Tedesco’s head and find out about her start into drag racing and what keeps her going week after week. Faith and family are vitally important to Tedesco. She began drag racing when she was 8 at Pittsburgh Raceway Park (renamed Keystone Raceway Park), a track owned by her father Michael Tedesco. It was her Uncle Carmen who convinced his niece to grab a helmet and fire suit and to get behind the wheel of a race car. A lifelong drag racing fanatic, Uncle Carmen was Mia\'s biggest fan until his passing in 2015. | Luke gets to dive into the Andy Schmall racing world.', 'chan_desc': "Are you a sportsman drag racer or fan?

He headed into college knowing he wanted to work in engineering but was not sure what. He added his Bachelor in Business later so he could know how to be a better brand manager. Kevin mentioned that the brand manager position is like being at the center of a wheel where all of the aspects of a brand radiate out and the manager is facilitating the connections making sure everyone communicates.Classic cars have always been an extension of ones personality and the current line of muscle cars is no different. Kevin noticed that many people make their twitter handles or email addresses a description of their car and think that owners love and identify with their vehicles on a basic level. Dodge is working hard to keep the personal choices coming with eye catching colors like GoMango or Plum Crazy and performance options like the Hellcat and wide body packages.   | This weeks show is with Jordan Zlotoff, the Chief Executive Officer of the M1 Concourse in Pontiac Michigan. Perhaps just a few years ago not many people had heard of the M1. Today however, times have changed! Thanks to a multiple great events and it\'s strategic placement near the automotive capital of the world, the M1 is gaining international attention. We were onsite at the recent (and massive) Roadkill nights event there as mentioned in Episode 403. Jordan is leading the way on the high visibility of this fantastic place and I wanted to find out more about it.   | This weeks show is with WyoTech President and CEO Jim Mathis along with the VP of Admissions Troy Chaney. Founded in Laramie in 1966, WyoTech provides concentrated training programs\xa0 such as Automotive Technology, Collision Refinishing Technology, Diesel Technology, Interior, Restoration and performance, and other areas as well. Jim is a graduate of WyoTech and previously held the office of President up until 2002. Wyotech has changed ownership over the years, but Jim was able to purchase the school just a few years ago and returned back into family owned hands. He intends to keep it that way. For those that have ever considered attending an automotive trade program this will be a MUST LISTEN TO interview.   | This weeks show is with Dan Cheveralls, an engineer at a tools company and a fellow Dukes of Hazzard fan. His experience as a product development engineer brought him into the fold of using 3D printing for the development and evaluation of new products, and he has successfully integrated this into his personal life by creating "one-off" parts for his own restoration projects. Since the viability of 3D printing has been a common question as of late I asked him on the show to share the process!On this edition of Ask Rick we dug into the\xa0opposite side of the 3D "one off" discussion and jumped full bore into the process, timeline, and (frankly) large expense of mass market restoration part manufacturing! I wanted to know about some of the intricacies surrounding the creation and sourcing of a new part.   | In this weeks show we sent The MuscleCar Place staff writer Scott Stap to Pontiac, Michigan to attend the amazing Roadkill Nights event, presented by Dodge! Listen in for feature interviews with Kevin Hellman (Dodge Brand Manager), John Hammer (Dodge Experiential Manager), and Roadkill\'s own David Freiburger & Mike Finnegan!   | This weeks show is with Cody Young, owner and operator of Cody Crafted specialty shop. Cody grew up with a passion for cars and speed, which led him into racing and building race cars. He traveled around and did some wrenching or sales as well as stand in racing for some teams. After years of living life in the fast lane, it was time to settle down and pick a reliable job to support his family. Cody started working in a dealership and after a few years there, he realized that the Saturday hours were causing him to miss his boys growing up. His realization that life was slipping through his fingers, he knew it was time to start his own business so he could call the shots. After working in a fab shop, to learn how to do the work, he started Cody Crafted and is able to spend time with family while still building vehicles that fire his passion.Check out Episode 359 where I talked to Jeff Teel from Holley regarding the Terminator Stealth fuel injection system. This system looks like the old school Holley carb just like what was used on the General Lee. I have been talking about installing this injection system since even before the Kibbe Lee was purchased. Cody, being the consummate listener, noticed that I had a lot going on and he thought that this is his time to step up and lend a hand. He has installed a few different injection systems in various cars and trucks and knew that he could help out with a little expertise. I greatly appreciate the offer to help and thought I should have him on the show to learn more about CodyCrafted.If you would like to know more about Cody and what CodyCrafted can do for you, check out his page at CodyCrafted.com or on Instagram.com/codycrafted. You can keep up with the latest happenings on Facebook.com/CodyCrafted.   | This weeks episode features a full show dedicated to a catch up on e-mails as well as our popular "Ask Rick" segment to discuss the two best things in car life: road trips, and buying cars on road trips!That led to the discussion of purchasing two of his dream cars as well; his \'67 GTO and his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. In the case of the Boss, it was his lifelong dream car. He had a feeling that prices were only going up so he borrowed some cash from his sister and put the deal together. Listen in to find out how prophetic that decision was....for both the GTO and the Boss!   | This weeks show features the return of Jeff Allison, Owner and operator of Allison Customs, Airline Pilot, and You Tube sensation. I asked Jeff to be on the show as a fitting tribute as to how far the show (and Jeff) have come in the last 400 episodes. Back in episode 72 (Feb 2011) I announced that the Chevelle was going to be built and that Jeff had offered to build it for me. Since then it has not only been an amazing experience with the car but a fun journey with a great friend.\xa0For a long time Jeff Allison ran a construction company as his main source of income and flew airplanes as a side business and had dreams of owning a hot rod shop. Jeff eventually moved up to captain and dropped building houses but now had time to work on cars as the side job. He said that eventually he wants to retire from flying and go full time in the custom business. The automotive jobs he takes are never rush jobs and the customers understand that it may take awhile since this is not the main source of income.Jeff Allison, Scott Bowers, Rob Kibbe, in the Ron Francis BoothAs a car enthusiast, Jeff liked to fill his down time with automotive information and The Muscle Car Place became one of his main sources of entertainment. In January of 2011 Jeff offered to help bring my Chevelle dreams to life and so began a great friendship. The build was featured start to finish on The Muscle Car Place and over the next four years it went from mostly rust to a stunning SEMA show car that attracted attention for TMCP and Allison Customs as well as Ron Francis Wiring who hosted the car in their booth. Today I use the Chevelle as intended as an autocross car and it attracts attention where ever I drive it.   | This week our guest was Seth Withers, our brand new sales director for The MuscleCar Place Network of shows. After ten years of building our network shows the shows to an amazing level of production and content, I knew that to achieve our goal of "big time" it would require a full time Sales Sales Director to place over the entire network. This person had to have a sales track record, be a real car guy or gal already, be a fit with out existing team, and (most importantly) be a true believer in our podast network already. As always, I asked my existing listeners for help....and Seth was the fit we needed. He is a long time listener of both The MuscleCar Place and the Kibbe and Friends show\xa0and he is anxious to start working with the team.\xa0He began a few months ago and we\'re now going public with it!Pro-Touring Update with Larry Callahan: Good Guys Columbus and Des Moines results, APOLLO Astronaut Corvette\'s, and the never ending saga of his \'68 Camaro!   | Happy 4th of July, 2019!

More details soon! 😍😃👍🏻  A post shared by Overland History (@overland_history) on May 17, 2018 at 5:48pm PDT   | On session 9 of the Overland Roundtable, we discuss a topic that we have all dealt with but maybe not given much though; when to change plans. \xa0There frequently comes a time during an adventure that we have to make a decision. \xa0We can either act sensibly or push on and conquer\xa0whatever lies in front of us. \xa0Pushing on can be the first idea in a string of bad decisions. \xa0The Overland Roundtable panel gets together to discuss their lessons learned, give some recommendations, and share some stories surrounding the tales of when we altered course...or should have.  We mentioned some other links that you might find helpful or interesting. \xa0  Brandon mentioned using the Garmin maps to identify public vs private land. \xa0A blog post from Garmin regarding their mapping that would serve this purpose can be found here. Dan mentioned onXmaps as a cross platform mapping product that can also help differentiate\xa0public and private land. \xa0This may have been mentioned on a past session by someone in the audience, but its worth mentioning again. Brandon also mentioned a book titled Beetle Drive\xa0by Fiona Easterby as inspiration to get out and explore using whatever means you have available. \xa0   \xa0 Our guest panelist this session is Jason Hamasu ("J" on here since Jason Spect is on the show) from Outlaw Xpedition Overland (OX Overland, formerly Oregon Trail Overland). \xa0Jason and his team just recently finished their adventure that retraced the Oregon Trail from finish to start; a trip that was more than two years in the making. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0    \xa0 Flashback 3 years ago, almost to the day. This is where it all began. Jays #f150 and my other #fordranger. It\'s been a long crazy road thus far: from the team changing, to different rigs, bearing a New Name with a New Purpose. What started off as two kids skateboarding and pushing against the grain, has become two brothers planning and executing these Historic expeditions in contrast to what "Overlanding" really is. We are Purpose driven. The goal is as much The destination as it is the Journey. Somehow we found a way to push against this grain as well....And we\'re proud of our path and where it has led us. Thanks to ALL OF YOU who support our craziness.

Entire industries have been built around its consumption, and the engines, parts, and repairs that power our machines in the direction of the future.

After waiting years to prepare we finally did a full review of the 2005 Dukes of Hazzard movie. This was a $50Million dollar big screen production of our favorite TV show, featuring our favorite car doing the best big screen performance any car has ever performed, ever (we\'re looking your way, Bullitt).

He completes restorations to concours level. Donnie has worked on pretty much every Ferrari model made including 512 BBs, 365 2+2s, TDFs, James Coburn’s California Spyder, and many, many others.

In 2010, Cameron attended an apprentice-style program at the Nicholas G. Hayek Watchmaking School in Miami with a Swiss curriculum. The ten years of passion drove him to fine-tune his designs and goals before launching Weiss watches in June 2013.

Racing was on the upswing and new tracks were being built all across the U.S. Imported cars from Europe and Japan were flooding the market, designers were pushing limits and drivers were looking for an opportunity to race for more than just a trophy. Into this void stepped John Bishop with a fledgling organization called IMSA that offered competitive, professional racing in a friendly atmosphere and carried a new message: Racing with a Difference.The Inside Story Now ToldIn this behind the scenes book, Mitch Bishop and Mark Raffauf tell the inside story of how IMSA became a global powerhouse in just a few short years. It covers John Bishops early life, his years at the SCCA and tells the story of how IMSA grew from humble beginnings in 1969 into the Camel GT Series, a circuit that became the most popular form of professional sports car racing in the world. Interviews with many of the top drivers, team owners, car builders and others from the era helped shape this book, which also includes hundreds of never-before-published photos. The first twenty years of IMSAs history deliver fascinating stories of vision, innovation, common sense leadership and overcoming personal tragedy. Bishop and IMSA left\xa0an enormous imprint on the racing world and changed thousands of lives. This book is a must-read, for those interested in how it all happened\xa0and\xa0in learning critical management lessons\xa0still\xa0applicable in todays motor racing world.

Dating back to his teens in the 1970\'s where he became an integral part of the organization during its GT glory days, he went on to become the key person behind IMSA’s GTP era before shifting his attention to Grand-Am, and today, the relationship continues with his leadership role in the new IMSA championship | Our Time at the Wheel is Done?! Driving will become illegal, as human drivers will be demonstrably more dangerous than cars that pilot themselves. Is this an impossible future, or a revolution just around the corner?Sam Schwartz, "Gridlock Sam," America\'s most celebrated transportation expert, describes in his book about the revolution in self-driving cars. The ramifications will be dramatic, and the transition will be far from seamless. It will overturn the job market for the one in seven Americans who work in the trucking industry. It will cause us to grapple with new ethical dilemmas, if a car will hit a person or a building, endangering the lives of its passengers, who will decide what it does? It will further erode our privacy, since the vehicle can relay our location at any moment. And, like every other computer-controlled device, it can be vulnerable to hacking.Right now, every major car maker here and abroad is working on bringing autonomous vehicles to consumers. The fleets are getting ready to roll and nothing will ever be the same, and this book shows us what the future has in store.Who is "Gridlock Sam"?A well chosen name for Sam Schwartz, who has nearly 40 years of experience in the field of transportation engineering and traffic safety and is considered a worldwide authority in traffic, highway, bridge, transit and parking systems.As the former New York City traffic commissioner at the New York City Department of Transportation, he was responsible for an 8,000-person agency, $350 million expense budget and a $700 million capital budget.

Then, at just 9 years of age, he experienced a life altering event: he went for a ride in his first Ferrari, a 1960 Rosso Chiaro 250 SWB to be exact. Wayne was instantly bitten by the Ferrari bug and hooked for life. Automobiles have been Wayne\'s passion ever since.Wayne learned the art of Ferrari restoration from his mentor Francois Sicard -- a former Ferrari racing mechanic and widely considered to be the foremost Ferrari expert on the East Coast -- and his good friend Luigi Chinetti Jr., whose father Luigi Chinetti Sr. won the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans race for Ferrari and opened the first Ferrari dealership in the country.Chasing Classic CarsWith an emphasis and talent for Ferrari early on, Wayne has built a career of seeking out some of the worlds most rare vehicles of a by gone era, giving way to preservation and beauty for all to enjoy, and of course to buy!His lifetime of experience in automobile restoration under his belt, master car restorer Wayne Carini has a resume that includes body and paint work on rare car collections owned by the likes of David Letterman, tennis great Ivan Lendl and the DuPont family.Then comes Chasing Classic Cars, a U.S. television documentary series presented by Wayne, who owns F-40 Motorsports, who looks at classic cars from all eras, focusing on finding and getting cars running, with the option of restoration and a likely sale. The series shows the restoration and auction process, and not all projects are financially successful. It has featured cars which have not previously been shown in public for decades.Pay It ForwardWayne is also involved in and regularly attends many different car clubs and events to get young people involved in the car collector hobby. He believes that without young people\'s involvement, the car collector tradition will disappear. His latest passion is convincing families with special needs children to consider placing collector cars into a special needs trust with the hope that the cars will benefit the children in the future. | Journalist\'s Passion Leads to High Profile Digital PlatformA motor racing broadcaster, commentator and journalist, Will Buxton has had the rare pleasure of turning his great passion into something resembling work for the better part of 20 years.

His wife Jennifer, has saved more than $54,000 by making the same decision, thus together they’ve saved $200,000. They are completely debt-free, and within another year or two, they\'re going to pay cash for a house.How did they do it? By going car free. They occasionally rent cars and frequently ride in cars, they just don\'t own one -- the fixed costs are too high.There are many benefits to living car free, and the financial windfall is at the top of the list. According to the American Automobile Association, the average cost of car ownership is $8,400 a year -- over $700 per month. Keep in mind that you pay for your car in after-tax dollars. So a $700 monthly car cost eats up approximately $1,000 in salary. Every month.How would you like to boost your income by one thousand dollars a month without a side hustle and without having to beg your boss for a raise? What could you do with that money? Lots of things. Pay off debt, like credit cards or student loans. Save it. Invest it. Buy an appreciating asset like a house or rental property. Buy Bitcoins if you\'re feeling sassy. Travel. Save for a child’s college. Or even pay off your mortgage and retire early. Serious question: how would you like to be debt free and have six figures of cash in the bank -- without doing any extra work?THE CAR FREE LIFESTYLEWhen you go car free not only will you save a boatload of cash, you’ll also reduce your stress level, lose weight, improve your health, live longer, retire sooner, and do your part to help fight climate change.When Chris first got rid of his car, he was a TV News anchor in St. Louis, Missouri. Within a few months of bicycle commuting to work he lost 25 pounds and saw his abs for the first time in years. Even though he was eating as much as he wanted. It’s all possible with one smart lifestyle choice… going car free. You will still ride in cars and rent them occasionally, you just won\'t own one.

Lots of improvements on my toy.An email exchange that leads to the invitation on the show:Hello Doug,I've been a car guy for as long as I've been able to walk.The Mustang story started about 20 years ago. From a business associate that I had known for 15 years. I did most of the interior work, and put the car in the garage, covered for over 10 years.  Years of business took over my time.  Before my 69th birthday, I decided to get into putting it back on the road. In the meantime I donated a ‘64 T-bird to the AACA in Hershey, PA. The rest of the story involves spending money and finding qualified shops to work with. I'm not done yet, have an appointment to install a custom dash pad that has two gauges molded into the center. Please give me a call to talk about my 68 Mustang GT Fastback.Here’s what David and I talk about today:Why the fascination with Mustangs?Tell me a little about the find.Tell me a little about your story to find a Mustang.

Such as how much his confidence changes after a strong run at a track that he was expecting to be a struggle (Richmond); if it’s disappointing to be putting together such a strong season and only have one win; why he feels like his team has been more competitive with the ‘Big 3’ lately but what they are still searching for. Briscoe has a very interesting racing background that includes his grandfather and father being race car drivers, so he explains how he grew up at racetracks and what went into convincing his parents that he wanted to race; the four-year gap between his first race and the next time Briscoe got behind the wheel; the uphill battle of expenses and equipment during his sprint car career and whether Briscoe felt he had to work harder because of those variables; the reasons why Briscoe felt he knew what to do when he finally got behind the wheel after years of just watching racing. Why make the switch and come to NASCAR? Moving to North Carolina out of high school, competing in a stock car dream challenge, working in the Cunningham shop and getting some ARCA starts and how he landed a full-time championship season. Which drivers have a better adjustment – dirt to asphalt or vice versa? Recalling the first time he got behind the wheel of a stock car; how much Briscoe is still learning and adjusting to stock cars and the Xfinity Series; being bitten by racing too nice and if he’s going to have to change that; trying to get better at the NASCAR lingo to communicate with his team; where he feels his strengths are and what would be a considered successful season for Briscoe when it’s done?

Muscle Car Of The Week Video #21: 1970 Dodge Super Bee 440 6-PackThis 1970 Dodge Super Bee is not the car you want to drive if you don\'t like attention.   This Top Banana Yellow example from the Brothers Collection is not only visibly noticeable thanks to the bright color and white interior and stripes, but the 440 6-Pack Pistol Grip under the hood causes a stir on the street anywhere you go!4. Muscle Car Of The Week Video #69:  1969 Hurst / OldsBack before 1970, GM had a mandate that limited the engine cubic inch displacements in midsize "A" body cars like the Chevelle, GTO, and Cutlass 442 to 400 cubic inches.   However, George Hurst and Doc Watson were able to create a special version of the Olds 442 that broke the mold, and allowed for an Olds 455 to be installed and sold through Oldsmobile dealers.   Called the Hurst / Olds, these cars came to be in 1968, and by 1969, they were widely known for their outlandish styling, fully-loaded option list, and excellent performance.    This example from the Brothers Collection is an unrestored survivor, an original car that was driven often... the way Hurst would have wanted!3. 1969 Camaro Vs. 1969 Mustang: Muscle Car Of The Week Episode 266 V8TVWhich would you pick, the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS396 with the 375 HP L89 aluminum head big-block and a 4-speed Muncie transmission, or the 335 HP 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 428 Super Cobra Jet 4-speed?   Tough choices for sure, especially with these two fine examples from The Brothers Collection!2. 2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350R: Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 229 V8TVThe original GT350 hit the streets… and tracks… in 1965 and is still regarded as one of the most capable American performance cars ever built.     The ‘65 was a no-nonsense purpose built street legal racer in a Mustang 2+2 body comprised of hand-picked parts and smart modifications made by the Shelby team in Venice, CA.    It was light, nimble, and basic, and it rocked on the street or track.   The Shelby name has since been applied to just about everything you can think of, and there is no doubt that some Shelbys remained more true to the original concept than others, but the 2016 GT350R is one hundred percent deserving of the snake and stripes.    From The Brothers Collection.1. Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode # 179:  1967 Shelby GT500 427 Side OilerThe ‘65 and ‘66 Shelby Mustangs were very successful cars, but Shelby upped the stakes for ‘67 by introducing a big-block version of the GT cars with the GT500.    However, this one takes it up another notch with a 427 "side-oiler" V8.

We think it’s cool that some seriously high performance versions slipped out, like this ‘70 built with a 429 Super Cobra Jet and a Drag Pack!What was intended to be a utilitarian, personalized pick-em-up truck, sometimes ended up being the hottest car on the street.    And while high-performance Rancheros were nothing new in 1970, as evidenced by the factory 312 supercharged ‘57 Ranchburner we showed in episode 15, or the blue ‘68 Cobra Jet from episode 79,  this one is probably the highest of the hi-po Rancheros.1970 Rancheros are largely similar to Torinos, save for the bed box in place of a set of doors or a fastback roofline.     Up front, they all share the same sheet metal and suspension, so it only makes sense that the hottest Torino performance engines fits right in.    In this case, we’re looking at the 385 series 429 Super Cobra Jet, in all of it’s Ram Air and Drag Pak glory.The “super” part of the package actually starts out back, with a 3.91 or 4.30 rear gear.   These cogs ended up spinning the engine faster at high speed, so Ford beefed up those versions with a 4-bolt block, forged 11.3:1 compression pistons, bigger valves, a solid-lifter camshaft, and a Holley carb breathing through the functional Cobra Jet shaker scoop.    The giveaway is the finned oil cooler mounted on the radiator core support, which helped keep 429s guts happy at high RPM.    The result is a factory rating of 375 HP and 450 lbs. ft. of torque, all going through the toploader 4 speed and up in tire smoke out back.The 429 Super Cobra Jet engine is one of the coolest looking plants of the era, with aluminum finned valve covers and the sinister finned shaker scoop, and it all plays into the sharp styling of the ‘70 Ranchero GT.   Ours is dipped in Dark Ivy Green and the full-width eggcrate grille awakens to reveal hidden headlights.     The lines are crisp, with a set of gills on the lower quarters just below GT emblems, and a discreet 429 badge down low on the fender.Styled steel wheels wrapped in raised white letter tires provide contact for the GT suspension, which added performance springs, shocks, and sway bar.   Front power disc brakes and power steering make it easier to handle for the driver.You’d better have your load strapped down tightly if you’re hauling the goods in this Super Cobra Jet Ranchero… or maybe wait until after work to go mop the streets with the competition.    Thanks for hanging out with us here in The Brothers Collection, we’ll try to find another cool car to share next time, on Muscle Car Of The Week.#Ford  #Ranchero  #musclecaroftheweekSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com1970 Ford Ranchero 429 Super Cobra Jet - Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 325 | 2 seats, 6 speeds, 10 cylinders, 645 HP, and one big - -  wing can only mean one thing… the Dodge Viper GTC / ACR American Club Racer edition.Yeah, the 2017 Dodge Viper is a sports car and not a Muscle Car, but we hope you don’t mind going along for the ride on this one.    2017 marked the end of a 25 year run for the 2-seat, 10 cylinder super coupe, even though it took a few years off along the way.    But Dodge didn’t just let the Viper slither off into obscurity when it came time to wrap up the program.  No, the 2017 models pack the most venom of any of the earlier snakes, spitting out 645 HP and 600 lb-ft. of twist from 512 cubic inches of aluminum V10.Viper GTC / ACRs are highly capable track cars, and a 2017 model holds the record with the fastest American street legal lap time on the Nurburgring in Germany, with a time of 7:01.3.  The ACR cars were built to be ready-to-race, and they lacked some of the accessories of their streetier counterparts, like no air conditioning or radio to save weight.   Body panels are carbon fibre, and the functional spoilers and splitters of the Extreme Aero package help generate 2000 lbs of downforce at speed.   This reduced the top speed to 177 MPH from 190 and change, but enhanced stickiness and stability like crazy.The GTC / ACR rides on a 4-wheel short / long arm suspension design suspended by coil springs and Bilstein 10-way adjustable shock absorbers.   ACR rear spring rates are more than double the regular Viper at 1300 lbs, the fronts are triple at 600 lbs.  Kumho Ecsta V720 P295/25R19 and 355/30ZR19 tires glue the Viper ACR to the streets.    Stopping is a serious ordeal with Brembo carbon ceramic matrix rotors grabbed by 6 and 4 piston calipers.    It all results in 0-60 times in the mid 3s, ¼ mile in the mid 11s,  and 60-0 in just 101 feet.We’ve talked about the “glory days” of Muscle Cars when you could special order just about anything to end up with a “1 of 1” car of your own.   Well believe it or not, that philosophy applies to the GTC / ACR, with 8000 color choices, 16 interior trims, 10 wheel choices, and 24000 stripe options, you could totally spec your own.In fact, once a buyer chose the color, stripe, and option combination for their new ACR, that specific design was made exclusive, and no other Viper would be built the same way.One of the car review websites gave these awesome bullet points on the ACR:Ride quality is very stiffOutward visibility is poorFirm seats can be uncomfortable after timeEntry/exit is extremely difficult for drivers and passengersPoor fuel economy, even for a high-performance sports carSounds about perfect to us.Sadly, this 2017 Viper GTC / ACR represendts the last of the breed, but we’re happy it landed here in The Brothers Collection.   And not just because we got to play with it!   We hope you enjoyed this episode as much as we did, and we’ll see you next time on Muscle Car Of The Week! | 10 Top Traits of Mighty Mopar Muscle - Muscle Car Of The Week Episode 322We’ve compiled an unofficial top 10 list of Top Traits of Mighty Mopar Muscle… elements found on Dodge, Chrysler, and Plymouth Muscle Cars that make these cars super-cool.

Chevrolet’s entrant was the new for 1967 Camaro, aimed straight at the Ford Mustang, which had been the playground bully of Trans Am in ‘66.   Chevrolet was technically out of racing at this point, but Chevrolet Promotions Manager Vince Piggins worked closely with the SCCA before the car was available to make sure it would have a place in Trans Am.   The rulebook required 1000 streeters needed to be sold to remain legal, but Chevrolet was able to utilize a loophole to qualify 1967 SS350 Camaros in SCCA Group 1 as well as Z28s in Group 2.   The result was that only 602 ‘67 Z28s were sold.When the options were all put together into a package for retail sale, Chevrolet called it Regular Production Option or RPO code Z28, and the code name was cool enough for a car name, so.. it stuck!   RPO Z28 added performance goodies all over the car to improve handling, braking, and speed, while reducing luxury items to save weight.    That’s one of the reasons why this car is unique, as it has a bit of both personalities.Z28s were equipped with one of Chevrolet’s most famous V8s, the solid-cam 302 cubic inch V8.   Chevrolet didn’t have a V8 that fit within the 305 cube Trans AM limit, so they crossed a 327 4” bore block with the 3” stroke of a 283, upfitted it with 11:1 compression pistons and a high-lift cam, and whammo!   Instant high-revving small block fun that fit the rulebook.    They were rated at 290 HP, but most agree the high-flow intake and heads and heavy-breathing 800 CFM Holley carb were good for more than that.   Z/28s were all backed by a 4-speed Muncie transmission, and a 12-bolt rear axle out back for strength and traction, this one stuffed with 3.73:1 gears.Don’t let the small displacement 302 fool you, these 11:1 solid cam mighty mice spun to 7000 RPM making full use of the 4-speed and 3.73 gears.The power team isn’t the only piece of the Z/28 puzzle, as the car was the only Camaro to roll on 15” wheels, although they were only 6” wide.   They featured power disc brakes, and the suspension system was tuned with stiffer springs and shocks, and a traction bar system to help reduce rear wheel hop.     Although ‘67 Z/28s had to exterior badges, the dual hood and deck stripes were a dead giveaway as to what you were tangling with.1967 Camaro Z/28s are fascinating cars, and their production and sale allowed Chevrolet to compete in the Trans Am racing series.    They are loaded with smart part choices, and this one tops it all off with the Rally Sport option!The Rally Sport package adds style to the Z, and it consisted of hideaway headlights, and distinctive tail lights with the reverse lights mounted below the bumper.     Bright trim outlined the bottom of the car with wheel opening and rocker mouldings.     This one also features front and rear bumper guards, a black pinstripe, and a vinyl top… all of which contrast nicely against the Ermine White paint.Adding even more contrast is the deluxe blue interior, the center 4-speed console loaded with gauges, and a tilt steering wheel to hang on to in the turns.   A/C was out of the question on Z28s, as was an automatic trans, so this is a car you drove with both hands!It’s a stunning car for sure, and this one runs with all it’s born-with, numbers matching parts.   It may have been used in some Chevrolet promotional material, but there wasn’t much for the ‘67 Zs, which is partially why they didn’t sell that many.Love the sound of that solid-cam 302.  Letsee here… what can we bring out next time from The Brothers Collection?

Oh no, buddy.   The Cobra R was completely engineered with hand picked parts to be a great performer on the street or track.While the stock Mustang GT was powered by a 4.6 liter V8 and remained true to the same basic formula since it’s introduction, the 2000 SVT Cobra R represented the closest factory-built racer ever.    It used a special 5.4 liter V8 engine, a 6-speed manual transmission, and a parts catalog full of goodies to go fast, turn hard, and stop like a track car should.It didn’t look like your typical Mustang under the hood.    Air is sucked in through the hi-ram intake, compressed in the 5.4 liter engine by forged pistons, Carillo rods, and a forged crank.   High-flow 32 valve heads and shorty headers send the smoke down the pipes, leaving 385 HP in its wake.That 385 HP peaked at 5700 RPM, with it’s 385 lbs. ft torque rating coming in at 4250 RPM.Cylinder heads were Lincoln Navigator units, and the engine required a revised domed hood for clearance.A Tremec T-56 6-speed manual is the only transmission offering in the R, and the 3.55:1 rear gear spins the independent rear suspension… a first in a Mustang.    These cars were good for 0-60 times in the mid 4-second range, with the quarter mile flags waving in just 12.9 seconds with 110 MPH trap speeds.Cobra R drivers didn’t need or want luxury items weighing down their ride, so the Cobra R is fitted with necessities only.    You won’t find a high-powered stereo, air conditioning, or other fancy stuff inside; just the needed instrumentation and controls to rock the track.     The dash features a 180 MPH speedo and 8000 rpm tach, but interestingly, non-numbered gauges for temp, oil pressure, fuel, and volts.    I guess Ford figured you’d add a set of numbered gauges if you were serious about racing.    Recaro seats keep the driver’s keester in place when wheeling the R around the track, but the rear seat was ditched to save weight.The 2000 Cobra R sits low thanks to dropped Eibach springs and twist-resistant oversize sway bars, and Bilstein shocks and struts.   Adding to the outstanding handling is a 2000 Cobra R exclusive independent rear suspension… something standard Mustangs didn’t get until 2015.Cobra R’s rolled on 18x9.5” aluminum wheels wrapped in BF Goodrich g-ForceKD 265/40ZR-18 tires that were specially designed for the car.    Retina-detaching brakes were 13” vented rotors with 4-piston Brembo calipers up front, with 11.65” rear rotors out back.    Braking performance is a great match to the acceleration capabilities of the R.The rear spoiler is the obvious indicator of a Cobra R, but these cars have several other body mods as well.    We mentioned the Power Dome hood, and the lower front fascia is also unique to the Cobra R.   Side exhaust tips peek out of the Ford only built 300 2000 Cobra R’s, and this is one of the newest  remaining, with less than 2000 miles on the odometer.The wing might look a little extreme, but it has a purpose on this 170 MPH capable Cobra R.    Is this Cobra your speed?    Share your thoughts on this one or any of the cars here in The Brother’s Collection, we’re happy to hear ‘em.   Thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time!#CobraR  #MustangCobraR   #musclecaroftheweek2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R Muscle Car Of The Week Episode 319SUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com | By 1967, the baby boomers were starting to have families of their own, and big, full-size cars like Ford Galaxies were flying off the showroom floors by the hundreds of thousands.   Performance car enthusiasts now had a variety of smaller, powerful pony cars to choose from, like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro.    And while Ford offered high-performance versions of it’s full-size family cars for years, the sales numbers of the big-inch big cars was declining.   Our ‘67 Galaxie 500 XL is fitted with the 7-Litre Sports Package and hides a legendary V8 under the hood, and is one of only a handful and a half ever built.The 7-Litre Sport Package started with the 345 HP 428 cubic inch V8 as the cornerstone, available with an automatic or a 4-speed manual transmission.     However, this just one of 8 made with the R-code 427, a 425 HP specially built powerplant that sucked air and gas through 2 4-barrel carburetors, smashed the mixture in high compression heads, and blew out the smoke through header-like cast iron manifolds.    It wringed out nearly 500 ft. lbs of torque and sent it through the toploader 4-speed down to the 3.50 gear equipped rear axle, ready to launch this XL sized XL off the line with authority.The plush interior of this 7 Litre is like a high-speed rumpus room, all jazzed up with the XL series bucket seats and wood grain steering wheel, and more red landscape than the surface of mars.     Cool vertical wood grain inserts run up and down the door panels, and the long center console is capped with a spacy 4-place indicator light set.     There are surprisingly few gauges, but the curious speed redline still graces the speedometer.. it was a Ford thing of the mid ‘60s.   It’s a big, roomy, comfortable place to mash the gas and row the gears.The long, sleek lines of this swingin’ ‘60s luxo cruiser are highlighted by the fastback rear design, and how everything else leans forward, suggesting speed and power.   7-Litres rolled on wider steel wheels with mag-style caps snapped in place, and front disc brakes have the unenviable task of stopping the big ride.  Redline tires accent the bright red paint, their stripe echoed in the 7-Litre’s thin white pinstripe that runs the whole length of the car.    There are a few exterior badges, but nothing blatantly obvious like a billboard stripe to warn the others of a 427 lurking in their midst.Driving this car is an experience like few others, as the suspension is soft, and you can really feel the car’s size as you wheel it through the turns.   Lifting the clutch and stomping the gas creates a fore-aft rocking as the super 7 squats under the torque, and you better have a clear road head, because this car is going to own it.#7Litre  #427Galaxie   #musclecaroftheweek1967 Ford Galaxie 7-Litre R Code 427 Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 317 V8TVSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com | 1968 was the second year for the Pontiac Firebird, a car originally marketed to compete in the still fairly-new Pony car segment started by the insanely popular Ford Mustang.\xa0\xa0\xa0All the American OEs jumped on the bandwagon, and Pontiac’s Firebird was intended to be a bit more upscale to compete with other luxury pony car entries like the Mercury Cougar.\xa0\xa0\xa0The lesson here is that fast cars can look unassuming and still be potent performers!#PontiacFirebird #Firebird #MuscleCaroftheWeekSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.v8tvshow.com - 314.783.8325 -http://www.v8speedshop.comFACEBOOK PAGE:  https://www.facebook.com/V8TVshow/SHOP FACEBOOK PAGE: https://www.facebook.com/V8SpeedShop/http://www.musclecaroftheweek.com - | Some people consider the Chevrolet El Camino to be somewhat of a novelty item, especially in the SS versions.    Originally built as a competitor to Ford’s original “mini truck” - the Ranchero - the ElCamino served dutifully to those who needed a helping hand carrying small payloads but didn’t need , or want, a pickup regular pickup truck.   But this one is the real deal when it comes to performance, style, and yes… practicality!Chevrolet boasted about the ElCamino having stamina and style.. the perfect choice for “right now” people who need a versatile vehicle for work, recreation, and around-town errands.”    With a 1500 lb payload and over 6 feet of bed length with the tailgate down, an ElCamino is a hard worker.     Base models came with a 230 HP 6 cylinder engine, but that’s not why we’re here.    This is Muscle Car Of The Week for cryin’ out loud.To attract more buyers, Chevrolet adapted the SS trim and performance package from the Chevelle to the ElCamino, which now gave buyers a way to drive a high-powered muscle car nearly guilt free!   After all, it was a work vehicle, why not add a big block, 4-speed, and performance suspension?  Who says you shouldn\'t make your work environment a bit more fun?S1:  Doesn’t need a trailer..This particular ‘68 Elky SS is rocking the highest output 396 available, the RPO code L78 375 HP 396 backed by a Muncie 4-speed transmission.     L78 specs read more like a race engine than a work truck plant, with and 11.5:1 compression ratio and a solid lifter cam.   The cylinder heads featured oversized valves and large rectangular ports for heavy breathing, and a forged crank secured by 4-bolt main caps kept the special connecting rods swinging at high rpm.    Power was rated at 375hp at 5600 rpm and 415 lb-ft of torque at 3600 rpm.    A Muncie M22 4-speed and 12-bolt rear end equipped with 3.55:1 gears spin the wheels.  You’ll have no excuse to be late to the jobsite with one of these.The L78 package also included the F41 heavy-duty suspension, consisting of higher-rate coil springs and shocks matched to them, a larger front sway bar, and braced and boxed rear control arms to keep the 4-link rear suspension system for twisting into a ribbon under hard launches.   A rear sway bar was also part of the package, as were 14” rally wheels and F70-14” tires.The ElCamino SS has a great look, like it’s lazier, no-job-having brother, the Chevelle SS.    This one is finished in a sweet Seafrost Green with a black lower accent and black vinyl top.   We really dig the color contrast with the black, green, silver Rally wheels, and redline tires… it’s just enough of each color to play along without clashing.   The SS badges are present, along with the little 396 box on the marker light.   Subtle, for sure, but they’re there.    The tailgate frames a satin-black stripe, and Chevy fans know that black band means big-block lurks under the hood.    It’s a warning to those looking to pick on our little pickup on it’s way home from work.Inside, you’d never know you weren\'t in a Chevelle SS unless you looked in the rear view mirror.    It’s got all the goodies… strato bucket seats, wood wheel, full console, Hurst-shifted 4-speed, and the full gauge panel in the dash.    We love the drum-style tachometer.     Am tunes and a heater keep you company on the way to the jobsite… or drag strip!The exact production number of L78 ‘68 ElCaminos isn’t known, but a figure of 393 has been estimated.  We’re happy to see one in The Brothers Collection, and trust that it’s working days are over, but it’s definitely not retired.1968 Chevrolet ElCamino 396 SS Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 316 V8TV#musclecaroftheweek #ElCamino #SS396http://www.musclecaroftheweek.com -FACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/MuscleCarOfTheWeek/ | 1971 saw a completely new Dodge Charger.   Out was the long, sharp, boxy Charger and “in” was the new curvier model for ‘71.   The new design featured a more pronounced long nose / short deck look, and although it was about 2 inches shorter than the 68-70 model, it was also wider than it’s predecessor.    The design remains controversial, with the interestingly up-swept pillarless side window design and fastback-ish rear roofline.     A new bumper design split the nose in half, and our Charger Super Bee features a clean look with hidden headlights.You could order all kinds of engines in your 1971 Charger, but our featured Super Bee is fitted with the one everyone talks about… the 425 HP 426 Hemi V8, and it’s coupled to a 4-speed manual transmission.   And while a Hemi Orange ‘71 Super Bee with a 426 and a stick might be tops on any muscle car wish list, it’s the top of this one that makes it even more special.If you’ve never seen a factory installed power sunroof like this one, you’re not alone.   Chrysler didn’t sell very many of the nearly $500 options, which mandated the full vinyl top as well.    When you add in the code E74 426 Hemi engine at over $880.00, and you were looking at an expensive Super Bee back in ‘71 even before you start adding the rest of the options.   Which do you think had lower production, the Hemi or the Sun Roof?    We’ll answer that one later.But if you DID spring for all these goodies, you got one heck of a ride, man.    Ours features a sprawling white bench seat interior, complete with power windows, a 150 MPH speedo, 8000 RPM tach, and a pistol grip shifter for workin’ the 4-speed gearbox.    Looking out over the long hood is a trip from any angle, as the Ramcharger scoop comes to life letting the 2 Carter AFB 4-barrels fill the Hemi with air.    We’re envisioning a clear day, turning up the Music Master AM radio, hitting the power overhead switch to let the sun shine in, and dumping the clutch to let the 490 ft. lbs. of torque launch us straight into the 5th dimension.These cars drive really nicely when in this kind of condition.  Power steering and brakes ease the driver effort, and the heavy duty clutch is quite tolerable, even in traffic.   The famous Chrysler torsion bar front suspension is taught but comfortable, with a sway bar to keep things on the level in the turns, and the 15 inch rally wheels and Goodyear Polyglas GTs hold the road.    A Dana 60 rear axle can stand up to the torque as the leaf springs try to hold it in place.   These cars have some of the coolest exhaust tips ever… many call them Machine Gun tips, but the red and chrome ends are officially called “Exhaust Bright Tips”.    We call them awesome.This is a love it or hate it design, and we’re leaning towards the love it, especially drenched in Hemi Orange with the white vinyl top and blacked-out hood to break it all up.     The thin black stripe looks like the car just crossed the finish line with a black ribbon wrapped around the base of the windshield.   Dual painted racing mirrors look cool, too.All tolled, there were 5,054 1971 Super Bees built.   22 came equipped with the 426 Hemi engine, and only 9 of those were 4-speed manual cars.  Coincidentally, there were also 9 known power sunroof 1971 Super Bees built with any of the available engines.  But how many Hemi 4-speed cars had sunroofs?   I’m not sure, but this one in the Brothers Collection is the Super Bee’s Knees, for sure.#SunroofMopar  #HemiSuperBee   #musclecaroftheweek1971 Dodge Super Bee 426 Hemi Sunroof Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 314 V8TVSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com', 'chan_desc': "What is Muscle Car Of The Week?\n\nWe gained access to an amazing collection of prized, rare, sought-after American Muscle Cars, and the owners of this astounding lot of cars have allowed us to shoot video features of them.\n\nThe cars cover all makes of Muscle Cars, ranging from AAR Cudas to ZL-1 Corvettes, and each week, we will post a new video featuring one of these amazing cars from The Brothers Collection.

Benjamin drives the 2019 Subaru STI S209 on a race track to find out if it lives up to the hype. Meanwhile, Sami puts the 2019 Ford F-150 Platinum Diesel to work and realizes he might still prefer the revamped Ram. Finally, we take a deep dive into Jeremy Renner's private social media network controversy. | The 2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI really a Golf GTI with a trunk? VW would love to convince you that's true, but Benjamin isn't so sure after a week together with the car. Sami rediscovers the Mini Cooper S magic that he thinks makes the car something special in a very crowded slice of the new car market. | Friend of the show Chad Kirchner spends time in the 2020 Ford Mustang EcoBost High Performance Pack and comes back to tell Benjamin just how wrong he was about his instant dismissal of the turbocharged muscle car. Sami then leads a discussion on the Netflix show Hyperdrive, which is perhaps the first time someone has made a competitive driving program that doesn't completely suck. | Is the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata's new motor a worthy upgrade over the previous 4-cylinder? Benjamin certainly thinks so - to the point where it changes the entire character of the car for the better. Sami then dives deep into the 2020 Hyundai Palisade SUV and wonders how such a luxurious three-row hauler came to market without a Genesis badge. Finally, the pair pay their respects to Benjamin's Datsun engine, which died doing what it loved at Watkins Glen International Raceway this past week. Also - Porsche book contest winners! | Subaru's basic design language doesn't take any risks, and after driving the 2020 Subaru Legacy for the first time Sami kind of wishes it did so that more buyers might be tempted to take a chance on the brand instead of seeking out the more stylish competition. Benjamin sets sail in the 2019 BMW 750i xDrive across two-lane blacktop seeking county fair fun, and is surprised by the combo of performance and plushness offered by the massive four-door sedan. | Is the 2019 Volkswagen Golf R a hot hatch, or a 'stealth executive car?' Will Sami tolerate Benjamin's unabashed use of marketing speak to describe the turbocharged, all-wheel drive Golf, or will it end their friendship forever? Will Sami's time in the 2019 Subaru BRZ Raiu Edition make him paint his own BRZ 'Cool Khaki Grey?' The answers to these questions, plus a Porsche book giveaway and fun listener feedback on this week's episode. | How strong is the charisma of Steve McQueen that Ford is still making Bullitt Mustang tribute cars 50 years after the movie debuted? Sami dives deep into the 2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt and comes away impressed with its mix of style and performance. After a detour into the weird world of movie tie-in cars, Benjamin continues the discussion with the 2020 BMW M340i xDrive, the fastest non-M3 version of the 3 Series sedan ever built. Don't even bother trying to re-read that sentence. Finally, the pair answer a question from a listener about how each of them got started in the automotive writing business. | Is the 2019 Chevrolet Camaro Turbo worth of the 1LE road racing package? Benjamin spends a week with the entry-level car to find out. Meanwhile, Sami pits the 2019 Ford Ranger against the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 in a mid-size pickup battle that may have a surprising winner. | Is the world ready for a version of the Nissan GT-R that costs over $200,000? Guest Chad Kirchner explains why the NISMO makes sense - and who it makes sense to - after driving the automaker's most expensive sports car to date. Benjamin relates his experiences with the 2019 Mercedes-Benz G550, the first re-design of the boxy G-Class in decades, and argues with Sami about whether it truly has a place in this world. Finally, the three engage in a spirited debate about where, exactly, the 2019 Jeep Gladiator fits in the existing mid-size pickup truck hierarchy. | When a Japanese company pays for a Germany automaker to build its flagship sports car, and then lets it sell a more powerful roadster version of its own, Benjamin is there to try to make sense of it all. The 2020 BMW Z4 M40i turns out to be more impressive than inspected after a week together on the road. Sami follows up with a comparison test between the 2019 Toyota Corolla sedan versus the 2019 Hyundai Elantra sedan.

They can give compelling feedback to those automotive businesses.These are stories that car drivers can relate to because of their own experiences getting vehicle repair work done. Episode four of the Auto Shop Connection podcast shows how stories can connect automotive consumers to repair shops. Shared stories are compelling ways of engaging without offering offense in the process.In this episode I share one of my own stories about a brake pulsation problem on a 2003 Buick that was proving difficult for several repair shops to pinpoint.Why Share Auto Repair Stories?Stories have been used for thousands of years to communicate and connect people in a community. They are a compelling way to engage attention or touch the heart and mind of an individual.But how can a story bring about change in the auto repair industry. We all know from experience that confrontation is a common but oft ineffective way to bring about change.By relating a story about a repair shop experience we had and how it made us feel, we can connect with automotive repair professionals. It’s an effective and non-threatening way of planting seeds that suggest the value of change.By listening to vehicle owner stories shop owners and managers can choose to change or adapt policies and procedures in their company. Improvements that lead to happy customers will increase the frequency of them telling their family, friends, and co-workers.How Auto Shop Connection will Help Auto Owners Share Their StoryWhile every interview will be a little different, most auto owners will be ask to answer several questions designed to help listeners get to know them. Then they will respond to questions about:A memory relating to cars from your childhoodThe make, model, and cost of your first vehicleOther vehicles you’ve had over the yearsWhich vehicle was your favoriteWhat if any names you gave a carWhich vehicle do you wish you still hadWe will also ask questions relating to experiences with auto repair shops like:Which type of shop you use for your auto repair and maintenanceWhat most influences your reason for the type of shop you useDescribe an exceptional experience you’ve had at a shopAs you may remember from previous episodes, the goal of these interviews is to provide feedback for repair shop owners.Sharing can help improve the way shops do business and improve the services they provided their customers.My hope is that this information will help answer questions about the interview process. If you have auto repair stories you’re willing to share I look forward to the process of connecting with you.Where to Get More InformationView the full article relating to this episodeAuto Owner Story for sharing fond car memories from your past | An Automotive Podcast By Dave EastmanIn episode three we continue the introduction of the podcast goal of improving auto owner satisfaction with auto shop services.

From the prewar sports car, the 328, to the 3.0 CSL and the famous Art Cars in between—this was a true showcase of the maker\'s racing heritage and past accomplishments. Yet, in a world built for opulence and power, the direct opposite was on display at the 2016 Pebble Beach Concours d\'Elegance as a green, 1961 BMW Isetta Police Car complete with its own uniformed German police officer stole the show. We speak to its owner, Steven, who shares the Isetta\'s background with us and how he managed to execute the look of this beloved microcar.

The production value is high given the quality and the depth of data harvested for this accolade with bragging rights at stake.  So how does a week like this come together? Who\'s in attendance?  How does the Motor Trend team decide on the potential list of contenders?  What does performance testing actually consist of?  Lean in as we pull back the curtain to reveal the inner workings of this competition to find the most rewarding car to drive. | This week, we talk about the reintroduction of the legendary Italian roadster—the Fiat 124 Spider.

Muscle Car Of The Week Video #21: 1970 Dodge Super Bee 440 6-PackThis 1970 Dodge Super Bee is not the car you want to drive if you don\'t like attention.   This Top Banana Yellow example from the Brothers Collection is not only visibly noticeable thanks to the bright color and white interior and stripes, but the 440 6-Pack Pistol Grip under the hood causes a stir on the street anywhere you go!4. Muscle Car Of The Week Video #69:  1969 Hurst / Oldshttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com - Back before 1970, GM had a mandate that limited the engine cubic inch displacements in midsize "A" body cars like the Chevelle, GTO, and Cutlass 442 to 400 cubic inches.   However, George Hurst and Doc Watson were able to create a special version of the Olds 442 that broke the mold, and allowed for an Olds 455 to be installed and sold through Oldsmobile dealers.   Called the Hurst / Olds, these cars came to be in 1968, and by 1969, they were widely known for their outlandish styling, fully-loaded option list, and excellent performance.    This example from the Brothers Collection is an unrestored survivor, an original car that was driven often... the way Hurst would have wanted!3. 1969 Camaro Vs. 1969 Mustang: Muscle Car Of The Week Episode 266 V8TVWhich would you pick, the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS396 with the 375 HP L89 aluminum head big-block and a 4-speed Muncie transmission, or the 335 HP 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 428 Super Cobra Jet 4-speed?   Tough choices for sure, especially with these two fine examples from The Brothers Collection!2. 2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350R: Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 229 V8TVThe original GT350 hit the streets… and tracks… in 1965 and is still regarded as one of the most capable American performance cars ever built.     The ‘65 was a no-nonsense purpose built street legal racer in a Mustang 2+2 body comprised of hand-picked parts and smart modifications made by the Shelby team in Venice, CA.    It was light, nimble, and basic, and it rocked on the street or track.   The Shelby name has since been applied to just about everything you can think of, and there is no doubt that some Shelbys remained more true to the original concept than others, but the 2016 GT350R is one hundred percent deserving of the snake and stripes.

We think it’s cool that some seriously high performance versions slipped out, like this ‘70 built with a 429 Super Cobra Jet and a Drag Pack!What was intended to be a utilitarian, personalized pick-em-up truck, sometimes ended up being the hottest car on the street.    And while high-performance Rancheros were nothing new in 1970, as evidenced by the factory 312 supercharged ‘57 Ranchburner we showed in episode 15, or the blue ‘68 Cobra Jet from episode 79,  this one is probably the highest of the hi-po Rancheros.1970 Rancheros are largely similar to Torinos, save for the bed box in place of a set of doors or a fastback roofline.     Up front, they all share the same sheet metal and suspension, so it only makes sense that the hottest Torino performance engines fits right in.    In this case, we’re looking at the 385 series 429 Super Cobra Jet, in all of it’s Ram Air and Drag Pak glory.The “super” part of the package actually starts out back, with a 3.91 or 4.30 rear gear.   These cogs ended up spinning the engine faster at high speed, so Ford beefed up those versions with a 4-bolt block, forged 11.3:1 compression pistons, bigger valves, a solid-lifter camshaft, and a Holley carb breathing through the functional Cobra Jet shaker scoop.    The giveaway is the finned oil cooler mounted on the radiator core support, which helped keep 429s guts happy at high RPM.    The result is a factory rating of 375 HP and 450 lbs. ft. of torque, all going through the toploader 4 speed and up in tire smoke out back.The 429 Super Cobra Jet engine is one of the coolest looking plants of the era, with aluminum finned valve covers and the sinister finned shaker scoop, and it all plays into the sharp styling of the ‘70 Ranchero GT.   Ours is dipped in Dark Ivy Green and the full-width eggcrate grille awakens to reveal hidden headlights.     The lines are crisp, with a set of gills on the lower quarters just below GT emblems, and a discreet 429 badge down low on the fender.Styled steel wheels wrapped in raised white letter tires provide contact for the GT suspension, which added performance springs, shocks, and sway bar.   Front power disc brakes and power steering make it easier to handle for the driver.You’d better have your load strapped down tightly if you’re hauling the goods in this Super Cobra Jet Ranchero… or maybe wait until after work to go mop the streets with the competition.    Thanks for hanging out with us here in The Brothers Collection, we’ll try to find another cool car to share next time, on Muscle Car Of The Week.#Ford  #Ranchero  #musclecaroftheweekSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com1970 Ford Ranchero 429 Super Cobra Jet - Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 325FACEBOOK PAGE:  https://www.facebook.com/V8TVshow/SHOP FACEBOOK PAGE: https://www.facebook.com/V8SpeedShop/ | http://www.v8speedshop.com/contact - A look at a few Mopars (and a cousin AMC) here at the V8 Speed & Resto Shop! 1968 Plymouth Barracuda, 1974 Plymouth Road Runner, and a 1969 AMC AMX!Let us know if you need help with repairs, performance upgrades, or restoration of your classic or Muscle Car, we\'re happy to help!V8 Speed & Resto Shop314.783.8325Cool Mopars and an AMC AMX at the V8 Speed & Resto Shop After Hours Video | 2 seats, 6 speeds, 10 cylinders, 645 HP, and one big - -  wing can only mean one thing… the Dodge Viper GTC / ACR American Club Racer edition.Yeah, the 2017 Dodge Viper is a sports car and not a Muscle Car, but we hope you don’t mind going along for the ride on this one.    2017 marked the end of a 25 year run for the 2-seat, 10 cylinder super coupe, even though it took a few years off along the way.    But Dodge didn’t just let the Viper slither off into obscurity when it came time to wrap up the program.  No, the 2017 models pack the most venom of any of the earlier snakes, spitting out 645 HP and 600 lb-ft. of twist from 512 cubic inches of aluminum V10.Viper GTC / ACRs are highly capable track cars, and a 2017 model holds the record with the fastest American street legal lap time on the Nurburgring in Germany, with a time of 7:01.3.  The ACR cars were built to be ready-to-race, and they lacked some of the accessories of their streetier counterparts, like no air conditioning or radio to save weight.   Body panels are carbon fibre, and the functional spoilers and splitters of the Extreme Aero package help generate 2000 lbs of downforce at speed.   This reduced the top speed to 177 MPH from 190 and change, but enhanced stickiness and stability like crazy.The GTC / ACR rides on a 4-wheel short / long arm suspension design suspended by coil springs and Bilstein 10-way adjustable shock absorbers.   ACR rear spring rates are more than double the regular Viper at 1300 lbs, the fronts are triple at 600 lbs.  Kumho Ecsta V720 P295/25R19 and 355/30ZR19 tires glue the Viper ACR to the streets.    Stopping is a serious ordeal with Brembo carbon ceramic matrix rotors grabbed by 6 and 4 piston calipers.    It all results in 0-60 times in the mid 3s, ¼ mile in the mid 11s,  and 60-0 in just 101 feet.We’ve talked about the “glory days” of Muscle Cars when you could special order just about anything to end up with a “1 of 1” car of your own.   Well believe it or not, that philosophy applies to the GTC / ACR, with 8000 color choices, 16 interior trims, 10 wheel choices, and 24000 stripe options, you could totally spec your own.In fact, once a buyer chose the color, stripe, and option combination for their new ACR, that specific design was made exclusive, and no other Viper would be built the same way.One of the car review websites gave these awesome bullet points on the ACR:Ride quality is very stiffOutward visibility is poorFirm seats can be uncomfortable after timeEntry/exit is extremely difficult for drivers and passengersPoor fuel economy, even for a high-performance sports carSounds about perfect to us.Sadly, this 2017 Viper GTC / ACR represendts the last of the breed, but we’re happy it landed here in The Brothers Collection.   And not just because we got to play with it!   We hope you enjoyed this episode as much as we did, and we’ll see you next time on Muscle Car Of The Week!#Viper  #GTC/ACR   #musclecaroftheweekSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com2017 Dodge Viper GTC / ACR Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 323 | 10 Top Traits of Mighty Mopar Muscle - Muscle Car Of The Week Episode 322We’ve compiled an unofficial top 10 list of Top Traits of Mighty Mopar Muscle… elements found on Dodge, Chrysler, and Plymouth Muscle Cars that make these cars super-cool.

Chevrolet’s entrant was the new for 1967 Camaro, aimed straight at the Ford Mustang, which had been the playground bully of Trans Am in ‘66.   Chevrolet was technically out of racing at this point, but Chevrolet Promotions Manager Vince Piggins worked closely with the SCCA before the car was available to make sure it would have a place in Trans Am.   The rulebook required 1000 streeters needed to be sold to remain legal, but Chevrolet was able to utilize a loophole to qualify 1967 SS350 Camaros in SCCA Group 1 as well as Z28s in Group 2.   The result was that only 602 ‘67 Z28s were sold.When the options were all put together into a package for retail sale, Chevrolet called it Regular Production Option or RPO code Z28, and the code name was cool enough for a car name, so.. it stuck!   RPO Z28 added performance goodies all over the car to improve handling, braking, and speed, while reducing luxury items to save weight.    That’s one of the reasons why this car is unique, as it has a bit of both personalities.Z28s were equipped with one of Chevrolet’s most famous V8s, the solid-cam 302 cubic inch V8.   Chevrolet didn’t have a V8 that fit within the 305 cube Trans AM limit, so they crossed a 327 4” bore block with the 3” stroke of a 283, upfitted it with 11:1 compression pistons and a high-lift cam, and whammo!   Instant high-revving small block fun that fit the rulebook.    They were rated at 290 HP, but most agree the high-flow intake and heads and heavy-breathing 800 CFM Holley carb were good for more than that.   Z/28s were all backed by a 4-speed Muncie transmission, and a 12-bolt rear axle out back for strength and traction, this one stuffed with 3.73:1 gears.Don’t let the small displacement 302 fool you, these 11:1 solid cam mighty mice spun to 7000 RPM making full use of the 4-speed and 3.73 gears.The power team isn’t the only piece of the Z/28 puzzle, as the car was the only Camaro to roll on 15” wheels, although they were only 6” wide.   They featured power disc brakes, and the suspension system was tuned with stiffer springs and shocks, and a traction bar system to help reduce rear wheel hop.     Although ‘67 Z/28s had to exterior badges, the dual hood and deck stripes were a dead giveaway as to what you were tangling with.1967 Camaro Z/28s are fascinating cars, and their production and sale allowed Chevrolet to compete in the Trans Am racing series.    They are loaded with smart part choices, and this one tops it all off with the Rally Sport option!The Rally Sport package adds style to the Z, and it consisted of hideaway headlights, and distinctive tail lights with the reverse lights mounted below the bumper.     Bright trim outlined the bottom of the car with wheel opening and rocker mouldings.     This one also features front and rear bumper guards, a black pinstripe, and a vinyl top… all of which contrast nicely against the Ermine White paint.Adding even more contrast is the deluxe blue interior, the center 4-speed console loaded with gauges, and a tilt steering wheel to hang on to in the turns.   A/C was out of the question on Z28s, as was an automatic trans, so this is a car you drove with both hands!It’s a stunning car for sure, and this one runs with all it’s born-with, numbers matching parts.   It may have been used in some Chevrolet promotional material, but there wasn’t much for the ‘67 Zs, which is partially why they didn’t sell that many.Love the sound of that solid-cam 302.

Oh no, buddy.   The Cobra R was completely engineered with hand picked parts to be a great performer on the street or track.While the stock Mustang GT was powered by a 4.6 litre V8 and remained true to the same basic formula since it’s introduction, the 2000 SVT Cobra R represented the closest factory-built racer ever.    It used a special 5.4 litre V8 engine, a 6-speed manual transmission, and a parts catalog full of goodies to go fast, turn hard, and stop like a track car should.It didn’t look like your typical Mustang under the hood.    Air is sucked in through the hi-ram intake, compressed in the 5.4 liter engine by forged pistons, Carillo rods, and a forged crank.   High-flow 32 valve heads and shorty headers send the smoke down the pipes, leaving 385 HP in its wake.That 385 HP peaked at 5700 RPM, with it’s 385 lbs. ft torque rating coming in at 4250 RPM.Cylinder heads were Lincoln Navigator units, and the engine required a revised domed hood for clearance.A Tremec T-56 6-speed manual is the only transmission offering in the R, and the 3.55:1 rear gear spins the independent rear suspension… a first in a Mustang.    These cars were good for 0-60 times in the mid 4-second range, with the quarter mile flags waving in just 12.9 seconds with 110 MPH trap speeds.Cobra R drivers didn’t need or want luxury items weighing down their ride, so the Cobra R is fitted with necessities only.    You won’t find a high-powered stereo, air conditioning, or other fancy stuff inside; just the needed instrumentation and controls to rock the track.     The dash features a 180 MPH speedo and 8000 rpm tach, but interestingly, non-numbered gauges for temp, oil pressure, fuel, and volts.    I guess Ford figured you’d add a set of numbered gauges if you were serious about racing.    Recaro seats keep the driver’s keester in place when wheeling the R around the track, but the rear seat was ditched to save weight.The 2000 Cobra R sits low thanks to dropped Eibach springs and twist-resistant oversize sway bars, and Bilstein shocks and struts.   Adding to the outstanding handling is a 2000 Cobra R exclusive independent rear suspension… something standard Mustangs didn’t get until 2015.Cobra R’s rolled on 18x9.5” aluminum wheels wrapped in BF Goodrich g-ForceKD 265/40ZR-18 tires that were specially designed for the car.    Retina-detaching brakes were 13” vented rotors with 4-piston Brembo calipers up front, with 11.65” rear rotors out back.    Braking performance is a great match to the acceleration capabilities of the R.The rear spoiler is the obvious indicator of a Cobra R, but these cars have several other body mods as well.    We mentioned the Power Dome hood, and the lower front fascia is also unique to the Cobra R.   Side exhaust tips peek out of the Ford only built 300 2000 Cobra R’s, and this is one of the newest  remaining, with less than 2000 miles on the odometer.The wing might look a little extreme, but it has a purpose on this 170 MPH capable Cobra R.    Is this Cobra your speed?    Share your thoughts on this one or any of the cars here in The Brother’s Collection, we’re happy to hear ‘em.   Thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time!#CobraR  #MustangCobraR   #musclecaroftheweek2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R Muscle Car Of The Week Episode 319SUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com | By 1967, the baby boomers were starting to have families of their own, and big, full-size cars like Ford Galaxies were flying off the showroom floors by the hundreds of thousands.   Performance car enthusiasts now had a variety of smaller, powerful pony cars to choose from, like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro.    And while Ford offered high-performance versions of it’s full-size family cars for years, the sales numbers of the big-inch big cars was declining.   Our ‘67 Galaxie 500 XL is fitted with the 7-Litre Sports Package and hides a legendary V8 under the hood, and is one of only a handful and a half ever built.The 7-Litre Sport Package started with the 345 HP 428 cubic inch V8 as the cornerstone, available with an automatic or a 4-speed manual transmission.     However, this just one of 8 made with the R-code 427, a 425 HP specially built powerplant that sucked air and gas through 2 4-barrel carburetors, smashed the mixture in high compression heads, and blew out the smoke through header-like cast iron manifolds.    It wringed out nearly 500 ft. lbs of torque and sent it through the toploader 4-speed down to the 3.50 gear equipped rear axle, ready to launch this XL sized XL off the line with authority.The plush interior of this 7 Litre is like a high-speed rumpus room, all jazzed up with the XL series bucket seats and wood grain steering wheel, and more red landscape than the surface of mars.     Cool vertical wood grain inserts run up and down the door panels, and the long center console is capped with a spacy 4-place indicator light set.     There are surprisingly few gauges, but the curious speed redline still graces the speedometer.. it was a Ford thing of the mid ‘60s.   It’s a big, roomy, comfortable place to mash the gas and row the gears.The long, sleek lines of this swingin’ ‘60s luxo cruiser are highlighted by the fastback rear design, and how everything else leans forward, suggesting speed and power.   7-Litres rolled on wider steel wheels with mag-style caps snapped in place, and front disc brakes have the unenviable task of stopping the big ride.  Redline tires accent the bright red paint, their stripe echoed in the 7-Litre’s thin white pinstripe that runs the whole length of the car.    There are a few exterior badges, but nothing blatantly obvious like a billboard stripe to warn the others of a 427 lurking in their midst.Driving this car is an experience like few others, as the suspension is soft, and you can really feel the car’s size as you wheel it through the turns.   Lifting the clutch and stomping the gas creates a fore-aft rocking as the super 7 squats under the torque, and you better have a clear road head, because this car is going to own it.#7Litre  #427Galaxie   #musclecaroftheweek1967 Ford Galaxie 7-Litre R Code 427 Muscle Car Of The Week Video Episode 317 V8TVSUBSCRIBE:  https://goo.gl/RIkdDShttp://www.musclecaroftheweek.com', 'chan_desc': "http://www.v8speedshop.com - 314.783.8325 -  V8TV is a Muscle Car TV show shot on-location at our full-service restoration and performance center,  the V8 Speed & Resto Shop.

If you have not seen the Videos on YouTube or Facebook on the Build, Clyde is a 1972 Mazda Rx2 we swapped a Gen V L83 Direct Injected engine out of a 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500. The main goal of the build was to build a super reliable streetcar to take on Rocky Mountain Race Week. With only a few months remaining until the week long racecar road trip where we Drag Race the car at 4 Different tracks in a week Alex began helping me build the car! At this point I already had the Engine and Trans Mounted but the car still needed almost a complete build! We started with pulling the stock rear end and cleaning up the under side of the car to move on to finishing the engine install and modifying the front steering and swapping the front brakes out to convert the car to 5 Lug. After lots of work with getting the exhaust in the car and figuring out the cooling system the engine was mostly sitting in place. I had to re build the trans tunnel to fit the new 6l80e transmission. After the car was sealed back in we moved on to wiring the car with a new PSI conversion harness and trying to make it work with the factory body harness. During this time we were able to re assemble the new Ford 9in and get the car back to a roller! With 1000 small things still to do we were able to finish everything up just in time for Race Week!

Yes, automotive companies face steep competition from existing players and new entrants. They also need to walk a fine line balancing time and money spent on their existing IT infrastructure and future technology needs, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning and how to manage increasing amounts of data. The experts speak:  Rick Booms, Eventful Conferences: “Absorb what is useful, discard what is not, add what is uniquely your own” (Bruce Lee). Judy Cubiss, SAP: “Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes Turn and face the strange” (David Bowie).

While awareness of the competitive advantage of diversity is growing, McKinsey’s 2018 “Delivering on Diversity”  showed that although “gender and ethnic diversity are clearly correlated with profitability, women and minorities remain unrepresented.” This is especially true in automotive and manufacturing companies. Hopeful news: Daughters of Rosie “helps women get hands-on jobs where they can grow” in these industries. The experts speak. Danielle Applestone, Daughters of Rosie: “This being human is a guest house. Every morning is a new arrival…Welcome and entertain them all” (Rumi).

Fortune’s 100 Best Places to Work (2018) did NOT include any traditional automakers or automotive suppliers, while many technology and Silicon Valley-based companies ranked high. Surprised? With the growing integration of the automotive and tech industries, automotive needs to attract and retain qualified talent. But how? The experts speak. Kristin Dziczek, CAR: “You may be a business man…But you’re gonna have to serve somebody.” (Bob Dylan). Ellen Sasson, SAP: “You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough people get what they want” (Zig Ziglar).

Every generation has its own approach to work, consumption, technology, and life in general – and to automotive. To remain relevant and strong, the industry needs new approaches to attract, maintain, and develop the younger workforce – and to attract a new generation of buyers with very different interests. Are OEMs aligned with this shift? Our Gen X, Y, and Z panelists will discuss, confirm, and perhaps debunk stereotypes of each generation’s behaviors and relationship with automotive.

What will it take to turn customers into fanatics, products into obsessions, employees into ambassadors, brands into religions? The experts speak. David Mingle, Qualtrics: “I\'ve learned that people will forget what you said … [but] never forget how you made them feel” (Maya Angelou).

The auto industry is at a major crossroads.  Silicon Valley dominates in the use of consumer data. But the auto industry, as it is still producing vehicles, has the data. Creating new consumer and employee experiences is where automotive tech is headed today. What is the way forward for both new Silicon Valley automotive and traditional Detroit/Stuttgart auto manufacturing? The experts speak. Ashok SIvanand, Integral: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool” (Richard Feynman).

Reflecting on what they learned at the 2018 AASA Technology Conference, our panel will discuss opportunities in the automotive aftermarket and a new breed of aftermarket suppliers. The experts speak. Chris Gardner, AASA: “My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me” (Jim Valvano).

In the spirit of this newfound information, we’re taking a few minutes to fill in the people who are not techs on what it's like. First off, not everyone's experiences are the same but there are a lot of things that most of us have in common. Most mechanics get their start as youngsters, taking stuff apart and sometimes putting them back together. This then goes to bikes, and as we get older, cars. Then our parents get on our asses to get jobs or go to school, so many of us end up going to some kind of technical school. From there we get thrown into shops to learn the rest. The one big thing here though is that almost no one gives a fuck about you. We also spend a ton of time on our feet and throwing around very heavy car parts such as rims and tires, so bad backs are as common as the low pay. We also typically dress poorly and this causes a major image problem that people think we’re dumb. However, due to the incredible number of systems, physical properties, and manual dexterity that this job requires, very few of us actually are. However, none of us are perfect so comebacks happen to all of us.Also, Uncle Jimmy gives a review of all of the fluids in a car based on smell.

The laws of man, the laws of physics and even Murphy's law, which isn’t necessarily a real thing, but sometimes as a mechanic it feels just as real as the other two. The laws of physics are really kind of important to know as an automotive technician, because they are absolute. They happen 100% of the time. Things like pressure, heat causes things to expand, and the transfer of energy are something we deal with every day in brakes, air conditioning, and getting off bolts. The laws of man are much more subjective and subject to change. Often times the laws of physics and the laws of man come into direct contrast with one another, such as pedestrians having the right of way. Also, we talk about the enforcement of laws and their subjectiveness to the people enforcing them. Inspections, winter beaters, and what every states definition of speeding is are also on the docket.Also, Uncle Jimmy rebrands Heisenberg's Law of Entropic Uncertainty to be about your car, house, and dog.This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

From actual knowledge, personality, or sense of humor you are going to want to hire people that fit the environment that already exists in your shop. Now it’s not a secret that fewer and fewer people are entering this trade, and it’s not a coincidence that the attrition rates of these new guys is very high. However, if they are placed into shops that they are going to fit in, they might stay in the industry long enough to make it a career. Figuring out the knowledge of new techs is an important thing to do, but it might be best not to turn new hires directly onto your customers cars if they are untested and unproven. The real question here is, what would you want to know about a new mechanic hire BEFORE they get into the shop?Also Uncle Jimmy says another sentence that has probably never been spoken out loud: “taking the test as if you are Adolf Hitler and The Pope.”This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

As mechanics though, depending on where you work there is a lot of completely justifiable stuff to complain about: service advisors not selling easy work, bringing in cars that should be in a junkyard, terrible working conditions, low pay, disgusting shops, and the list goes on and on. The main difference between the people who are insufferable and the ones who are justified are how they approach the endgame: are they offering some sort of solution to their complaints? Pay complaints will always be fairly valid because of the wide gulf between shop rates and what the mechanic gets paid, but the fastest way to increase your pay, especially in this climate, is to Grease the Wheels.  Also, Uncle Jimmy says, “I’m not going to complain about complainers” about 4 times.This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

Some animals, like dogs, are welcome guests in our cars. Eventhough it usually ends up with dog hair strewn from one end of the car to the other, which makes the car smell like that dog. We’ve even seen evap cores full of dog hair, that was dyed bright green because of the dye tests that had been done. Other animals are less welcome in your car but find a way in anyways. Rodents can use a lot of the parts of a car either to eat or make a nest. Recently, they have been eating the wiring harnesses which are now made from soy based plastics. This means that it is basically just a golden corral for the mice, with 2-3 foot sections of wiring harness getting eaten regularly. One car Uncle Jimmy worked on went through 2 wiring harnesses in the course of a few weeks in the exact same places, and the owner was angry because it was like they hired the mouse to go eat the wiring harness the exact same way. We also have heard of snakes crawling into heater vents, thank god this one hasn't happened to us yet. Also we detail a massive woodchuck popping out of an engine bay causing the tech working on it to literally shit his pants. Also, Uncle Jimmy channels his inner Dr. Suess and also says a series of words that have probably never been uttered in the same sentence: “Cannibalistic ritual involving the sacrifice of a Subaru”This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

First off, not every shop has a foreman but some dealer’s brand’s demand that the shop have a foreman. From where we’re sitting, this makes a lot of sense because cars are getting more and more complex, with more models entering the lineup every single year. Foremen exist to help the other technicians with some of the more complex repairs they might have to face. Typically they are some of the most educated people in the service department. However, because of the fact that they do not flag hours like a typical technician, the accounting department already has it out for them. Because of this, often times they get all sorts of extra shit jobs heaped on top of their already somewhat difficult job descriptions. Because of this, a word of warning, if you want to be a foreman make sure you get all of your job responsibilities down in writing- because dealers secondary job descriptions often times create a slave like atmosphere even for this elevated position. Also, Uncle Jimmy goes absolutely nuclear on accountants. This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

Sometimes what people think is wrong is actually wrong, but most of the time people who think what is wrong are wrong themselves in their guess. Either way, there are hoping that it is going to be a cheap and easy repair: a $12 radiator hose versus a $1200 or $12000 engine. One of our personal favorites is when there are 2 or 3 different people telling you what's wrong with the car and they all have different guesses for the fix. At the root of this problem is the idea that people think it is easy to be a mechanic, and in this they are gravely wrong. Also, we talk about when customers complain about things that their car is doing that it is supposed to be doing, AKA features. We also take a short dive into the world of the phantom problems, the problems that go away the minute the car rolls into the shop. Finally, we go into the often lucrative and fun part of our jobs where we get to buy cars that the owner thinks is catastrophically broken, and its not. Also, Uncle Jimmy talks 429-Thunderbird-on-a-farm drivers ed and why he has an iPhone4 as an excuse to not answer the 99% of people who call him because they need him to fix their car.This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

In all professions, people get into certain grooves and want to do the same things because they have figured out the shortcuts and ways to make the job easier. This gets complicated in the automotive field though because they keep making different kinds of cars with different problems. However, it doesn't take long in some cases for people to figure out exactly what is going to go wrong on some models and figure out easy ways to fix them. Admittedly, it's easier to get into a rut when you’re at a dealership because typically you're working on one type of car. The best example of this is the early Saturn dealers when they had one car, 3 bodies, two engines, and two transmissions. However, does this make you a good mechanic? Life is short so don't spend your time in the rut. We opt for the option of challenging yourself to do something different. The rut can also extend to work that you specifically avoid, such as alignments in climates where rust isn’t just a fact of life, it often ends up being a seasoning on your lunch. Also, Uncle Jimmy talks about the person who was in the worst rut in automotive history, Henry Ford. This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

Cheap Box, better stuff- Toolheadz Crate: the only crate made for the listeners of GTW! | On this week’s episode of Grease The Wheels, we are talking about when customers come into the shop for free repairs, because the manufacturer didn't make something right. Sometimes they are service actions, sometimes they are full blown recalls, either way the customer isn’t going to be paying for it. Some techs hate recalls because they don't pay well, but other techs have found ways- through doing it so many times, to actually make money on them. Often times there are multiple open recalls on the same car. However, some of these repairs are being done on cars that are way out of warranty and long past the point where the owner is going to put any money into it, and it really shows. Good rule of thumb here is to just write up everything else that is wrong with the car on the 1 in a million chance that the owner is actually going to greenlight those repairs. Moreover, it's a great way to cover your ass in the event that there is some sort of catastrophic problem with the car right after you fix the free shit, so then you get to put the blame on the owner because they “just wanted the free stuff”.Also, Uncle Jimmy explores “the point of no fucks given”This episode of Grease the Wheels is sponsored by toolheadzcrate.com.

Cheap Box, better stuff- Toolheadz Crate: the only crate made for the listeners of GTW! | On this week's episode of GTW, we are talking about one of the internet's favorite punching bags: The Millennials. Now the first question that always comes up when it comes to Millennials and our industry is, “how come there aren't many millennial mechanics?” Well turns out, that's on us. When they ask what it's like to be a mechanic, we tell them about it warts and all and that sent them running for the hills. However, there are still some millennials that have gone into the automotive field, and these people are going to end up making bank as the supply of mechanics eventually dwindles to near nothing. So, in a roundabout way, we are saying that they are a fairly intelligent group of people, unfortunately for them, you still can't buy experience. When you're the only Millennial in town who can fix people’s cars, you get to charge whatever you want.

We also chat through the usual motorsport and motoring news, and discuss which cars we'd buy for £40,000. | It's Frankfurt motorshow week which means we've gone a bit in-depth on the new Land Rover Defender (and why, yes, it is important), the new VW ID 3 – which is shaping up to be one of the most important cars ever. Tim's also been to the Porsche Experience Centre to find out why your car control is probably not as good as you'd hope. At least his isn't.Support the show | Welcome back! In this episode we talk about the hottest news of the week, which is undoubtedly the fact that Bugatti's hit 305mph in the Chiron. We talk about how the car was modified to hit it.

Graduating with a degree in Sign Painting from Boston\'s Butera Art School in 1979, he would not work exclusively on bikes until after attending his first rally in Laconia, New Hampshire. It would become weekend event that would permanently change his life. It sparked what would eventually become a lifelong endeavor. Immersing himself in a decades long trek he would travel the motorcycle circuit as an artist until choosing to settle in the Pacific Northwest. In 1999 he opened his airbrush studio, Killer Paint, in Snohomish, Washington.After several successful collaborations with Chip Foose of Foose Design, Mike was introduced to a unique market of enthusiasts with an unquenchable appetite for fast rides and custom paint jobs. Sunny California was set ablaze when Mike\'s signature flame jobs burst onto the scene, instantly branding his technique a hot commodity. A friendship with Jesse James of West Coast Choppers landed Mike his first spot on television. Appearing as a guest artist on The Discovery Channel\'s, "Monster Garage," was an exciting experience. Mike attributes a significant portion of his success to both Chip Foose and Jesse James. Chip, in particular, has been a major component in the exposure of Mike’s distinctive TRUE FIRE technique.Since his appearances on Monster Garage, Mike, has since been honored to participate in TLC\'s wildly popular "Overhaulin\'" and "RIDES"; shows he credits for their publicity of his TRUE FIRE technique. Mike has poured over 25 years of his life into his artwork, making it his primary focus, second to none. It\'s been a journey from one end of the country to another, some times being far easier than others. Along the way he\'s touched lives, inspired awe, spread smiles and lived to the fullest. In Mike\'s words, “What more could you ask for?”ABOUT KILLER PAINT - The custom automotive industry has never been the same since Killer Paint has come onto the scene.

"I was watching the nightly news as they announced that 12 died this day and 7 that day", Kevyn said. "I woke up one morning and challenged myself to name just one person who has died for my freedom", he continued. "I couldn\'t."So Kevyn decided to do something about it. He started the Fueled By The Fallen, a 501(c)3 non-profit. Kevyn enlisted the expertise of Chuck Spiker, a lifelong drag racer and former National Go Kart Champion, to create a memorial that would get the attention of all Americans. "The reason we chose race cars is because you can get the attention of a two year and a ninety-two year old with one", Kevyn said. Chuck took a 1963 Nova and created a 10 second quarter mile door slammer drag car representing fallen Marines from Iraq and Afghanistan. "Maybe I can get people who look upon the race car to remember just one name. If I can do that, I have accomplished my mission", Kevyn continued.The determination was made that more cars are needed. The \'63 Marines Nova was already filled with 867 fallen Marines. Fueled By The Fallen acquired a Bickel chassis custom drag car with a fiberglass 1966 Nova shell to become the second Marines car.A second 1966 Chevy Nova was acquired to become the Navy car in 2008. As more people viewed the Memorial Race Cars, the need for the other branches became immediately apparent.A 1992 Ford Mustang LX "Fox Body" was acquired to represent the fallen Army soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, there is a second Army Mustang (\'93 GT 5.0) that is a parade car to increase the visibility of those Army Heroes whom have given the ultimate sacrifice.In April of 2010, the Air Force car was acquired. It is a 1970 Chrysler Challenger R/T featuring 99 fallen Air Force Heroes.In August of 2010, a Ford Anglia was acquired from Niagara Falls, NY. It is currently being built into the first in a series of "Allies" cars to represent those brave fallen Heroes from our friends across the globe.In 2009, Kevyn recognized the sacrifices of our brave public safety personnel by creating the National Law Enforcement Memorial Cruiser featuring over one thousand fallen peace officers from around the United States since September 11th, 2001.In August of 2010, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, in conjunction with Fueled By The Fallen, created the Los Angeles County Memorial Cruiser featuring 477 fallen peace officers from Los Angeles County since 1850.Fueled By The Fallen and J & B Motorsports, Pittsburgh, PA, collaborated on two nitro funny cars. One is a "Marines Dress Blues" Memorial car and the other is a "USS Enterprise Tribute" car. Today, those cars can be seen racing at drag tracks across the United States.fbtf.orgwww.facebook.com/FueledByTheFallen', 'chan_desc': 'BS Industries, Inc. is an award-winning Los Angeles based company that designs and builds Customs and Hot Rods of every conceivable form.

Then on Wednesday, August 28, the world learned of the death of Jessi Combs.\xa0As a friend of Jessi’s, Corey thought it would be a good idea to do a tribute episode to her which we recorded that afternoon as Episode number 31. You can hear Corey fighting back the waterworks while telling his stories about his amazing friend.\xa0Needless to say, that delayed the publishing of this episode until this week. So, while the timing of the conversation may be off, Corey & I still had a good time catching up on events, learning about the Chattanooga Choo Choo, how we expect Sheriff’s Jeep Fest to go, and sharing just how big the Smoky Mountain Jeep Invasion has become with this week’s guest, Justin Murray, organizer of the event.Justin shares with us how they revised a dead club, how “open top” fits into their bylaws, what the very first “Invasion” was like, why it seems it has taken on a life of it’s own, what his first and current Jeep is, why he finally broke down and bought a JL, and what he does in real life with Victorian mansions.\xa0And of course we have our Tech Tip of the Week… all about LEDs.You can find helpful links to many of the things we talk about in this episode in the show notes at ModernJeeperShow.com and make sure to check out ModernJeeperAdventures.com for our growing list of upcoming adventures that you hear us talk about.As always, ModernJeeper is extremely grateful to our supporters including Warn Winches, Raceline Wheels, Bestop, Milestar Tires, Rugged Radios and, of course, Metalcloak.So, sit back, relax with a cold one, and enjoy Episode number 32 of The ModernJeeper Show… \xa0 | Hello ModernJeepers, welcome to Episode Number 31 of The ModernJeeper Show… the show about Jeeps, Jeeping and Jeepers.This is a very special episode.

Back when ModernJeeper was just a nascent website and the idea of a podcast was just a whim, I interviewed several industry leaders while at the 2015 Off Road Expo in Pomona, California.Each interview was about 30 minutes long, and was conducted from a table at Metalcloak’s 20 x 30 booth right in the middle of the show and you can clearly hear all the action going on around us.In this Flashback Episode, we decided to interview one of Metalcloak’s top jobbers at the time and Texas’ top Jeep builders, Keith and Pauline Jones of Jones Jeep in Marble Falls, Texas. This was a unique interview because Keith and Pauline had just driven their JK’s 1300 miles from Texas to Off Road Expo in Southern California along with an entourage from the Crawler Crew customer club and we thought it would be cool to share their story and their passion.\xa0Keith and Pauline share how they went from being Jeep Builders to Trail Guides, how their shop in a small town of 6500 people attracts customer from all over the state, how they scored a property at the entrance of Hidden Falls Adventure Park to build their new shop, how building Jeeps for local officials can help business, what their favorite Jeep trail is (it’s not one you’ve probably heard of), what dolomite is and why tires like it, how to succeed in the Jeep build business by being selective in what you work on and the products you sell, and what 220 MPH feels like on a Texas drag strip.\xa0Even though this interview was done in 2015, Keith & Pauline are still going strong in the Jeep building business and are about to launch some new initiatives in the coming months. Keep an eye out for what comes next from this enterprising couple of ModernJeepers.\xa0You can find helpful links to many of the things we talk about in this episode in the show notes below...As always, ModernJeeper is extremely grateful to our supporters including Warn Winches, Raceline Wheels, Bestop, Milestar Tires, Rugged Radios and, of course, Metalcloak.So, sit back, relax with a cold one, and enjoy Episode number 27 of The ModernJeeper Show…Helpful Links…\xa0Jones JeepMarble Falls, TexasHidden Falls Adventure ParkThe Rubicon TrailMoabOff Road ExpoNHRA MuseumThe Worlds Fastest Indian6Pak ShocksDuroflex JointsMetalcloak JK SuspensionFrank Hawley’s Drag Racing SchoolDefinition of DolomiteMetalcloak True Dual Rate CoilssPod", 'chan_desc': "The Show about Jeeps, Jeeping and Jeepers, hosted by Metalcloak's Matson Breakey and Mr. ModernJeeper and industry insider, Corey Osborne.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/19/ed/69/19ed694a-975b-1f4f-d571-9f0acd9a472f/mza_8389056450925374019.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-01-25'}}

Darren is a partner with the Walsers in 6 collision centers in Minnesota. He talks about what it takes to stay current on all the changing technology in the industry and the challenge of hiring qualified body repair people leading to the eventual decision to \'grow his own\'. In the meantime, he try to sell a guest from the first hour on why he should trade his beloved Tacoma on a new one.

Alex recently accepted a sales position at Walser\'s Porsche dealership in Wichita. He\'s incredibly passionate about cars in general and Porsche in particular.

Rob currently does sales training and talks about what it was like starving to death in the winter while doing motor sports sales. Doug puts Tom to sleep with an in depth analysis of the effect of federally relaxed cafe standards and the large manufacturers that are circumventing that by dealing directly with the California CARB (clean air resource board).

The Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye comes straight from the factory with 797 horsepower. And it was just announced that the 2020 Ford Super Duty can tow up to 37,000 pounds thanks to a 6.7-liter diesel engine that produces over 1,000 pound-feet of torque. These monster motors beg the question: can you ever have too much power? Is there a point at which cars and trucks are being sold with more power than is safe for the average driver to handle? It’s a great question, and returning to the podcast this week are Writers Christopher Smith and Anthony Alaniz to help us answer it. | It’s Truck Week on Motor1.com, and not because we planned it that way. For whatever reason, there’s just a lot of truck stuff happening this week. The biggest thing is the Texas State Fair, which has become the place for truck makers to debut new editions and updates for their popular models. On this week’s episode we’ll talk about all the news coming out of the Texas State Fair, and then ask the big question: why are we Americans so obsessed with trucks? | This week John Neff talks to Patrick Calello, the founder and designer of Automoblox, the toy car company which sold beautiful heirloom-quality wooden cars which were as fun to play with as they were to look at. | The Frankfurt Motor Show happened this past week, and among all the new cars that were shown was one we just couldn’t stop staring at. It’s the BMW Concept 4, which is a two-door concept car that foreshadows what the redesigned 4 Series coupe will look like. We weren’t staring at it because it was so good looking, though. We stared because of its grille, which is a comically large version of BMW’s iconic twin kidney grille. This whole giant grille trend has finally jumped the shark, and we’ve got BMW to thank for it. | The all-electric Porsche Taycan super sedan is finally here, and like all new electric cars, comparisons between it and what Tesla’s selling have already started. The most obvious matchup for the Taycan is the Model S, so on today’s episode, each car is getting a champion in the form of a Motor1.com editor and we’re going to duke it out to discover if a superior EV can be crowned. John Neff plays the part of Tesla fan boy, which shouldn’t be too hard because he owns a Model 3. In the Taycan’s corner will be Managing Editor Brandon Turkus who is the only one among us who has seen in person what the Taycan can do. He came back from that experience a changed man, a newfound EV acolyte as long as the EV in question is a Porsche. | There was a time when station wagons were thick on the ground across this country. Times have changed, though, and now crossovers are the most popular form of family transportation. Some automakers, though, continue to make wagons, and we salute them.This week Audi unveiled the RS6 Avant, a nearly 600-horsepower, all-wheel-drive super wagon that will, for the first time ever, be sold in the U.S.  We’re going to talk about it on today’s episode, along with why station wagons have fallen out of favor, and which ones are our favorite of all time.2019 Audi RS6 Avant- 25-year history- Twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8- 591 hp / 590 lb-ft of torque- 0-60 in 3.6 seconds, 155 mph top speed (174 with Dynamic Package, 190 mph with Dynamic Package Plus)- New version of Virtual Cockpit- Cool-ass headlight and taillight showsWhat happened to the station wagon in America?- Wagon sales are up, but their share of the market is down to 1.4 percentWhat is it about crossovers that is so appealing?Favorite wagons of all-time (John’s choices)- Mid-‘90s Volvo 850R Wagon (222 hp, turbo 5-cylinder, box on wheels)- Car and Driver’s custom second-gen Taurus SHO wagon- Dodge Magnum (SRT8 specifically)Now tell us YOUR thoughts:Twitter @Motor1com #motor1podcastFacebook https://www.facebook.com/motor1com | On this week's episode of the\xa0Motor1.com\xa0U.S. podcast, Global Editor-in-Chief John Neff, Senior Editor Greg Fink, and Writer Christopher Smith go through the new Corvette's pricing and options line by line, trim by trim. What they find is shocking – the new Corvette is perhaps the best performance bargain they've seen in the last decade, if not this century. | By the end of 2109 no fewer than 25 vehicles on sale today will be discontinued - that’s a lot! And whilst some of them we’ll miss, for most of them, they deserve the axe. On today’s episode we’re going through the list of ‘dead cars walking’ with an eye towards which cars we’d save, and which cars we’d recommend take their place. | 2019 has already seen the return of the Toyota Supra and arrival of the mid-engine Corvette. But for every one of those ground-breaking debuts, there are dozens of cars that are withering on the vine from lack of attention. We discovered 20 cars on sale today that have been around since at least 2010 with only minor updates. A couple of them even go back decades to the mid-‘90s. We’re going to play a game called kill it, invest, or let it ride - and decide their fate, one by one. | So the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette finally debuted last week, and it was a new car launch for the ages. Honestly, no one has been able to stop talking about it, including Motor1. We’ve written so many articles about the Corvette since it’s introduction that you might as well call us Corvette1.com. On today’s episode, we’re going to keep the conversation going and give our honest, unvarnished take on the new mid-engine C8 Corvette", 'chan_desc': 'Listen to hear John Neff and the Motor1.com U.S. team talk about everything automotive: cars, sportscars, supercars, sedans, SUVs, motorcycles, auto shows and more.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/77/9f/07/779f0756-bc5c-6583-d687-c34f90fc17d2/mza_2117415056916728874.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-04-08'}}

Crock pots and crock pot liners are your friends (Including the use of Insta-Pot) What is a Wartburger and why you want one Storage, utensils, and serving needs On track/last minute pickups, including ice, water, fruit, etc. Do not put pickles into the ice tubs, especially if the lid is open/loose 5 gallon drink coolers filled with ice water and Gatorade or lemonade Minimize prep and cleanup at the track as much as possible Clear totes are very helpful for organizing and finding at the track If possible, have a separate set of things from your normal kitchen during the season to make pre-race packing as easy and quick as possible Scheduling meals and responsibilities on track day Snacks, drinks, open platters etc. for in between meal grazing Advantages of Camp Sharing with other friends and teams, preferably both Cleaning wipes and other techniques to deal with potentially limited water supplies at some track infields and pit areas Favorite gadgets and prep tools Smokers, Crock Pots, Sous Vide, Turkey Fryers, etc. Favorite meals and meals that are difficult/require “too much” prep for at track preparation Other food and drink related thoughts Variety of the menu from race to race is also something to consider  \xa0 We will be producing many of the best recipes we use on our website shortly after this episode (once Bill finished prepping the 6 cars we need to end our season) \xa0 We end with a much anticipated (by Bill) Hella Sweet or But Terrible that went over like a Led Balloon.\xa0 \xa0 Please let us know if you or your team have any suggestions and recipes if possible and we can share them with everyone with either an email to garageheroesintraining@gmail.com or even better within a 5 star review from wherever you downloaded our podcast.\xa0 | On this week's podcast episode we go over wheel alignment and measurement techniques that can be used at home and at the track by almost everyone with Gil Winingham from QuickTrick Alignment.\xa0 Having a minor change to the alignment can lead to very significant effects, increasing speed, decreasing lap times, and easier/safer driving and handling.\xa0\xa0 Please contact Gil at:\xa0\xa0https://www.quicktrickalignment.com/\xa0 | Our team now has a new race car build about to begin.\xa0 Long Roof for Life:\xa0 Project Codename:\xa0 Godzuki!!!\xa0 It is a “new to us” Honda Civic that we will be converting into an endurance race car after this season.\xa0 Since we know “Mr Honda” we will have backup knowledge to assist us as we go.\xa0 Our plan is to build this car as a demonstration project for our listeners.\xa0 If you have any ideas or thoughts, and suggestions on what we should do, please let us know within a podcast review or on our email at GarageHeroesInTraining@gmail.com. On this GHiT Team focused episode this week, we covered what we have been up to in the garage this past week or so.\xa0 Lots of HPDE and NHMS race weekend prepping on all counts.\xa0 Vicki has been obsessed with car detailing for the past two weeks on her 1999 NB MX-5 with a Flyin’ Miata turbo.\xa0 Inside, outside, in the engine bay, adding decals, etc.\xa0 Alan avoids the Capri with everything else that could possibly be worked on and Bill is working on the 4 HPDE cars for Watkins Glen and two additional race cars this week (The cheap Boxster is trying its best to avoid remaining cheap).\xa0 We also get into the Race Truck brake issue and our path forward; still not sure we have a plan.\xa0 Vicki makes her point that we could use an additional team member with mechanical skills, but we still don’t know how to find our missing skillset. \xa0 We cover how to go about converting a streetcar into an endurance racing car and in what sequence.\xa0 Our general priority is to first make sure it is safe by stripping it down and making sure what is structural is sound and repair as needed.\xa0 After this, we add in safety features like the roll cage, racing seats, racing harness, and fire suppression systems etc.\xa0 Do not forget to address the brakes and braking system with good racing pads and racing fluid, and likely improved brake rotors and calipers.\xa0 Please review our episode #59 with Wendy from Porterfield's if you would like much more detail in this area.\xa0 Tires and brakes are probably the biggest performance bang for the buck improvements you can do. The next priority we like to follow is to improve our driver skill and the durability of the car towards the abuse it is about to receive.\xa0 This would include better grades of the various fluids, better suspensions, oil coolers, radiator improvements, transmission coolers, differential coolers, etc.\xa0 Potentially adding a better clutch etc. as they fail during racing. As far as driver improvements, we really like HPDE events for the type of racing you will be doing, for instance NASA HPDE for road racing, EVO School for Autocross, etc.\xa0 Really any type of coaching will usually lead to significant improvement, especially if early in your racing career.\xa0 Don’t forget to use your daily driving time to help practice and improve several aspects of your driving skills, like heel and toe, hand positioning and movements, and long range vision etc.\xa0 At this point you have a good solid foundation and you can work to dial in the car further and continually improve.\xa0 \xa0 Once solid, we start looking at better clutches, improved drivetrains by adding in an LSD or a Torsen or even a locked/mini spool type etc. and avoid the open differentials where you only drive one of the wheels.\xa0 The costs of these improvements tend to be a bit higher than the earlier steps. \xa0 Nice/Next level additions to have at some point would include: Telemetry and video analysis to allow you to compare driver styles and performance via the data collected. Engine power increases can be a very expensive path unless you swap out the engine Suspension improvements like lowering the car, improving handling with springs, sway bars, coil overs, etc. Lightening the vehicle. Aero is also another great path to improve performance at a reasonable cost.\xa0 Don’t forget alignment is a great bang for the buck potential improvement, especially a good alignment and then a racing camber and toe adjustment. \xa0 We ended with Vicki’s Tool of the week for use with vinyl decals, stripes etc.:\xa0 It is called Knifeless Tape and it allows you to cut any designs and shapes needed into any vinyl to make your desired edge designs. \xa0 And finally, Vicki volunteered to list several of our cars for the “we” of our team.\xa0 “We” shall see. \xa0 Again any questions, suggestions, movie references, and/or car purchases, please contact us at our email at GarageHeroesInTraining@gmail.com and or even better within a podcast review. | Another new intro bumper starts off our summary of Disney’s D23 expo with most of the highlights.\xa0 We cover most of the announcements and also give our opinion on most and background in many cases if you are not familiar with the

villain list (attached) \xa0 Our open invitation to Kevin Feige remains!\xa0 We won’t try for spoilers but would love to review the MCU and his career to date. | Chris Egan is our special guest driver from the Futility Motorsports endurance racing team.\xa0 We last saw Chris at the 24 Hours of Lemons race at Thompson.\xa0 We review his lemons racing history as well as the team’s recent over-temp issues at their last race.\xa0 Chris started racing with a Shelby Daytona and somehow he is still going (with the Futility Motorsport Saab).\xa0 Chris has also raced in several HPDE’s and tried his hand at autocross.\xa0 Chris races with his family (father, brother, and sister) and is shooting for a top 20 overall.\xa0 Chris covers why the Daytona is no longer the team vehicle and how the 250k mile Saab came to be a race car. \xa0 We also talk about the pressures and responsibilities of being a square on the E1R bingo card and the history of the “Young Chris Egan” moniker.\xa0 \xa0 Chris is a mechanical engineer who has a penchant for following in the steps of Rube Goldberg, so he fits right into the lemons paddock.\xa0 A natural born tinkerer in all areas, we also go over the recent intercom system that Chris has been working on and developing.\xa0 As expected, Bill had no shame and requested a test model for our upcoming HPDE at Watkins Glenn.\xa0 \xa0 The conversation led to many different areas of discussion, including:\xa0 \xa0 HPDE vs racing vs autocross comparisons in learning and experience on track driving and improving your ability to read and predict other drivers, both on and off the track.\xa0 \xa0 Chris recalls several of the wild and crazy things he has seen both on and off the track at a lemons race, including a burning man themed paddock \xa0 Vicki and Chris talk about making their own tracks at NHMS by not going up the hill.\xa0 Chris seems to have worse luck at NHMS than we do. \xa0 Lots of trial by fire and learning what “to do” and what “not to do”.\xa0 \xa0 Building an old Toronado in Jahn Pagels shop with Spank the night before the Sonoma race.\xa0 \xa0 We make a challenge for a twin-engine car driven by two stick shifts.\xa0 (one single clutch would be acceptable) \xa0 We also go through a quick math problem with Alan over the plusses (time) and minuses (laps) of his recent red mist collection of black flags.\xa0 \xa0 We also go round and round on what we are doing with the El Jeffe race truck brake heating issues and the Capri engine/transmission swap with input from Chris \xa0 Chris get subjected to a Good, Bad, and the Ugly review of his racing career/history. \xa0 We make a bet between Chris and Alan on who finishes their project car first (getting the engine to fire).\xa0 Who do you think will win?\xa0 Chris and his E36 or Alan with the 3.8 liter Capri swap.\xa0 \xa0 Biggest takeaway:\xa0 Finish the work on the car as soon as possible, not just in time for the race.\xa0 \xa0 How many other racing podcasts would also have a Wacky Racers reference in the flow of the conversation? | We (Finally) cover the recent San Diego Comic Convention (SDCC).\xa0 We cover the entire event with what we found of interest.\xa0 Marvel dominated most of the announcements, but we tried to cover everything.\xa0 \xa0 Including: Krypton, several times The Witcher and Henry Cavil Top Gun Maverick Trailer Jay and Silent Bob Reboot movie and all of Kevin Smith’s movies Terminator:\xa0 Dark Fate The Cats Trailer It 2 Picard trailer The Orville The Watchmen TV series Pennyworth Akira (delay) The Boys on Amazon

\xa0 D23 Speculation \xa0 Bill gets on a soapbox, twice, this episode including: Krypton is a must watch show Why the short season/few episode season is a bunch of OOOGAAA horn \xa0 Vicki has homework to watch Akira and listen to The Sessions Podcast with Bob /Marley \xa0 Thoughts about the recent new Corvette C8 reveal since our last episode \xa0 And we wrap up with our most looking forward to picks and a big shout out to: Christian James Hand and his podcast called “The Session” where he breaks down popular songs track by track in a most entertaining manner.\xa0 We can't wait to see him live when he comes to the east coast.\xa0 \xa0 We will follow up with a D23 review as soon as possible, hopefully with some Marvel Phase 5 information.\xa0 | Wendy Charlier has been our primary contact at Porterfield’s since we started our team and has been with the company 20 years.\xa0 Wendy has a racing background from her family that goes back many years.\xa0 Also, for those of you that are not familiar with them, Porterfield’s is a private company that services all kinds of performance applications related to the braking your car and heat management, including brake pads, rotors, calipers, fluids, full brake kits etc., as well as other aspects of performance & racing like suspension components, oil coolers, starters, heat protection items, and batteries, and many others items.\xa0 So if you need any brake pads for virtually any car or truck, they have them or will make them for you. Highlights from this episode include: \xa0 Brake Pads Selection Factors  What tracks What type of racing, historic, endurance autocross, dirt, etc. What use What car What heat/temperature is expected  \xa0Rotors  Vented vs solid Drilled and/or slotted (Hint don’t cross drill if you are racing) Slotted One piece vs two piece Proper sizing and selection  \xa0Calipers/Pistons  The effect of the piston size, piston quantity, and the total piston surface area  \xa0Brake fluids, types, uses, comparisons \xa0Wendy also recommended several brake pads to choose from depending on your driving needs, autocross, sprints, HPDE/track days, road/endurance racing etc.  We also cover the brake pad torque performance and its impact on braking and brake feel A good bit of discussion on our racing pads of choice the Raybestos ST43’s Other brands available include the Porterfield brand, Hawk, Performance Friction, Pagid, and several others from Raybestos How brake calipers can affect brake pad selection, especially with respect to the available pad thickness  \xa0Brake Fluids selection  Dry boiling point vs wet boiling point DOT 3 4 5 etc. (racing use DOT 4) Frequencies and reasons to change, bleed, etc., like if it boils, bleed it ….. Hydroscopic effects on brake fluid and its boiling point depression and why brake fluid is hydroscopic How varying local humidity levels can affect brake fluid performance Brake fluid compressibility and its effect on pedal feel  Brake lines and selection and advantages of braided stainless steel lines \xa0 (real) Brake Ducting and cooling solutions (not using pool noodles), both neoprene and silicone, with wire reinforcement Sizing of ducts and positioning tips on both the inlet and outlet sides NACA Ducts and other options Oil coolers \xa0 We also reviewed a reusable oil filter that we are absolutely dying to try. \xa0 Finally, Bill also attempted to talk Wendy off her personal cliff and start her amazing race career.\xa0 We will get Wendy out racing soon.\xa0 \xa0 So please join us for an excellent podcast reviewing all aspects of braking your race car.\xa0 And no, brakes don’t just slow you down.\xa0 | This episode is dedicated to our friend Aaron Leinemann.\xa0 He has had some unexpected bad medical news and a GoFundMe page has been started to assist.\xa0 Please share whatever you can to assist Aaron and his amazing family.\xa0 Link at the end.\xa0 \xa0 On this episode, our team reviews the 2019 24 Hours of Lemons race GP du Lac Chargoggagogg(etcetera) AT Thompson Speedway in Northeastern Connecticut.\xa0 We entered our Race Truck “El Jeffe” a 2004 Chevy S-10 with many Isuzu Hombre body panels and our new to us 1998 BMW E36 3-series car for our first race with it after buying it about two weeks prior.\xa0 El Jeffe was updated from the former Stan Lee livery to and Avengers Endgame livery and the E36 was quickly themed in the paddock to be a Captain America car.\xa0 We review Friday practice and spend most of the episode covering the race on Saturday and Sunday.\xa0 Highlights include:  New Drivers, several first timers at Thompson Thompson track walk and review Saturday and Sunday within El Jeffe Saturday and Sunday in the BMW E36 El Jeffe brake issues and a potential fix and path forward to alleviate this ongoing problem.\xa0 Our 4 black flag debacle and how it impacted our position in the race (HINT not well) Bill got to make two signs with Connor to slow the cars in the pits A minor incident where a car came across the bow of the El Jeffe and removed moist of the front end facia Saturday night’s Potluck Dinner hosted by the Three Pedal Mafia team for Stuntin’ and Explodin’ fest We show our exceptional math skills several times this episode Team awards for the weekend Hella Sweet or Butt Terrible idea of the week To do’s and improvements for our next race Radio and Helmet communication issues Then things devolved from there  \xa0 Aaron's Go Fund me link:\xa0 \xa0  https://www.gofundme.com/calling-all-racers-support-a-teammate-in-need?pc=tw_dn_cpgntopnavlarge_r&rcid=r01-156579899205-2044fc655aa44466&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tw_dn_cpgn | We were honored to have internationally renowned racing coach Peter Krause join us for an introductory discussion of data collection and analysis to improve your track driving while minimizing the addition of risk.\xa0 The conversation was exceptional and covered a wide range of areas and topics.\xa0 Some of the highlight areas we covered include:  Data collection systems, options, and comparison What to use, how to use, and several options for how to analyze the data His virtual track walks with Ross Bentley, especially the Road Atlanta Vicki, Alan, and Bill studied prior to our race at Road Atlanta last December We also discussed the use of Video to compliment the data and several ways to get to intelligent video which includes the track video with several displays of the data Several stages of progression in data collection and analysis Predictive lap times and the use and implications in car Keys to breaking through stagnation and plateaus in driving A simple and clear delineation between good and great drivers Several different ways of presenting the data including tabular formats, strip charts, and colored maps which can aide in the use and interpretation of the data collected.  We also cover several of the more popular commercial systems including:  Race Monitor app Harry’s Lap Timer Aim’s Solo, Solo 2, Solo 2 DL, MXM, and MXL GoPro Hero 7 VBox Sport Race Render Use of OBD blue tooth dongles Race Chrono Porsche Precision Track App BMW M App  Peter also recommended two books that he finds useful in introducing more detail into the use and the analysis of the data.\xa0 We have already ordered our copies.  Making Sense of Squiggly Lines by Chris Brown Practical Race Car Data Acquisition by Bob Knox  If you ever wondered what the top three key data collection parameters are, Peter shared his views as a driver coach who hopes everyone can use these three metrics to help with their self-learning.\xa0  Engine speed/rpm Throttle position Brake Pressure  If you have any more questions or wish to talk with Peter in more depth, he is easily contacted through his website at www.PeterKrause.net\xa0 and please pay special attention to his websites area on Track Wisdom.\xa0 Other references we also recommend include: AIM sports YouTube channel Race studio Analysis And of course, the Virtual track walks Peter made with Ross Bentley that are available on the speed secrets website.\xa0 We can't wait until we can go into a bit more depth with Peter after we utilize his wisdom in our coming races and HPDE’s.", 'chan_desc': 'We are an amateur endurance auto racing team.

She rides and investigates into the history and lore of small towns, abandoned\xa0landmarks, and historical sites while performing paranormal investigations to see if she can\xa0collect evidence of ghost activity. It's a pretty neat hook, and if nothing else, is a pretty cool way to learn some history of small town America. She's gearing up to release Season 2 of her show on October 1.

Instructors from Total Control Training\xa0provide guidance and instruction while safety gear comes from Cycle Gear, Shark, HJC, and Shoei. They got kids rolling around on Stacyc electric balance bikes. They let you get on a wheelie machine to feel what a wheelie is like.
