We return to the Ford of Bruinen to figure out exactly what happened, and even look back on the early adventures of the Hobbits in Book I of The Lord of the Rings. We court controversy with questions about Balrog wings and whether we really are too hard on Fëanor (spoiler: no). Plus, what happened to the greatest Elvish poets of the First Age, and wouldn’t it be nice if they were still around? | That’s what Vizzini told us to do, so we have. As we shake off the jet lag and learn to live again without full English breakfasts and a steady supply of fish and chips, we look back at Book I of The Lord of the Rings, revisiting the recurring themes in the story so far. Then we look ahead to Book II, and the new themes and tone that will emerge as Frodo continues on the ever-darkening road to Mordor. We shake the dust off Barliman’s Bag with a few questions from our summer hiatus, finally put Tolkien 2019 behind us with a brief discussion of our favorite moments, and explore the answer to the burning question: Who’s more goth than Morgoth? | Alan and Shawn reunite in person for a live recording from Tolkien 2019 in Birmingham, England! We interviewed several special guests at the conference, including returning guests (Marquette University archivist Bill Fliss, authors Dimitra Fimi and John Garth) and some first-timers: legendary artist Ted Nasmith, Richard Medrington — the man behind the one-man theatrical production of Leaf By Niggle — and dramatist Brian Sibley of the Lord of the Rings BBC radio play! Plus live questions from our panel audience, questionable wardrobe choices, and some other unquestionably good stuff! | We end Season 3 by welcoming Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull to the podcast! This renowned husband-wife team have co-authored some of the most essential books in Tolkien studies. In addition to several volumes on Tolkien’s art (such as J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator) they’ve given the world The Lord of the Rings: A Reader’s Companion, the recently-expanded J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, and much more. We talk about their many award-winning publications, hear how it feels to be given a special project by Christopher Tolkien himself, and receive a comforting reminder that anyone can make a mistake. | Strider is remarkably not disappointed that the Elf who’s overtaken them on the road is not his girlfriend. It’s Glorfindel of Rivendell; and for listeners who remember our episodes on the fall of Gondolin, we’ll not only answer the question of whether this Glorfindel is really that Glorfindel, we’ll also delve into Tolkien’s essays to understand what makes him so special. Plus, more questions about Elvish rebirth, a booth review on who attacked the Prancing Pony in the previous chapter, and hip-but-casual footwear options for the discerning demiurge. | Strider’s path to Rivendell leads the hobbits through rough terrain; all the while, the days get colder and Frodo gradually succumbs to the evil effects of the Witch-king’s blade. A bad situation starts to look even worse when Pippin and Merry catch a glimpse of three trolls ahead — and if that sounds familiar to you, then you scored higher than they did. Sam surprises everyone again with a bit of his own poetry, we talk about the power of textual ruins with a Tolkien Quote of the Day, and Shawn once again wonders about the smells of Middle-earth. \xa0 | Frodo awakens, wounded and bewildered, after the attack on Weathertop. Believing they’ve been led into a trap, Sam is certain (again) that Strider is not to be trusted, but the Ranger proves himself useful (again) by treating the wound with athelas, a healing herb of the Dúnedain. The wonder drug doesn’t work wonders, but it eases Frodo’s pain enough to resume the journey to Rivendell. We ponder the possibilities of troll architecture, celebrate a podcast milestone, and consider how Sauron is like a cell phone battery. | Alan and Shawn are pleased to welcome Greg Hildebrandt to the Prancing Pony Podcast! An iconic artist and illustrator, Greg (together with his twin brother Tim as the Brothers Hildebrandt) helped a generation of readers visualize Middle-earth in the Ballantine Books J.R.R. Tolkien Calendars from 1976 to 1978, and continues to create fantasy and sci-fi art to this day. Greg talked to us about his art and shared some incredible stories from his long and celebrated career, including the story behind the poster for some obscure 1970s movie called Star Wars. | It’s our most Bombadilicious episode yet! Once again, Alan and Shawn open the common-room to listeners for live, unscripted questions that we answer on the spot as best we can. This time around we tackle several questions about Rings of Power (and the people who wear them), the optics of invisibility, and how not to purloin poultry. Also, some pre-finale Game of Thrones predictions that will seem absolutely hilarious now… and move over, Carolinas and Texas: Tuckborough-style barbecue might just be the next hot culinary trend. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Evening falls on Weathertop, and our heroes make camp beneath the stars with the Black Riders not far away. Strider tells stories to chase away their fears, covering most of The Silmarillion in a lot less time than we did. But in the darkest night, the Black Riders sneak up on the camp, and Frodo is suddenly overcome by a desire to disappear. We revisit the story of Beren and Lúthien, Alan alliterates again, and we solve several surprisingly similar listener questions about Ringwraiths.', 'chan_desc': "As they explore the work of J. R. R.

شاعر بالبحر أو السماء أو الفراشات أو حتى بأكلة دسمة، أما الجبل فأكاد أجزم بأنك لم تسمع، كنتُ أرى الجبل رمزًا للقوة والجبروت، ومصدرًا للرهبة والثبات، حتى التقيت بالصديق عبد الله ناجي الشاعر والروائي، كانت مصادفة رائعة عند ركن دار مسكلياني بمعرض جدة الدولي للكتاب 2018م، بعد صداقة شهدها الفيس بوك سنين عددًا، كنت أقرأ منشوراته بتأنٍ وإكبار، فعبد الله شاعر مجيد وروائي رصين ومثقف حاذق، تركيبة نادرة، تجعله قادرًا على ابتلاعك من اللحظة الأولى حتى توشك أن تفر إلى جيب سترته أو تختبئ تحت قبعته الإفرنجية. يقعنك بأن الشعر ضرورة وجودية، والفن ركن من أركان الحياة لا تنعقد إلا به، وليس ترفًا أو خيارًا

And how does our understanding of transfusion help us to understand our own reading of historical and contemporary scientific advancements?In today\'s episode, Jacke talks to Professor Ann Kibbie of Bowdoin College about her new book, Transfusion: Blood and Sympathy in the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination, which examines the scientific and literary treatment of the nineteenth-century practice of transfusion, including the way transfusion seeped into the works of authors like George Eliot, Adam Smith, and Bram Stoker, whose Dracula stands as a culmination of the practice of transfusion and the elemental feelings it arouses.\xa0Help support the show at patreon.com/literature or historyofliterature.com/shop.

Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol (1809 – 1852) rose from obscurity to a brilliant literary career that forever changed the course of Russian literature. Born in 1809, he and his contemporary Pushkin influenced the titans who followed, including Tolstoy and Doestoevsky and Chekhov. Best known for his novel Dead Souls, his play, The Government Inspector, and a handful of classic short stories like “Diary of a Madman” and “The Nose,” it is his short story “The Overcoat” that perhaps best expresses his artistry and influence. As Doestovsky famously said, “we all come out from under Gogol’s overcoat.” But who was this unusual writer? Where did he come from? What was so different about his fiction, and what made it resonate with readers? And why does his story “The Overcoat” still have the power to make Jacke weep?Help support the show at patreon.com/literature or historyofliterature.com/shop. (We appreciate it!)

They were the Brontes - Charlotte, Emily, and Anne - who lived with their brother Branwell in an unassuming 19th-century Yorkshire town called Haworth. Their house, a parsonage, sat on a hill, with the enticing but sometimes dangerous moors above and a cemetery, their father’s church, and the industrializing town below. It was a dark little home, with little more than a roof to keep out the rain, a fire to keep things warm at night, and books and periodicals arriving from Edinburgh and London to excite their imagination. And from this humble little town, these three sisters and their active, searching minds exerted an influence on English literature that can still be felt nearly two hundred years later.Help support the show at patreon.com/literature or historyofliterature.com/shop.

Dismissed by Virginia Woolf as a writer for children and by H.G. Wells as a demonstration of the triumph of talent over genius, Stevenson nevertheless thrilled generations of audiences and inspired countless other writers, including Joseph Conrad, Ernest Hemingway, Hillary Mantel, Vladimir Nabokov, Graham Greene, and Jorge Luis Borges, who declared that reading Stevenson was "among the greatest literary joys I have ever experienced."

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Marcel Proust (1871-1922) did little of note until he turned 38 years old - but from that point forward, he devoted the rest of his life to writing a masterpiece. The result, the novel In Search of Lost Time, published in seven volumes from 1913 to 1927, stands as one of the supreme achievements of Modernism or any other period. Written in Proust\'s inimitable, discursive prose, the novel recreates the memories of a lifetime, infusing a search for the past with an almost mystical belief in the power of beauty and experience to be ever-present, alive, unified, and universally important. Drawing upon everything in Proust\'s life, from his childhood bedtime kisses from his mother to his travels through high Parisian society, the towering novel stands alone for its deep artistic and psychological insights.

Her father Robert managed an estate for a wealthy family; her mother Christina was the daughter of a local mill-owner. Among her rather large family, Mary Ann stood apart as the only one with a taste for intellectual pursuits. Her views on philosophy and theology led her to reject religion at the age of 22, leading to a row with her father that lasted months. She spent the next fifteen years in a kind of quest for intellectual companionship, which led to some humiliating episodes before finally resulting in a successful, if socially fraught, relationship with an unhappily married journalist named George Henry Lewes. After making a living as a freelance editor and translator, Evans turned to writing novels at the age of 37. Published under the pseudonym "George Eliot," her first novel Adam Bede was an immediate success, praised for the depth of its psychological insights and the clarity of its moral vision. Eliot followed Adam Bede with several classics of English literature includingThe Mill on the Floss, Silas Marner, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda. She was, remarked Virginia Woolf, one of the few English novelists who wrote books for grown-up people. Help support the show at patreon.com/literature or historyofliterature.com/shop.

A newly reenergized Jacke Wilson returns for a deep dive into the life, works, and politics of Samuel Beckett. Yes, we know him as one of the key figures bridging the gap between modernism and post-modernism - but was he more than just a highly refined artist generating art for art\'s sake? Was he engaged with his times? And if so, how might that engagement have affected his writings? We\'ll immerse ourselves in Waiting for Godot and some of Beckett\'s other works for our answer, with special guest Nic Barilar, PhD Student in Theater and Performance Studies at the University of Pittsburgh.

Born in 1949, she went from a childhood in Illinois to a career as a Broadway singer, a Hollywood actor and movie star, a songwriter, an author of children’s books, an author of cookbooks, and now a podcaster. Along the way, she’s worked with everyone from Woody Allen to Steve Martin to Bette Midler to Garry Shandling to Peter O\'Toole to Max von Sydow to Brian di Palma to - well, it’s a who’s who of everyone Jacke admired when growing up in the 70s and 80s. She joins Jacke for a conversation about her new project, WINNETKA, a podcast-memoir in which she explores her childhood in the 50s and 60s - and the secrets that cast long shadows across even the brightest of families.

Known for his writerly struggles to advance the novel form beyond irony and postmodernism, as well as for his personal struggles with depression, drug addiction, and suicidal tendencies, David Foster Wallace died of his own hand in 2008. In the years since his death, new biographical information has emerged, including several disturbing incidents regarding women whom Wallace treated poorly, including stalking incidents and other alarming incidents and allegations. Today, Wallace has an uneasy relationship with the literary canon: widely recognized as a brilliant if sometimes narcissistic talent, possessed of both genius-like intelligence and deep flaws both as a writer and a human being. Today, his reputation is a source of contention: Was he a prophetlike figure who surpassed his peers and superseded all who came before? Or a smart but flawed man whose worst tendencies led him to generate thickets of navel-gazing and unreadability?Help support the show at patreon.com/literature or historyofliterature.com/shop.

It shadows the experiences of detective Sherlock Holmes, an enigmatic genius, as he tries to unravel the mystery of each investigation he partakes in. Set in late 19th century London, the novel not only creates a successful mystery plot, but also circulates through real locations including Hyde Park, the river Thames, St George’s Church in Hanover Square, as well as adding fictional places to spice things up.  The vibrant reoccurring illustrations of London’s means of transportation are also worth noting.   The novel begins in the famous apartment 221B Baker Street, home to Sherlock Holmes who is visited by clients in need of assistance in resolving various issues. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock Holmes works his magic in order to find a logical solution to each mystery.  Narrated through the perspective of Dr. Watson, Holmes’s close friend and companion, he serves as a monitor as he accompanies or is given a full account of the sequence of events surrounding investigation details.  Watson then documents each adventure and shares it with the readers which in turn act as memoirs of Holmes’s achievements. This type of narration only enhances the sense of mystery surrounding each case because of the occasional missing detail and leaves the reader wondering about the next course of action. Interestingly, Holmes offers logical explanations for each of his solutions, but nevertheless manages to keep the audience on their toes. Family fortune, reputation, social status and moral weakness are just some of the themes Doyle explores in his novel of suspense and mystery.  Doyle’s use of 19th century English jargon proves to be a delightful read, whilst still maintaining a lucid style easy to follow and understand. For those embarking on their first ever encounter with the pipe-smoking, violin-playing sleuth, this is just the beginning of an unforgettable journey.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/0d/18/f2/0d18f2fd-b179-eba6-e071-62f6cdccc49d/mza_3454429489624343688.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-09-24'}}

Perhaps you’ve heard them here, on past episodes for prior books. But what you’ve never before witnessed is the two of them TOGETHER. Despite their close friendship and longtime desire to share a mic or stage, this is a first. (Happy dance!) The part of me that lives for literary matchmaking is in full swoon right now.\xa0That’s what these two New York Times bestselling authors (of 17+ combined books) do best—raise the bar on what’s possible. Each time I see them hit a new life or career goal, it’s not long before they seem to exceed it—permitting us to follow suit. That doesn’t mean life doesn’t have its hardship, but if you’re buoyed by grace, gratitude, and good cheer, they’re your people. \xa0I trust this conversation will make you feel all kinds of hopeful as Dani and Gabby reveal real-world writing strategies with out-of-this-world processes. Feel reassured as they talk about how they tap into their book titles. Pace and format their books. Overcome resistance to create multiple streams of income. I believe you’ll become inspired as they explain how they work within time to EXPAND it (doing less to attract more). And delight in their devotional habits that access magic.\xa0Coaxing angelic support might be mentioned, too (wink, wink), including a personal guardian angel story I relive that\'s REALLY out there. (Shocking, I know.) Gabby\'s on a first-name basis with the Archangel for Creativity and Communication, and invites you to be, too! All helpful, because as Dani says, "You have to believe you\'re a writer before the world concurs.”\xa0I mean, do you have a better strategy than reaching for the divine? I didn’t think so.\xa0Welcome to woo. We\'re so happy you\'re here! xo | He’s authored 90 books. A Fellow of the American College of Physicians. Teaches meditation (with Oprah!). Been a husband for 49 years. A devoted father and grandfather. And he\'s beloved by Lady Gaga. So, other than his daily coffee, yoga, and more cushion time (“Om”) than a geriatric dog, what more could a guy want? Plenty, it turns out. Nothing short of enlightenment. And not just for himself, if humanity’s going to make it. Good thing he’s written the book on that.\xa0I feel ridiculously blessed to welcome Dr. Deepak Chopra on the Beautiful Writers Podcast today. It’s his FIRST tour stop for MetaHuman: Unleashing Your Infinite Potential, which pubs next month via Harmony Books. Our mutual friend, Arielle Ford, is our special-sauce guest co-host. She’s widely credited with making Deepak a household name back in the day as his longtime book publicist. (Arielle helped facilitate the rapid growth of self-help, launching clients like Marianne Williamson, Louise Hay, Wayne Dyer, Neale Donald Walsh, and her sister, Debbie Ford, before authoring eleven books herself.) Deepak and Arielle are like family, the kind forged over lifetimes, she says. Doesn’t sound too farfetched after hanging out with them. \xa0No stuffed shirts here! As Arielle promised, Deepak is delightfully FUN. Sure, I couldn’t get him to complain or gossip—not even about politics (well, he did mention some “thugs"). But girlfriends had to break it down, and Arielle and I got our fix at the end once he hung up. Here’s to hoping the big D is too busy contemplating the universe (or lack of one—just wait) to care that we closed the show talking about him behind his back. Just balancing the scales, Deepak. You drew first blood with those names you called my girl at the top of our show. (Smiley.)We’ve got a lot to cover, including how haters caused Deepak to take the MD off his books for a time (say what?!); ways in which meditation increases our creative genius, and his especially enlightening answers to our rapid-fire Q\'s. If you’ve ever hoped to get off the rat wheel (BEYOND the wheel), you’re going to love this new book, as well as his advice for accessing "the window of infinite creativity.” We talk silencing the inner bullies in our heads, and his favorite author & book, which I ordered immediately.\xa0Of course, he’s got a meditation schedule you’ll never in a million years be able to replicate, but may find wildly entertaining. Pretty much the same thing for his nighttime sleep rituals—how can anyone remember all this stuff, much less implement them? Ahh. A girl can dream. Or, go beyond the dream. Isn’t that the point? I mean, it’s all an illusion, right?\xa0All I know is the guy’s voice makes me happy. “Like champagne bubbles in my head,” Arielle says. Here, here.

This is my favorite time of year—when I get to dive back into past episodes of the #BeautifulWritersPodcast and release our annual “Best-Of” show. (We’re on #3, in case you’ve been keeping track.) I’ve had a blast curating a wide variety of my favorite clips from summer 2018-19, and hope you enjoy revisiting excerpts you’ve already heard but may have forgotten, or meeting some of these bestsellers for the first time. (I’ve also pulled snippets from Marianne Williamson’s episode from our archives—since her presidential debate performances have her front-and-center in the news right now and likewise on my mind. God, she’s prolific—and generous with her writing wisdom.)Our line-up for today’s episode is, once again, jaw-dropping. I feel like the luckiest girl at the party. Curious to learn what motivates Lee Child to continue racing to finish the next installment of his billion-dollar Jack Reacher series year after year? Great. He’s about to get vulnerable. Or, details of how Catherine Oxenberg used the power of her pen to write in real-time to save her daughter and take down a terrifying cult? Yep. She’s here too. As is Abby Wambach, Seth Godin, Ann Patchett, Meg Wolitzer, Austin Channing Brown, and Steven Pressfield (again, yay!). Plus so many others.Thank you for being here! And for sharing your enthusiasm for this show. I love hearing about how you binge listen, take pages and pages of notes, and look forward to the book (I’m working as fast as I can—promise:)). You and your writing needs are on my mind and in my heart as I strive, always, to keep bringing you the best of the very best.\xa0May your writing journey be as light and easy as a summer breeze.\xa0Welcome.\xa0LindagratefulxxPS.

For a mom fighting to take down a terrifying cult and free her daughter, India, there are no sweeter words. Just last week, mother, actress, royal, and first-time author Catherine Oxenberg saw the fulfillment of her years-long campaign to stop Keith Raniere and his organization, NXIVM (pronounced nexium). A New York jury took less than five hours to render Keith guilty of charges that include sex trafficking, conspiracy, racketeering, and possession of child pornography.This is not the norm, by the way—to bring down a cult leader, much less his entire world, before a mass type of Jim Jones tragedy unfolds. And it’s not the norm to pen a book in real time as it’s all happening. But what’s a mother to do when she\'s convinced her daughter is a victim of sex slavery and could be murdered or influenced to commit an “honor suicide” any day as the group\'s leader becomes increasingly erratic? Is she supposed to stand by idly as law enforcement fails to take her fears or evidence seriously? Not if you’re blessed with a platform, as Catherine has been since her 80s Dynasty fame. Not when you have a particular skill for gathering evidence, rallying the media, and writing a detailed, riveting account of the play by plays.The book, Captive: A Mother\'s Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult, is truly CAPTIVATING. And, in a move her publisher (Simon & Schuster) couldn’t have predicted when they banked on this new author and purchased the proposal for this story without an ending, the guilty verdict would come out a week before the release of the paperback. \xa0I always told her she was magic. I always told her she was otherworldly. I always told her she was powerful and courageous. I even wrote those words to describe Catherine Oxenberg over twenty years ago in my first book, where she shared the story of her own abuse. But I never could have foreseen how my friend would have to depend on those traits to save India\'s life—and the lives of countless women by leading the charge to bring their perpetrator to justice. It’s the bond Cath and I have from raising Indie and Tosh together that brings a depth and humor to this conversation that I cherish. I think you’ll find it surprisingly fun—and insightful about the writing process, too, especially if you\'re interested in working with a co-author.But most certainly if you’ve got a burning desire to share your story and have an impact. Captive is a living embodiment of the term "power of the pen." And isn’t that why we write—so that our stories change the world?Throughout this fight, people called Catherine crazy. They called her paranoid. They called her desperate. I call her the Erin Brockovich of sex trafficking and cult-busting. I couldn’t be prouder of this real-life princess warrior, and can’t wait to share today\'s conversation with you, including a super sweet message from India at the end of the episode.\xa0Welcome.\xa0LindaxxSupport the show | Acclaimed bestseller Meg Wolitzer joins me today on the Beautiful Writers Podcast! Her TWELFTH novel, The Female Persuasion, is now out in paperback—a story perhaps even more relevant today than when it was released in hardback. When Meg started writing the manuscript, she, like many of us, believed we were about to swear in our first female president. We all know how that turned out. But did you ever stop to think about how authors scripting characters in books at that time had to revisit their storylines following our election\'s unexpected outcome? Hmmm.\xa0Meg’s work is especially hot right now for several reasons. First, a book she wrote fifteen years ago, The Wife, garnered an Oscar nod and a 2019 Golden Globe win for Glenn Close (for Best Actress in a Drama). Glenn’s not-a-dry-eye-in-the-house, standing-ovation acceptance speech was a rallying cry to women everywhere to own their power and FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS. Something Meg saw her mother—also a critically acclaimed, bestselling novelist—model powerfully at home and in the publishing industry. Second, with various projects in different stages of development in Hollywood (including The Female Persuasion being co-produced by Nicole Kidman for Amazon Studios), my guess is that Meg is far from done suiting up for the red carpet.\xa0I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed having this conversation and how excited I am to share it with you. I know you’re going to get valuable tips from Meg’s vast experience, especially if you’re struggling with procrastination or need inspiration to Marie-Kondo your files or writing space. I believe you\'ll love what she has to say about the highs and lows of doing this work—and how she gives us a little window into her celebration rituals upon finishing yet another book.\xa0Ahhhh… finishing!

And she is every bit as irreverent and funny and whip-smart as you’d hope. Joining us in today\'s guest co-host chair is someone we both adore, the legendary book editor Betsy Rapoport, who edited Candy’s second memoir, A Fine Romance, and who I’ve been lucky enough to call my mentor for the past eighteen years. Despite being the highest paid actor on television for a long time, Candice is exceptionally humble. But Betsy and I manage to get her to share gold about her creative process. From her erratic work ethic; what it was like being the first female to wear the 5-timer jacket hosting for Saturday Night Live; and how she’s embraced Instagram, nearly “breaking the Internet” posing for an eclipse photo with her Book Club cast-mates Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, and Mary Steenburgen. Unlike many of our guests who became household names before the advent of social media, Candice relishes posting pics and scripting funny captions for her feed.I don’t know if it’s easier or harder not to take yourself so seriously when you were born into Hollywood royalty. Some speculate that Candice’s humility is a byproduct of being the daughter of Edgar Bergen, a famous Vaudeville ventriloquist whose dummy, Charlie McCarthy, was beloved by millions and had a bigger room than Candice did in their home. Her first memoir, Knock Wood, is a candid portrayal of a little girl trying to earn a father’s love.   Candice has always been a writer—starting with magazine work for Esquire following her first movie at nineteen. We cover so much in this chat, including what makes a good book title (poetic, evocative, counter-intuitive), and why sometimes the publisher decides to forgo all that to bank on clarity. We talk about how bloody hard it can be making the audio version of your book—but how it’s a good excuse to order comfort food. Candice shares the anxiety she feels when writing memoir, and the role of an editor (in this case, Betsy) to help her go deeper. Although Candy’s latest book is a love letter to her daughter, Chloe Malle (a writer for Vogue), her first husband—the late director, Louis Malle, and her current husband, Marshall, I hope you’ll find this conversation a bit of a love letter to the collaborative process. That and showfolk, dogs in costume, and smoking sage bowls. Welcome.Support the show | Bestselling thriller author of ten novels, including The Progeny, Firstborn, The Legend of Sheba, Iscariot, and the Books of Mortals trilogy (with New York Times bestseller Ted Dekker), Tosca Lee is in the house!  She’s representing this genre proud with The Line Between, a dystopian page-turner already optioned for television by Edward Burns and his Marlboro Road Gang Productions, in partnership with Radar Pictures (#cantwait). As you’ll hear, the female protagonist could be the little sister of one of my favorite Dean Koontz characters (Dean’s a former guest of this show)—bad-guy killing heroine, Jane Hawk.  I’ve put the notorious night-owl Tosca together with my guest co-host today, Hayli Baez, because I adore them both. And, for the unique things they have in common—namely a past with pageantry, as in beauty, which has helped both of their current careers; an obsession with world-travel, fed in part by those pageants; and get this—late-night video-game playing! (Admission, I’ve never played a video game in my life, so I’m dying to know the allure of shooting fake people.) You might be wondering how a busy author like Tosca has time for such an indulgence but says it helps her come up with some of her best characters and storylines. And, I’m guessing her three boys think she’s the coolest. Speaking of cool, Hayli has THE dream job according to my son (and probably yours, too). She actually gets PAID to livestream herself playing video games on Twitch. Yes, that’s really a thing. She also happens to have written excellent fan fiction as a teen and still gives me the best book recommendations of anyone. And, she’s family. I can’t take any credit for her beauty or brains, as she’s my fiancé’s daughter, thus not blood-related. But, as soon as I learned she’d read the entire Harry Potter series more than anyone I’d ever met (or heard of!), I was deeply proud. Lol.  I’m excited to share this chat, with its many pearls, including how Tosca plots her suspense and thinks about each character’s arc within the three-act structure (and her two invaluable book recommendations on the subject). There’s her refreshing take on the thriller genre and how she recruits top experts for her research to make her work bulletproof (and how you can too!). I am also fascinated by her thoughts on how travel helps the writing mind play and wander; her description of dealing with the twin demons of fear and procrastination, and why letting someone see your writing before it’s ready is like allowing them to see your cellulite! We talk balancing writing time with platform building (social media); how her hot farmer husband handles her 20-hour writing days (and bakes cookies); what to do when an author friend writes a book you just don’t like; and how when her friends are mad at their mates, they\'ll ask her help in devising the perfect murder plot. If you love action, conspiracy, romance, and questions of whom—and what—to believe, you’re going to adore this high-octane story of survival and love in a world on the brink of madness (and its sequel, out in September). And, you’ll be taken with the sanity and sweetness of this killer author and her deep gratitude for her craft and her readers. I left this conversation more in love with books and writing them and know it will likewise inspire your reading and writing life.

Didn’t I just see Bradley Cooper do that with Lady Gaga in A Star is Born?!” Taylor’s memoir, Tell It To My Heart (named after one of her most popular ballads) pubs on Valentine’s Day and goes deep and vulnerable about topics you’d never guess by watching her career, starting with her tragic childhood in which her voice gave her the fire and inspiration to stay alive. Popular podcaster/TED producer/ media communications coach, Bronwyn Saglimbeni, is today’s guest co-host. I love this woman! She, like Taylor, is also a busy mom and business owner who happens to have a rockin’ rock band side hustle. Can you stand it? I’m such a singing wanna-be!Thank you for joining me for this magical conversation, punctuated by snippets of several of Taylor’s biggest hits. We’re going to talk about so much, not the least of which includes healing, the music industry, what it’s like to write brutal truths about family members who are still standing,  why standing on that TED or TEDWomen stage is as scary (or scarier!) than singing in a stadium, and learning to trust yourself—a challenge for us all. There’s no holding back here, and a whole heap of heart. We\'re so glad you’re here.Linda xoSupport the show | Jack Reacher’s back at #1! But that’s no surprise to the millions of “Reacher’s Creatures” who anxiously await each installment of this thriller series—23 at present count. With PAST TENSE (Delacorte Press), author Lee Child once again puts us on the edge of our seats and leaves us there, ensuring that our journey with this ex-military policeman turned drifter continues to live up to the Forbes magazine label as the "strongest brand in publishing.” It’s not every day I get to talk shop with a writer who’s sold over 100 million books. But what makes today’s interview especially THRILLING for me was getting to share the mic with my guest co-host, Tom Bergeron. Lucky for me, Tom’s day job with Dancing with the Stars just wrapped for the year and he had time. Time to brainstorm his dream literary guest with me and then make the intro. #BestJobEver. The result is one of my favorite conversations to date, and I hope yours too! Lee and Tom have cult followings the world over, but for very different personas. Lee and Jack Reacher (don’t even think of making me separate the two here) are formidable—towering, intimidating figures. Tom, on the other hand, is adored for his light, comedic personality and jokes that at least he’s taller than Tom Cruise (the star of several Reacher films). Of course, as you’ll see, Child is a blast to interview and Bergeron has a dark side (as is revealed via his recent turn to dramatic acting). But what most interested me here was talking with two icons at the top of their game. Few authors have the kind of rock-star financial or creative freedom Lee has created for himself. And, having formerly hosted both America’s Funniest Home Videos and Hollywood Squares (for which he won an Emmy), Tom has been part of three of the most popular TV shows of all time. For a girl who’s lived many years of her life within eyeshot of the Hollywood sign, that holds all kinds of gifts for me. Speaking of gifts! HAPPIEST and MERRIEST of holidays to you and yours, you guys. I can’t believe another year has flown by. I couldn’t imagine a better way to spend my time than here, with you, on this show. Thank you for listening. I feel so blessed. Until the New Year … Write On!

The story is built around a young boy growing up without parents in pre-civil war Hannibal, Missouri, in a house owned by two spinsters and run by unpaid black servants, yes, slaves.\xa0 We purposely do not use the "n" word as it is found distasteful to most, Take note parents, the times, around 1840, are different, and this group of young boys led by Huck\'s trouble-making and boisterous friend Tom Sawyer talk about robbing stagecoaches and finding ways to get into trouble. But Huck, who takes time to think things through, is often smart enough to see through the big talk that comes from Tom and choose the right path. Life on the Mississippi was anything but boring- unless you were an orphan boy stuck in a house with two spinster ladies trying to make sure you were walking the straight and narrow path.Overall the story that Huckleberry Finn tells us is innocent and full of adventure- enough that this book has often been called "America\'s greatest novel.\xa0Save at Ancestry now and discover your roots!

Set at the turn of the 19th century, Pride and Prejudice catches a perfect glimpse not only of a time when women were socially and economically dependent solely on their marital status, but also as an age of enlightenment and witness of the French Revolution.This romantic novel with its hint of comic references begins with the famous quote "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."This famous quotation sets the story into motion as the eligible Mr. Bingley is introduced as he rides into town. The quote also draws in and to some extent reveals the content of the plot to come. Soon the news of the arrival of the well off Charles Bingley finds its way to the ears of the Bennett household. Having five unmarried daughters, the Bennetts are eager to match them up with suitable spouse candidates and see them prosperously married. After attending a ball, Mr. Bingley is instantly attracted to the oldest Bennett daughter Jane and it is fair to say that the feeling is mutual. Such cannot be said about his close friend Mr. Darcy who rudely refuses to dance with the second Bennett daughter Elizabeth. Consequently, Elizabeth’s first prejudice is born as she labels Mr. Darcy arrogant and obnoxious; however, she later learns never to judge a book by its cover and must swallow up her pride to achieve happiness. Pride and Prejudice witnesses the exciting courtships of the Bennett sisters and their suitors, as well as the not so joyful relationships of other characters. As the novel develops the relationships between the characters must outweigh the forces seeking to tear them apart. Experience the adventures of the Bennett sisters as they face the troublesome issues of manners, social class, family, and marriages in a male reliant society. A story not only portraying the unreliable nature of pride and prejudice, Austen’s classic also paints a vivid image of the past and the woman as a member of society.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/a7/9a/4f/a79a4f65-0ff4-a13b-724a-e34699cd8cb9/mza_5015938246342506323.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-06'}}

"Never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow." – Mark Twain  We\'re all guilty of it, let\'s be honest, it\'s really normal to procrastinate. Who among us hasn\'t waited until the last minute to do something tedious or uncomfortable like contest a speeding ticket, study for a test? Today, you\'re far more likely to grab your smartphone and search longingly for those little red notification flags from a social media app, or to pop open a rainbow colored game for that quick hit of dopamine your brain loves so much. I\'m guilty of dusting and straightening every shelf and book in my office until they look conspicuously like modern art before I\'ll sit down to write an important email or a blog post. The truth is that procrastination is built into the human condition -- clearly we can\'t do everything on our to-do lists at the same time -- but why has it become so frowned upon in our culture of late? And how can we reframe procrastination since we know it\'s so integral to the creative process? Luckily, research scientist Michael Grybko returned to the podcast to help me find some answers from the perspective of neuroscience. Stay tuned ...

"To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time." - Leonard Bernstein  We\'re all guilty of it, let\'s be honest, it\'s really normal to procrastinate. Who among us hasn\'t waited until the last minute to do something tedious or uncomfortable like contest a speeding ticket, study for a test? Today, you\'re far more likely to grab your smartphone and search longingly for those little red notification flags from a social media app, or to pop open a rainbow colored game for that quick hit of dopamine your brain loves so much. I\'m guilty of dusting and straightening every shelf and book in my office until they look conspicuously like modern art before I\'ll sit down to write an important email or a blog post. The truth is that procrastination is built into the human condition -- clearly we can\'t do everything on our to-do lists at the same time -- but why has it become so frowned upon in our culture of late? And how can we reframe procrastination since we know it\'s so integral to the creative process? Luckily, research scientist Michael Grybko returned to the podcast to help me find some answers from the perspective of neuroscience. Stay tuned ...

We’ll kick off the show with the iconic, international bestselling author of 14 novels, including the era-defining Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture – Douglas Coupland – with his thoughts on the subject.  "I don\'t believe in writer\'s block. Think about it -- when you were blocked in college and had to write a paper, didn\'t it always manage to fix itself the night before the paper was due? Writer\'s block is having too much time on your hands." – Jodi Picoult  Last year I wrote a piece for Copyblogger titled "How to Outsmart Writer’s Block with Neuroscience" – there are lots of good resources embedded there – and that piece explored a handful of solutions to the accursed ailment. I wanted to revisit it here with some past podcast guests thrown in for humor and context. As you know if you’ve listened to enough of The Writer Files, I dig into the habits, habitats and brains of dozens of renowned and prolific authors, and I ask them roughly the same questions about their unique process as a survey of contemporary writers. We’ve always billed the podcast as a hybrid of "Inside the Writer’s Studio" meets "The Proust Questionnaire," and this makes for a treasure trove of knowledge to pick and choose from for writers. And just a reminder that you can find the entire archive at writerfiles.fm, where you can also support the show by just clicking the little yellow PayPal donation button on any of the episodes. So we’ll kick it off with a little refresher course on the miracle of the human brain. Stay tuned ...

"Somehow, despite having made a career of helping writers with their second and third and fourth drafts, I must have been harboring hopes that my first try would displace Shakespeare from his perch atop the literary pantheon." – Peter Guzzardi  Peter has been a professional book editor for nearly 40 years. After getting his start in marketing, writing catalog copy in New York City, he moved to the editorial side where he eventually took the reins at Harmony Books, an imprint of Random House, Inc. Mr. Guzzardi has worked with some incredibly talented authors over the years, including Stephen Hawking on A Brief History of Time, Deepak Chopra on dozens of books, Douglas Adams on his Hitchhiker novels, Carol Burnett, Martin Amis, Arianna Huffington, and even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Like so many aspiring writers who "swear they\'re going to finally write that book," Peter decided to throw his hat in the ring and write about the wisdom he\'d accumulated on his own journey. The result of that hard work is his recently published Emeralds of Oz: Life Lessons From Over the Rainbow, an apropos title for 2019, the 80th anniversary of the film classic, The Wizard of Oz. Emeralds of Oz is a book in the "...tradition of All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten ... life lessons drawn from the most beloved movie of all time," and Carol Burnett said, "I loved this book as much as I loved the movie."

In that way it’s a story of expanding circle, like tossing a stone into a pond and observing the ripples outward. Ishta talks of searching for those right words that feel good in your mouth. The result is a poetic text that mimics in feeling the patterned and precise and vibrant illustrations Jen created. Jen comments that the work she was doing at the time on the book felt innate and that she had in mind the science and math that surrounds us all the time. What we are left to hold in our hand is a book and a story that resonates out to readers and out through readers.

We talk about culture and tradition and family and history. We also talk a lot about Kevin’s Aunt Fannie. There is a story behind the entire nature of fry bread and the way Kevin’s text approaches that story is through affirmation statements of what fry bread is and what it means. The book’s narrator walks the readers from the concrete and tangible into the abstract and ineffable, and the journey is helped along with great care from Juana’s beautiful illustrations. The way this book’s characters are in relation to one another, at times following, or playing, or participating, or listening draws out an intimacy in their togetherness, and it’s in that intimacy that the reader is invited into this experience. Kevin reminds us all in this conversation that there are many different ways that people can be Native, and I think it’s fair to say that this author-illustrator pairing accomplishes that message beautifully. There is also wonderful and robust narrative back matter waiting for readers of any age to explore and expand their knowledge even further. In short, this book has a bounty of goodness to go around and I think you will find yourself quite comforted and cared for and brought into the story, allowing space for you, in turn to comfort and care for and bring closer those cultures and customs of our Indigenous brothers and sisters so that they may be honored and respected.

This picture book biography of the great jazz legend Miles Davis and his journey to find a sound that was beautifully and uniquely his own. That sound took him places. That sound was the birth of the cool. Keith’s depiction of Miles Davis is art that shouts music, and art that lives and breathes its subject matter. We follow Miles through childhood and into his formative years, through success to the threat of being forgotten to history and back out again on the stage of the Newport Jazz Festival. It’s a story rich with means and desire and the reminder that we all have to face something in this life.

With more than 75,000 registered Little Free Libraries (LFLs) in eighty-eight countries around the world, there is great chance you’ve passed an LFL in your neighborhood at some point. This simple idea designed to build and support community around reading provides no-cost access to books any time of day and they’ve been popping up in some really unexpected locations, including restaurants, grocery stores, and barbershops as well as those you’ll find nestled into neighborhoods. I was not aware of LFLs’ founders, Todd Bol and Rick Brooks, or that the idea took some time to finally take root.\xa0 Reading Miranda’s story feels part love letter to the LFL founders and part reminder that we all have the capacity to be heroes in our neighborhoods. The text in this story is straightforward and empowering, and John Parra’s art brings something more in the form of seamlessly blending together the dreaming and the doing. It’s a book you will want to put in readers’ hands over and over. You can access even more information about this book and its author by visiting\xa0www.matthewcwinner.com/podcast.

There’s a bit of a conference din hovering throughout the background of this recording, but there is also a whole lot of humor and a whole lot of heart. As Shannon shares about making books with Dean, “we coauthor a lot of things, and some are alive”!\xa0We were in the middle of a very huge exhibit hall at the American Library Association’s annual conference in Washington DC this past June. We had just recorded a live episode with Cece Bell and Kate DiCamillo on a great big stage in front of a whole bunch of super nice people who got up early in the morning to join us. The exhibit hall was just getting busy with crowds and signing lines and giveaways and sales pitches. And we snuck into some unmarked tabled area behind some big heavy curtains, because that’s how we roll.

There are more conversations about gender going on than perhaps ever before, but there are also lots and lots of adults and kids alike who are not quite sure exactly how to talk about gender. In Theresa and Noah’s debut picture book, readers meet four different children who each identify differently from one another in terms of gender. The narrator introduces each child by sharing how that child identifies now and how that may have changed, then the narrator provides language to help describe each of these varying gender identities. As we discuss in the conversation, the narrator is that of a guide and onlooker with us, the readers, but the narrator also uses lots of non-definitive language in order to help communicate the fluidity and varied nature of gender identity.\xa0 Theresa puts it best when she says, “We all have a sense of gender that belongs to us”. I hope that you, dear listener, find that there is space for you in this conversation as well. And for your students, your friends, and your family members.

Awâsis is bringing some of her Kôhkum’s bannock to a relative but she accidentally drops the world-famous bannock off a bridge. She meets several forest relatives on her way back to Kôhkum including a duck,\xa0 a rabbit, a frog, an owl, and a bear. And while each is not able to provide bannock, one-by-one the forest relatives offer comfort and generosity in the form of ingredients. Dallas speaks to me about the importance of putting Cree first when writing this story. He also shares a brief and complex history of bannock, an important food to Indigenous people, both now and during historic times of massive and purposeful starvation. There is so much to talk about in this beautiful, beautiful picture book. You can access even more information about this book and its author by visiting\xa0www.matthewcwinner.com/podcast.

In Adib’s debut novel we meet Darius, a nerdy, overweight, Iranian-American boy who you will love deeply from the outset. I was rooting for Darius hour by hour as I listened to this audiobook, and what I was left with each time I paused to step away from the story was the picture of a complex if not broken kid who is seeking the realest connection to those around him, but feels perhaps like he’ll be denied it because he’s not what he thinks others want him to be. But perhaps I’m putting too much of myself onto the story and onto my description here. Because Darius was a character with whom I identified with strongly. The book, as Adib puts it, is a love story of a friendship.\xa0You can access even more information about this book and its author by visiting\xa0www.matthewcwinner.com/podcast.

LUCA’S BRIDGE is a border story. It is a family story. It is a story that centers on the universal language of emotion. Luca is an American citizen, but his parents are not. And when his parents are deported, the whole family must leave, which means Luca is forced to leave his own country in order to go to a country he has never known where people speak a language he has never spoken. But there’s hope.

S. Lewis\' An Experiment in Criticism with a recap of the terms that Lewis defines in chapters 5-7, starting with myth. They talk about what it means to have an "extra-literary" experience and how to cultivate the proper attitude of a good reader. Next Cindy and Angelina dig into the definition and benefits of literary fantasy versus the dangers of morbid fantasy. They talk about our deep need for stories of "the other" and have experiences with people and places that are not the same as our own.   Another big topic of conversation is the idea of literature being escapist, particularly fantasy and fairy stories. Angelina and Cindy talk about several things related to this idea: belief and disbelief, fiction versus nonfiction, and the wonder of childhood. Cindy brings up Lewis\' comments on the comic and what relation that has to the current popularity of the graphic novel. Angelina also explains why we shouldn\'t be looking to directly relate to a character in a novel in order to get something out of the book.  A Moment   by Mary Elizabeth Coleridge   The clouds had made a crimson crown Above the mountains high. The stormy sun was going down In a stormy sky.

S. Lewis’ An Experiment in Criticism. Next, we will dive into Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen, applying the principles we have learned as we read. Angelina and Cindy discuss Lewis’ approach to literature and the point of this book being a critique more of readers than of books. Some main ideas they bring out of the first chapter are the importance of rereading, the fact that real readers will carve out time for books, how books have the power to change us, and the way readers can’t help but talk about books. Cindy highlights the connection between Lewis critique of the literati and Mr. Bons in “The Celestial Omnibus.” Angelina talks about the challenge of keeping the love of literature for those whose profession it is to teach it, especially in the modern American university culture. Our hosts discuss the idea of reading to improve oneself as opposed to submitting to the experience of reading a challenging book. Angelina makes the point that it is about motive and whether or not you are trying to control the outcome. The benefits are the byproducts. From chapter 3, Angelina and Cindy contemplate how we approach art and the need to get ourselves out of the way so that we can enter the work of art. Finally, they cover the five characteristics of the unliterary reader according to Lewis. The Man He Killed by Thomas Hardy “Had he and I but met \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0By some old ancient inn, We should have sat us down to wet \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right many a nipperkin! “But ranged as infantry, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0And staring face to face, I shot at him as he at me, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0And killed him in his place. “I shot him dead because — \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Because he was my foe, Just so: my foe of course he was; \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That’s clear enough; although “He thought he’d ‘list, perhaps, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Off-hand like — just as I — Was out of work — had sold his traps — \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No other reason why. “Yes; quaint and curious war is! \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You shoot a fellow down You’d treat if met where any bar is, \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Or help to half-a-crown.” Book List: This is the Story of a Happy Marriage by Ann Patchett Paradise Lost by John Milton Bleak House by Charles Dickens Phantastes by George MacDonald A Good Man is Hard to Find by Flannery O’Connor Support The Literary Life: Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on\xa0Patreon, and get some amazing bonus content!

A composer, music minister, and the president of New College Franklin, Greg has also been friends with both Cindy and Angelina for several years. After sharing their commonplace quotes, and all the meaty discussion that surrounded the topics in those quotes, Cindy asks Greg when he became aware that he was a reader. Greg talks about growing up in a reading family, as well as the influence of his high school English teacher.   During his college years, Greg minored in English, and he tells about his favorite professor and the great works he had the privilege to study. Cindy, Angelina and Greg chat about building a library without letting reading and book-buying becoming too much of an obsession. Greg also talks about his strategies to keep reading widely and get himself out of a reading slump. Angelina and Greg agree on the value of reading for pleasure as well as work and keeping track of what type of books you are dipping into daily. Cindy also asks Greg the million dollar question--to name a few of his favorite authors.    Arabia   by Walter de la Mare   Far are the shades of Arabia, Where the Princes ride at noon, \'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets, Under the ghost of the moon; And so dark is that vaulted purple Flowers in the forest rise And toss into blossom \'gainst the phantom stars Pale in the noonday skies.   Sweet is the music of Arabia In my heart, when out of dreams I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn Descry her gliding streams; Hear her strange lutes on the green banks Ring loud with the grief and delight Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians In the brooding silence of night.   They haunt me — her lutes and her forests; No beauty on earth I see But shadowed with that dream recalls Her loveliness to me: Still eyes look coldly upon me, Cold voices whisper and say — \'He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia, They have stolen his wits away.\'   Book List: (Amazon Affiliate Links)   The Order of Things by James Schall   The Educated Imagination by Northrup Frye   The Measure of My Days by Florida Scott-Maxwell   How to Eat Fried Worms by Thomas Rockwell   The Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

Today your hosts Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins are joined once again by Thomas Banks for their discussion of Samuel Johnson\'s essay "The Vulture." Before getting into the meat of the essay, Angelina talks about why she disagrees with her own commonplace quote on the purpose of poetry. In the process, she gives us a brief history of literary periods from the classical to the neoclassical and enlightenment.   Thomas shares some more biographical information on Samuel Johnson and his work. Cindy highlights both the important place and the danger of satire, which is a popular neoclassical form and the one used in Johnson\'s essay. The discussion ends with thoughts on why Johnson\'s essay was finally not included with the others in The Idler collection, as well as what his purpose may have been in writing "The Vulture."   Be sure to tune in again on September 17, 2019 for "The Literary Life of Greg Wilbur," followed by three weeks of episodes on C. S. Lewis\' An Experiment in Criticism. Our fall novel will be Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen.    Upcoming Events:   September 19: How to Love Poetry Webinar with Thomas Banks   A Farewell to Arms   by George Peele   His golden locks Time hath to silver turn\'d; O Time too swift, O swiftness never ceasing! His youth \'gainst time and age hath ever spurn\'d, But spurn\'d in vain; youth waneth by increasing: Beauty, strength, youth, are flowers but fading seen; Duty, faith, love, are roots, and ever green.   His helmet now shall make a hive for bees; And, lovers\' sonnets turn\'d to holy psalms, A man-at-arms must now serve on his knees, And feed on prayers, which are Age his alms: But though from court to cottage he depart, His Saint is sure of his unspotted heart.   And when he saddest sits in homely cell, He\'ll teach his swains this carol for a song,-- \'Blest be the hearts that wish my sovereign well, Curst be the souls that think her any wrong.\' Goddess, allow this aged man his right To be your beadsman now that was your knight.

M. Forster. Angelina and Cindy tell why they love this short story so much and how it encapsulates their own ideas about literature. Thomas gives us some biographical background on E. M. Forster. We get a brief look at the plot of the story, as well as some discussion of how allegorical Forster makes this story. Angelina highlights the idea presented in “The Celestial Omnibus” that what we see in fairy land is more real than what we see in our own world. Other themes our hosts bring up include modern educational theory, wonder and innocence, using poetry versus enjoying it, and literary critique contrasted with experiencing literature. Their conversation hinges around the contrast between Mr. Bons’ pride and pretension and the boy’s humility and sincerity. This story embodies everything that The Literary Life podcast is all about, so we hope you enjoy both the story and this episode! Summer of the Short Story: Ep 18: “Vulture on War” by Samuel Johnson Upcoming Events: September 22: How to Love Poetry Webinar with Thomas Banks Port of Aerial Embarkation by John Ciardi There is no widening distance at the shore— The sea revolving slowly from the piers— But the one border of our take-off roar And we are mounted on the hemispheres. Above the waning moon whose almanac We wait to finish continents away, The Northern stars already call us back, And silence folds like maps on all we say. Under the sky, a stadium tensed to cry The ringside savage thrumming of the fights, We watch our engines, taut and trained for sky, Arranged on fields of concrete flowered with lights. Day after day we fondle and repeat A jeweler’s adjustment on a screw; Or wander past the bulletins to meet And wander back to watch the sky be blue. Somehow we see ourselves in photographs Held in our hands to show us back our pride When, aging, we recall in epitaphs The faces just behind and to each side. The nights keep perfect silence. In the dark You feel the faces soften into sleep, Or tense upon the fraught and falling arc Of fear a boy had buried not too deep. Finally we stand by and consciously Measure the double sense of all our talk, And, everyman his dramatist, anxiously Corrects his role, his gesture, and his walk.

Angelina and Cindy kick off the conversation about how much they each identify with Orwell\'s description of his childhood. In his story of learning to write, we see many aspects of a good education, even his inclination to imitate other authors. An important point Angelina brings up is Orwell\'s own struggle against the calling he felt to write, in contrast to having an ambition to do so. Angelina brings up a related story about musician Gregory Alan Isakov, and Cindy reiterates the idea of why we need leisure in order to find our vocation.   Cindy and Angelina also bring out some of the qualities Orwell possessed that make a good writer. Maturity as a human being and as a master of a craft are crucial to certain forms of writing, as Orwell points out about his own work. Other topics of conversation include truth-telling in writing, the motives for writing according to Orwell, and the growing process of writers.

O, Source of uncreated Light, The Father\'s promis\'d Paraclete! Thrice Holy Fount, thrice Holy Fire, Our hearts with heav\'nly love inspire; Come, and thy Sacred Unction bring To sanctify us, while we sing!

Chase from our minds th\' Infernal Foe; And peace, the fruit of love, bestow; And, lest our feet should step astray, Protect, and guide us in the way.   Make us Eternal Truths receive, And practise, all that we believe: Give us thy self, that we may see The Father and the Son, by thee.   Immortal honour, endless fame, Attend th\' Almighty Father\'s name: The Saviour Son be glorified, Who for lost Man\'s redemption died: And equal adoration be, Eternal Paraclete, to thee.

Before getting into the short story discussion, Cindy and Angelina chat about what a "commonplace book" is and how they each go about recording quotes and thoughts, including the QuoteBlock app.   First off, Angelina gives us a little background on the author Guy de Maupassant and some information on French naturalism. Then she digs into her thoughts on how this story is a fairy tale in reverse and what that might mean in context. Cindy points out the perfection of de Maupassant\'s writing and his economy of style. They also bring up some of the formal elements of the story, particularly the key role the reversal takes in the plot. The main themes they find in "The Necklace" touch on common human struggles with ambition, discontentment, loss, suffering and gratitude.

The conversation today kicks off with an attempt at defining the "essay" form and giving a brief history on its development. Thomas shares a little background information on Joseph Addison and his writing, as well as several other essayists who came before and after Addison. Thomas also talks about why essays are a significant part of his reading life. The conversation also spins off into a discussion of the importance of how we spend our leisure time.   Finally, our hosts chat about this week\'s essay, which gives highlights of England\'s history from the perspective of a silver coin. Addison\'s tale is full of humor and satire, as well as layers of social commentary and pathos.

After a great chat over their commonplace quotes, Angelina and Cindy dig into this week’s short story, “The Garden Party.” They start with how Cindy found this story and the connections she was making to Little Women. Angelina gives a brief biographical sketch of Katherine Mansfield and highlights how Mansfield’s own illness and death give us insight into how she deals with death in this story. Angelina walks us through how she looks at the use of figurative language and images, such as the Garden of Eden. They also touch on “The Garden Party” having the same structure of moving toward a moment of epiphany that we saw in “Araby.” Cindy brings up the disconnect between the world of the women at home and the working people outside the home, as well as between the classes in this story. They talk about the importance of Laura’s new hat as a symbol of one type of person she can become. Another image that Angelina and Cindy take a look at is the descent from the garden into darkness. They discuss the parallels from the beginning of the story and the end of the story, as well as Laura’s movement from innocence to experience, from blindness to sight.

Forster Ep 18: “Vulture on War” by Samuel Johnson The Truly Great by Stephen Spender I think continually of those who were truly great. Who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history Through corridors of light, where the hours are suns, Endless and singing. Whose lovely ambition Was that their lips, still touched with fire, Should tell of the Spirit, clothed from head to foot in song. And who hoarded from the Spring branches The desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.  What is precious, is never to forget The essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs Breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth. Never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light Nor its grave evening demand for love. Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother With noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.  Near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields, See how these names are fêted by the waving grass And by the streamers of white cloud And whispers of wind in the listening sky. The names of those who in their lives fought for life, Who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre. Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun And left the vivid air signed with their honour. Copyright © 1955 by Stephen Spender.

K. Chesterton’s essay “A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls.” Before diving in to today’s episode, don’t forget to register for the amazing Back to School online conference coming up on August 26-29, 2019! Angelina opens with a brief history of the Victorian era and the more prevalent availability of the novel to the masses. She also gives several examples of the “penny dreadful.” Cindy and Angelina discuss why they agree with Chesterton that people need these simple, even formulaic stories. They remind us that childhood is a time for good books, not a time to worry about reading all the “Great Books.” Another topic that Cindy and Angelina chat about is the importance of developing imagination. They talk about the truth that fiction and story-telling are necessary parts of human culture. Cindy highlights the importance of the heroic adventure stories for boys. Angelina brings out the point that the elite critic is out of touch with the masses who long for stories of good winning over evil. The penny dreadful should not be judged as art, since that was never what it was intended to be. Summer of the Short Story: Ep 13: “The Garden Party” by Katherine Mansfield Ep 14: “Adventures of a Shilling” by Joseph Addison Ep 15: “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant Ep 16: “Why I Write” by George Orwell Ep 17: “The Celestial Omnibus” by E. M. Forster Ep 18: “Vulture on War” by Samuel Johnson Bavarian Gentians by D. H. Lawrence Not every man has gentians in his house in Soft September, at slow, Sad Michaelmas. Bavarian gentians, big and dark, only dark darkening the daytime torchlike with the smoking blueness of Pluto’s gloom, ribbed and torchlike, with their blaze of darkness spread blue down flattening into points, flattened under the sweep of white day torch-flower of the blue-smoking darkness, Pluto’s dark-blue daze, black lamps from the halls of Dis, burning dark blue, giving off darkness, blue darkness, as Demeter’s pale lamps give off light, lead me then, lead me the way. Reach me a gentian, give me a torch let me guide myself with the blue, forked torch of this flower down the darker and darker stairs, where blue is darkened on blueness. even where Persephone goes, just now, from the frosted September to the sightless realm where darkness was awake upon the dark and Persephone herself is but a voice or a darkness invisible enfolded in the deeper dark of the arms Plutonic, and pierced with the passion of dense gloom, among the splendor of torches of darkness, shedding darkness on the lost bride and groom.

The Dark Tower began with King\'s 1982 novel The Gunslinger, and unfolded over the course of seven numbered books and 22 years, a sprawling saga of wild west outlaws and powerful sorcery, of a quest through ages and a tower that spans universes. That would be a massive creation for any author, but King\'s Dark Tower is unique in that it\'s a world that keeps bleeding into and crossing over with his other stories in ways large and small, so that the Dark Tower\'s Mid-World begins to look like a secret network of passageways that interlink King\'s entire body of work. Liz Braswell, Louis Peitzman and Bill Tipper are joined for this conversation by B&N Science Fiction and Fantasy blog editor Joel Cunningham, who has spent more time in the Dark Tower world than any of the rest of us. | Our guest on the B&N podcast today is none other than Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness.\xa0 Van Ness\'s brand new new memoir is titled  Over the Top and that title resonates with the dramatic, witty, and scene-stealing persona that fans of the show have come to know — but it\'s the subtitle, A Raw Journey to Self-Love — that really says volumes about this engaging and revealing new book. Van Ness charts the tumultuous course of a life growing up in a small town, navigating the world of a queer teen without role models, and finding a way forward — first as a hairstylist, and then as a performer, comedian, podcast host and TV star. In Over the Top, Van Ness is absolutely candid about abuse and addiction and talks openly about living with HIV — it\'s a book that\'s dead set against a culture of silence and shame about the facts of life. And when Jonathan Van Ness joined us in the studio — just as Over the Top was being published — he was just as forthcoming in person as he is on the page. |  The Testaments is Margaret Atwood\'s long-awaited return to the world and characters of her 1985 classic The Handmaid\'s Tale, a dystopian novel set in a fictional near-future theocracy called Gilead, a nation in which religious fundamentalists wield absolute power, and which organizes itself chiefly around the subjugation of women. Atwood\'s literary career has been among the most prolific and wide-ranging among novelists of her generation — a short sampling of her notable works includes Cat\'s Eye, Alias Grace, The Blind Assassin, The Robber Bride and the MaddAddam Trilogy — The Handmaid\'s Tale and the story of its narrator Offred has resonated with readers through decades. It\'s acquired a fresh generation of readers since becoming the basis for a television adaptation on the streaming platform Hulu. So it\'s no exaggeration to say that readers worldwide were exultant to learn that this fall Atwood would return to Gilead and to some of its characters in her new novel The Testaments. And the resulting book is no disappointment, a story of intrigue and struggle to survive that both reflects our fears for how close our future might be to the dangers Atwood signals — and offers a vision of the humanity that is not only capable of endurance, but resistance. Atwood spoke with B&N\'s Miwa Messer about what it meant to return to the dark and compelling world she\'s brought into life in a book we\'ve been thrilled to name a Barnes & Noble Book Club selection. | On this episode of King of the Dark, Louis Peitzman, Liz Braswell and Bill Tipper turn from the grand scale of Stephen King\'s dark epics to the supremely concentrated pleasures of his short fiction. King has published over 200 works of short fiction, most of which have been collected in volumes including  Night Shift,  Skeleton Crew,  Everything\'s Eventual and others. In many of these — especially some of the earlier stories collected in Night Shift and Skeleton Crew\xa0— the master is at his elemental best, spinning tales that take just a few pages to cast a spell that lasts long after the short, sharp shock of the ending has been delivered. So we decided it was time to devote an episode to the glorious — and some times a little gory — work in miniature that is the classic King short story. | Today our guest is the spellbinding storyteller Ann Patchett, joining \xa0us to talk about her new novel  The Dutch House. \xa0Patchett is the author of a treasure trove of fiction including 2011\'s State of Wonder, and 2016\'s Commonwealth, but she may be most widely known for her award-winning 2002 novel Bel Canto, which crafted a symphonic and deeply humane multi-character story amid an embassy hostage crisis. \xa0She\'s also the author of the widely lauded memoir Truth and Beauty, a wide-ranging essayist, and a bookseller, the co-founder of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she lives. \xa0In The Dutch House, Patchett plunges readers into the story of Danny and Maeve, a brother and sister whose lives are bound up in the memory of the house they once lived in and the splintering of their family. Patchett joined B&N\'s Miwa Messer by phone to talk about composing on her feet, sibling bonds, and what it means to find a home. | Welcome to episode fifteen of King of the Dark, our special series on the B&N Podcast devoted to the worlds of Stephen King. It\'s big week for us — Louis Peitzman, Liz Braswell and Bill Tipper started with King\'s 1974 bestseller Carrie and now we\'ve arrived at his latest novel,  The Institute, which was published just last week, on September 10th. It\'s a story packed with themes that will be familiar to King\'s fans — the story concerns a group of children who possess psychic talents, a drifter who finds a fresh start in a small town, and a government conspiracy willing to stop at nothing. But it\'s also about kids banding together against grotesque forces, about uncertain journeys across America, the ease with which the powerful exploit human weakness, and the unheralded strength in the bonds of friendship, shot through with humor, horror, incredible tension and an eye for workaday cruelties and unexpected moments of beauty. In other words, vintage Stephen King. A quick warning: Spoilers Ahead! If you haven\'t read The Institute yet, definitely pause and devour before listening. | Our guest on this episode is author and cartoonist Randall Munroe, author of the new book  How To: Absurd Advice for Common Real-World Problems. Munroe became an internet legend via his webcomic XKCD, a daily feature published since 2005 in which a cast of stick figures take on the conundrums of 21st-century living via a mixture of scientific analysis, wry humor, and absolutely unpredictable creativity. It\'s inspired flash mobs, taught lessons in radiation exposure and password security, and coined the immortal phrase "someone is wrong on the internet." Munroe\'s scientific background is no joke — he\'s a former NASA roboticist — and he became a bestselling author in 2014 with his book What If, which used science to answer readers\' wild questions like "could you make a jetpack out of machine guns." In How To, Munroe applies science to the everyday — but uses Rube Goldberg concepts to find the most unnecessarily complicated, difficult, and expensive way to do everything from charging your phone to making friends. But as he explains to B&N\'s Bill Tipper sometimes it\'s the long way around that gets you where you need to go. | Welcome back to King of the Dark, our special series on the B&N Podcast, a journey through the gloriously shadowy fiction of Stephen King. On today\'s episode, we\'re not quite caught up to the author\'s brand new release  The Institute — we\'ll be talking about that one next week. This week, we\'re looking at 2013\'s  Doctor Sleep\xa0— a marvelous novel that is both a sequel to his classic  The Shining and a bewitching tale all on its own. Danny Torrance, the psychically gifted little boy of The Shining, is now an adult, tormented by some of the same addictions that plagued his father, but working to fight his demons in every sense of the word. Dan uses his abilities — his Shining, you might recall — is to help the dying find peace, but when he meets a young girl named Abra with talents like his, he also discovers the plot of a terrifying secret society called The True Knot — and they have plans for Abra and all children like her. If you didn\'t think that The Shining would lead us to a page-turning thriller about psychic vampires, alcoholism and recovery, and one of the most compelling villains ever to put on a top hat, well, when did Stephen King ever fail to surprise? | On today\'s episode of the B&N Podcast we were joined by one of the most influential writers in the world, whose books examine how humans think and behave in ways large and small. As a staff writer for the New Yorker and in his books The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, and David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell, as well as in his podcast Revisionist History, Gladwell has marshaled the tools of an array of sciences to challenge conventional wisdom about everything from how to spot an art forgery to what makes a basketball team succeed. His new book  Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don\'t Know is his first in six years, and its origin, Gladwell writes, was in the author\'s confrontation with the perplexing, tragic and infuriating events that led to the death of Sandra Bland in a Texas jail in 2015. When author joined B&N\'s Bill Tipper in the studio, he explained how his outrage over Bland\'s story led to the questions raised in Talking to Strangers. | Welcome back to King of the Dark, our special series on the B&N Podcast, celebrating and exploring the fictional worlds of Stephen King. Every week for this limited series Liz Braswell and Louis Peitzman join Bill Tipper as they ready through many of King\'s most fascinating, enduring, and sometimes enigmatic creations, including Carrie, The Shining, It, Misery and many more, talking along the way about their adaptations and the connections between them. We\'ve arrived this week at 2011\'s bestselling  11/22/63 — a take on the perennial question: if you could travel back in time and change one thing, what would it be? In 11/22/63, King wraps his imagination around the assassination of JFK and creates an almost literal doorway into the past. The result is a love letter to midcentury America and King\'s unique twist on an enduring theme in speculative fiction. In this episode Liz, Louis and Bill talk about 11/22/63\'s link between domestic abuse and political violence, the story\'s surprising connection with the world of It, and one character\'s ingenious use of time travel to keep his diner open.', 'chan_desc': "Every author has a story beyond the one that they put down on paper.

My guest today is philosopher Catherine Wilson, author of the book How to be an Epicurean: The Ancient Art of Living Well. At a confusing cultural moment where many people are looking for a guiding framework, she’s here with a strident defense of Epicureanism as a way of life.

After all, we’re all stuck in our own time, limited by our culture, consciousness, and whatever knowledge we may possess of what came before. Maybe that explains part of the appeal of historical fiction like the series Downton Abbey, set in a great Edwardian country house in the early 20th century. My guest today is stage and screen Director Michael Engler. He’s the director of the new Downton Abbey feature film, and he directed episodes of Downton Abbey, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, 30 Rock and much more for TV. Meticulously recreating one corner of Edwardian England and building original story worlds within it, Downton Abbey is part romantic comedy, part historical drama grappling with the tensions of class and society at the sunset of empire.

It has one purpose: to get you away from where you are right now.” That is from the very, very weird tale Car Concentrate from Israeli writer Etgar Keret’s wonderful new collection of short stories called FLY ALREADY. It’s not a bad description of the situation most of Keret’s characters find themselves in—wriggling like butterflies stuck on the pins of their own minds or circumstances, trying by any means necessary to get free. It’s maybe not too much even to say that this is the human condition as Keret sees it and the reason he writes stories—to open up magical escape hatches in the midst of suffocating realities like divorce or religious hatred. His stories are strange, beautiful, funny, and poignant—somehow emotionally connected even though they’re full of people who struggle to make sense to (and of) one another. Like all great art, they defy description, so ignore everything I’ve just said and go read them…but first, stick around for a bit to see what kind of escape tunnel this conversation might turn into.\xa0 Surprise conversation starters in this episode: Michio Kaku on uploading your consciousness and traveling to other planetsLearn more about your ad choices.

First it’s scary, then you settle in to a rhythm, then you hit your stride, then you get too attached to things being the way they are. For a while there I thought I could only record an episode of this show sitting in a particular chair facing a particular direction. When that kind of thing happens, it’s time to shake things up. So today’s show was recorded 5000 miles away from my comfy New York studio, in my wife’s hometown of Istanbul, Turkey. We took a ferry from the European to the Asian side of the city, to the neighborhood of Kadikoy. There we met Chef Musa Dağdeviren—a one of a kind of food ethnographer who’s trying to preserve techniques and recipes from Turkey’s vast and diverse culinary history before they disappear forever. We ate at his restaurant Ciya Sofrasi and talked to him afterward in the offices of Yemek Ve Kultur (food and culture), the magazine he’s been publishing for the past 15 years. Musa is a man on an ambitious labor of love—a mission his mom gave him as a small child to investigate, understand, and pass on this knowledge. He’s totally unlike anyone I’ve ever met, and I’m happy to share this very different episode with you. THE TURKISH COOKBOOK — Musa’s vast compendium for an English speaking audience. Comprehensive as it is, it contains less than half of the 1500+ recipes he’s collected in his travels. More to come!

The selection and sequence of songs were a kind of message to the listener that left plenty of space for their own thoughts and feelings. Back in June Think Again hit its fourth year and its 200th show and it feels like the right time to take a step back and revisit some of the places the conversation has gone this past year. I’m intuitive rather than strategic about choosing guests for the show and books to read—when it works, it’s an art rather than a science. And as with any art, themes emerge and recur in different guises. In this episode, I’m putting together some of my favorite moments of 2019, strung together with minimal interruption from me. So kick back and enjoy this eclectic collection, and feel free to write me through my website jasongots.com and let me know your thoughts, feelings, and insights. Or send me a mixtape of your own!

Ok, Raise your hand if you thought of your brain.If you did, you’re in good company. For centuries, Western science, culture, and language has been obsessed with the head as the center of thought and the body as the center of feeling. This split can get hierarchical, attaching ideas like “sin” and\xa0 to the body and the emotions while putting the brain, along with rationality, up on a pedestal. I’m very happy to be speaking again today with neuroscientist and philosopher Antonio Damasio, who has done more than anyone one else I know to get that brain down off its high horse and reattach it to the body. We last talked a year ago, about his book THE STRANGE ORDER OF THINGS - Life, Feeling, and the Making of Cultures, which has now come out in paperback. It turns everything upside down, not only re-anchoring mind in body, but finding in primitive bacteria and social insects patterns that help explain human culture. Maybe there’s more going on in the Mona Lisa than in a bacterial colony, but they also have quite a lot in common.

I can still remember the sense of friendly reassurance from that smiling little icon that popped up on the screen when you turned it on—a cute, tiny computer smiling back at you. This device, it suggested, knew you. Understood you. Was someone you could trust. Since then, we’ve come a long way, baby. The cold, black, addictive rectangle in my pocket—a gleaming window into all the hopes and terrors of the known world—is a far cry from the early, friendly promises of that smiling machine on which I could magically paint things at the touch of a button. My guest today, in a very different way, grew up in the long shadow of that same cultural trajectory. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, was her dad. But like our relationship with the machines he helped unleash on the world, hers with him was deeply complicated. In her beautiful memoir Small Fry, Lisa Brennan-Jobs writes about his indifference, his attention, and her struggle to find herself in and outside of his shadow.

Although there were some fun moments looking at the inappropriate novelty items like at Spencer Gifts, such as edible underwear, the mall in my memory is a symbol of suburban anomie and alienation. A place, as my guest today would put it, without context. The woods, on the other hand, were endless and full of surprises. We’d follow the twisting creek, overturn rocks to find crawfish, and eat sassafras leaves. Once we made Molotov cocktails out of my mom’s nail polish and threw them into the creek with pure, anarchic joy. In the woods, I was always, utterly present—connected to every sound and attuned to the slightest movement. In the mall, I was mostly conscious of whether or not my jacket looked cool. I’m here today with Jenny Odell. She’s an artist and educator who grew up in Silicon Valley and teaches at Stanford, the heart of the attention economy that’s colonizing more and more of the cultural woods. She’s also an avid bird watcher—or “bird noticer”, as she might put it. Her wonderful new book HOW TO DO NOTHING: RESISTING THE ATTENTION ECONOMY is something like a primer for growing the woods inside the mall. It’s about carving out space for ourselves in a world that wants to put our time and our lives to other, more utilitarian uses.\xa0 Surprise conversation starters in this episode: Edward Slingerland on the Taoist concept of Wu Wei and how it plays out in Chinese business culture\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

Priests drink—at least in the movies—but mostly not in bars . . . So maybe nobody walks into a bar? How, when, and where are we all supposed to figure out how to get along? My guest today, who also happens to be an old, good friend of mine, has an answer, or several. He’s Jeffrey Israel—a professor of Religion at Williams College and the author of a new book Living with Hate in American Politics and Religion. He argues that pluralistic societies like the United States need two uneasy siblings: a strong political will to recognize and protect our common humanity and also “play spaces” where we can give rein to the difficult feelings- anger, resentment, even hate- that can’t be erased by politics, a Beatles song, or just by wishing them away. In his generous and provocative book, Jeff mines Jewish-American humor from Lenny Bruce, Philip Roth, and the sitcom All in the Family for models of rough and reflective play. Spike Lee’s film Do The Right Thing gets a well-deserved star turn, too. And for a civics that can protect human dignity while making space for all the nastiness and alienation we have no choice but to live with, He looks to philosopher Martha Nussbaum, among others.It’s a difficult conversation for an imperfect and imperfectable world, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. So Jeff makes a bold case and invites us all to the table —rabbi, priest, Imam, and the rest us who don’t fit into easy categories—to hash it out.

I wonder what this is about?” or “Oh, wow, I need this information.”I opened up Feedly when I was preparing this article and stopped on an article at The Write Practice titled “How to Find the Core Message of Your Writing” because it was clear and seemed relevant to the kinds of things I like to read.But I also stopped on an article by Emily P. Freeman: “How to Find (and Become) A Good Listener.” That sounded useful to help me as a coach and to help me improve relationships with family and friends.Or consider James Clear’s book Atomic Habits. The main title intrigues me with that word “atomic” connected to “habits.” His subtitle is “An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones.” Then he includes a tagline that clarifies it further: “Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results.” That sounds like a doable approach to the topic of habits, doesn’t it? He hooked me with his title and subtitle combo.We have to entice our readers to click on the link or open the book by capturing that first concept in a few words that hint at or outright reveal the subject, topic, theme, or problem we’ll address in the piece.Hook Your Readers with Attention GrabbersLet’s say you nailed it—you lured in your readers with the headline.Now it’s time to hook them—to grab them by the throat, as novelists often say. Bring on the attention grabber: it’s that first line or two that will keep them reading.When I taught composition to high school students, I’d offer attention-grabber ideas like: a startling statistic a quote a question an intriguing statement or claim a story (e.g., an anecdote that stands alone, a personal story, or someone else’s story)That article about finding the core message of your writing starts, “Why do you write?”—a question any writer will instinctively answer, at least in his head.So the author, Joe Bunting, has probably hooked us. Our mind is engaged with the question. It’s a good attention-grabber.Emily P. Freeman’s article on finding and becoming a good listener has an epigraph—a quote from Dr. Larry Crabb about listening to each other—followed by the beginning of the actual article. She starts with a story:It’s 2012, and there’s a stack of brochures in the little room I type in. I keep staring over at them, rereading their invitation, “To know more about you: If you would like to be informed of upcoming events…”I reach over, and I turn the plastic holder to face the wall. I cannot keep reading that same brochure over and over again.What’s going to happen? Why is this brochure featured so prominently in this story? Is she going to take action? Is it going to change her? What does this brochure have to do with listening?You can see how stories are great for hooking readers—they’re great attention-grabbers. They awaken curiosity and open a loop that we must close. We want to know what happens and how it ends.So Emily has hooked me.You, too, can use stories. And here’s a bonus tip—if you start far enough into a situation, the action of a story engages and hooks the reader, but you can leave it hanging so that you complete the story in the conclusion. That provides closure that satisfies and gratifies the reader. It feels like you’ve come full circle.But for them to get to the end, you’ve got to hold him.First you hook them, then you hold them.Hold Your Reader’s AttentionTo hold the reader isn’t easy. We’re battling for his or her attention, and we all know the long list of distractions that can pull a reader away at any moment.Here are some tips. | [Ep 212]For about four years, I didn’t do much to get healthy or stay healthy. I’d talk about getting in shape but wouldn’t actually do anything. I’d wake up and think about it, then roll over and go back to sleep.It’s no surprise, of course, that the idea of exercising—the thought of it—didn’t strengthen a single muscle in my body. The desire to be healthy, no matter how intense, didn’t actually make me healthy.I had to take action.Finally, about a year ago, I decided to do something. I started by jogging, plodding slowly through the neighborhood on a route so short I called it the wimpy route.But that’s how it began. To start improving my health, I took action. It was humbling to start so small, but I got out there and ran—I mean, plodded—the wimpy route over and over.And wouldn’t you know, action produced results.Over time, I ran a tiny bit faster and farther and grew a tiny bit stronger and healthier. By continuing to take action, I continued to see results.Productive Writers Take ActionIf we want to be writers, we can’t just talk about writing and wish our projects into existence. The idea of writing—the thought of it—won’t get a single sentence of an article, blog post, poem, or short story composed. The desire to be a writer won’t actually make you a writer.You have to decide to do something.You have to take action.That’s how it begins, no matter how humble or wimpy it may seem to you.Productive Writers WriteIn the beginning, it doesn’t have to be much. Just as I didn’t expect to be running a half-marathon distance when I first started plodding around the wimpy route, we don’t have to complete a 200-page novel in our first efforts to sit at our computers and write.We can tap out a few sentences; maybe a paragraph or two. With those humble beginnings, it begins. And over time it adds up.That’s the foundation of a productive writer.A productive writer writes.Productivity Doesn’t Mean Assembly-Line ProductionProductivity doesn’t mean we have to spit out poems like candy from a vending machine or roll out blog articles like cars on an assembly line with repetition and precision. After all, that can lead to a loss of creativity and originality.What productivity does mean is we have to start and complete projects instead of falling down rabbit holes of research for weeks on end or avoiding the work out of fear or perfectionism.Productive writers finally step away from the search engines and library books and throw some of their discoveries onto the page to sort it out and produce a final project.Productive writers overcome perfectionism and fear by sitting down and tapping out their thoughts to create a rough draft, no matter how rough.Priscilla Long, author of The Portable Writer’s Mentor, writes, “In the end what matters to the ambitious dreamer is a steady and even rather plodding stream of work.”1 It’s fine, she says, if much of the output is “rough, awkward, contrived, and arguably awful.”2That’s part of becoming a productive writer. You regularly produce a “plodding stream of work” no matter how “arguably awful” it emerges. Through the act of writing, you’re discovering your voice, your style, your preferred genre, your message.You’re figuring out how to write and what to write every time you write. It’s building a kind of creative strength in you, as you overcome Resistance and do the work.Productive Writers FinishEventually, after establishing a system of producing words and rough drafts, productive writers will develop a habit of finishing what they start.So often, writers start project after project in bursts of creative inspiration but struggle to see even one of them through to completion.Not everything we produce will be publishable, but we have to start and finish projects to build our body of work.Productive Writers Set Up SystemsTo be effective at starting and finishing, | [Ep 211]Creativity as a pillar of the writing life? It’s a no-brainer. Creativity and writing go together like pencil and paper.Writers practice creativity each and every day.But when we think about creative writing and a creative writer, our minds may turn toward MFA programs. After all, that’s where you study creative writing.I hate the potential implication—that other kinds of writing are not creative.Who's a Creative Writer?Creative writing instructors and programs offer teaching and training that nudge students toward an approach—a mindset and practice—different from that of writers who focus more on, say, blogging or marketing. Certainly MFA students gain skills that prepare them for a rewarding, challenging writing life—one that matches their goals to write and produce literary work.But I believe those who write corporate brochures and articles about succulents are also creative writers, even if they didn’t graduate with an MFA or land their work in respected literary journals. Bloggers and copywriters can also practice a rewarding, challenging creative writing life that matches their goals.When you write, you’re creating.If you write, you create.Thus, creativity is a pillar of the writing life.On the flip side, all writers—even published authors who have completed MFA programs—are capable of producing somewhat stagnant, occasionally derivative, work.We don’t want that.So how can any writer—all writers—practice creativity? How can we be more creative to enjoy our best writing lives?Entire books have been written about the topic, so I can’t tackle everything. But here are a few thoughts to get us started.What Is Creativity?First, it might help to establish a definition of creativity, but that’s harder than you might think.Researchers and experts and writers have been trying to pin it down, and no one seems to agree. I haven’t located one single definition (unless we would turn to Merriam-Webster). What I’ve spotted are words and phrases tossed around that we can consider:  originality (this comes up a lot) surprise (which we talked about regarding curiosity) authenticity (important for writers to practice) discovery (including making connections)1Whether these words reflect the process of creating or the finished product itself—that is, the thing created—they give us a hint of what it means to be creative: what it means to create.Learning from Other CreativesI’ve written before of how we can learn from the greats, studying writers we admire, even copying passages to learn techniques. We may find inspiration in their creative process and integrate elements into our own space and our own routines.But why limit ourselves to learning from other writers? We may work in the world of words, but we can learn from other domains: Writers can learn from the creativity of scientists to continually ask questions, experiment, dig deeper, analyze, draw conclusions, and try again. Writers can learn from visual artists how color, form, and texture engage the senses and drive decisions. Writers can learn from actors how working with the constraints of the stage and the script, we can make numerous choices that affect a performance and its effect on the audience.Julia Cameron’s Artist Dates encourage outings to step out of our writing hovels and step into other spaces, whether a museum or yarn shop, an antique emporium or international grocery store.From this new set of sensations and input, we build a network of possible connections, with one idea linking to another and another to form a new, novel concept that sidesteps the standard, mainstream mindset to discover original thoughts all our own as we become more creative.Creative InspirationWe not only learn from these other domains, we also amass new images and sensory experiences we can drop into our projects, deepening or expanding what we might have pulled toget... | [210]Dani Shapiro writes, “When I think of the wisest people I know, they share one defining trait: curiosity” (213, Still Writing).As she notes this connection between wisdom and curiosity, she continues, “They turn away from the minutiae of their lives—and focus on the world around them. They are motivated by a desire to explore the unfamiliar. They are drawn toward what they don't understand. They enjoy surprise” (213).I love how she connects surprise and curiosity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi makes that same connection, as you’ll see shortly.But before we get to that, let me establish my own connection: that curiosity is one of three pillars of your best writing life...along with creativity and productivity.Curious Writers Bring More to Their WorkAs curiosity becomes a daily practice, our writing will benefit, because curiosity serves as a driving force to producing captivating content and developing a writer who has things to say.Nourish curiosity and you’ll have a lively imagination drawing from a vast and ever-expanding library of ideas. Each day, even the smallest flash of wonder fans the flame of creativity.If we agree with Dani Shapiro that curious people focus on the world around them with a desire to explore the unfamiliar—drawn toward what they don’t understand—we gather clues for how we, too, can cultivate curiosity to live out our best writing life.If you’ve lost your sense of wonder and dampened curiosity, don’t worry. You can recapture it, funneling into your work a newfound delight in the world around you, in yourself, and in others.If you happen to be by nature a curious lifelong learner, lucky you! Continue to explore new ways to cultivate it further to become even more curious and pour what you discover into your writing projects.Develop CuriosityMihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book Creativity writes:“[T]he first step toward a more creative life is the cultivation of curiosity and interests, that is, the allocation of attention to things for their own sake…. Creative individuals are childlike in that their curiosity remains fresh even at ninety years of age; they delight in the strange and the unknown. And because there is no end to the unknown, their delight also is endless.” (346, Creativity)Did you hear his suggestions? Allocate “attention to things for their own sake.” “Delight in the strange and unknown.”It’s similar to what Dani Shapiro was saying: even the old in age are young at heart as they “explore the unfamiliar” and let themselves be “drawn toward what they don’t understand.”Curious people learn something new every day.Search, Capture, AskMy mom moved from the American Midwest to a coastal town in the South and became captivated by the flora and fauna of the area.She bought a telephoto lens so she could capture photos of the birds that seem so exotic to her. She grew up and lived most of her life with mourning doves, cardinals, robins, starlings, swallows, and red-winged blackbirds.Now she’s delighting in what are, for her, “strange and unknown” species. She’s “exploring the unfamiliar” as she snaps photos and looks up in a guidebook the names of birds that turn out to be wood storks, ibises, great blue herons, green herons, and anhingas.She shares them with her Facebook followers posting one photo after another along with thoughtful captions further modeling this curiosity that comes so naturally to her.My mom is by nature curious and developed it as a journalist, rooting out stories everywhere she goes.But you don’t need to be a trained journalist to ask the questions popping into your head and to search for answers: borrow binoculars—or a telephoto lens—to study a bird ask a parent about her first crush wonder about the etymology of a word—and look it up dig into a time in history you know little about consider why a person made one choice instead of another ask that about yourself, | [Ep 209]Each week I claim that writers are discovering ways to reach their writing goals—and have fun—by being more curious, creative, and productive.And each week you may be thinking, “Really?”Yes, I really do believe these three traits or these three values can drive you forward to achieve your goals—and have fun along the way. They are values I myself take to heart and encourage my clients to explore and embrace, because curiosity, creativity, and productivity—together—have the potential to transform both you and your writing.Today’s overview will give you a high-level look, and in the weeks ahead we’ll drill down into each one, to look at their core. By taking a closer look, you’ll see how developing these traits as a part of everyday life and as part of your writing practice, you’ll position yourself to become the writer you want to be.Pillar One: Curiosity in the Writing LifeWhy curiosity on its own? Why not tuck that under the umbrella of creativity?Curiosity drives us to discover, to wonder, to think “What if?”Could there be a more energizing trait for a writer?Writers of fiction turn to the “what if” prompt to ignite their imagination. Curiosity propels stories forward for the reader as they wonder what’s next. Curiosity gets characters into trouble and then curiosity helps them solve problems to get out of trouble.Poets, too, benefit from curiosity as a driving force. As the poet asks questions, she looks more closely at anything from a fish to a father. Curiosity calls us to slow down, consider, put the pieces together in a way that the rest of the world, speeding along without a pause, rarely has time to mess with—and curious poets put words to what they’ve pieced together.Writers of nonfiction who let curiosity guide them will break free from rephrasing the same old points over and over. A curious writer will dig deeper, probe into subject matter, research topics to find the freshest, most accurate answers.Writers who value and practice this as a part of their daily lives will likely have more fun along the way, delighting in both big wonders and small, grieving over deep injustice, seeking truth and revealing it.In the next episode, we’ll look in more detail about how to develop curiosity as a writer and practice it regularly. Let’s look briefly at the next pillar of the writing life: creativity.Pillar Two: Creativity in the Writing LifeYou can enroll in an MFA program to earn a degree in what? Creative writing.Whatever focus you select—fiction, poetry, or creative nonfiction—creativity is the core concept of the program because creativity is core to a writer.You’d be hard-pressed to find someone disagree with the belief that creativity is key to great writing, and yet I’ve read pieces that could use an injection of creativity. Aren’t we seeking to create something new rather than regurgitate something old and stale in a style that sounds like it could have been written by anyone?Embedded in the idea of creativity is not only that the ideas are creative—they’re fresh, novel, compelling, engaging—but also that we are indeed creating things. We can’t make something out of nothing, but we can mold into existence a passage, a poem, a project from ideas formed out of words. In that sense, writers are creators.Practicing the craft of writing builds our confidence in wielding the tools at our disposal, but we can practice creativity in other areas of life in a way that enriches us as people. That, in turn, feeds into our work.Be more creative as a person, and you’ll move closer to becoming a more creative writer—and thus achieving your writing goals.And the creative process itself—even before arriving at the final product—satisfies the person in the midst of creating. So you really can’t lose if you prioritize this value.Pillar Three: Productivity in the Life of a WriterIf we want to be writers, | [Ep 208]Today I’m chatting with Sharon Stohler, author of the nonfiction children’s biography\xa0Affectionately Yours: The Devoted Life of Abigail Adams,\xa0a charming and inspiring picture book released in June 2019.As you’ll learn in the interview, Sharon and I met years ago when we both started home educating our very small children, so we’ve known each other for decades. I was privy to her idea for this book years ago when she shared it with me as a friend. Later, we worked together when she brought me on for more official coaching.Sharon’s path to publishing was long and required vision, flexibility, patience, and perseverance. Pursuing traditional publishing revealed insights that led her to eventually land on self-publishing Affectionately Yours. And anyone who has poked around at self-publishing or pulled it off knows to do it well you undertake a long list of new steps and stages.She did it. She pulled it off.I hope you find her story instructive and motivating.Though the process was long and complicated, time-consuming and expensive, she said that the moment she held that book in her hands, it was all worth it.Sharon Stohler has a B.S. in Early Childhood Education from the University of Delaware and a Masters of Education from West Chester University. She has taught children ages four through 12 in private, public, and homeschool classrooms. Sharon currently teaches 3rd grade in a hybrid homeschool classroom and often finds herself delighted by her students and their brilliant minds. Aside from her own family room, she feels most at home in a library. She and her adventurous husband live in Indianapolis, where they cater to the needs of their Siamese cat, Gigi. They have three grown children.Resources Sharon Stohler's website Affectionately Yours: The Devoted Life of Abigail Adams (affiliate link) Tiny Boat, collaborative publisher and illustrator Daron Benson Children's Book Authors and Illustrators Facebook page Bigger Dot, printer for Affectionately Yours Tara Lazar's sample children's book layout & dummy construction John Adams biography by David McCullough (softcover edition, affiliate link) All podcast interviews All podcast episodes | [Ep 207]On my drive to Minneapolis to serve on the faculty of Northwestern Christian Writers Conference, I listened to podcasts: one after another, back-to-back.I welcomed that stream of input filling my mind with ideas, strategies, and solutions that I can apply to my writing life.But it’s easy to listen and then forget what I heard. What a waste if I devote hours to listening but never remember or apply what the experts recommend!Life is short. I want to learn and grow and transform—I want to become wiser and more discerning. I’m committed to implementing those ideas!Sort and StackSo first I capture the information. Later, you know what I do?I sort and stack it.I’ve done this for years without having a name or phrase to put with it, but author Robin Jones Gunn said it in her keynote address: we must learn to sort and stack.Sort and stack.Sort and Stack Conference NotesSometimes conference attendees report that by the end of the weekend they feel like they’ve been drinking from a fire hose. They’re blasted with so much new information in session after session, they feel hit with input and ideas and vocabulary and concepts they've never heard before.It’s overwhelming.It would be easy to set aside the notes from those sessions and return to status quo when they arrive home.But life is short. Those attendees came to learn and grow and transform, so I hope they’re committed to implementing those ideas.Avoid the OverwhelmHopefully they scribbled down copious notes, captured them someplace—to sort and then stack them into logical, usable groups.My breakout session offered probably 30 ideas, maybe more, of ways people can put some heart, soul, and a little laughter into social media. Another session may have offered 20 or 50 more ideas. Soon, the writers will have filled a notebook.It’s easy to get overwhelmed. We don’t have to do it all, and we don’t have to do it all right away.But we don't want to lose those ideas.The conference attendees don’t have to implement every idea the day they get home from the conference, and I don’t have to implement every idea I heard on the drive home in those podcasts I listened to.We want to sort out what to do when so we try things out in an order that makes sense.Create a Master StackIf we successfully capture the information, we can create a master list and continue to work through it, sorting and stacking over time.We can convert our notes from the master list or “stack” into more lists, labeled however we wish: Research Try next month ArchiveAs you sort notes from your master list into these sub-stacks, you can label them in many ways. Use the nomenclature from the organization, time-management, or productivity systems that make sense to you.Again, think of each new list as another stack. Move notes to one stack or another, sorting as you go.Sort and Stack Based on ROIThe Writer's Guide to ROI series helps with sorting and stacking. By thinking through return on investment of any given idea, I can comb through the stack of ideas I collected from my podcast marathon and sort them based on values and goals and efficient use of time.Then I can sort them into new stacks or categories to figure out how and when to implement them. This moves me closer to action I’ll take—specifically the very next step.What’s the Next Action?Long ago I read David Allen’s book Getting Things Done, which explains his productivity methodology. He recommends a Next Action list formed by asking, “What’s the next step?”For a long time I stuck a Post-It on my computer monitor with that on it: “What’s the next step?” Asking that helped me sort all the possible actions I could take and zero in on the very next one to do. The rest could remain on the Next Actions stack.I learned to phrase each item with a verb so the task or action would be expressed as a specific, | [Ep 206]Several years ago I watched a free training presented by Chalene Johnson, where she explained how to start with one piece of content and then use it in several forms for various outlets. With this efficient and productive approach, she gets the most mileage out of a single piece of content.It’s a clever, creative way to improve ROI.Chalene Johnson’s Content Creation SystemChalene is comfortable on video, so she starts with a live video as the primary content form. She decides what she’ll speak on and has several points to cover, and I don’t think she scripts it in advance. She probably writes out bullet points to keep her on track and speaks from those.At the time of the training she recommended Facebook Live, but since then I’ve seen her and others do live video on multiple platforms at the same time. That might be like Facebook Live and Instagram Live or IGTV and maybe Periscope, too. With one live broadcast, she instantly reaches people in multiple places all at once.Afterwards, that video is saved.And that’s the beauty of her system. She can repurpose that saved video into multiple formats.For example, she can: edit the video recording into segments to publish on YouTube use the audio from that recorded livestream to create a podcast episode have the audio transcribed and use that written version as the draft of an article or two to publish at her website pull quotes and video excerpts to use on Twitter create infographics and quote posts to pin on Pinterest design quote images for her Instagram feedI don’t think she mentioned it, but she could create slide decks to publish on LinkedIN SlideShare and use the recorded video as part of a program or course.One piece of content turns into gobs of material for all kinds of purposes and platforms. The impact she can have with just one focused creative idea and effort blew me away.That’s a savvy use of one’s time and a remarkable return on investment.Creative Content Repurposing for WritersMaybe one day I’ll start with live broadcasts like Chalene Johnson, but that’s not who I am or where I’m at. Inspired by her training, I started to think about my own strengths:What one piece of content could be my starting point?What could I create to serve at least double-duty if not triple- or quadruple-duty to have the biggest impact possible?How can I take the principle behind Chalene’s training and adapt it for where I’m at as a writer to increase my ROI?Start with Written Content: Big to SmallAs a writer, an obvious starting point for me was written content.That’s what I did. Podcast: I ended up scripting my podcast episodes, so those are offered in audio form for those who subscribe to the podcast. Blog Article: The script is available as an article for those who prefer reading it at my website. Newsletter: Since it’s relatively short, I include that same content in my weekly newsletter, so people don’t have to go to my website or listen to the podcast to learn from my ideas. Instagram Quote:\xa0For the Instagram feed, I create a quote post with a brief excerpt from the article—enough so that people don’t have to go to the original piece in order to gain a valuable insight, in case they want to stay in Instagram rather than click away to my website. Instagram Image: To mix things up, I often take a photo that relates to the ideas, such as the image of a book I refer to in the article, and publish that in my feed. Instagram Story: Sharing the post from my Instagram feed in my Story draws a few people who are focusing more on that element of Instagram. Facebook: I repurpose one of the excerpts from Instagram into a post on my Facebook page, and that links back to the original article on my website. Pinterest: I create at least one or two pins for Pinterest. Twitter: I tweet a variety of links to the article on Twitter, using quotes and images to mix things up. | [Ep 205]In the Next-Level Writer series, we talked about plans and goals.When we set out with a goal and make a plan to methodically move toward that goal, we see what it takes. We understand the investment involved.That’s when we measure the ROI of a particular task or activity using not only our deepest values, which we looked at in Part 2 of A Writer’s Guide to ROI, but also our goals.Weigh Your GoalsLet’s say your goal is to complete the manuscript of a novel by the end of summer, but on a whim you commit to a one-month daily photography challenge on social media.The challenge is a lot of fun and provides a creative boost as you break away from your work-in-progress to edit and post an image.Is that creative boost worth it?The challenge starts to distract you from your writing goal as you invest more time in photography than in writing the novel.You have to decide.Do you change your goals and your alter your plan to accommodate an activity?Consider your ROI.You Can Change Course for Greater ROIIf the photography challenge keeps you from meeting that end-of-summer goal, should you continue with the challenge and change your deadline, or focus entirely on the writing?As you pour creative energy into the photography, you may have less available to invest in the writing.But you might gain so many new followers, it’s worth it, because you might never have met them if you hadn’t the challenge.What’s the greater ROI?Consider your goals. What’s more important? What’s needed first?That will help you determine the best investment of your time, creative energy, and personal resources.Measure Your ROIYou can measure the return on investment based on what you’d like to see.In part one in A Writer’s Guide to ROI, Crystal Paine decided activities were worth her time if they made her money or brought in more people or helped her serve her audience better.You could try other measurements: Income Word count Email signups Visitors to your website Readers of a particular article Engagement and likes on a social media update New followers or friends on social media Sales of a book or product Downloads of a free item Downloads of a podcast episode Completing a work-in-progress Relationships with people in the industry (agents, editors, publishers, other writers)You can see from this list how specific activities lead to certain measurements.There are other elements that are so important but much harder to measure, like emotional returns. It’s hard to track those, but you can try. Track them daily using a scale of 1 to 10 to determine where you’re at each day or at the completion of each activity.You can decide how you feel or what you’ve gained in such areas as: Self-improvement Confidence Happiness or joy Creative satisfaction Emotional energy Improved writing skills GrowthIs It Worth It for Me?Is it worth it for me to post on social media at my current rate or more often?Is it worth it to produce a weekly podcast?Is it worth it to send out an email newsletter?Is it worth it to quietly work on books that won’t be available for over a year, maybe two?For me, the answer is yes. Yes to all of that and more.When I calculate my ROI—which is ultimately based on my goals and values—the time I spend on the writing and writing-related activities brings in new relationships as I help more people, gain new opportunities to speak and write, and develop ideas I can use in other ways.I’m having fun along the way, and I satisfy my curiosity by exploring new questions that arise and new topics of interest.Is It Worth It for You?I could continue to list the results I gain—the returns on my investment—but the big question is this:Is it worth it for you?How about your writing projects and your writing-related activities you’re committed to... | [Ep 204]My son participates in value debate. The competitors take either the affirmative or negative stance on a resolution and argue for or against it based on a value. The judge determines which side best upholds their value.I’ve served as a judge for these debates many times, and the more I listen to these clashes, the more I’ve come to realize we make decisions based on personal values all the time in our everyday lives.Just as an example, I’ve talked with the kids about this, and let’s say they’ve gotten an invitation to a quiet gathering with close friends where they’ll just hang out and chat. But then they receive another invitation on the very same night to a fun activity, like a concert, with people they don’t know as well.How do they choose?They can decide based on what they value more: time with close friends doing something quiet or a chance to attend a concert. Which is the higher value at that time in their lives?Personal values form the core of our decisions and are critical to determining our ROI.A Writer’s ValuesAs writers, we could take on countless tasks and sign up for numerous activities, all of which bring various results.So we bring in the idea of our return on investment, or ROI. If we invest something of ourselves—time, money, resources, energy—what are we getting back from it? What’s the result—the return—on that investment?Our values are behind it all, at the core of our choices. Whether we realize it or not, we inevitably return to our values to determine our ROI.Does any given activity and the investment it requires fit with what we value most?Know Your ValuesWe all have deep-seated values, whether we’re aware of them or not and whether we’ve ever identified them or articulated them or not.They may be high-level, ethical values—like not hurting someone else in your pursuits.Or they may be smaller, personal values, like carving out time each day to exercise.In part one of A Writer’s Guide to ROI, I shared how Crystal Paine determined if her time devoted to a task or activity was worth it. For her, the time invested must result in money and helping people—that’s how she knows it’s worth devoting time to a project or task. She’s come to value that as a business owner.What Are Your Values as a Writer?As you see, one of her values is helping people.You may share that value. As a writer, you may long to help people with your ideas and solutions.You may have other values, as well. You may value the satisfaction of producing something creative or taking the risk to delve into a personal struggle so you can share it with others so they might find hope.You may value storytelling as an art form and strive to write beautiful narratives.You may value poetry and commit to daily practice regardless of whether your final versions end up in a literary magazine.Knowing your values helps determine the ROI of an activity.When Values Are RevealedBut sometimes your personal values may not be easy to identify. You may not have articulated them.Our values have a way of revealing themselves as we take action.You get to a certain level of success or achievement and realize, wait, this isn’t what you thought it was going to require or feel like.This isn’t aligning with your values.This isn’t what you want.Jeff Goins’ StoryThis happened to Jeff Goins.For years as a blogger, Jeff created content about writing, publishing, and creativity. Over time, he decided to build this part-time pursuit into a business, and it grew. He hired employees and farmed out some of the articles he used to write to other freelancers.But he was stressed out with the work of managing it all. He reached out to Seth Godin, who reminded Jeff that he didn’t have to do this—he didn’t have to build a business. But if he wanted to build a business, he had to commit to that work.Jeff then reached out to business coach Casey Graham,", 'chan_desc': "Reach your writing goals and make significant progress (and have fun!) by being more curious, creative, and productive.

This is a superhero story that kicks Marvel's and DC's asses out of the multiverse. It's fast, emotional, tactical and above all it's consistent.  In a world where people get their powers by triggering under extreme stress and/or trauma, the distinction between ''hero'' and ''villain'' is simply a matter of perspective.  Widely regarded as ''the Game of Thrones of superhero stories'' Worm is an intense exploration of a world much like our own if a large number of people started getting superpowers starting in the 1980's.After an exceptionally traumatizing event, Taylor Hebert finds she has the seemingly-mundane ability to control insects.  Told primarily from her perspective, Worm follows Taylor as she decides to use these powers for the greater good - no matter what the cost.  Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the chaos and complexities of the 'cape' community of Brockton Bay.  Cape politics, factions, rivalries, information warfare, and the individual problems of the unbalanced people beneath the costumes puts even the heroes' morality in question.  Taylor's actions in the midst of this leave her in a position where she's forced to make some hard choices, facing the reality of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.''The only superhero work to show the world as worse because of superheroes''''X-men has more continent busters, while Worm has more busted continents''''You know all those times in superhero stories where you wonder why they don't just do *this* or *that* with their power?

She is also, now, an author. Her book Bored and Brilliant: How Spacing Out Can Unlock Your Most Productive and Creative Self came out of her own experience and curiosity about the creative process and confronting digital distractions - one of the biggest challenges for writers. She asked her audience to help her figure out what it would mean to let all of that go and to learn to shut down in order to build your creative juices up. Bored and Brilliant is the result, and it begins with an extreme case of writer’s block – what Manoush refers to as “a blankness.”Episode music by Ryan AndersenFollow us on Twitter @10MinuteWriters and find Manoush at @manoushz and @NoteToSelf | Conventional, linear narratives are not really Jennifer Egan’s thing. She\'s a shape-shifter of fiction – jumping through time, space, voices and forms. She\'s written a graphic novel, a short story composed of tweets, and, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Visit from the Goon Squad, a kind of novel-as-concept album. Jennifer Egan takes on historical fiction in her newest novel, Manhattan Beach. We called her at her home in Brooklyn to ask about her process and how she begins her unpredictable novels. | Jeffrey Cranor and Joseph Fink, co-creators of the phenomenally popular Welcome to Nightvale podcast, the “Nightvale Presents” series of podcasts, and New York Times bestselling co-authors of the new novel, It Devours, their second book set in the fictional world of Nightvale. We caught up with them at the 2017 Boston Book Festival. Episode Music by Disparition | The blockbuster 2003 thriller The Da Vinci Code launched Dan Brown into the best-selling stratosphere. More than 200 million copies of his books have sold worldwide since. Three of his novels have been made into films starring tom hanks as fictional Harvard professor Robert Langdon. Brown is a disciplined writer, rising at 4am to a breakfast smoothie and "bulletproof" coffee, writing every day, and throwing himself into his research. He spent four years researching Origin, his latest novel, which again thrusts Langdon into a 24-hour scavenger hunt for keys, codes and symbols in spectacular European locations. The breathless action drives bigger questions about faith, conspiracies, and organized religion. The question of whether contemporary notions of god can withstand scientific scrutiny is at the heart of Origin. We caught up with him just before discussing the book at The Music Hall in Portsmouth for Writers on a New England Stage.Music in this episode by Gregory W. Brown, used with permission by PARMA Recordings, and Podington Bear. | For many writers, hitting their stride means finding their voice. Success for Sarah Hurwitz is in creating a voice for others. Sarah was candidate Hillary Clinton’s chief speechwriter during the 2006 Presidential primary, and was quickly snatched up by the Obama campaign team. She landed in the White House, soon being named First Lady Michelle Obama’s head speechwriter. We asked Sarah about her work and confirmed that she worked on that 2008 speech to the Democratic National Convention that was plagiarized by then candidate Trump\'s wife, Melania at the 2016 Republican National Convention. | Virginia Macgregor, author most recently of Wishbones, has a knack for capturing the voices of children and young adults and projecting her novels through their lenses, giving us young narrators with accurate levels of experience and naivety - and a perspective not often found in adult literature. Our conversation with her centered around that: how she conjures the voices of young people, insures they are three-dimensional, and navigates those voices around complicated adult situations.Episode music by Broke for Free | Atul Gawande is a surgeon, professor at Harvard Medical School, and writes about medicine and ethics for the New Yorker. He’s author of several best-selling books, most recently, Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. The book questions the human cost of miraculous medicine, and urges a shift from the prevailing thought that human decline and death are signs of failures to instead think about how to make old age and the experience of dying better. Despite the grave topic, Gawande views it as a book about living. We spoke to him in the greenroom at The Music Hall in Portsmouth before a Writers on a New England Stage\xa0live event.Episode music by Uncanny Valleys.Please take a moment to take our listener survey at survey.panoply.fm \xa0 | Celeste Ng came out of the gate strong. Her first novel, Everything I Never Told You, was a New York Times bestseller and Amazon\'s #1 Best Book of 2014. Her latest, Little Fires Everywhere, continues her exploration of family dynamics and the effect of being included or excluded from belonging. She has said in the past that her stories begin with images, so we began by asking her where those images come from.Episode Music by Cheetara | Louise Penny was well into her forties when she published Still Life, the first in what has become the wildly popular Armand Gamache mystery series. The novels are set in Québec, where Gamache is Chief Inspector of the provincial police force. They are meticulously plotted, part police procedurals, part exploration of human nature - and the precarious balance between good and evil. Louise Penny is now out with the thirteenth in the series, Glass Houses.Episode Music by Dana Boulé.', 'chan_desc': 'A peek into how great writers conjure and craft their work.

Today, I have the pleasure of interviewing Aaron Becker. Born in Baltimore, Aaron moved to California to attend Pomona College where he scored his first illustration job designing t-shirts for his water polo team. Since then, he's traveled around the world, from Kenya to Japan, Sweden to Tahiti, looking for good things to eat and feeding his imagination. He now lives with his family in Amherst, MA where he's busy at work on his next book project. You can find out more about what he's been up to lately at storybreathing.com.

Archer is the author of the highly acclaimed Vermont-based series featuring detective Joe Gunther, which the Chicago Tribune describes as “the best police procedurals being written in America.” He has won the New England Independent Booksellers Association Award for Best Fiction — which is the first time a crime fiction author has received this honor — and in 2011, his 22nd Joe Gunther novel, Tag Man, earned a place on The New York Times bestseller list. Before trying his hand at fiction, Archer wrote history books. His most well-known is Southern Timberman: The Legacy of William Buchanan, which is all the lumber and oil business in Louisiana from the 1870s to the 1970s. When he’s not writing, Archer is a death investigator for Vermont’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Over the past thirty years, he has also been a detective for the Windham County Sheriff’s Office, a volunteer firefighter/EMT, the publisher of his own backlist, and a frequent contributor to magazines and newspapers. In this episode Archer and I discuss:  Using practical experience for writing research Using curiosity and questions for story inspiration The historical origins of the title Bomber’s Moon Keeping a character and world fresh over thirty books The power of treating the reader as a co-storyteller  Plus, his #1 tip for writers.

Now, according to the bio that either he or his publicist submitted when we set up this interview, RJ Barker is a softly-spoken Yorkshireman with flowing locks. He lives in the frozen north with his wife and son, and divides his time between writing and looking after his son. According to the about page on his blog, RJ Barker is (and I quote) “Probably more ridiculous than you already believe.” RJ is the author of The Wounded Kingdom series, which comprises Age of Assassins, Blood of Assassins, & King of Assassins and his newest book is The Bone Ships which is the first in The Tide Child series. In this episode RJ and I discuss:  The story behind The Bone Ships Hearing and creating the voice of a fantasy world Working with a copyeditor while breaking the writing rules Deciding when and how to break writing rules Creating an awesome opening line Balancing immersing a reader and explaining a world  Plus, his #1 tip for writers. For more info and shownotes: DIYMFA.com/271 | Hey there word nerds! Today, I have the pleasure of interviewing NoNieqa Ramos. Now if you’re a die-hard word nerd and fan of the show, you probably remember NoNieqa from her previous interview with us (Episode 202). I had such a blast talking with her that when I heard she had a new book coming out, I knew I had to have her back on the show. I mean, how often do I get to geek out about the literary merits of the F-bomb with a fellow writer? NoNieqa and I are definitely birds of a feather. NoNieqa is an educator and literary activist. She’s the author of the YA novel The Disturbed Girl's Dictionary, which was named a 2018 New York Public Library Best Book for Teens, and a 2019 YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults Selection. She believes Halloween is a lifestyle, not a holiday (which I totally agree with by the way). Today, we’ll be discussing her latest book, The Truth Is…, as well as the important (but often difficult-to-talk-about themes) that come up in this story. In this episode NoNieqa and I discuss:  The power of forgiveness and empathy Writing inclusive narratives The writer’s responsibility to write three-dimensional characters Writing invisible as well as visible marginalizations The power of a respectful question  Plus, her #1 tip for writers.

His novel, The Lesson is a work of speculative fiction is about what happens when a spaceship arrives at the US Virgin Islands with a race of super-advanced aliens on a research mission on board. This story grapples with the tensions between these newcomers and the local Virgin Islanders and explores various themes, including: the nature of belief, the impact of colonialism, and how far are we willing to go for progress? This book breaks new ground as one of the first science fiction novels to be set on Saint Thomas, in the Virgin Islands. It’s a combination of literary social fiction and speculative fiction, and it also paints a vivid picture of Charlotte Amalie, which is Cadwell’s hometown. Cadwell has an MFA in fiction from North Carolina State University, as well as Master’s degree in Linguistics. He was the winner of the 2014 NCSU Prize for Short Fiction and attended Clarion West 2016. His short fiction has appeared in The Verge, Lightspeed, Nightmare, and Asimov’s Science Fiction and several of his stories have received honors or been nominated for Best-Of lists. I have been reading his debut novel, The Lesson, and it is absolutely un-put-downable.\xa0 In this episode Cadwell and I discuss:  How a dream inspired The Lesson Keeping a story character-driven while also adding speculative elements The power of using--and sometimes withholding--multiple points of view\xa0 Using speculative fiction to grapple with contemporary social issues Blending past, present and a speculative future Writing speculative fiction in an MFA program  Plus, his #1 tip for writers.

Today, we’re doing another one of our live-from-a-conference interviews, this time from RWA annual conference, which is the big event that the Romance Writers of America put on each year. I had the pleasure of speaking at this event a few years ago in San Diego, and this year because it’s back in New York, I’m delighted to be attending it once again. For this episode, I have the pleasure of interviewing Nisha Sharma, whose YA novel, My So-Called Bollywood Life, has just won the RITA award, which is one of the top awards for romance writing, for best young adult r omance. Nisha is also the author of the adult contemporary romance The Takeover Effect. Now, because I can’t resist a good YA story, and because it’s been nominated for a RITA, our discussion focuses particularly on My So-Called Bollywood Life. But before we get to the interview, let me tell you a little more about our guest.\xa0 Nisha’s writing has been praised in NPR, Cosmopolitan, Teen Vogue, Buzzfeed, Hypable and more. She credits her father for her multiple graduate degrees, and her mother for her love of Shah Rukh Khan and Jane Austen. She lives in New Jersey with her Alaskan husband, her cat Lizzie Bennett and her dog Nancey Drew. In this episode Nisha and I discuss:  The inspiration behind My So-Called Bollywood Life How minor characters influence and develop the main character Building a real world as opposed to a fantasy world How Bollywood structure conventions influenced the book Using blog posts at the beginning of each chapter as an anchor for writing The similarities between Jane Austen and Bollywood  Plus, her #1 tip for writers. For more info and shownotes: diymfa.com/268 | Hey there word nerds! Today, I have the pleasure of interviewing Todd Herman, who I am honored to count as one of my mentors. I first met Todd about five years ago, when he gave a talk at an entrepreneurship event, and right away I could tell that he was speaking my language. You see, Todd is a performance coach who specializes in the mental game. He works with ambitious entrepreneurs, athletes, and leaders who want to achieve wildly outrageous goals, like building a multimillion-dollar business, reaching an Olympic podium, or launching an international brand. He’s run his own sports science training company for over twenty years, and his signature performance system, 90 Day Year (which I use regularly in my work and my writing) has been named the world’s top leadership and skill development program—not once, but twice!\xa0 Todd is also the author of the Wall Street Journal bestselling book The Alter Ego Effect which we’ll be discussing today. In this episode Todd and I discuss:  The great superpower that all humans have The thing all top performers do How seeing that you have many selves can lead to greater mental health and performance The trap of the “authentic self” How to choose and activate an alter ego Why this technique is so useful for writers  Plus, his #1 tip for writers. For more info and shownotes: DIYMFA.com/267 | Hey there word nerds! Today, I have the pleasure of interviewing Natasha Scripture. Natasha is an author, poet, humanitarian, and former aid worker. As a spokesperson for the United Nations, she covered humanitarian crises around the world and before the UN she worked for a variety of organizations, including the BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera English, the World Bank, TED, National Geographic, and Condé Nast Publications.\xa0 She has been published in the New York Times, the Telegraph, Glamour UK, the Sydney Morning Herald, HuffPost, New York Post, and the Atlantic, among other publications. She has also been featured in Marie Claire, Women’s Health, and the Sunday Times Style magazine.\xa0 Natasha has lived in several different countries, travels frequently, and seeks to inspire and empower women everywhere with her writing and her storytelling. Her first book is Man Fast: A Memoir, which we’ll be discussing on the show today. In this episode Natasha and I discuss:  The journey from writing a self-help book to writing a memoir. How to use writing to process grief.\xa0 The process of structuring a memoir’s outward and inward journey. Creating space for self-discovery. Saying, “No” to others to say, “Yes” to yourself.

You might be doing a double-take right now because this episode is airing on a Thursday and not on Wednesday like our usual schedule. In fact, this is a bonus episode to celebrate the 5-year anniversary of DIY MFA. That’s right… exactly five years ago today, we announced this podcast to the world. Since then, we have released a new episode every single Wednesday like clockwork. It’s been a wild and crazy ride and I am so happy and grateful that you’re celebrating this podcast-iversary with me! In the last five years, we’ve hit some major milestones. We are at 265 episodes (and counting!) and we hit the top of the iTunes New & Notable Arts section in our second week. I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing over 200 authors, editors, agents and industry professionals. These interviews have run the gamut: from debuts to bestsellers and award-winners representing pretty much every major genre award, as well as Pulitzer Prize winner. Last year I even conducted my first official celebrity interview. (Insert fangirl squeal here.) If you’re a DIY MFA super-fan you’ll probably notice something else if you look closely at our line-up. Very few of our interviews are repeats with the same guest. This is because we have such a long waiting list to get authors on the show that we had to start limiting the number of times an author could come back.

I was a child and she was a child,       In this kingdom by the sea,   But we loved with a love that was more than love,       I and my Annabel Lee;   With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven       Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,       In this kingdom by the sea,   A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;   So that her highborn kinsmen came       And bore her away from me,   To shut her up in a sepulchre       In this kingdom by the sea.     The angels, not half so happy in heaven,       Went envying her and me;   Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,       In this kingdom by the sea)   That the wind came out of the cloud by night,      Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.      But our love it was stronger by far than the love       Of those who were older than we,       Of many far wiser than we;   And neither the angels in heaven above,      Nor the demons down under the sea,   Can ever dissever my soul from the soul       Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:      For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams       Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;   And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes       Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;   And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,       In her sepulchre there by the sea,       In her tomb by the sounding sea.

The sled and traveller stopped, the courier\'s feet Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed In a tumultuous privacy of storm.  Come see the north wind\'s masonry. Out of an unseen quarry evermore Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer Curves his white bastions with projected roof Round every windward stake, or tree, or door. Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he For number or proportion. Mockingly, On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths; A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn; Fills up the farmer\'s lane from wall to wall, Maugre the farmer\'s sighs; and at the gate A tapering turret overtops the work. And when his hours are numbered, and the world Is all his own, retiring, as he were not, Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone, Built in an age, the mad wind\'s night-work, The frolic architecture of the snow.Reading © Classic Poetry Aloud, 2008. | Rudyard Kipling read by Classic Poetry Aloudwww.classicpoetryaloud.comTwitter: @classicpoetryFacebook: www.facebook.com/poetryaloudGiving voice to the poetry of the past. ---------------------------------------------------Ifby Rudyard Kipling (1865 - 1936)If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting too;If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,Or being lied about, don\'t deal in lies,Or being hated, don\'t give way to hating,And yet don\'t look too good, nor talk too wise:If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;If you can meet with Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two impostors just the same;If you can bear to hear the truth you\'ve spokenTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,And stoop and build \'em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginningsAnd never breathe a word about your loss;If you can force your heart and nerve and sinewTo serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in youExcept the Will which says to them: \'Hold on!\'If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,If all men count with you, but none too much;If you can fill the unforgiving minuteWith sixty seconds\' worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that\'s in it,And - which is more - you\'ll be a Man, my son!Reading © Classic Poetry Aloud, 2007. | Dollie Radford read by Classic Poetry Aloudwww.classicpoetryaloud.comTwitter: @classicpoetryFacebook: www.facebook.com/poetryaloudGiving voice to the poetry of the past.---------------------------------------Decemberby Dollie Radford (1858 – 1920)No gardener need go far to find    The Christmas rose,The fairest of the flowers that mark    The sweet Year\'s close:Nor be in quest of places where    The hollies grow,Nor seek for sacred trees that hold    The mistletoe.All kindly tended gardens love    December days,And spread their latest riches out    In winter\'s praise.But every gardener\'s work this month    Must surely beTo choose a very beautiful    Big Christmas tree,And see it through the open door    In triumph ride,To reign a glorious reign within    At Christmas-tide.Reading © Classic Poetry Aloud 2009 | Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  read by Classic Poetry Aloudwww.classicpoetryaloud.comTwitter: @classicpoetryFacebook: www.facebook.com/poetryaloudGiving voice to the poetry of the past.--------------------------------------------The Arrow and the Songby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 – 1882) I shot an arrow into the air,It fell to earth, I knew not where;For, so swiftly it flew, the sightCould not follow it in its flight.I breathed a song into the air,It fell to earth, I knew not where;For who has sight so keen and strongThat it can follow the flight of song?Long, long afterward, in an oakI found the arrow, still unbroke;And the song, from beginning to end,I found again in the heart of a friend.

Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer\'s lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm\'d; And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance, or nature\'s changing course, untrimm\'d; But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; Nor shall Death brag thou wander\'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou growest; So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.Reading © Classic Poetry Aloud, 2007. | Joaquin Miller read by Classic Poetry Aloudwww.classicpoetryaloud.comTwitter: @classicpoetryFacebook: www.facebook.com/poetryaloudGiving voice to the poetry of the past.--------------------------------------------------- For Those Who Failby Joaquin Miller (1837 – 1913)"All honor to him who shall win the prize," The world has cried for a thousand years; But to him who tries and who fails and dies, I give great honor and glory and tears. O great is the hero who wins a name, But greater many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime.

But suck\'d on countrey pleasures, childishly?   Or snorted we in the seaven sleepers den?   T\'was so; But this, all pleasures fancies bee.          If ever any beauty I did see,   Which I desir\'d, and got, t\'was but a dreame of thee.      And now good morrow to our waking soules,   Which watch not one another out of feare;   For love, all love of other sights controules,   And makes one little roome, an every where.   Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,   Let Maps to other, worlds on worlds have showne,   Let us possesse one world, each hath one, and is one.      My face in thine eye, thine in mine appeares,   And true plaine hearts doe in the faces rest,   Where can we finde two better hemispheares   Without sharpe North, without declining West?   What ever dyes, was not mixt equally;   If our two loves be one, or, thou and I   Love so alike, that none doe slacken, none can die.

This episode was brought to you by Freedom — upgrade to Premium and use code FIRSTDRAFT for 40% off a yearly or Forever plan! Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode   Renee says The Flame in the Mist contains nods to Disney’s Mulan and the classic marital arts film 47 Ronin   When it comes to pitching books by Sabaa Tahir (listen to her First Draft interview here), Traci Chee, or Sarah Nicole Lemon (listen to her First Draft interview here), Renee has you covered. Not so much, she says, when it comes to pitching her own books.   Though Renee loves physically strong female heroes like Katniss, from Susanne Collins’ The Hunger Games, she says the hero of the Flame in the Mist series has “strength of the heart.”   The Beautiful series is an homage to Anne Rice’s seminal Interview with the Vampire series (omigod don’t miss the movie version, optimistically titled Interview With the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt). She read The Queen of the Damned first. Renee loves Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, too.   Each book in The Beautiful’s four-part series will have a different main character, but they will all take place in the same world. Renee borrowed this narrative structure from the world of regency romance novels; in particular, Renee cites Sabrina Jeffries’ Hellions of Halstead Hall series as an inspiration. I came across this in getting recommendations from Bea and Leah Koch, who run The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Culver City, Calif. (listen to their First Draft interview here)!   Renee loves mysteries, like the TV series Columbo and Agatha Christie’s Poirot   In addition to Anne Rice’s many vampires novels and Twilight, Renee was also inspired by Charlaine Harris’ Sookie Stackhouse books (which were adapted into the True Blood HBO show) (and I recommended fellow YA author Morgan Matson watch the series - hear me and Morgan chat in her First Draft interviews here and here!).   Renee says almost every book series she loves is a version of Romeo & Juliet by William Shakespeare or The Count of Monte Christo by Alexandre Duma, and she’s also obsessed with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.   Renee and I gush over Mirage by Somaiya Daud, but I have a bone to pick with her vis a vis robots   Google is funding efforts to delay or end death! Science is trying to restore activity to a deceased brain! Dogs and cats are being cloned (Barbara Streisand did it)! Life is wild!

Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode   The seminal Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson was one of the only Western comics that Jen read as a young artist   In high school Jen started a webcomic called Strings of Fate and took is super seriously!   Jen’s first publishing experience was contributing to Flight, an anthology put together by her webcomic peers and edited by Kazu Kibuishi, who has gone on to author and illustrate the Amulet series, Copper, and he illustrated the re-release of the Harry Potter series.   Jen’s agent is Judy Hansen of the Hansen Literary Agency, who represents many of the top graphic artists and illustrators out there today   Jen’s first editor at First Second, Calista Brill (author in her own right of Tugboat Bill and the River Rescue, Cat Wishes, and Little Wing Learns to Fly) is still her editor today!   She was also fortunate to work with book designer Colleen AF Venable (also the author of Melvin the Sloth is About to Do the Best Thing in the World and\xa0 while she was with First Second   After Jen’s first book, she adapted “IRL,” a short story for Cory Doctorow, one of the founders of BoingBoing and author of Little Brother and Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.   One of her freelance cartoon jobs was illustrating Tom Angleberger’s books, including Tom Angleberger’s Fake Mustache.   Veronica Roth’s new collection of short stories, The End and Other Beginnings: Stories From the Future, has one of the best titles ever, IMO (hear her First Draft interviews here and here)   In 2019, Jen was awarded multiple Eisner Awards, for best writer/artist, and for best publication for teens.   Jen enlisted the help of her friend, Lark Pien -- colorist for books like Printz-winning American Born Chinese and Boxers and Saints, written and illustrated by MacArthur Fellow Gene Luen Yang -- to work on Stargazing and help her get the book in on time.

Browne, author of  Black Girl Magic and  Woke Baby, was the host at the Nuyorican when Gabby was finding herself there   Through The New York City Latina Writers Group Gabby got the chance to work with Alicia Anabel Santos and her mentor, Vanessa Mártir, co-author of  Do Something!

Listen to Stephanie’s episode here   Lori Perkins, founder of the L. Perkins Agency and Riverdale Avenue Books   When Patricia Arquette accepted the Oscar for Boyhood,  she stirred controversy with her speech    High Art with Allie Sheedy and  Gia with Angelina Jolie were some of Gabby’s first LGBT movies (and her mom’s exposure to lesbianism was The Singing Nun’s “Dominique”)   Autostraddle is one of the largest lesbian source of news   Roxane Gay tweeted about Juliet Takes a Breath   Gabby worked at GLSEN, the LGBT education nonprofit   Wil Moss and Sarah Brunstad were Gabby’s editors at Marvel   Jo Volpe at New Leaf Literary    Blankets by Craig Thompson was one of the first graphic novels Gabby read   The quote I reference from Amy Poehler is from an episode of her “Ask Amy” series for Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls: “Great people do things before they're ready. They do things before they know they can do it. … Doing what you're afraid of, getting out of your comfort zone, taking risks like that- that's what life is.”   Some artists of color who inspire Gabby are Trinidad Escobar, author and illustrator of graphic memoir  Crushed, and Lawrence Lindell, writer and illustrator of From Black Boy, With Love\xa0   Gabby was reading  My Beloved World, the autobiography of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, while writing Juliet Takes a Breath   Don’t miss  Gabby’s TED Talk!

Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode   In addition to Nice Try, you should also check out Josh’s standup specials: Dancing on a Weeknight (2019); Physical Whisper (from 2016); and Everything’s the Best! (2011).   Nancy Kerrigan was the subject of one of the most bizarre crimes in all of sports (really worth watching The Price of Gold, an excellent 30 for 30 documentary about the Kerrigan-Harding incident), which was documented in the film I, Tonya, which Josh’s parents did not see out of loyalty to Kerrigan   Early on Josh performed in the chorus of The Music Man   We decide that literary humor is to comedy as Garrison Keillor is to Chris Rock   Josh wrote a spec script for It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia   Josh was contributing to places like McSweeny’s and New York magazine when he first moved to the city   Josh co-founded the @SeinfeldToday Twitter account with his friend Jack P. Moore (playwright and sitcom writer for shows like Dear White People), which went viral and got him lots of professional opportunities   Josh made an impression on Jim Gaffigan with a joke about the wisdom of the justice system in D2: The Mighty Ducks when he was getting his feet wet as a standup in New York City   Josh talks about establishing authority as a standup onstage, which reminded me of Pete Holmes addressing how he looks (more like a youth pastor than a comedian) on his 2013 special, Nice Try, The Devil. You can see a great example of Josh doing something similar in his 2019 sets on Late Night with Seth Meyers and  The Late Late Show with James Cordon. Josh also got advice and encouragement about this from fellow comedian Pete Lee.   Josh got a big win when he was able to write for Billy on the Street, featuring Billy Eichner   One of the notable segments from Last Week Tonight with John Oliver was an early one about net neutrality, with a bit at the end (which Josh credits to Geoffrey Haggerty, a comedy writer for shows like The Daily Show and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver) calling for viewers to write in to the FCC. So many viewers wrote to the FCC that  its system crashed, and the government investigated whether the onslaught of feedback was from actual citizens or a coordinated DDoS attack.   Tim Carvell, head writer for The Daily Show who left with John Oliver to create Last Week Tonight with John Oliver   Josh is now the producer and writer for Desus and Mero on Showtime. Before he wrote for them, he was a fan of Desus and Mero’s podcast,  Boedga Boys, and their TV show, Desus & Mero, on VICELAND.   Josh does pep talks on Twitter from time to time, and initially was approached to write a book based on that premise. But he resisted that idea because internet darling Jonny Sun (playwright, academic, and author and illustrator of Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too -- listen to Jonny Sun’s episode of First Draft here) had already illustrated the famous Twitter pep talks written by Lin-Manuel Miranda (actor, composer, and playwright of Hamilton and In the Heights) for the book, G’Morning, G’night!: Little Pep Talks For Me & You.   I was reading Brené Brown’s Daring Greatly: How the Courage to be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead, at the same time as Josh’s memoir, which actually was a beneficial co-reading experience (FTR I also recommend Brown’s The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You’re Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are on audiobook! It’s read by Lauren Fortgang and she does a great job!)   Josh was on a panel with journalist and author Liz Plank--whose most recent book, “For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity”, is on sale now!--about shifting concepts of masculinity   Nikki Glaser, a comedian and radio host who Josh admires, gave him pivotal advice early in his career   I want to hear from you!

Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode   The term “latchkey kid” refers to a child who returns from school to an empty home, or a child who is often left at home with little parental supervision, because their parent or parents are away at work. David was reading Stephen King at an early age, as well as The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway and Lady Chatterley’s Lover by D.H. Lawrence were some of the books David read at an early age, at his dad’s behest David is married to fellow YA author, Nicola Yoon, writer of New York Times bestselling books Everything Everything and The Sun is Also a Star (listen to her episode of First Draft here) BTS is the only Kpop David knows The TV show VEEP can be mean-spirited, but it’s so good at it that people still love it David did the JET Program, the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program, for three years after college David and Nicola both attended Emerson college to get their MFA David was channeling Haruki Murakami (author of\xa0Norwegian Wood and\xa0Kafka on the Shore) in that program, and Nicola was channeling Ann Beattie (author of Chilly Scenes of Winter and Walks With Men) David was in the Emerson MFA program with Gregg Rosenblum author of the Revolution 19 series I share my fav quote from Leigh Bardugo, New York Times bestselling author of the books in the Grishaverse, including the Shadow and Bone trilogy, the Six of Crows duology, and the King of Scars duology, as well as author of forthcoming adult novel, Ninth House (listen to her episodes of First Draft here and  here)   \xa0  The addictions of writers like Truman Capote and Gertrude Stein are often romanticized. In Big Magic, Elizabeth Gilbert tackles the masculine language of pain and suffering surrounding art, dispelling the myth that writers need those things to be creative   When David watched Frozen, he wanted to know what happened with the parents  \xa0  David’s favorite advice is from Margaret Atwood: “Read, read, read. Write, write, write.” He adds: Go to therapy.  I want to hear from you! Have a question about writing or creativity for Sarah Enni or her guests to answer? To leave a voicemail, call (818) 533-1998.

We talk about addiction and fiction, loving and writing boys who fight against toxic masculinity, and fighting against “I’ll be perfect when…” thoughts. Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode   Stephen King, John Grisham, and airport novels were some of the first things Mary picked up when she moved to Texas and became a reader   Mary compares moving, learning to read, and realizing she could *remember* what she read as Bradley Cooper discovering the mind-expanding possibilities in Limitless (movie)   Mass Appeal was the graffiti magazine Mary went to work for, and they now do documentaries, including the recent Wu-Tang doc, Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men (tv series)   “Like.

However, Morgan Matson’s editor is actually Justin Chanda, also at Simon & Schuster (listen to Morgan’s First Draft episodes here and here)!   “I love my mom a not-normal amount and it makes me crazy,” an article Mary wrote for Aeon about her mom which went viral   The Joaquin Phoenix movie, Her, is akin to how Mary felt exploring the idea of falling in love over text   Mary references Justin Bieber’s first appearance on The Ellen Show. Watch it and be transported to a time when he was a mere bb   There are some similarities between Permanent Record and the Hugh Grant/Julia Roberts film Notting Hill, which is a classic   Mary and I are now both obsessed with Brené Brown, author of Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection   The New York slang that Mary uses in the book is a love letter to  Desus & Mero (who went from YouTube channel to their podcast, Bodega Boys, to a VICE and now a Showtime TV show) and Mary’s friends who run the podcast Chillin Island   Maslov’s Hierarchy of Needs is awesome but it does not include mental health   Mary is a part of Overeaters Anonymous   Holly Black talked to me in her episode (listen here) about the depressive state she fell into after publishing her first book   I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!

Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode  Link to  Sara Farizan’s First Draft episode and  Katie Cotungo’s First Draft episode In Here to Stay, Reggie Miller (former NBA player and commentator) and Kevin Harlan (NBA commentator) are Bijan’s (protagonist) favorite NBA commentators and when he needs a minute he has them narrate in his head. Sarah had the opportunity to go to Scholastic and read a chapter from Tell Me Everything! Sara Farizan recently watched Killing Eve (TV show), and thinks that because people haven't really seen female serial killers that the characters Villanelle is loved despite being an “unlikable female lead”.  “You’re Not Allowed in the Anne Hathaway Club if You Hated Her in the 2000s” article on VICE In Fireworks, Katie wanted to reflect an accurate experience of being a teen especially when writing a historical and not including social media and technology in the way we use it today Sarah made a Trent Reznor (founder, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter of the band of Nine Inch Nails) zine in high school that only five people ever saw. Sarah also played The Sims (PC game) to reflect all the things she was interested in. PostSecret was the origin of the app Veil from Tell Me Everything.

Thanks again!   | First Draft Episode #206: Stephanie Perkins and Sarah Enni I was thrilled to do an event with Stephanie Perkins, New York Times bestselling author of Anna and the French Kiss, editor of My True Love Gave to Me, and many more. We met at Malaprop’s, Stephanie’s local bookstore in Asheville, North Carolina, to discuss villains in contemporary stories, our favorite podcasts, and the upcoming Netflix movie based on Stephanie’s most recent novel, There’s Someone Inside Your House! Links and Topics Mentioned In This Episode   In Tell Me Everything By Sarah Enni, the main character Ivy uses a Post Secret type app called Veil and is faced with the moral ambiguity of social media apps. Ivy deals with the negativity of social media and twisting herself into knots trying to defend something that is special to her.   The first time that Sarah was in Asheville she was interviewed Beth Revis (Author of Across The Universe, listen to her episode of First Draft here), Meagan Spooner (Author of The Starbound Trilogy , listen to her episode of First Draft here), and Megan Sheperd (Author of Grim Lovelies, listen to her episode of First Draft here) for First Draft and she was able to reach out to them through Twitter. She believes that social media is morally gray because sites like Twitter have helped her make friends and connect with people but have also dismantled other peoples lives.   The creator of the app Veil is a villain called Rake Burmkezerg which is an acronym for Mark Zuckerberg. Rake creates an app that fosters a lot of negativity but wants to take no accountability for it which is what makes him the villain.   During her writing process, Sarah got the chance to explore her feelings about the people who have created the systems that are in charge and so much apart of our lives now e.g. Larry Ellison (Founder of Oracle Corporation) , Mark Zuckerberg (CEO of Facebook) and Jack Dorsey (CEO of Twitter). They manage a huge part of their lives and are met with almost no accountability.   Stephanie was previously seen as an exclusively Romance genre was always interested in True Crime, Horror and Thrillers. There’s Someone Inside Your House is her first thriller.   Scream (movie), was very influential to Stephanie as a child and turned her from a very frightened child into someone who saw how fun they could be and how they could be a safe place to explore your fears.   Most of Stephanie’s horror background comes from Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton as well as Stephen King novels.   There’s Someone Inside Your House is a very traditional thriller but Stephanie wanted to keep the killer's point of view out of it. Since our society celebrates villains like Hannibal Lecter and Freddy vs. Jason (movie) she wanted to take that element out of the story and focus on the victims.   Netflix has purchased There’s Someone Inside Your House a year ago and Stephanie has received the script! Henry Gayden is the screenwriter for the project and also the screenwriter for Shazam! (movie) as well as the Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse sequel (movie).   Judy Blume’s books talk about Belted undergarments and are dated but still end up being universal and timeless. So Sarah doesn’t worry about her books becoming dated and writes about what is relevant to her book now.   Sarah Enni’s First Draft Podcast episode in which she talks about her positive high school experience which also inspired the high school in Tell Me Everything.   In the eighth grade, Sarah realized her favorite movie Rushmore was her favorite movie and Radiohead was her favorite band. And she still goes back to that person to check in to make sure she’s still in touch with it and that’s were her pull to the YA genre came from.   Sarah loves NPR and started this podcast because she always wanted to be Nina Totenberg.   Sarah and Stephanie podcast recommendations: How Did This Get Made, Welcome to Nightvale, Truth and Justice with Bob Ruff, and My Favorite Murder.   The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was very influential to Stephanie to the point where she named her cat Mr. Tumnus.   When writing Anna and the French Kiss, Lola and the Boy Next Door and Isla and the Happily Ever After, Stephanie wanted to take elements of fairy-tales and even paranormal romance and pull that off with a realistic ending. She wanted the idea of two teenagers who are meant to be and will be together forever.   I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU! Have a question about writing or creativity for Sarah Enni or her guests to answer?

MoPOP, a modern art museum in Seattle that hosted the Star Wars costume exhibit when it was in town   Dealing in Dreams by Lilliam Rivera also explores the world of a matriarchy   Somaiya uses Scrivener to organize her extensive historical documents that she writes before she drafts her books   Aeon Timeline is timeline software Somaiya paid for to create a 1,000-year history of the world of her book   I get to discuss Yucca Mountain, where we should be sending all of America’s radioactive waste!

In Carry On, we meet Simon Snow, the most unlikely Chosen One ever, in his last year at the Watford School of Magicks and having a distinctly un-magical time. But Rowell steers her creation through it via adventure, laugh out loud humor, a wonderfully inventive magical system, and an extremely appealing vampire named Baz. Her fans did everything short of their own magical rituals in the hope that Simon and Baz\'s story would continue, and now the award winning author of Eleanor and Park and Fangirl has brought this couple back in  Wayward Son\xa0— and this time she\'s brought them to America. B&N YA Podcast host Melissa Albert called up Rainbow Rowell on the phone just before Wayward Son hit bookshelves, for a talk about fantasy and fandom, Baz\'s unique charms, and the special magic of a road trip. | Today on the YA Podcast, our special guest is the celebrated graphic novel writer Mariko Tamaki, in to talk about her razor-sharp and groundbreaking new take on a DC comics character who has crossed over from villainous sidekick to fan-favorite antihero. Mariko Tamaki is the Eisner Award and Caldecott Honor-winning author of celebrated graphic novels including Skim, This One Summer and Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me. With  Harley Quinn: Breaking Glass, Tamaki offers a story of teen angst, fierce loyalty, and finding your voice. Bestselling author of The Hazel Wood and regular YA Podcast host Melissa Albert spoke with Tamaki on the phone to talk about the quest to give readers a Harley they\'ve never seen before. | David Yoon is the debut author of  Frankly in Love, a tale of fake dating, first love, and life as a first-generation Korean American that deepens as it goes, from a wickedly incisive comedy to a painfully beautiful exploration of how identity is determined by and in spite of our families. We talked to Yoon about his high school years; how fatherhood has changed his craft; collaborating with his wife, the novelist Nicola Yoon; and writing his first novel. | On today\'s episode we spoke with novelist Shelby Mahurin about her darkly enchanting debut  Serpent and Dove. It\'s a story of deception, betrayal, love and magic set in a world divided between an authoritarian religious government and a mysterious society of powerful witches. Louise le Blanc is a witch hiding among townsfolk who would consider her a monster, and she finds herself in an uncomfortable alliance with righteous witch-hunter Reid Diggory. Mahurin sets their story in an atmospheric world drawn uniquely from French culture and folklore. A short while before Serpent and Dove hit bookshelves, Shelby Mahurin dropped in to out studios to talk about her inspirations and plans for the world of Serpent and Dove, which has also been chosen as a Barnes & Noble YA Book club selection.\xa0 | Our guest on today\'s episode of the B&N YA Podcast is the writer Katharine McGee talking about her new novel  American Royals, which hits bookshelves this week. McGee first dazzled readers with her Thousandth Floor trilogy, a glamorously imagined story of wealth, power and intrigue set in the dizzying atmosphere of a future Manhattan in which the word "skyscraper" takes on a whole new meaning. With American Royals, the inventive author places a modern romantic comedy in an alternate reality in which the American Revolution ended with George Washington accepting the crown from a grateful nation — and 200 years later, his descendants still hold the throne. Katharine McGee joined Melissa Albert in the studio to talk about her fascination with history, her love of a great TV cliffhanger, and the sources of her unique, addictive stories. | We are resharing one of our favorite conversations that we originally posted earlier this year, in case you missed it! Leigh Bardugo is the keeper of the Grishaverse, a sprawling fantasy landscape that includes the\xa0Shadow and Bone trilogy, the\xa0Six of Crows\xa0duology, gorgeous fairy tale collection\xa0The Language of Thorns, and now\xa0King of Scars, the opening title of a duology about Nikolai, the charming, haunted Ravkan king. On the eve of its publication we talked to Bardugo about her path to publication, finding solace in books, what it means to write a zero draft, and the upcoming Netflix adaptation.\xa0 | Gretchen McNeil is the author of YA books including the Agatha Christie-inspired\xa0Ten; the\xa0Don\'t Get Mad\xa0series, coming soon to the BBC and Netflix; and the\xa0#MurderTrending\xa0series, continuing this month with\xa0#MurderFunding, an anarchic horror comedy about a reality TV show gone disturbingly wrong. We talked to McNeil about what really scares her, how her performer\'s past influenced her writing, and being the teen with all the bad ideas. | Today our special guest is Derek Millman, author of the new novel  Swipe Right for Murder. Millman burst onto the YA scene last year with his darkly funny debut  Scream All Night, set in an off-kilter world of B-movie monsters. Swipe Right for Murder is part classic noir story, part 2019 coming of age, and absolutely page turning throughout. Millman sat down with B&N\'s Melissa Albert to talk about his obsessions, inspirations and the stories that have fed his one-of-a-kind imagination.\xa0 |   I\'m not Dying with You Tonight is the story of two high school seniors who find themselves thrown together when a fight at a sporting event ignites into widespread violence of a kind that\'s become heartbreakingly familiar. \xa0As events spiral out of control, Lena and Campbell — who are most certainly not friends — will need each other to make it through the night, get to safety and pick up the pieces. \xa0It\'s a propulsive story that unfolds over the course of hours, but the conversations that readers are going to want to have — about racism, prejudice and reality, and what it means to cross seemingly enormous divides between us — are going to go on for a long time. \xa0We were so lucky to have authors Kimberly Jones and Gilly Segal with us to talk about their enthralling debut — they dropped into the studio just as I\'m Not Dying With You Tonight hit bookshelves everywhere.  | If we had to name two things we\'re maybe most obsessed with on the B&N YA Podcast, they would be amazing debuts, and fascinating twists on classic tales. So we\'re thrilled today to have as our guest Erin A. Craig, whose brilliantly conceived debut novel  House of Salt and Sorrows is coming next week — a story that mingles eerie atmosphere, a tantalizing mystery, and a twist, of course, on one of the most haunting and beguiling of classic fairy stories, The Twelve Dancing Princesses. House of Salt and Sorrow hits bookshelves on August 6th, and in the run up to its arrival, Craig spoke with B&N\'s Melissa Albert about how her background stage-managing lavish productions helped spark her writer\'s imagination.', 'chan_desc': 'Explore the stories behind the young adult books you love with the B&N YA Podcast.

Over the course of this discussion, he retrospectively defines theory as a means of establishing the extent to which "it is legitimate to be suspicious of communication." Along the way, he reconnects with New Criticism, Jakobson, Bakhtin, Saussure, de Man, Fish, and Knapp and Michaels. Through an analysis of epitaphs and a final tour through Tony the Tow Truck, he underscores the central role of language in the variety of literary theories presented in the course. | In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry takes on Knapp and Michaels\'s influential article, "Against Theory." The historical context of the piece is given and key aspects of the theorists\' critical orientations, specifically their neo-pragmatism, are defined. A lengthy discussion of the relationships between, on the one hand, intention and meaning and, on the other hand, language and speech follows with reference to Saussure, deconstruction, and Russian formalism. Knapp and Michaels\'s use of Wordsworth\'s "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" to explore the limits of meaning and intention is examined in depth. Ultimately, the case is made, using issues subject to dispute in Knapp and Michaels, that theory is a useful and necessary tool in literary studies. | In this lecture on critical identities, Professor Fry examines the work of Stanley Fish and John Guillory. The lecture begins by examining Tony the Tow Truck as a site for the emergence of literary identities, then brings the course\'s use of the children\'s story under scrutiny through the lens of Fish. The evolution of Fish\'s theory of interpretive communities is traced chronologically through his publications and examined in close-up in Milton\'s Paradise Lost. John Guillory\'s work on interpretive communities and the culture wars leads to a discussion of the Western canon and multiculturalism. | In this lecture on queer theory, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Judith Butler in relation to Michel Foucault\'s History of Sexuality. Differences in terminology and methods are discussed, including Butler\'s emphasis on performance and Foucault\'s reliance on formulations such as "power-knowledge" and "the deployment of alliance." Butler\'s fixation with ontology is explored with reference to Levi-Strauss\'s concept of the raw and the cooked. At the lecture\'s conclusion, Butler\'s interrogation of identity politics is compared with that of postcolonial and African-American theorists. | In this lecture on post-colonial theory, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Edward Said and Homi K. Bhabha. The complicated origins, definitions, and limitations of the term "post-colonial" are outlined. Elaine Showalter\'s theory of the phasic development of female literary identity is applied to the expression of post-colonial identities. Crucial terms such as ambivalence, hybridity, and double consciousness are explained. The relationship between Bhabha\'s concept of sly civility and Gates\'s "signifyin\'" is discussed, along with the reliance of both on semiotics. | In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines trends in African-American criticism through the lens of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Toni Morrison. A brief history of African-American literature and criticism is undertaken, and the relationship of both to feminist theory is explicated. The problems in cultural and identity studies of essentialism, "the identity queue," expropriation, and biology are surveyed, with particular attention paid to the work of Michael Cooke and Morrison\'s reading of Huckleberry Finn. At the lecture\'s conclusion, the tense relationship between African-American studies and New Critical assumptions are explored with reference to Robert Penn Warren\'s poem, "Pondy Woods." | In this lecture on feminist criticism, Professor Paul Fry uses Virginia Woolf\'s A Room of One\'s Own as a lens to and commentary on the flourishing of feminist criticism in the twentieth century. The structure and rhetoric of A Room of One\'s Own is extensively analyzed, as are its core considerations of female novelists such as Austen, Eliot, and the Brontës. The works of major feminist critics, such as Ann Douglas, Mary Ellman, Kate Millett, Elaine Showalter, and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, are mentioned. The logocentric approach to gender theory, specifically the task of defining female language as something different and separate from male language, is considered alongside Woolf\'s own endorsement of literary and intellectual androgyny. | In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines the work of two seminal New Historicists, Stephen Greenblatt and Jerome McGann. The origins of New Historicism in Early Modern literary studies are explored, and New Historicism\'s common strategies, preferred evidence, and literary sites are explored. Greenblatt\'s reliance on Foucault is juxtaposed with McGann\'s use of Bakhtin. The lecture concludes with an extensive consideration of the project of editing of Keats\'s poetry in light of New Historicist concerns. | In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores Fredric Jameson\'s seminal work, The Political Unconscious, as an outcropping of Marxist literary criticism and structural theory. Texts such as Shelley\'s "Ode to the West Wind" and Shakespeare\'s seventy-third sonnet are examined in the context of Jameson\'s three horizons of underlying interpretive frameworks--the political, the social, and the historical, each carefully explained. The extent to which those frameworks permeate individual thought is addressed in a discussion of Jameson\'s concept of the "ideologeme." The theorist\'s work is juxtaposed with the writings of Bakhtin and Levi-Strauss. The lecture concludes by revisiting the children\'s story Tony the Tow Truck, upon which Jameson\'s theory of literature is mapped. | This first lecture on social theories of art and artistic production examines the Frankfurt School. The theoretical writings of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin are explored in historical and political contexts, including Marxism, socialist realism, and late capitalism. The concept of mechanical reproduction, specifically the relationship between labor and art, is explained at some length. Adorno\'s opposition to this argument, and his own position, are explained. The lecture concludes with a discussion of Benjamin\'s perspective on the use of distraction and shock in the process of aesthetic revelation.', 'chan_desc': '(ENGL 300) This is a survey of the main trends in twentieth-century literary theory.

It was radical, exciting, and very political. And Gloria’s kindness, openness, and authenticity really shined through. In this episode, we discussed the difference between French and American feminism (7:25), what advice Gloria would give to her 20-year-old self (29:41), and about the idea of Paris as a village (4:50). \xa0 | All of New York seems to be talking about the new restaurant, Le Coucou, by chef Daniel Rose. Fortunately, Daniel’s son and Bénédicte’s daughter attended the same nursery school, and after a playdate one day, a podcast recording was arranged. Daniel has led an incredible life––a Chicago native, he studied philosophy in France before opening several successful French restaurants in Paris. Our late-afternoon conversation at Le Coucou was so fascinating that we recorded right through our planned apéro.\xa0 We spoke about modernizing traditional French cuisine (7:51), expanding traditional French food internationally (22:48), Daniel’s dream of eating ortolan (10:57), and why Americans love the Big Mac (10:04). | We first collaborated with Darren\xa0Walker, the passionate and articulate President of the Ford Foundation, on a groundbreaking exhibition entitled\xa0Posing Modernity: The Black Model from Manet and Matisse to Today at Colombia University's Wallach Art Gallery in New York. It shed new light on black models in the arts throughout history and was so successful that it was exported to the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. With characteristic rigor and enthusiasm, Darren made sure to assemble the best team possible to work on this project, and like a true Francophile, even travelled to Paris for the opening. We talked about the role of art in creating an empathetic society (10:42), philanthropy as a catalyst for social change (15:02), controversial funding sources (20:55), the Notre Dame Cathedral fire (18:19), his favorite Francophone artists (24:10), the African diaspora (28:08), and more. | The amazing thing about Adam Gopnik, staff writer for The New Yorker,\xa0is that he knows more about France than many French people. It’s as if this podcast was made for him. You can ask him a question about anything, from the Statue of Liberty to French pop music, and he will give you an eloquent, informative and captivating answer.\xa0 When he arrived at the French Embassy’s building on Fifth\xa0Avenue for this interview, we had just begun major renovations. We basically met in a storage room, between two cabinets and a sofa propped on its side. Let’s say, this is what added to the informal nature of the conversation. We talked about the intellectual exchange between France and America (2:10), the role of the president in both countries (24:30), Montaigne (3:34), Romain Gary (12:40), and Bastille Day. (31:50).\xa0 |    Visual artist Mickalene Thomas seems to have artwork everywhere, from the Moody Arts Center in Houston to the Brooklyn Museum and Paris. One morning in June, Mickalene and her partner and muse, Racquel Chevremont, joined me at Albertine, the French bookstore on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. The three of us talked at length about how Mickalene reinterprets famous French paintings; about the visibility of black women in the arts; Mickalene and Racquel’s love for Dior and French butter; and the role that Paris plays for African-American artists.    \xa0 |  Jonathan\xa0Galassi\xa0has been at the helm of the legendary publishing house Farrar, Straus & Giroux—one of the most literary publishers in the U.S.—for more than 30 years. He is the Antoine Gallimard of America, if you will. He’s also an eminent translator of Italian and French poetry and a poet himself. \xa0Jonathan Galasssi walked over to my apartment one spring morning, carrying a giant tote bag of French poetry. We talked about French and American poetry (6:33), how French authors get published in the U.S. (16:05), Michel Houellebecq (20:35), and his favorite spots in Paris (29:34). It was a wonderful and poetic morning, as you’ll hear in this episode.\xa0      |  Adam Weinberg\xa0is the Director of the Whitney Museum of American Art—one of the most important museums in the United States. I met him when I first arrived in New York, during his own Arts and Letters award ceremony, which we had organized at our bookstore, Albertine. It was then that I first discovered that, despite his grand title, Adam is an extremely generous, down-to-Earth person. In this episode, we candidly broach some very controversial topics, including cultural appropriation (17:00) and funding in the art world (5:03). And of course, we also spoke about cultural life in France (15:18).\xa0  |  When I started as Cultural Counselor of the French Embassy, everyone told me that I had to meet Claire Messud—that she was quintessential Francophile intellectual, not to mention author of six works of fiction. We conversed about what it means to be a citizen of the world (2:04), literature (4:45), Flaubert (5:20), Algeria (7:20), and\xa0feminism (9:50)—as well as her memories of childhood vacations in the south of France (20:12). It was like talking with a friend, as you’ll hear now. C’est parti.    |  I met Liesl Schillinger, the literary critic and translator, 11 years ago. I had just been appointed as a negotiator for France at the UN Security Council in New York. As a critic for The New York Times, she was invited to every book party in town, and she generously took me to every one. Here we talked about translation (4:55), French books (13:54), and secret recommendations for visiting France (19:58). She also surprised me by declaring her love for the most unexpected French singer (21:17).      | David Sedaris––one of the best-known American humor writers and radio personalities––has written extensively about his time in France.\xa0No one skewers the French like he does. He's written about our language, especially our weird gendered words, living in a village in Normandy, and shopping at unusual Parisian boutiques. He came to my apartment one afternoon and we talked about his French teacher (15:40), the different types of humor on each side of the Atlantic (2:43), his love for certain French words (16:44), our health care system (25:15), and his dislike for the French habit of kissing (29:57).", 'chan_desc': 'The Thing About France is a podcast where cultural figures explore the fascinating and complicated relationship between France and America.

A spur-of-the-moment purchase of a random assortment of Baby-Sitters Club books on eBay sparked the excitement that would become Generation BSC. And what is Generation BSC? First, it’s a micro-generation Kate and Lauryn have identified with between Generation X and Millennials. This micro-generation has also been called the Oregon Trail Generation, Generation Catalano, the Star Wars Generation, Xennials, and Elder Millennials - essentially, for our purposes, those born between 1980 and 1985 who would have read Baby-Sitters Club books as they were being released in the late 80s and early 90s. Second, it’s a biweekly episodic podcast where Kate and Lauryn revisit each book in the Baby-Sitters Club series both looking back at how they approached the topics and themes when they read the books as children and comparing that with how they approach the same topics and themes in 2019 (and beyond). Eventually, the podcast will include guests and “Very Special Episodes” where Kate and Lauryn visit other pop culture from the same era and later, using the Baby-Sitters Club and Generation BSC as a jumping off point for discussion.Whether you’ve loved the Baby-Sitters Club since childhood or are jumping in for the first time, you’ll have a great time reading along with Kate and Lauryn.

Naya, of Naya Reads and Smiles (the largest channel lead by a black booktuber), also spoke on the issue in her own video. The disparity between White booktubers and Black booktubers is undeniable. “White BookTubers who garner at least 300,000 subscribers on their YouTube channels … and two out of three of them even have their own published novels. On the flip side, the most well-known African-American BookTuber to date is Naya Reads and Smiles, with only 58,000 subscribers, despite having been uploading videos for years.In other news, we also discussed:Toni Morrison passed away, and Roxane Gay wrote a great piece for The New York Times about her legacy.

Oh, and the occasional random hook-up she indulges in to pass the time. When Jersey meets Isaiah “Zay” Broussard with his soulful gray eyes, quick wit and easy charm, she’s determined to remain aloof. She doesn\'t have time to get sidetracked by fleeting fantasies, even if she does feel an unexplainable connection to Zay she’s never experienced before.Love BelvinThe Rhythm of Blues: (First book in her Love in Rhythm & Blues series) Ragee is a successful R&B singer, music composer, and actor who shot to fame and celebrity at rocketing speed.

Hot take here. Staff picks work! Emma had a staff pick on All the Lives I Want and Holland actually picked it up at Elliott Bay while visiting Seattle before our episode! (Shout out to our episode with Amy Stephenson from The Booksmith, who initially recommended it to us, and to our favorite audiobook provider,\xa0Libro.fm.)    \xa0 \xa0  \xa0   View this post on Instagram  Picked this up @elliottbaybookco from their #stafffavorite shelf, cracking it open tonight. #essays #hollandreads #literarytourism #shoplocal @grandcentralpub  A post shared by The Novel Neighbor (@novelneighbor) on Jul 29, 2018 at 4:54pm PDT   \xa0 --- Chapter II [26:37] In Which No One Tells Holland She\'s Crazy, People Love Their Greeting Cards, The Drunk Booksellers Marvel at Novel Neighbor\'s Ability to Handsell Events, and We Reiterate that Bookstores are a Business (whaaaa?) The Novel Neighbor: More Than A Bookstore  The Novel Neighbor is not just a bookstore. In addition to author events, they host\xa0birthday parties, summer camps,\xa0bookstore yoga, and adult classes (like continuing ed, but sexier), among other things (sorry Amanda!). Recommended reading for staff retreats:   StrengthsFinder 2.0 by Tom Rath  168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think by Laura VanderKam  Beware of squirreling, y\'all.  \xa0 Chapter III [47:06] In Which We Move From Books to Books, Talk About Hybridity, and We Finally Meet a Bookseller Who Has Read Harry Potter Book Description Guaranteed to Get You Reading\xa0 Anything meets anything. NOT "It\'s the next" NOT EVERYTHING IS THE NEXT HUNGER GAMES, Y\'ALL. Hybridity.  Holland loved a book that was Comic Con meets The Help. FYI, it\'s called The Almost Sisters by Joshilyn Jackson. Emma recommends Hawkeye by Matt Friction. It\'s Buffy meets Veronica Mars. Which apparently is listed on Emma\'s shelf talker. But, like, who reads those?  Desert Island Pick The Secret Garden by\xa0Frances Hodgson Burnett Emma hasn\'t finished The Secret Garden, but The Little Princess might be Emma\'s Desert Island pick. That said, she hearts Mandy by Julie Andrews, which is kinda the same thing, so that counts, right?  Station Eleven Picks Practical: anything from the Did you Know shelf, such as\xa0How to Stay Alive in the Woods: A Complete Guide to Food, Shelter and Self-Preservation Anywhere by\xa0Bradford Angier Political: Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President by\xa0Candice Millard Wild Pick  The Amazing Adventures of a Nobody and The Kindness Diaries: One Man\'s Quest to Ignite Goodwill and Transform Lives Around the World by\xa0Leon Logothetis Book of Joy by the Dalai Lama Bookseller Confession Holland hated Fates and Furies by Lauren Groff and The Nest by Cynthia D\'Aprix Sweeney. Also, she never read Catcher in the Rye, which both Kim and Emma are totally okay with. Emma says you should skip Catcher and read Franny and Zooey.\xa0 Shout out to a bookseller who has\xa0actually read Harry Potter.  Go-To Handsell Best book Holland has read since she opened the bookstore (whoa): The One-In-A-Million Boy by Monica Wood Kids of Appetite by David Arnold (if you liked\xa0Outsiders, read this) Go-To Picture Books: Lady Pancake and Sir French Toast by John Funk, illustrated by\xa0Brendan\xa0Kearney Interstellar Cinderella by\xa0Deborah\xa0Underwood, illustrated by Meg Hunt Impossible Handsell Good Luck of Right Now by Matthew Quick (author of Silver Linings Playbook and The Reason You\'re Alive)  FYI: Emma\'s really into Richard Gere.\xa0\xa0 Book for Booksellers Throw back to\xa0Laura VanderKam 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works by Dan Harris Favorite Bookstores  Flyleaf Books\xa0- Chapel Hill, NC Elliott Bay Book Company\xa0- Seattle, WA Strand Book Store\xa0- New York, NY novel.\xa0- Memphis, TN The Last Bookstore\xa0- Los Angeles, CA  Road Trips are for bookstores, right?

Follow Books & Whatnot on Twitter at\xa0@booksandwhatnot.  Chapter I In which a local coffee shop assists in alcohol acquisition, we want more spaceships and dragons, and a book brings Emma to tears. We’re Drinking Christen and Julia were given some free beer from their local coffeeshop, Orange Spot Coffee: Stillwater Artisinal\'s Stateside Saisan and Sake-Style Saison. As our cocktail for the evening, we\'re drinking the Lime of the Ancient Mariner from Tim Federle\'s\xa0Tequila Mockingbird.   Christen\'s Reading  \xa0   War Storm by Victoria Aveyard   I’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara  Shout out to\xa0Joan Didion\'s Slouching Towards Bethlehem    Julia\'s Reading  \xa0\xa0\xa0   Girl in Snow by Danya Kukafka (audiobook via Libro.fm)   How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan   Monsoon Mansion by Cinelle Barnes   Daphne by Will Boast   Kim\'s Reading  \xa0  Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann (audiobook via Libro.fm) Amateur by Thomas Page McBee (pubs August 14, 2018)  McBee\'s previous book,\xa0Man Alive, is also excellent    Emma\'s Reading  \xa0   Circe by Madeline Miller (audiobook via\xa0Libro.fm)   The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai\xa0   Forthcoming & Newly-New Titles We\'re Excited About Julia & Christen are Excited About  \xa0\xa0   The White Darkness by David Grann (pubs Oct 30, 2018)  My Sister the Serial Killer by\xa0Oyinkan Braithwaite (pubs Nov 20, 2018) Cult X by\xa0Fuminori Nakamura  Kim\'s Excited About  \xa0  So Lucky by\xa0Nicola Griffith (audiobook via\xa0Libro.fm)  also check out her bestselling historical fantasy novel, Hild   Any Man by Amber Tamblyn  Emma\'s Excited About  \xa0\xa0\xa0   There There by Tommy Orange  Fight No More by Lydia Millet Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik (pubs July 10, 2018)  her previous book, Uprooted, is one of Emma\'s faves   Half-Witch by John\xa0Schoffstall (pubs July 17, 2018)   Chapter II [23:30] In which we discuss how bookstores work (and how you keep books on the shelves in a bookstore that moves), Julia and Christen give advice to future bookmobile owners, and the mobile bookstore finds a forever home! Customer: So, is this a library?  Interested in breaking into publishing (then abandoning your fancy degree to become a bookseller)? Check out the University of Denver Publishing Institute. Julia and Christen met there, so that bodes well. Shout out to Blue Bicycle (founder of\xa0YALLFest, Charleston\'s Young Adult Book Festival) Fun fact: the aunt in Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson is described as itinerant. Maybe not the best role model, but not the worst! The bookmobile is so purrrrrrrrrty:    \xa0 Books that Itinerant Literate must have in stock:    City of Thieves by\xa0David Benioff Kafka on the Shore by\xa0Haruki Murakami Man Called Ove by\xa0Fredrik Backman Ella Enchanted by\xa0Gail Carson Levine\xa0 Lunar Chronicles Series by\xa0Marissa Meyer Replica and Ringer by Lauren Oliver  Tips for potential bookmobile owners:  What\'s an SAN? Ok, go to www.bowker.com Have an accountant in the family. Indiegogo is your friend. (Kickstarter only gives you the funds if you meet your goal, whereas Indiegogo allows you to choose to still get your funds if you don\'t meet your goal.) Bungie cords are clutch. Know your legal obligations (you need separate business licenses for every municipality!) For the first few months, plan two hours more than you think you\'ll need. Ask someone who is not in your field to walk through your store and give you feedback. Don\'t take everything a customer says to heart. Engage sometimes, but not always. Bookstores are businesses too, y\'all.   Chapter III [44:30] In which Julia, Christen, & Emma have the same wheelhouse; we debate Christen\'s concept of "feel-good" books; and Christen wants to be fierce & fearsome while naked Book Description Guaranteed to Get You Reading Christen loves fiction containing witches, dystopias, feminism, misandry, unreliable narrators, and anachronistic elements. Also, nonfiction books about product and content marketing. Highly recommend\xa0Building a Storybrand by\xa0Donald Miller.   Emma recommends We Were Witches by Ariel Gore, cause witches + misandry = win!  Julia digs retold fairy tales and pop science/medical nonfiction (shout out to\xa0This is Your Brain on Parasites by Kathleen McAuliffe). Desert Island Pick Christen: Harry Potter, natch  Julia: Young Adult faves, such as Anna and the French Kiss by\xa0Stephanie Perkins   Station Eleven Picks Christen\'s practical book:\xa0Peterson\'s Field Guides to Medical Plants Christen\'s "feel-good" books: Letters to a Young Poet, One Hundred Years of Solitude\xa0by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer, and The History of Love by Nicole Krauss. Or, to go more apocalyptic: The Giver by\xa0Lois Lowry (aka "The Handmaid\'s Tale for children")   Julia: The Unbearable Lightness of Being by\xa0Milan Kundera Wild Pick Julia: Nature reading (The Soul of an Octopus by Sy Montgomery) or books about female resistance Christen wants a guidebook about how to be Lady Godiva. #legit  Lady Godiva, the ultimate Rebel Girl Bookseller Confession Christen actively doesn\'t finish things she doesn\'t enjoy. Real talk, this is a necessity for all booksellers. And readers. And humans. Neither Julia, Christen, nor Emma have read\xa0Philip Pullman\'s\xa0His Dark Materials. For the record, Kim loves this series and owns multiple editions of the books. Because it\'s awesome and Kim has great taste. Seriously, look at this pretty cover:   Impossible Handsell Julia: Getting Mother\'s Body by\xa0Suzan-Lori Parks Christen: Eligible by Curtis Sittenfeld Everyone: Hogarth\'s Shakespeare series  Book for Booksellers Julia: Jane Unlimited by\xa0Kristin Cashore Christen: Building a Storybrand by\xa0Donald Miller Favorite Bookstores  Avid Bookshop in Athens, GA Battery Book Exchange & Champagne Bar in Asheville, NC Flyleaf Books in Chapel Hill, NC Charis Books\xa0in\xa0Atlanta, GA Little Shop of Stories in\xa0Decatur, GA Tattered Cover (which is where Julia and Christen met! best #meetcute ever)  Favorite Literary Media  Shelf Awareness and Lit Hub On Twitter: Maris Kreizman (author of Slaughterhouse 90210 and judge for Book of the Month Club) Poet.org Poem of the Day    Epilogue In which we tell you where to find Itinerant Literate on the Internets  Website: itinerantliteratebooks.com or chsbookmobile.com Facebook: itinerantliteratebooks Twitter: @chsbookmobile Instagram: @chsbookmobile Tumblr: itinerantliterate.tumblr.com  You can find us on:  Twitter:\xa0@drunkbookseller Litsy: @drunkbooksellers Facebook Instagram Email  Newsletter Website  Emma tweets from\xa0@thebibliot\xa0and writes bookish things for\xa0Book Riot.

Introduction In which we apologize profusely for the delay in our episode posting, bond over Kelly Link, and get excited about books that are... already out We had the pleasure of chatting with Javier nearly every week for a month while trying to record this episode (#techfail), then ran into a few other delays (#lifefail), but WE HAVE PREVAILED. That said, we talk about books that are already out as if they\'re forthcoming and we\'re drinking a nice "summer" drink because it was, you know, still summer when we first started this wild ride of an episode. Just pretend you\'re a time traveler visiting the halcyon days of late August 2017.\xa0 \xa0 We’re Drinking Vodka & Tonics with NO FRUIT  Javier\'s Reading   a bunch of nonfiction for the Kirkus Nonfiction Prize   The Sun in Your Eyes by Deborah Shapiro   Heartbreaker by Maryse Meijer   The Seventh Function of Language by Laurent Binet   Ranger Games by Ben Blum   Kim\'s Reading   Mother of All Questions by Rebecca Solnit   (and check out the  Huffington Post article about being mansplained to while reading about Solnit\'s Men Explain Things to Me)     You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie   The Store by James Patterson... \'cause Patterson is awesome, gives booksellers (including your grateful hosts) money for fancy things like student loan debt and ridiculous urban rent, trolls Amazon for funsies, and rocks a photoshopped Santa hat like a boss:      Kim\'s reading aloud: My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George   Emma\'s Reading   MIS(H)Adra by Iasmin Omar   Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado... Emma\'s favorite story from the collection is “Inventory”   Lumberjanes: Unicorn Power! by Mariko Tamaki   Spinster by Kate Bolick   \xa0 Forthcoming Titles We\'re Excited For Kim\'s Epic List of Titles that Are Already Out   The Golden House by Salman Rushdie   Sing, Unburied, Sing by Jesmyn Ward   Miss Kopp’s Midnight Confessions by Amy Stewart   What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton   Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng   Afterglow by Eileen Myles   Never Stop by Simba Sana   The Origin of Others by Toni Morrison   Javier\'s Excited About   The Heart’s Invisible Furies by John Boyne   Release by Patrick Ness (if you haven\'t read Ness before, Javier recommends you start with The Chaos Walking series, which beginning with The Knife of Never Letting Go)   Dinner at the Center of the Earth by Nathan Englander (also mentioned The Ministry of Special Cases and What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank)   The Gone World by Tom Sweterlitsch (pubs 2/6/18)   The Grip of It by Jac Jemc    Emma\'s Excited About   The Glass Town Game by Catherynne M Valente   In Other Lands by Sarah Rees Brennan   We Were Witches by Ariel Gore (How to Become a Famous Writer Before You’re Dead)   A Loving, Faithful Animal by Josephine Rowe    Chapter I [26:50] In which Javier conquers the Chicago bookselling scene Javier started at Tower Records (RIP) He currently manages the Fiercely Independent\xa0Chicago-area bookstore,\xa0The Book Table.  Javier has worked at pretty much every bookstore in Chicago. Other than the OG Powell\'s. Unless you\'re talking time travel. Javier\'s epic Tour de Bookselling (chronologically): Tower Books --> Crown Books --> Barbara\'s Bookstore --> The Book Cellar --> Seminary Co-op Bookstores --> 57th Street Books --> Newberry Library Bookstore --> Book Stall --> City Lit Books --> The Book Table\xa0  Chapter II [33:45] In which we talk Publishing Cocktails and how to network IRL in the internet age Publishing Cocktails, created by Javier and Keir Graff (senior editor at BookList) brings Chicago-area book industry folk from around the country together. They have two primary meetup events: Book Swap & Cash Mob.  Follow Publishing Cocktails on Twitter at @PubNight. Sign up for the Publishing Cocktails email list for future updates.\xa0\xa0  Chapter III [38:20] In which Emma is, once again, deeply disappointed Book Description Guaranteed to Get You Reading Anything not blurbed by Lena Dunham (shout out to  Gary Shteyngart’s epicly excessive blurbing). Anything blurbed by Kelly Link or George Saunders. Check the blurbs on Patrick Rothfuss’s Name of the Wind. Plus time travel! Kim and Javier bond over All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders (shout out to the Booze and Lasers Book Club at Third Place Books Seward Park), with references to Michael Crichton’s Timeline and, you know, Harry Potter. Emma ruins the ending of one of the stories in A Guide to Being Born by Ramona Ausubel. Desert Island Pick The entire body of work of Agatha Christie Station Eleven Pick Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, which has Javier’s favorite first line: It was a pleasure to burn. In case you were wondering, Emma’s favorite first (and second) line(s) come from Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House. Javier’s posting staff’s favorite lines from literature in his store and he drunkenly promised Emma that he’d post hers too. Pics or it didn’t happen, Javier. Wild Pick The Hidden Life of Trees by\xa0Peter Wohlleben Bookseller Confession HAS ANY BOOKSELLER ACTUALLY READ HARRY POTTER? JESUS, YOU GUYS. Go-To Handsell Geek Love by Katherine Dunn Here\'s Javier\'s blurb, blatantly stolen from The Book Table\'s website: When confronted with the "What is your favorite book of all time?" query, most people will often pause, looking over the inquisitors head while thoughtfully scratching his or her chin. I, on the other hand, will not hesitate when I tell you this. Geek Love is my favorite book. Of all time. Period. This oddball masterpiece (a National Book Award Finalist in 1989) shaped me as a reader and more importantly as a bookseller 20+ years ago. It\'s one of those reading experiences that make you feel like you\'re in on some life-changing secret. A novel that will chill you, move you and make you laugh, often at the same time. Help celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Geek Love, quite possibly the best novel you\'ve never read. Master & the Margarita by\xa0Mikhail Bulgakov: There\'s a cat that drinks vodka and talks! Bonus Bookseller Confession from both Emma and Kim: They’ve never read either of Javier’s go-to handsells. #booksellerfail Impossible Handsell The End of Alice by A M Homes (author of This Book Will Save Your Life\xa0and Music for Torching) Also mentioned, the origin impossible handsell: Tampa by Alissa Nutting Book for Booksellers The Grip of It by Jac Jemc Still Life with Tornado by AS King (author of Ask the Passengers) Another stolen blurb from The Book Table\'s website: In Still Life with Tornado A.S. King captures the human condition we refer to as "being a teenager" with so little effort I found myself utterly floored. Exploring the way that memory affects grief and vice versa was second in genius only to how King manifests said memory/grief in the mind of 16 year old Sarah. King weaves family history, art and what our past, present and the future can tell us about ourselves into a perfect storm of a book.

Introduction In which we make pot jokes and get excited about books We\'re switching up our intoxicant of choice this episode and getting stoned rather than drunk (mostly). Paul\'s rocking Mr. Moxey\'s Mints (of the peppermint/sativa variety). Emma\'s smoking CBD (not to be confused with William Steig\'s children\'s picture book, CDB!). Kim stops talking while stoned—which would make for a really awkward\xa0podcast episode—so she\'s drinking the hoppiest IPA she could find instead. Everyone\'s a little too high to explain the varieties of weed particularly well, so you should just read David Schmader\'s Weed: The User\'s Guide: A 21st Century Handbook for Enjoying Marijuana.  Paul\'s Reading:  Up South by Robert Lashley The Nameless City by Faith Erin Hicks A collection of books from Mount Analogue Press  Manners by Ted Powers Final Rose by Halie Theoharides (a comic book tone poem about love and loss made up screenshots from The Bachelor)   Reading Through It book club pick: What We Do Now: Standing Up for Your Values in Trump\'s America,\xa0edited by Dennis Johnson   Emma\'s Reading:  First Position by Melissa Brayden (thanks to a recommendation from our\xa0episode with  The Ripped Bodice) Giant Days 4 by John Allison, Max Sarin, Lissa Treiman, Liz Fleming, and Whitney Cogar All the Lives I Want: Essays about My Best Friends Who Happen to Be Famous Strangers by Alana Massey (thanks to a recommendation from our episode with  Amy Stephenson)   Kim\'s Reading:  We Should All Be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Hope in the Dark by Rebecca Solnit On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century by Timothy Snyder The Aisles Have Eyes: How Retailers Track Your Shopping, Strip Your Privacy, and Define Your Power by Joseph Turow\xa0  Forthcoming Titles We\'re Excited For:  You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie (out June 13) Love and Trouble: a Midlife Reckoning by Claire Dederer (out May 9)  also mentioned Poser: My Life in Twenty-Three Yoga Poses   Theft by Finding: Diaries (1977-2002) by David Sedaris (out May 30) Hunger: a Memoir of (My) Body by Roxane Gay (out June 13) Priestdaddy by Patricia Lockwood (out May 2) Borne by Jeff VanderMeer (out April 25) Book of Joan by Lidia Yuknavitch (out April 18) Woman No. 17 by Edan Lepucki (out May 9) Isadora by Amelia Gray (out May 23) Dreaming the Beatles: the Love Story of One Band and the Whole World by Rob Sheffield (out April 25) Witches, Sluts, Feminists: Conjuring the Sex Positive by Kristen J Sollee (out June 13) Modern Tarot: Connecting with Your Higher Self Through the Wisdom of the Cards by Michelle Tea (out June 13) The Perfect Mix: Everything I Know about Leadership I Learned as a Bartender by Helen Rothberg (out June 20)   Chapter I [18:50] In which we learn what The Seattle Review of Books is, talk about book reviews as a meta art form, and get advice on promoting diversity and being a safe, welcoming place for people who aren\'t\xa0white bros The Seattle Review of Books is a book news, review, and interviews site. This isn\'t consumer reports, with a thumbs up or down on each title; each review aims to have a conversation with the book. It\'s a site that aims to look like your bookshelf, without genre classification. Emma & Kim don\'t quite understand Paul\'s assertion that people don\'t organize their bookshelves, but we roll with it.  SRB makes all their money through a single sponsor (which changes each week). If you\'re interested in their sponsorship program, you can learn more here. Paul wants to promote young, new writers and help them build up their clip file. So you should probably pitch him with your brilliant, bookish ideas. Email submissions@seattlereviewofbooks\xa0or fill in the contact form on their about page. Emma particularly loves the Help Desk by Cienna Madrid. Ask Cienna an awkward book-related question at advice@seattlereviewofbooks.com.  Being a couple of white guys, Paul and his co-founder Martin McClellan are extremely concerned with diverse representation. You can learn more about how SRB encourages diversity in both the books they review and the reviewers they publish on their about page (or by listening to this episode...). But you should know right off the bat, they are not here to promote the new Franzen novel and they will not pander to bros.\xa0   Chapter II [33:10] In which we talk about life in the US post-election, say something negative about a book, and discuss Paul\'s past (and current) life as a bookseller Reading Through It\xa0is a post-election book club hosted by Seattle Review of Books, the Seattle Weekly, and Third Place Books Seward Park. They meet the first Wednesday of every month. On our post-election world, Paul Constant says: "This is what books were made for. Books are engines of empathy... the only way to do a deep-dive into an issue. It\'s our stored knowledge... This is the moment for books."  The next Reading Through It book group pick is The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion\xa0by Jonathan Haidt. They\'ll be meeting Wednesday May 3rd at Third Place Books Seward Park. Read Paul\'s article on his time at Borders:\xa0Books Without Borders: My Life at the World\'s Dumbest Bookstore Chain  Though he\'s not technically a bookseller anymore, Paul is still "on team books." Keep an eye out for our "I\'m On Team Books" t-shirts, which may or may not be a thing we sell one day.  Chapter III [43:20] In which Paul is better at explaining our questions than stoned Emma is at asking them, Emma and Kim give Paul major side-eye due to his bookseller confession, and Emma continues to push Uprooted by Naomi Novik Desert Island Pick (what would you read that you never had the time to read before): The Years of Lyndon Johnson by Robert Caro (beginning with The Path to Power) We couldn\'t find a video of the following clip of Caro on the Colbert Report, so we\'ll just leave you this series of gifs to explain why you, too, should consider bringing an epic five-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson as your desert beach read:      You\'re welcome. Now, back to your regularly scheduled show notes.\xa0 Station Eleven Picks (the books to preserve for society) The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (everything you need to know about living in a society) Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (everything you need to know about life and how it doesn’t always work out the way you want, but you should live it anyway) Read Paul\'s  essay about\xa0The Scarlet Letter, originally written for Scarecrow Video. Wild Pick\xa0(traveling is about observing things... soaking everything in) We Tell Ourselves Stories In Order to Live by Joan Didion ("because she is the greatest observer on the planet and I would want to be like her when I was traveling") Bookseller Confession\xa0 Once again, we have a guest who hasn\'t read Harry Potter. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? Paul also hasn\'t read Lord of the Rings\xa0and Kim proceeds to side-eye him from across the city.  (In case you were wondering, the title of the direct link to this gif is "wtf-i-cant-even-you-are-stupid." Just sayin\'.) Emma, naturally, tries to convert Paul to fantasy w/ an Uprooted recommendation because "nobody doesn\'t like it." Paul commits to reading it in order to prove her wrong. Go-To Handsell\xa0Fup\xa0by Jim Dodge Paul saved the book from going out of print and—arguably more importantly—he handsold a copy to Allison Hannigan.

Introduction In which we feel real fancy, learn more about geography, and can’t stop asking for recommendations. We’re drinking French 75s and feeling classy as fuck.  We’re Reading Bea is reading Murder on Black Swan Lane by Andrea Penrose (out June 27). And she recently finished An Extraordinary Union by Alyssa Cole, which she thinks will be a great gateway romance (out March 28) about a female spy posing as a slave. Fun fact, Alyssa Cole lives in Martinique, and Kim and Emma’s geography lessons continue.  Leah is reading Kiss Me That Way by Laura Trentham and Flirting with Disaster by Victoria Dahl. Emma is reading Hot Dog Taste Test by Lisa Hanawalt—a graphic foodie memoir that is weird and delicious. She also just started Kim & Kim by Magdalene Visaggio, which is a comic about punk rock bounty hunters in space. Kim is reading Love Is Love a graphic anthology written in response to the Orlando shooting curated by Marc Andreyko; an important, but difficult read. All proceeds for the book go to the victims, survivors, and families affected by the Orlando Pulse shooting. Which is to say, everyone should buy this book. She’s also reading The Book of Joan by Lidia Yuknavitch (out April 18) a futuristic space Joan of Arc story, which hits weirdly close to home in its political content. We’re Excited About: Bea and Leah have so many frontlist romance novels to tell you about:  An Extraordinary Union by Alyssa Cole (more than worth a second mention and out March 28) Full Mountie (#3 in the Frisky Beavers series) by Ainsley Booth & Sadie Haller (out April 4)  First in the Frisky Beavers series is Prime Minister\xa0“and is basically about if Justin Trudeau weren’t married and liked kinky sex.”   Ramona Blue by Julie Murphy (author of Dumplin’;\xa0out May 9) The Thing About Love by Julie James (out April18)\xa0  Julie James will be making an appearance at Ripped Bodice on her author tour!

SIDETRACK: Polyamory Recommendations Laid Bare by Lauren Dane (#1 in the Brown Family series) Maya Banks Glutton for Pleasure by Alisha Rai Back to frontlist... Kim is looking forward to  The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas Whereas: Poems by Layli Long Soldier The Mother of All Questions by Rebecca Solnit Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Chapter I [19:00] In which we discuss Bea & Leah’s Romance Origin Story, Talk Vaginal-Looking Covers, and Get ALL THE ROMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS  Bea loved historical fiction (and historical fashion) and introduced Leah to The Bridgertons series by Julia Quinn (which is great for people who want to test the waters of regency romance)  First in the series is\xa0The Duke and I  Leah ultimately came to love contemporary romances and became a hardcore romance fan with the help of Nora Roberts—The Bride Quartet series is one of her favorites  First in the series is Vision in White  Also mentioned:\xa0Julie James, whose newest book is The Thing About Love (mentioned earlier and out April 18) and\xa0Susan Elizabeth Phillips whose newest book is First Star I See Tonight Where to Start with Contemporary: First, what level of heat are you looking for?

The store is separated into 5 Zones, which are decorated to reflect their genre: Historical, Contemporary, Paranormal, Erotica, and Everything Else  -Sidelines: bookish things, but also things that will appeal to romance readers like stuff about feminism. Solid rec for Juniper & Ivy’s nerdy wood laser cut pieces.\xa0 “Part of being a romance bookstore is being unapologetically feminist and sex positive”  Chapter III [48:35] In which Bea goes hardcore practical for her Station Eleven pick, people are kinda boring (in a good way), and we talk sexy nonfiction. Bea’s Station Eleven pick is\xa0Robert’s Rules of Order by Henry Robert.

Introduction In Which We Discuss Sad Sociology Books and Amy’s Twitter Life Coach, and Furiously Take Notes On the Books We’re Recommending Each Other (but oh wait look, show notes!) We’re drinking Manhattans—Amy’s go-to, “I’m fancy on a Friday night” drink—and making jokes about robotripping.  We’re Reading: Amy is reading Cloud Atlas\xa0by David Mitchell (and Kim & Emma are SO excited) and Fever Dream by\xa0Samanta Schweblin.  Kim is reading\xa0Necessary Trouble by Sarah Jaffe, The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis, and The Revenge of Analog by David Sax—which is her favorite book of 2016.  Emma is reading\xa0My Favorite Thing Is Monsters by Emil Ferris (out from Fantagraphics Feb 14) and The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson.\xa0  Also mentioned: Shirley Jackson’s memoir(ish) essay collections Life Among the Savages\xa0and Raising Demons\xa0and the new biography on Jackson, Shirley Jackson: a Rather Haunted Life by Ruth Franklin. She recommends all the Shirley Jackson book. Because Shirley Jackson is a #bosswitch  Emma’s favorite book of 2016 is Trainwreck by Sady Doyle. Amy’s is Evicted by Matthew Desmond (paperback out Feb 28). If Kim were allowed to pick two favorites, her other favorite would be\xa0While the City Slept by Eli Sanders (paperback out Feb 7). We’re Excited About: Amy is looking forward to so many books in 2017, but, when pressed, narrowed it down to these six: All Grown Up by Jami Attenberg (out March 7) All the Lives I Want: Essays about My Best Friends Who Happen to Be Famous Strangers by Alana Massey (out Feb 7)  Alana Massey is Amy’s “Twitter life coach,” so you should probably follow her too: @alanamassey  The Road to Jonestown by Jeff Guinn (out April 11) Woman No. 17 by Edan Lepucki (out May 9) And We’re Off by Dana Schwartz (out May 2)\xa0  Dana Schwartz is also the creator of Guy In Your MFA. Amy says,\xa0“She’s so talented it makes me angry.”   Emma is excited about Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (out Feb 14)  Seriously. Read this book. It’s his debut novel and it’s amazing. Or listen to the  record-breaking audiobook.  What We Do Now: Standing Up for Your Values in Trump\'s America edited by Dennis Johnson and Valerie Merians\xa0  shout out to Melville House for putting this out with a quickness.  Always Happy Hour by Mary Miller  the cover is done by the amazing painter Lee Price.   And Kim is looking forward to The Animators by\xa0Kayla Rae Whitaker because she’s pretty sure it’s queer.  Chapter I [19:50] In Which We Discuss How Kids Book Authors Write The Best Erotic Fan Fic, Dick Jokes, and Shipwreck in Seattle Amy works at Booksmith in San Francisco, California. She is their Events Director, does all their social media, and is their de facto HR dept. Because bookstores.\xa0  Booksmith recently celebrated their 40th anniversary\xa0and they’re opening a new store called  The Bindery—a sort of wine bar/living room space/events annex—across the street. Amy is also the co-creator and host of Shipwreck,\xa0“a competitive literary erotic fan fiction live show,” which began in June 2013 and runs once a month at Booksmith (and sometimes travels to Comic Cons). They record ALL the shows so you can enjoy crazy dick jokes from the comfort of your own headphones.  They were inspired by the competitive reading series\xa0Write Club, which also has \xa0a podcast! Shipwreck is such an amazing concept, that Grand Central Publishing wanted to collect the stories in a book:\xa0Fanfiction Parodies of Great (and Terrible) Literature from the Smutty Stage of Shipwreck edited by Amy Stephenson and Casey A. Childers  Hey, Seattleites, does this sound awesome? You too can enjoy live erotic fan fiction at Emerald City Comic Con this year on March 2nd.  The line-up includes:\xa0 Seanan McGuire (whose most recent book is Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day\xa0and who\xa0wrote for the very first  Shipwreck) Peter Mountford (author of The Dismal Science) Scott Westerfeld\xa0(who has a graphic novel called Spill Zone coming out May 2nd)\xa0 Matt Fraction (who writes Sex Criminals, so you know his erotic fanfic will be excellent).\xa0 They’ll be writing fan fiction for Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman comics. And their San Francisco performer, Baruch Porras-Hernandez, will be reading for both shows. Buy tickets here. There will be two shows, one at 7pm and another at 9:30pm. BONUS: we, the Drunk Booksellers, will be there selling books and representing Elliott Bay Book Co. Chapter II [40:00] In Which We Reveal Bookseller Secrets and Are Super Supportive of Each Other The book description guaranteed to get Amy reading is: “strong female character written by a women involved in a murder somehow and you won’t believe the twist… bathtub gin reading.” If you need a gateway mystery, Amy recommends Tana French, specifically The Likeness.  Her desert island pick is The Comedians by Graham Greene because she already reads it every year. Her Station Eleven pick (aka the world is falling apart, which it kind of is) is Erich Fromm: The Sane Society\xa0(NOTE: this is still in print, despite what we say in the episode)\xa0and On Disobedience by Eric Fromm  Her Wild pick: something Didion\xa0“because Didion teaches you how to see the world.”\xa0 Bonus bookseller confession: neither Kim or Emma have read Didion. So where do you start with Didion?  If you want to read something that’s going to make you cry: The Year of Magical Thinking If you want astute cultural commentary: Slouching Towards Bethlehem  Amy’s bookseller confession: she can’t get into Ferrante  Go to handsells:  Tana French Margaret Atwood’s contemporary fiction: Cat’s Eye\xa0and\xa0The Robber Bride Fred Vargas, who writes police procedurals that are weirdly witty, funny, and entertaining; her newest book, A Climate of Fear is out March 7th go to non-fiction: A Thousand Lives by Julia Scheeres (who also wrote a memoir called Jesus Land  The book Amy wants to champion to other booksellers: Spare and Found Parts by Sarah Griffin, which she describes as “a modern, feminist telling of Frankenstein, sort of”  Chapter III [50:40] In Which Our List of Bookstores to Visit and Sites to Check Out Grows Almost As Long As Our List of Books to Read Bookstore Crushes  WORD\xa0Bookstores\xa0 (in Brooklyn, NY and Jersey City, NJ)\xa0 Skylight\xa0Books\xa0(in Los Angeles, CA) Title Wave Books (in Anchorage, AK)  Favorite Literary Media: website:\xa0  Book Riot—“I think they’re doing the lord’s work out there.”  podcasts:  Let’s Not Panic: podcast by bookseller\xa0Maggie Tokuda-Hall who is spending the year traveling around South America in a Jeep with her husband Adam Wolf.

Introduction In Which Ann Doesn’t Let Us Set Anything on Fire, Emma Makes Coworkers Awkward, Michael Activates Host Mode, and Kim Finds a Book Too Relevant We’re drinking Cider House Drools (local hard cider, shot of rum, dash of bitters).\xa0The alternate drink is the Out-cider (sub bourbon for rum). Or, if you’re Michael and rockin’ the cold medicine, tea. Ann had originally planned to have us drink Charles Dickens’s punch, which involves a shit ton of alcohol and, uh, fire. If you’re braver than we are, here’s the recipe:  https://food52.com/blog/18626-the-punch-you-add-a-spoonful-of-fire-to-literally  What We’re Reading:  \xa0 Emma is reading: Where Am I Now?: True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame by Mara Wilson and\xa0Life Among the Savages by Shirley Jackson (Bonus reading! Check out The New Yorker article about the new Shirley Jackson bio:  The Haunted Mind of Shirley Jackson)  Michael is reading: Shadow Man by Alan Drew (pubs 23 May 2017... also mentioned:\xa0Gardens of Water)  Ann is reading: The Stars Are Fire by Anita Shreve (pubs 2 May 2017)  Kim is reading: Trainwreck: The Women We Love to Hate, Mock, and Fear... and Why by Sady Doyle  Emma and Kim just read\xa0Vicious by V E Schwab (shout out to book club!) Chapter I [11:00] In Which We Discuss the Noble Role of the Bookseller to Booksellers and How To Be an Introvert in a Socially-Focused Industry Ann and Michael work for this little publishing house you’ve probably never heard of named\xa0Penguin Random House. Yeah, we think they should have called themselves the Random Penguin House, too.  Be among your people at BookRiot Live. They have designated reading rooms, for all y’all introverted book nerds. We see you.  Chapter II [19:20] In Which We Unveil the Creation Story of Books on the Nightstand, Michael Issues a Mea Culpa for not Reading Ann’s Recs Sooner, and Kim Wonders About Knitting Podcasts Books on the Nightstand readers voted on what Michael should read over the summer. The results:  So, due to popular demand, Michael finally read Ann’s recommendations from yeeeeeeears ago: Stoner by John Williams and The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood. He also recently discovered how great Stephen King is and treated himself to Salem’s Lot for Halloween.  Ann recently reread The Secret History by Donna Tartt. She also loved The Nix by Nathan Hill and Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a Daring Escape, and the Making of Winston Churchill by Candice Millard Check out the last eight years of\xa0Books on the Nightstand\xa0episodes at their website:\xa0http://booksonthenightstand.com/podcasts. BTW, Booktopia is still alive via Northshire Bookstore in Manchester, VT. Field trip? Michael’s Recent Favorite Comics/Graphic Novels/Graphica:  The Vision by Tom King DC: The New Frontier by Darwyn Cooke Paper Girls by\xa0Brian K. Vaughan  Emma follows up with a rec for Joyride by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly, then we all nerd out about Lumberjanes. (Seriously, y’all. it’s awesome.)  Chapter III [35:10] In Which Ann Wants to Read The Road\xa0Set at a Boarding School, Kim is Uncomfortable with Magical Realism, and We Crush on Bookstores Ann’s book description guaranteed to get her reading: A dark and disturbing apocalyptic story collection of thrillers set in boarding schools.  The Unfinished World: And Other Stories by Amber Sparks The Secret History by Donna Tartt The Secret Place by Tana French Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel The Road by\xa0Cormac McCarthy  Favorite Short Story Collections  Strange Pilgrims: Twelve Stories by Gabriel Garcia Marquez Emma has to name drop Kelly Link (obvi) and everybody flips out.\xa0 Ann: Tenth of December by George Saunders. She also loves the individual stories “Anything Helps” by Jess Walter (from We Live in Water) and “Governor’s Ball” by Ron Carlson (expanded upon in Ron Carlson Writes a Story)  Desert Island/Station Eleven/Wild Books  Michael used to say The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, but he doesn’t actually... like reading Shakespeare, so maybe not. So then he thought he’d pick 100 Skills You\'ll Need for the End of the World (as We Know It) by Ana Maria Spagna, illustrated by Brian Cronin. But, naw, nevermind. He’d bring DC: The New Frontier by Darwyn Cooke. Ann would take The Complete Essays by Michel De Montaigne, because she got a crush on him due to How to Live: Or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer by Sarah Bakewell.   Go-To Handsell  Michael: Any Human Heart by William Boyd and Stoner by John Williams Ann - The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell (IT’S ABOUT JESUITS IN SPACE, GUYS)   Bookseller Confessions  Michael still hasn’t read Great Expectations. But, I mean, he read A Christmas Carol, so he’s read Dicken’s okay? Also, he hasn’t read Sandman by Neil Gaiman. Neither has Emma. Or Kim. But we’ve read Alan Moore’s Watchmen, so that balances out, right? Right?? Ann convinced  hundreds of people to read War and Peace with her, but only got to page 75. At least she’s inspiring.

Grace and Thomas are surrounded, alone with the Angel, confronted by the Demon Girl. The three forces of the British, Americans and Exiles prepare their defences, as outlying troops at Palmer's Point meet the first onslaught. But they are quickly overrun, and fall back to high ground. Meanwhile, the army of monsters march on inexorably towards the Maunsworth Entry-Point, a seemingly unstoppable storm... | Previously... Events in the Maunsworth Array have led to a resonance in the Standing-Point Field that has hurled Grace and Thomas back into the Heavenfield, but worse, has allowed a terrible creature out into the Array Hall. Stuart Nicks, together with three soldiers, finds himself chasing after the creature in a desperate attempt to prevent it escaping into the Array tunnels, and from there out into the world. Meanwhile, Thomas and Grace have found themselves on the edge of another Heavenfield reality, alone with the Angel, and the approaching armies. The three forces, British, American and Exile, unable to retreat, must defend the open Entry-Point. They cannot allow any more creatures through, and can only dig in and await the inevitable onslaught... | Previously... The three forces of Americans, British and Exiles, under the guidance of the Angel, are forced into an uneasy alliance against the threat of the approaching Demon army. The creatures, led by the female entity, are intent upon breaking through the Maunsworth Entry-Point and out into the everyday world. Thomas and Grace travel back from the Heavenfield to the Array Chamber, but during the transition Thomas is surrounded by a host of Angelic creatures, who decide to lend their support against the Demons. Meanwhile, Alex has a visitation from the Demon Girl, who forces him into a confrontation which leads to a terrible chain of events, which sees Thomas and Grace hurled once more back into the Heavenfield... | Previously... Alex has taken Grace and Thomas hostage, forcing them to travel back into the Heavenfield, just as both the American and Exile forces are drawn up to do battle. He leads them to the ruins beyond the valley in a desperate search for the Angel, but Thomas escapes with Sanders, and Alex is recaptured. As they flee, Gutteridge apprehends them, chasing Thomas down into the Angel's tunnels. Thomas finds the Angel, who intervenes just as the Americans and Exiles launch their attacks. It seems as if disaster has been averted, but Alex has chilling news. The horde of Creatures, led by the Demon Girl, may have followed them to Maunsworth, intent on destroying them all... | Previously... Speers and his forces have broken the cordon around the American Entry-Point, and have made their way to the British E.P. just in time to confront the Exile forces, newly-arrived from the destruction of their Fortress by the Demon army. The Demon Girl, manipulating all sides, tells Speers to send Gutteridge to the ruins around Maunsworth, for a chance to kill Thomas Sullivan, who she perceives as a threat to her plans. Meanwhile, Alex has taken Grace and Thomas hostage in a desperate attempt to re-enter the Heavenfield and end the prophecy of the 'Final War'... | Previously... The British forces at Maunsworth are concentrating upon building their fighting strength, in response, not only to the Exile cordon around their Entry-Point in the Field, but also towards the increasing political tensions with the Americans (whose policies are fuelled by Speers' paranoias). Grace and Commander James face painful times as they interrogate their prisoner Alex, who reveals some disturbing facts about his past, and also warns of a terrible danger approaching Maunsworth. Meanwhile, since returning from the Field, and his encounters with the Angel, Thomas Sullivan is finding himself increasingly assailed by visions and dreams which, while lending him a unique insight into the true nature of the Heavenfield, threaten to overwhelm him...... | Previously... Now that the Americans have their own Array up and running, they have entered into a desperate arms-race to break the siege around their Entry-Point into the Heavenfield. Speers, in charge of the American forces, is still unaware of the attackers' identity, and is mistakenly convinced that it is the British that hold the Field. Meanwhile, Alex, having escaped the Exile fortress, has reached the Maunsworth Entry-Point, and finds himself a prisoner once again, this time to the British. Henschel, having helped Alex escape the fortress has opened it up to the attacking Demon army, sealing its destruction. The British expedition team fight their way back to the Entry-Point and escape to safety, but the Exile forces hold the Heavenfield-side of the Doorway now. The spy within Maunsworth, who has been passing information to Gutteridge and the Americans has been uncovered, and her attempts to destroy the Array averted. For the time-being it seems that all forces face an uneasy stalemate...... | Previously... At the American Entry-Point, Gutteridge and his covert team infiltrate behind the lines of the Exile blockade and capture an enemy Fieldship. Now they must attempt to fly it back to their Entry-Point. Back in the Exile Fortress, Alex is confronted by a deranged Dr. Henschel, who helps him escape from his cell. Henschel reveals that it has been he, not Alex, under the influence of the Demon Girl, and in a moment of lucidity has destroyed the Exile Array and opened up the Fortress to the attacking Demon army. Alex makes for Hangar 13, where Henschel has a Fieldship waiting to aid his escape. Meanwhile, at the Maunsworth Entry-Point, the expedition is still under attack from the Exile soldiers. Grace and Thomas, separated from the group attempt to hide in the ruins, but Thomas is shot by an Exile soldier and his suit is breached. As he is overcome by the atmosphere of the Field he spies a mountainous figure who comes to their rescue. Thomas awakens to find himself in the company of an angel, who heals his wounds and repairs his suit. Thomas returns to the Field, and finds Grace.

But Grace and Thomas find themselves split from the group, and run further into the ruins in a desperate attempt to evade their pursuers. Meanwhile Speers' American Accelerator Array is complete. His newly-formed army enters the Heavenfield, only to discover their Entry-Point encircled by a force of Exile soldiers.

The occasion is Melody’s sixteenth birthday, but it proves bittersweet as the assembled family recalls Melody’s mother—who never reached age sixteen. Charting the course of two families from different classes, Woodson’s affecting narrative tackles identity, ambition, desire, and parenthood as well as exploring how the decisions young people make change the generations to come.

When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her—freedom, prison, or death. With The Testaments, the wait is over. Atwood's sequel picks up the story fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.Atwood is in conversation with Rebeccca Traister, author of three books and writer-at-large for New York magazine and The Cut, and a contributing editor at Elle magazine.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9780385543781Learn more about your ad choices.

In both his music—which includes cover versions of iconic\xa0 protest songs and socialist anthems—and his politically-inflected lyrics, he’s dedicated himself to effecting social change and to moving others to get involved in grassroots activist causes. His new book is a direct and bracing call to action in which he shows that freedom is composed of three elements: liberty, equality, and accountability, and demonstrates that accountability is our most powerful tool against the rising tide of authoritarianism.

One of the largest privately held multinationals in the country, and one of the most secretive, Koch owns companies in businesses ranging from energy to chemicals to banking; its CEO, Charles Koch, and his brother, David, are together wealthier than Bill Gates. As Leonard shows, the brothers have consolidated power by practicing a single-minded attention to the bottom line—which has also meant quashing unions, widening income inequality, thwarting action on climate change, and making capitalism a deeply alienating force for many Americans.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9781476775388Learn more about your ad choices.

Now in this stunning memoir he tells his own story—perhaps his most fantastic feat yet. Straczynski grew up in the care of adults variously damaged by addiction, mental illness, and poverty. His only refuge from the misery was comic books, and he gradually realized that he, too, could invent alternate worlds. But even as he managed to take power over his future, a terrible secret in his family’s past continued to haunt him.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9780062857842In a series of deft, powerful memoirs beginning with the award-winning Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, Fuller has kept readers riveted with stories of her unconventional family’s life in southern Africa.

Gathered from some fifteen years of work for The New Yorker, New York, and other publications—along with several new pieces—the essays in this collection wholeheartedly celebrate television and guide us to new ways of looking at it. Arguing that TV demands more than just watching, Nussbaum outlines her struggle with “prestige television”—an awakening she traces to Buffy the Vampire Slayer—and questions the breakdown of shows into high- and low-brow. She also examines programming in the light of #MeToo, explores how fans distort their favorite shows, profiles influential figures such as Kenya Barris, Jenji Kohan, and Ryan Murphy, assesses the legacies of Norman Lear and Joan Rivers, and more.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9780525508960Learn more about your ad choices.

Her uncle was always kind to her but his wife, Sarah Reed was anything but. Sarah’s son John and Sarah’s two daughters also contributed to Jane’s torment.  Jane was excluded from all family activities and found solace only in her books and dolls.One day John knocked her down and she tried to defend herself. This earned her a traumatic lock up in the room where her uncle died. At one point, she thought that she could see his ghost and this so terrified the poor child that an apothecary had to be called in. The kind man advised Sarah Reed to send Jane off to boarding school and she was subsequently sent to Lowood.Seen through Jane’s eyes, Lowood was only marginally better than Gateshead but at least she had friends there. The book will take you way back to the days of bumpy carriage rides and class discrimination. It is also a glimpse into some historical aspects of England centuries ago and the antiquated notions that were held at the time.Charlotte Bronte tells an amazing story about a woman who faces issues of respect in an era when women were not permitted to stand up to society.  Eventually Jane finds an employer that supports her but the shadowy and ominous Mr. Rochester, hides a dreadful secret that threatens Jane’s happiness.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/c5/90/dc/c590dccf-02f2-18d3-3e16-388be90d1a32/mza_9068090517591690291.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-29'}}

She\'s dropping some hot knowledge on us about what it is like to navigate the pre-debut time, how to find and utilize mentor texts, winning social media strategies, how to work well with illustrators, and so much more. Plus you\'ll hear me moan about... cars? Listen, I can\'t talk about TV Shows on a Book Podcast EVERY time. ;-) Shownotes: JenniferLaughran.com/Literaticast | My guest is Executive Editor of the Abrams Appleseed imprint, Meredith Mundy. We chat about all things "little-kid" book related -- including the different types of board and novelty books, and the joys and challenges of writing and publishing them. | It\'s a Summertime Bonus Episode! ABLA Senior Agent Jen Rofé joins me to answer burning listener questions about queries, submission strategies, working with your agent, and so much more. Plus we talk about glass-blowing and Russian spies. (Obviously!) | First I talk a bit about the etiquette of leaving your agent and getting a new one -- it\'s not as scary or weird as you might worry it will be! Then, the fabulous Dahlia Adler joins me to talk about her books, blogging, promoting authors, self-promoting, cutting through the internet noise, avoiding burnout, and being a professional Big Mouth. We also talk about her site LGBTQ Reads, and Dahlia gives us a taste of her favorite queer reads. Get your pen and paper ready so you can jot down these terrific titles! | I sit down with powerhouse editor Namrata Tripathi, the founder and publisher of Kokila Books, a new imprint of Penguin Random House. The first books from Kokila are coming this week, so we have a great discussion about what it is like to start an imprint from scratch, from deciding on the name and logo to choosing the first books to publish; also the importance of diversity in creators, topics, gatekeepers; and what conversation would be complete without mentioning nerdy vampires?\xa0 | My guest is Laurent Linn, an Art Director from Simon and Schuster. He\'ll give us the inside scoop on such hot topics as: What the heck does an Art Director do?! How are book jackets made? What should an illustrator have in their portfolio? What is the "life cycle" of a picture book and why do they take soooo long to come out? And WHO PICKS THE FONTS?! Also we\'ll talk about vampires and theme parks, obviously. | This episode, I\'m pleased to welcome newly minted Newbery Medalist Meg Medina. We chat about world building in realistic fiction, writing large casts of characters, balancing business vs art, tips for debut authors as well as those suffering from "sophomore slump." Oh... and though I promised her I would NOT ask her about "the call" from the Newbery committee.... at the end, she tells a bit of the story anyway! Yesss! Plus we gab about TV shows and Tamales. | I sit down with Lisa Cron, the author of STORY GENIUS and WIRED FOR STORY - she is chock full of advice to make your next novel truly unputdownable. Also, I get a couple of words in edgewise, and talk about my obsession: RUSSIAN DOLL! | I\'m getting ready to head to Seattle for ALA Midwinter. So what even IS that? In this episode, I speak to Jenny Choy, the Associate Director for School-Library Marketing for Abrams Books for Young Readers. Jenny tells us the difference between publicity, marketing, and school-library marketing, and gives us the lowdown about what happens behind the booth curtains at a big librarian conference like ALA. What books are on display, and why? Which authors get invited, and why? What does she wish that authors knew about her job? So much great info! Yay! | I chat with four awesome booksellers about their top children\'s and YA book picks for holiday gift giving (and my own picks, too!) -- some you\'ve probably heard of, but others likely be new to you, and all are well worth checking out. Of course, there\'s no way that we could get ALL our faves in one little podcast.... but hey, it\'s a start. :-)\xa0', 'chan_desc': 'A literary agent and her friends dish about writing and publishing books for children and young adults.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/fd/88/e8/fd88e827-a03f-e7c1-0c0d-fb3db94e1597/mza_5902232026802258188.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2017-07-17'}}

I'm a huge fan of Bayana and Robyn, and if you're interested in finding out more about them and listening to their show, head on over to http://blackgirlscreate.org/wizardteamThis panel was about all of the cool opportunities that J.K. Rowling missed when she was creating the concept of Ilvermorny, the wizarding school in the United States. Rather than just copy-pasting Hogwarts into the Americas, she could have taken our actual history into account, and also addressed that ONE school for millions of students wasn't really practical. So what would that look like? What kind of education and transportation network would have to be in place to accommodate that many kids, and what about the periods before integration? How would that have worked?Thanks so much for listening, and I will see you again soon with the other panel we did with Mark Oshiro! | Hey there, you beauties! I'm here with a very special episode, which RoShawn and I did as part of an all-day John Wick Marathon fundraiser! We're raising money for Project Corazon, a targeted effort by Lawyers For Good Government, which provides funding to lawyers who want to represent detained immigrants but who can't afford the expense of travel and hotels.

It has been a while, and RoShawn and I are here to just chat a bit about the super fun new game that came out from Niantic, and we're also going to tell you about some upcoming changes to the UNspoiled! Patreon page, some meetups, and what's going on at LeakyCon! For those of you who are Patrons, don't worry, this episode isn't replacing the Half-Blood Prince reread episode for this week, so keep an eye out for that too! |  | I am so sorry it has taken me this long to get this episode up, but I really hope you enjoy it. Spoilers: RoShawn and I hated this book deeply and plan to pretend we never read it at all. However, something good did come of it; LeakyCon was amazing and we will be back next year, so hopefully we will see some of you there!

Today is the first time I will be releasing a podcast that doesn't have anything to do with any sort of media whatsoever, and is instead just a conversation between RoShawn and me. I'm only putting the first episode as wide-release so that everyone can get a sense of it, but from Episode 2 onward they will be an exclusive perk to $20+ Patrons. Here's why I chose that high a tier: RoShawn and I will be splitting all the $20 tier profits 50/50, and adding a whole new show to our recording schedule is no joke so it really needed to be worth our while. This episode is about Being Sick, and it's kind of funny because I start off the episode talking about how I'm not really sick and it's just allergies, but...it turns out I was actually sick and just in denial. RoShawn shares her thoughts on the Neti-Pot, and I read an advice column question that has us both ready to call the cops. Thanks so much for listening! This show will be bi-weekly, so another one will be out on Patreon in a couple weeks and we're open to topic suggestions as well as emails asking for advice! Hope you enjoy the show. :D | I have some news and events to share, and then RoShawn and I open our February Accio! boxes!

The collection includes essays, poetry, and fiction around harassment, abuse and the underlying power dynamics in our everyday lives. Oria explains how the collection came together and the need for diverse voices and styles in our fraught political moment.Also, Tea Obreht, author of Inland, returns again to recommend Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah\'s short story collection Friday Black. | Co-hosts Kate Wolf and Medaya Ocher speak with Sarah M Broom about her latest work The Yellow House; a moving and beautiful book rooted in one place, which combines memoir, archival history of her family, and a story of her growing up in New Orleans East.  Sarah explains how the culture of this forgotten part of the city - isolated by the industrial canal, accessible only by the High Rise bridge - came alive in and around her family\'s home.  Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans East and destroyed The Yellow House; but through days of interviews and years of research Sarah conjures them back to life, reviving her large extended family, re-animating a lost world rife with character, tragedy, wisdom, and love.Also, Tea Obreht, author of The Tiger\'s Wife and Inland, returns to recommend Salvatore Scibona\'s stunning second novel, The Volunteer. | Jenny Odell, author of How To Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy, joins co-hosts Medaya Ocher and Kate Wolf to asses the state of the human soul in the age of social media reproduction. The verdict is clear: we need strategies of resistance. Constantly tracked and hunted by the digital panopticon, we have no time for reverie, reflection, letting go, or just being. We desperately need Nothing, which is everything. Jenny shares details of her own liberation.Also, Susan Straight, author of In The Country of Women, returns to honor Toni Morrison by sharing how she has read her favorite book every single year since she was twelve, Morrison\'s luminous second novel, Sula. | What if that most celebrated of American genres, the Western, was stripped of its traditional tropes? Gone are the heroic lonesome gunslingers, the helpless women on the homesteads, the rampant outlaws, and cliched representations of inidigenous people. Is it possible that a such novel, rooted in greater historical accuracy, could prove equally (if not more) engaging? Tea Obreht\'s Inland accepts this challenge; and she joins co-hosts Medaya Ocher and Eric Newman to explain how she came to tell the story of two women, 40 years apart, on the western frontier. There\'s heartbreak, bravery, ghosts and camels because, when it comes to the western, reality is stranger than mythology.Also, writer and translator Magdalena Edwards, whose article for LARB "Benjamin Moser and the Smallest Woman in the World" became a viral sensation, returns to direct folks to an astonishing filmed interview of Clarice Lispector, the only one available online:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zwGLBpULs | The redemptive power of oral history is at the heart of Susan Straight\'s new memoir, In The Country Of Women; and also in this installment of the LARB Radio Hour, the first in a special series featuring Los Angeles authors. As Susan relates the amazing stories of the women in her family from across many generations to host Kate Wolf, the spirit and character of these women is conjured back to life. Our troubled times are presaged in the tragedies and violence encountered by Susan\'s ancestors; but the promise, not yet extinguished, of this blood-stained land shines through from these women of the past to their sisters in the present.Also, filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, whose latest film is American Factory, return to recommend four books: Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston; The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead; The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson; and The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander.This episode of the LARB Radio Hour is supported in part by the California Arts Council, a state agency. Learn more at www.arts.ca.gov. Any findings, opinions, or conclusions contained herein are not necessarily those of the California Arts Council. | We have two great interviews this week. First up, Magdalena Edwards joins co-hosts Kate Wolf and Medaya Ocher to discuss her article for LARB "Benjamin Moser and the Smallest Woman in the World," which has gone viral. This dialogue is no less gripping, as Magdalena outlines her experience working with a publishing industry icon as the hired translator for Clarice Lispector\'s The Chandelier; and what that harrowing experience led her to reveal about the sordid underbelly of intellectual accreditation. Suffice to say, the powerful readily exploit the vulnerable; but, in this case, the pen and the podcast are gaining the upper hand. Then, Kate and Medaya are joined by Jess Row to discuss his new groundbreaking work White Flights: Race, Fiction, and the American imagination. Row brilliantly critiques a broad range of white American authors as he advocates for reparative writing, in which writers use fiction "to approach each other again" in full awareness of America\'s long racist history. It\'s nothing short of a clarion call for authors to ply their trade in the fight against Trump and the on-going racist/enthno-nationalist revival that he leads.(p.s. The amount of great literature referenced and discussed in both halves of this podcast would satisfy anyone\'s late summer reading list.) | LARB\'s Medaya Ocher talks with Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert about their new film which documents the recent history of an American factory in Dayton, OH that was closed last decade and re-opened this decade under Chinese ownership and management. The tale is rife with paradoxes: the communists are the capitalists; and the workers from the land of Reagan and Trump channel socialist solidarity as they move to form a union against the wishes of the folks from the People\'s Republic.  The conversation fills in the backstory; and, along the way, reveals what makes this highly political documentary so compelling - the filmmakers\' drive to capture the humanity of all the players in the drama.Also, author Anthony McCann returns to recommend No One Knows My History, Fawn Brodie\'s beautifully written biography of Joseph Smith, the founding prophet of the Mormon religion. | One of the most pressing issues facing American society is the rise of a radical anti-government right wing movement over the past few decades; and now, in particular, its relationship to President Trump. Author Anthony McCann goes right to heart of this movement in his new book Shadowlands: Fear and Freedom at the Oregon Standoff, the product of his first hand experience covering the Ammon Bundy-led occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in early 2016.  In this illuminating conversation with co-hosts Kate Wolf, Eric Newman, and Medaya Ocher, McCann\'s observations about the array of characters at the heart of this dramatic stand off in isolated rural America both confirm and dramatically deny expectations. What is clear is that this movement, for worse not for better, now has deep roots in our country. Yet McCann\'s unflinching reporting points a way forward: nothing is to be gained by further isolation and vilification versus direct engagement with people, including with this troubled-but-fascinating lot.Also, Lyra Kilston returns to recommend Laila Lalami\'s heralded 2014 novel, The Moor\'s Account. | "There\'s so much there, and it\'s so fascinating" observes co-host Kate Wolf after Lyra Kilston opens this week\'s podcast with a summary of her new book Sun Seekers: The Cure of California. Kate might as well be talking about the entire history, brief yet spectacular, of Southern California. This week\'s show unveils another of the spectacular paradoxes that define the rise of the Golden State Paradise/Dystopia - the relationship between California Modernism to European Sanatorium culture. If you\'ve ever marveled at the modern architectural jewels that dot the LA landscape; and fantasized about a refined European ex-pat community that built them - prepare to have your dreams recast (in the best SoCal tradition!). Lyra spins fascinating tales that will challenge your understanding of LA history, in dialogue with Kate and Eric Newman, Also, Hanif Abdurraqib returns to recommend Harmony Holiday\'s new book of poetry, A Jazz Funeral for Uncle Tom. | What could possibly be more of an LA literary event: James Ellroy reading from his new novel, This storm, then talking with Tom Lutz, founder and Editor-in-Chief of the Los Angles Review of Books - and even taking questions from the audience (you simply need to hear his answer to a question about Trump). It\'s the greatest contemporary practitioner of the great LA genre, live in LA!', 'chan_desc': 'The LOS ANGELES REVIEW OF BOOKS, as its name suggests, looks out at the world of books from its perch on the Pacific Rim. Since the 19th century writers have bridled at New York’s seeming monopoly over publication. Bret Harte in The Overland Monthly, John Crowe Ransom and Robert Penn Warren in I’ll Take My Stand, and the other regionalists, along with other outsiders, people who felt excluded from the literary conversation, and writers and readers in a thousand places — including even New York — have called for a more representative literary world. The internet has started to bring this to fruition, and Los Angeles, the famously centerless city and the largest book market in the country, is what Hamlin Garland, if he were still alive, might assume was the new center.  In Crumbling Idols (1893), Garland argued that the center had left Boston for New York in the 1870s or 1880s, and was cruising quickly past Buffalo on its way to Chicago and pointed West.  Perhaps there is no center anymore, but Los Angeles, a global city with a global reach, speaking over 100 languages and sending its music, literature and film to every corner of the globe, isn’t a bad candidate for it, and those of us who live here and love books — whether we’re from Iowa City, Tehran, Brooklyn, Singapore, Guatemala, Addis Ababa, or even Los Angeles — are happy to think that after some time in San Francisco, Garland’s center might be passing through Los Angeles around now, perhaps on its way to Mexico City.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts/v4/95/64/51/9564515f-4137-e374-8319-5226abef9a21/mza_1399084307399307386.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2012-01-08'}}

Three recommendations: don\'t read it at night, or just after you\'ve eaten a full meal, or if you\'re weak of heart. You\'ve been warned!"--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain and Black Order"Sigler is masterful at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go. Just when I thought I knew what abyss he was leading me across, he knocked the bridge out from under... I think I screamed the whole way down... Infected is a marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror."--Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm and Death Match"Sigler is the Richard Matheson of the 21st Century...smart and creepy, Infected is a flawless thinking-person\'s thriller. Bravo to a bold new talent!"--Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bad Moon Rising and Ghost Road Blues"Horror mavens rejoice! Infected is a revelation -- a novel that lives up to its hype. From page one, the story of a mysterious smart-virus that turns its hosts into deadly drooling drones creeps up on a reader like the ratchet of a roller coaster climbing toward its inevitable crest. Sigler brings the folksy character detail of Stephen King, the conceptual panache of Clive Barker, and the oozing, shuddery pathologies of a David Cronenberg movie. Zombies, spies, conspiracies, and gallons of goo make this the fastest read in the west! Highest recommendation!"-- Jay Bonansinga, national bestselling author of Shattered, Twisted, Frozen, and The Sinking of the Eastland"Sigler has a unique talent for keeping readers on the edge of their seats; I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. Infected is full of mayhem, action, and gore--and you won\'t be able to put it down."-- Dave Wellington, author of 13 Bullets and the Monster Island trilogy"Scott Sigler\'s Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you\'ve got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way.

We discuss which tribes might fall into the categories of Iron Age \'A\', \'B\' and \'C\' Celts that are referred to in the reading. Although there are some discrepancies with the dating, the history does make sense when compared with the movements of the Atrebates, Catevellauni and Cantiaci tribes at the time of the Roman Conquest of Britain (A.d. 43). Our sources are:  http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainAtrebates.htm http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainCatuvellauni.htm http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainCantii.htm http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainRegninses.htm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrebates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantiaci https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnenses  \xa0 Faerie Tale by Spiral Dance  Multi-award winning group Spiral Dance, based in Adelaide, has been playing rousing, high-energy music to enthusiastic audiences throughout Australia and beyond for over a decade.

Kipling\'s works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), Puck of Pook\'s Hill (1906) and many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888). His poems include "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man\'s Burden" (1899), and "If—" (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children\'s books are classics of children\'s literature, and one critic described his work as exhibiting "a versatile and luminous narrative gift". Rewards and Fairies is a historical fantasy book by Rudyard Kipling published in 1910. The book consists of a series of short stories set in historical times with a linking contemporary narrative. Dan and Una are two children, living in the Weald of Sussex in the area of Kipling\'s own home Bateman\'s.  Bateman\'s, Sussex They have encountered Puck and he magically conjures up real and fictional individuals from Sussex\'s past to tell the children some aspect of its history and prehistory, though the episodes are not always historically accurate. Another recurring character is Old Hobden who represents the continuity of the inhabitants of the land. His ancestors sometimes appear in the stories and seem very much like him. The full text of Rewards & Fairies can be found on Project Gutenberg. For more details about Rudyard Kipling visit the Wiki Page or Kipling Societ\'s website. \xa0 Shakespeare\'s Puck & Sussex Pharisees We discuss how Shakespeare may have heard the folklore of Puck on his travels with the Elizabethan court. The local Sussex word for Fairies, Pharisees, comes from the double plural found in the dialect - \'fairies-ies\' or \'pharisees\'.  "Then we have \'Puck\' or \'Pook\', which is derived from the Saxon word \'Puca\', meaning a Goblin (Smith 1956 p.74). Both modern forms are common in placenames as will be seen later in this article, but also occurs as dialect description of fairies, but not just Goblins, which are seen as mischievous or nasty fairies (Simpson & Roud 2000 p.286). \'Dobbs\' or \'Master Dobbs\' is a name used for a house fairy that helps with the housework. If someone has been working harder than expected, it was often said of them that \'Master Dobbs has been helping you\' (Parish & Hall 1957 p.31)." [Sussexarch.org] \xa0  Iron from Stone by Damh the Bard  This song, Iron from Stone, is inspired by the earlier song, Scarborough Faire. Damh tells us:  "Scarborough Faire\xa0is an amazing song. Such a wonderful melody and lyric that tells of all of the impossible tasks a human woman would need to achieve to be with a man from Elfland. But I began to wonder… "These wonderful folk songs have been left us by anonymous writers from years ago and have been sung ever since. But is there another story behind Scarborough Faire? What about that songwriter from years ago? What inspired them\xa0to write such a song? So I thought I would tell that story." Damh the Bard  You can find his music on iTunes, or from his website, Pagan Music.

Northill May Song & Mwynen Mai by Blanche Rowen & Mike Gulston  A pair of May Carols. The custom of \'going Maying\' included leaving hawthorn blossoms at your beloved\'s door on May Day morning (assuming you hadn\'t been out in the woods with her all night). \'Mwynen Mai\' (Gentle May) is a jolly little polka with our freshly translated English lyrics. (from The Dance Goes On liner notes) Buy The Dance Goes On from Bandcamp \xa0 2. The Fairy Glen by Katie Nicholas & Cernunnos Rising  Katie Nicholas, the youngest daughter of George Nicholas from Cernunnos Rising, is the lead vocalist on this beautiful new track, The Fairy Glen. Born and bred in Liverpool, Katie (20) moved to London at the age of eighteen as an integrated ad-designer (JWT London) and pursues her music as a country-pop singer/songwriter, runs Busy Bee - an online community helping independent artists create a “buzz”, plus more alongside her 9-to-5; with the aspiration to do her passion full-time. [source] You can find out all about Katie and her work, including her superb album, Dizzy, on her website. \xa0 3. Song For Ireland by Celia  Celia\'s album, Fire in the Head, is a compilation of some of the finest Irish songs. She adds her unique style to the presentation of classic Irish music, and you can hear her track Song for Ireland in this show. You can get hold of Fire in the Head from Bandcamp or CD Baby. \xa0 4. Sacred Falls: Saint Nectan & the Legacy of the Dragon by Professor Roland Rotherham  St. Nectan\'s history, the legends of his almost endless family and the sacred site of Nectan’s Glen, holding as it does the beautiful ‘Falls’, are explained in this narrative together with a possible link between Saint Nectan’s family and the warlord who may be attributed to the later legends of King Arthur. The book also deals with the history and legends of many of Cornwall’s other sacred wells and springs. You can buy Sacred Falls from the St. Nectan\'s Waterfall Online Shop. \xa0 5. The Laily Worm & the Machrel of the Sea by Kate Fletcher & Corwen Broch  Kate & Corwen met in the 10th century playing at a medieval banquet. Their compatible collection of ancient reed instruments inspired love at first parp.The fact that they also had similar collections of Finnish pop cemented the relationship. Since meeting they have walked pilgrimages to Spain, across Norway, rebuilt Kate\'s narrowboat and played lots of music. They are currently recording their first duo CD, Fishe or Fowle. You can find out more about Kate & Corwen on their website or on their Contributor Page. \xa0 6. Native Son by Julia Ecklar  Native Son is a song about a sheep-dog. Stepping out into a pasture of sheep is like pushing the membrane between two worlds. The dog starts to shiver violently at the first whiff of musty wool. The shadows, the wind, the turn of your head and the force of the dog\'s silent gaze is part of a cacophony of pressures that push or bounce against each other. You can sense where to push against these masses of energies to make the sheep and your dog move ina direction you choose. The ability to feel and see these energies is stitched into your dog\'s DNA. You don\'t teach him how to use this knowledge - he teaches you. It\'s why he was made, and all he wants to do. (From the CD liner notes] Buy Horsetamer from Prometheus \xa0 8. Forgotten, Never Be by Damh the Bard  Forgotten, Never Be is a song about the traditions and customs that we cherish in our cultures. It is a masterful piece from Damh\'s most recent album, Sabbat. This new collection of songs harks back to Spirit of Albion and The Cauldron Born. The anthems have a folk-rock feel, and the ballads have even more depth and meaning. The inclusion of the classic folk song Scarborough Faire and a cover of Lady in Black by Uriah Heep makes this an album that will surely please old and new fans of Damh’s music alike. You can get hold of Sabbat from CD Baby.

The pub has awards for being the most Druid-Friendly pub in Sussex!    The Holly Lord from Woman of the Earth  Woman of the Earth One of Spiral Dance\'s earliest albums, \'Woman of the Earth\' is where Celtic folk rock meets pagan inspired tales of magick, myth and legend. It contains not only Holly Lord, but the Goddess and the Weaver, Into the Green, Hour of the Wytch, the title track - Woman of the Earth - and others. It is now sadly out of print but can be found as a digital download at CD Baby or Soundclick. One of our favourite albums.    Spiral Dance Band Members  The Band The band was formed in 1992 as a project to explore some of the more mystical elements in life and has drawn its energy from the song-writing and vocal skills of Adrienne Piggott. Adrienne’s haunting lyrics are supported by Nick’s driving guitar work and Paul’s innovative accordion lines.    Adrienne Piggott  Adrienne hails from an immigrant family and grew up surrounded by stories and songs from Ireland and the British Isles that were part of every day life, ensuring her love of the music, legends and traditions from these cultures. She began singing in pub sessions in her late teens and early twenties, then went on to sing in a cappella groups and folk bands. Her interest in the occult and magic led to the creation of the band Spiral Dance - her ‘dream child’- a passionate union of her voice and song writing gifts. Adrienne has won awards for her vocal talents and wordsmith skills and has written most of the songs that appear on the Spiral Dance albums. [source]    Nick Carter  Nick had always wanted to play guitar for as long as he can remember and says he would still love to know how to play. He started playing in his early 20s for fun and had a passion for rock and blues, Eric Clapton being the main influence. The blues was followed with lead guitar and a very short stint of heavy metal. He auditioned for Spiral Dance in late-1996, an ordeal that consisted of playing all the songs from the bands first album (Woman of the Earth) and then a live gig two days later! And the best thing about being in the band? "The biggest thrill when playing live is watching the audience singing the words back to us, whether it is a gig in Australia or overseas!" [source]    Paul Gooding  Paul is one of the leading exponents of the button accordion in Australia, his skilled honed in the folk clubs and festivals of his native England. He moved to Australia in 1998 and joined Spiral Dance in 2000, bringing with him his love of English folk ballads and passion for European dance tunes. In 2009, he was very proud to win "Most Outstanding Instrumentalist" at the South Australian Folk Awards. [source]    The Gathering from \'Over the Nine Waves\'  Over the Nine Waves Over the Nine Waves was originally a song cycle featuring narration and songs. The narrative tracks and album artwork are available free at www.spiraldance.com.au. Based securely in Irish Myth, this album contains 10 superb tracks by Spiral Dance as well as some enchanting narration by Vince Brophy. Tales told with song and narration of the legendary characters from the Irish Mythological and Ulster Cycles, which are the oldest surviving prose in western literature, memorised as they happened and handed down from generation to generation by bards before the introduction of literacy. You can still get this album from Soundclick with the narrative tracks as a free download directly from Spiral Dance.    Willyaroo, South Australia  Adrienne mentions the town of Willyaroo which is near Adelaide in South Australia. We had to look this one up to get the right spelling for you! She also mentions the terrible injustices that the White Man inflicted upon the aboriginal tribes,in particular, the Peramangk.    Damh the Bard and Cerri Lee & \'Oscar\' the Dog  Damh and Cerri We are joined for a surprise appearance by Damh the Bard, Cerri Lee and Oscar the Dog!  \'Oscar\'    Fae Dance & Through a Sylvan Doorway from \'Through a Sylvan Doorway\'  Through a Sylvan Doorway Two tracks from the seminal work in the Spiral Dance discography. A fine collection of songs & tunes, pagan rhythms and folk ditties, all set in the latest and brightest, unique Spiral Dance double album.    Wickerman & the English Ale Festival  Wickerman The Wicker Man burning at the English-Ale festival in Mylor, South Australia this year, 2015. The English Ale (\'Ale\' meaning singing, dancing and making merry) is a seasonal gathering to celebrate the historic customs of England. Free events include masked torchlit giants procession, bonfire, Morris dancing, Punch and Judy, traditional music, Beating The Bounds and more  The Burning Wickerman at Mylor As the English Ale Festival website says: The first of our winter rains has come; in the Adelaide Hills the creeks and streams trickle and begin to run, the European trees have lost their leaves and the beautiful eucalypts shimmer in the early winter sunshine.

Listener Feedback Chris  St. Piran\'s Cross We had a great question from Chris in South Australia about Celtic tattoos, specifically about any that are Cornish in nature. As we say in the show, there aren\'t many original and ancient designs from Cornwall. There are a few books that may help with more general Celtic knotwork or art. We recommend having a look at:-  Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction by George Bain Art of the Celts: From 700 B.C. to the Celtic Revival World of Art by Lloyd Laing Gaelic Tattoos: Top 50 Irish Gaelic Tattoo Ideas Book The Celtic Design Book - Aidan Meehan  We suggested either using a variant of St. Piran\'s Cross or a form of the Piskie - the little pixie unique to Cornwall. We have images of both (and the Tintagel Labyrinth) below.  Field Piskie by Josee Saurus  The Tintagel Labyrinth from the Cornish Store \xa0    Promo - Live Wire! Podcast Radio - Savvy  Live Wire!

Music - Sabbat Damh the Bard  Sabbat Sabbat, the opening track on the album, is a rousing song about the eight seasonal festivals of the year (known as sabbats to Wiccans).

Where the Goddess rides her horse, guiding you to magic, and the Horned God of old calls us from the shadows of the Greenwood.

Cerri is equally in her element when she is up to her elbows in clay or painting one of her fabulous pictures. She is partner to Druid musican and long-time supporter of our show, Damh the Bard and can be found supporting him at many of his performances. \xa0 Emma Doubleday  Emma Doubleday Our dear friend, Emma, is an Essex girl, born and bred.

The 14 Track album is a sincere blend of Medieval Celtic Rock, unique to the Dolmen spirit. The band purposely composed \'Banquet\' as a forerunner to "Nuada" a second album release due for this year (2014) in May. It was decided after they had finished their 2013 Euro Tour, that there were to many songs for Nuada, and more in production, so decided that Nuada should be split and Banquet should introduce an exciting yet bizarre theme of which the band are presently enchanted, hence laying a musical foundation for 2014 the "Nuada, God of the Sun Tour" and the adventure of musical discovery. You can buy Banquet on The Dolmen website.

The World Drum in front of Philip\'s Altar, pic by Philip \xa0 The Prayer for Mother Earth We are all human beings, all people, you, me, our neighbours. No matter where you live in this world, if it is in Africa or South-America, if it is in Asia, Europe or U.S.A, we are all sisters and brothers in humanity. All people of the world. Whether rich or poor, whatever colour, religion or political thinking, we are all residents of this one planet, Mother Earth. The time has come to answer the questions. Do we really want to destroy our home? Do we really want war, hunger or disasters? Do we really want to give our next generations a planet in such a condition that there will not be any hope for survival? Mother Earth is crying. She is shivering in fear of losing all her entrails, as we dig and drill to get hold of what we think is our right towards a better wealth. Mother Earth is crying. Soon she will not have any tears left, and then it will be too late. The time has come to unite and stand together. Please, I ask you, take each other’s hands, lift them high and make a prayer while The World Drum sings her song and we feel her heartbeat. It is the heartbeat of Mother Earth. It is our heartbeat, from each and one all over the world. It is the heartbeat of life itself. Let us join together as one that this heartbeat may continue.

"Sitting at home one misty morning, gazing from my window at a grey, cloudy day, it struck me that soon my sons would be making their own ways in the world and I\'d be rattling around at home alone much of the time. "The words and tune of this song came into my head all in a rush and this draft version was recorded soon after via a Skype headset plugged into my computer. I\'ll re-record it \'properly\' for my next CD (which will probably be called \'Lord of the Wildwood\'), but I kinda like this rough and ready first take. It has a quality that the Welsh call hiraeth, a sort of melancholy yearning after times and things past."

Philip Shallcrass Part 2 of our Interview  Greywolf inside Roundhouse In this part of the Interview Philip talks about the Celtic connections of Druidry, shamanism and sweat lodges and reveals how he got the name of \'Greywolf\'  Philip, Joe & Us - pic by Mike Shallcrass    Song at Wodnesbeorg Philip Shallcrass  The Sign of the Rose The Sign of the Rose is an album of songs, spells and invocations from BDO chief, Greywolf, aka Philip Shallcrass. "Beginning with an invocation to the old Saxon gods of Britain, it moves into ‘Song at Wodnesbeorg,’ a song inspired by Greywolf’s meeting with Woden on an ancient burial mound in North Wiltshire. Next is an invocation of Awen, the sacred, flowing spirit of inspiration in our tradition. This is followed by a hymn to the divine feminine, ‘Lady of the Greenwood.’ Track 5, ‘Lover’ and the title track, ‘The Sign of the Rose,’ are lyrical love songs. ‘Autumn Spell’ is a prayer for healing, followed by ‘Hel’s Embrace,’ reflecting on the dark side of relationships, while the next track, ‘A Perfect Mirror,’ deals with love’s ability to find itself reflected in another’s soul." "‘Slide’ is an out-and-out rocker with some bitchin’ slide guitar work. ‘Sacrifice’ muses on what we may or may not be willing to give, or give up, for love. ‘Thanks’ is an expression of gratitude for the sheer strangeness of being alive. The final track, the 12-minute epic, ‘The Sweet Sorrow,’ is a tragic tale of love and loss, based on a traditional Scots ballad of the same name, here given a makeover with layered harp, bass, percussion and strings."

Not from Nantle but from our own research.. The Court of Hefaydd Hen THE COURT OF HEFEYDD HEN (or Hyfaidd Hen) – unknown, but, according to the Mabinogion, certainly not in Dyfed.  But according to some other traditions, Hefeydd was the first King of Dyfed. Gorsedd Arberth was his burial place and also the entrance to Annwn. Was this the enchanted castle in the third Branch? A hero called Hefeydd Hir is found in the 6th century epic poem Y Gododdin (composed by a Briton named Aneurin who lived in a land which is now part of Scotland). In the second Branch of the Mabinogion he appears as one of the Seven Knights, King Hefeydd of Dyfed who died in 892 etc... Hefeydd was a common name in Mediaeval Wales. The Kingdom of Gwawl fab Clud  Map of Scotland showing the Wall It is said that the literal meaning of the name is “Wall Son Of Wealth”. “Gwawl”, according to the University of Wales Dictionary means:  The Vallum (Roman wall) between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde - the Antonine Wall, not Hadrian’s Wall Man Light  But his last name more than likely refers to the River Clyde in Scotland. Therefore he was one of the people of the Old North, that is to say they were Britons, like the Welsh.  Alt Clud - now called Dumbarton Rock Their capital was Allt Clud – a huge rock on the further north bank of the River Clyde. [Now called Dumbarton (City of the Britons) Rock NS399745].

We talk about what we saw at the conference and recap the evening in which we were lucky enough to walk away with a podcasting award. It’s a convo about the state of political nonfiction, brown drinks, the internet, and the publishing job market. Join us! | After quickly running through the publishing news of the past few weeks and deciding whether each thing is Good or Bad, we talk about some news of our own: as of today, we’ve launched our own agency and are open for business. We talk a little about our new agenting home, and then get into a To Loon It May Concern about power dynamics, respect, and agent etiquette online. Join us! | This week we talk about how the new emphasis on preorders for book sales has changed the way books are purchased, discussed, marketed, and evaluated by publishers. It’s a self-reinforcing feedback loop between publishers and book buyers, and it’s a trend with weird ramifications. Then, we talk through the idea of “crossover” books--who creates them, publishers or readerships? In all, it’s an episode about the interactions between the people selling and the people buying books, and how that interaction ends up changing the books themselves. | After a rousing conversation about 1) pie and 2) the joys of novels that can’t be made into good movies, we talk about Macmillan’s new decision to restrict library purchases of ebooks. The (questionable) choice leads to some fundamental questions about the publishing and reading landscape: do libraries help or hurt publisher sales? How does an ebook differ from a print book, in terms of library usage and even just as a product bought and sold? | That classic online book retailer / Pentagon contract candidate is at it again, folks. With the announcement of Audible’s new audiobook feature called “Captions,” we talk about how it mostly amounts to an audacious rights infringement, one that fits perfectly in line with Amazon’s larger cohesive project of devaluing books as a means of swallowing the industry whole. We discuss the possible strategies behind rolling out something as nakedly infringing as this feature, and then look at another news item this week--Dean Koontz signing a five-book deal with Amazon as his publisher--to talk about where everything is at and where we go from here. | It’s hot and muggy out, and we use that as an opportunity to examine one of publishing’s oldest pieces of conventional wisdom, that the industry grinds to a halt in the summer. We discuss how, rather than truly slowing down, the work over summer in books changes; we talk about soft pitching, research, conferences, and the other things that make publishing not a seasonal industry but one with a rhythm we’ve all come to rely on. Also, Laura is hopelessly hooked on a phone game and we try to Work Through That. | Hello from the recording studio, where a large paint job is in progress--but it’s only making the takes stronger. Today we talk about the recent New York Times article about the rampant fraud and counterfeit problem on Amazon, and then contrast it with a GOOD publishing thing, the success of Minotaur Books and their fascinating approach to achieving it. Plus a To Loon It May Concern at the end. Join us!Special episodes for June are out already, and July’s are on the way. As always, you can send us stuff at printrunpodcast@gmail.com. | ...It’s a big, open-ended question, but it’s one we ask ourselves this week with regard to how the role of agents and agencies could shift to meet the needs of modern publishing. We talk through some big ideas and some small tweaks, and have a wide-ranging conversation on how agenting could look different--for both agents themselves and the authors they work with. | This week, in light of the Natasha Tynes story, we discuss the trend of books being canceled by publishers due to bad behavior online by their authors. In a time when authors often find themselves harassed online with the intent of driving them off platforms or costing them opportunities, how can we make sure that decisions in response to internet outrage are made properly and based on the right reasons? Do publishers really have a track record that should make us trust them in some of these values judgments? Also included is a quick conversation about the recent sale of Barnes and Noble. | This week we’re joined by literary critic and editor Nathan Goldman to talk about the current state of book discourse, and the role literary criticism plays in the broader publishing ecosystem, especially in the age of Goodreads and Amazon consumer reviews. We discuss blurbs, boosterism, book twitter, the importance of “negative” or nuanced reviews, and how editors decide what gets reviewed and when. It’s a fun conversation that takes good stock of the patterns of contemporary book discussion, so be sure to tune in!', 'chan_desc': 'Print Run is a podcast created and hosted by Laura Zats and Erik Hane. Its aim is simple: to have the conversations surrounding the book and writing industries that too often are glossed over by conventional wisdom, institutional optimism, and false seriousness.\n\nWe’re book people, and we want to examine the questions that lie at the heart of that life: why do books, specifically, matter? In a digital world, what cultural ground does book publishing still occupy?\n\nWhether it’s trends in the queries from writers that hit our inboxes or the social ramifications of an industry that pays so little being based in Manhattan, we’re here for it. Probably to laugh at it and call it names, but here for it nonetheless.\n\nPrint Run is the happy-hour conversation after a long day at a catalog launch; it’s the bottle of wine you drink most of on a Tuesday when the manuscripts are no good. We’re for writers, for publishers, for anyone who’s opened a book and wanted to know—really know—what goes into getting the damn thing made.\n\nJoin us.

Dr. Watson, who still mourns the disappearance of his famous friend is intrigued enough to step out of his house and take a look at the crime scene. A crowd has gathered there, curiously gazing up at the room where the crime is supposed to have taken place. Watson inadvertently jostles against an elderly, deformed man and knocks a stack of books from the fellow's hand. The man curses Watson vilely and disappears into the throng. It suddenly occurs to Watson that one of the books that he had helped the stranger pick up had seemed familiar... Thus begins the first thrilling story, The Adventure of the Empty House, in The Return of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which was published after what Holmes enthusiasts call the Great Hiatus.The Return of Sherlock Holmes was published in 1905. In 1891, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was completely exasperated by the seemingly endless appetite of readers who welcomed each new Sherlock Holmes story with the greatest delight. He wrote to his mother confessing that he was “thinking of slaying Holmes... He takes my mind from better things.” His mother's famous reply, “You won't, you can't, you mustn't!” only echoed the voice of his readers. However, in 1893, Conan Doyle did the unthinkable; he finished off Holmes in the Reichenbach Falls in The Final Problem and thought he had done with the man for good.He hadn't reckoned with his readers. There was a flood of protest. Letters to the editors of newspapers, a stream of mail to his publishers and himself, all demanding that Holmes be kept alive. Finally, he gave in and The Return of Sherlock Holmes was greeted with huge delight. Though The Hound of the Baskervilles came out in 1902, it was set in a time before Holmes' “death.” The Return of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of 13 stories. Among them are The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, a tale of a reclusive old bachelor who suddenly vanishes, The Adventure of the Dancing Men, a delightful puzzle involving a mysterious message that contains a series of stick figures, The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist in which a lovely young governess is being stalked by a man on a bicycle, and many others. The last story, The Adventure of the Second Stain has Watson revealing that Holmes is now completely retired and would not like Watson to write any more stories about him!The Return of Sherlock Holmes is indeed a delightful continuation of the Holmes saga and a great addition to your repertoire!", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/f9/f9/25/f9f92596-eb9e-2d3b-cfbe-8723ea425e14/mza_1419058796297647517.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-09-10'}}

We’re reairing last year’s fabulous interview with NaNoWriMo’s founder, Chris Baty, which is sure to inspire anyone thinking about doing NaNoWriMo to jump in with both feet this November. We hope you will. | Today’s episode celebrates what guest Rachel Kadish calls the work of “repair”—which refers to a repairing of a history that so often showcases the exploits and successes and stories of men. Writers are increasingly taking on histories that deserve deeper consideration, or historical figures who were overlooked by the history books. With that comes research and also a responsibility to portray things as they might have happened, thus repairing the record and honoring histories both lost and forgotten. | Escapist, other-worldly, and mind-expanding. These are just a few of the things that describe what fantasy is to its readers. In this week’s episode, Grant and Brooke talk with Victoria Schwab about creating fantasy that pushes the boundaries of our known power structures and why it matters to her to write accessible fantasy. Plus, we discuss how important fantasy literature is to children, and how and why The Harry Potter series is the most influential and important series of an entire generation. | In today’s episode, debut novelist R.O. Kwon, author of the acclaimed novel, The Incendiaries, talks about the book that took her ten years to write, her obsession with language and how she learned to sideline those obsessions in order to finish the book. She talks about her inspirations, the dead-end of following a bad metaphor, and strategies for finishing a book that went through some 50+ versions. | Join Grant and Brooke for today’s episode, a celebration of memoir and an exploration of what makes this genre so magical. This week’s guest is Linda Joy Myers, President of the National Association of Memoir Writers, who shares about the genre she loves, what draws people to memoir, why it’s important, and why people should write their stories. And, Brooke and Linda Joy are teaching some memoir classes this fall that we invite listeners to check out at: www.magicofmemoir.com. | We’re celebrating the publication of Brooke’s new book, Write On, Sisters! and in today’s episode Grant interviews Brooke on a wide range of topics that highlight many of the most important and provocative points of this new book—how women writers don’t champion other women authors as much as they need to, how women hold themselves back, how the world at large doesn’t value women’s stories the way they do men’s, and how women are still fighting not just to be published and read, but to be valued as equal to their male counterparts, and sometimes even to be believed. And then there’s how women writers can counter all this—through community, through championing other women writers, through recognizing how they stand in their own way and curbing those behaviors. We hope you enjoy and share! | Brooke and Grant extend a giant thank you to their listeners for making the first year of Write-Minded so much fun and such a success. In this week’s episode, to celebrate a year of shows, they answer four prompts as a way to remember some of their favorite guests from Year One: 1) something that changed their writing; 2) something they learned; 3) something they passed onto others; and 4) something that inspired them. | It’s our final week of summer mash-ups and Grant is flying solo today, but not for long. Brooke and Grant will both be back next week with a new format and a celebration of completing a year of podcast episodes. Today take a moment to enjoy  Kwame Alexander and Abigail Thomas, two authors who don’t listen to what the industry says is best. There’s lots of wisdom and inspiration in today’s short episode. | It’s Week 2 of our summer mash-ups and Brooke takes off for Jordan this week. Grant and Brooke are choosing to highlight two activist-educator authors with Jessica Valenti and Daniel José Older. These are two writers who will make you think, whose passion on the page translates into passion in the real world, and they’re changing lives with their words and their books. | In this summer episode, Brooke is packing for her trip to Jordan, so Brooke and Grant hatch a plan to share with you a few of their favorite episodes.

I had to research her story for my new book, Katherine Tudor Duchess, about Katherine Willoughby, who was the senior lady sent by King Henry, with her husband Charles Brandon, to welcome Anna when she first arrived in England. The shortest reigning of all Henry’s \xa0queens, Anna of Cleves outlived them all. | Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII, is often portrayed as being shy and even boring and described as the opposite of Anne Boleyn, passive and introvert, but of course the truth is far more complex.Her short reign was during the often chaotic events of the reformation, and she must have struggled with her conscience as a devout Catholic when the Church of England was established.One chronicler of the time said Jane Seymour was the most beautiful of all Henry’s wives, noting that when she donned her queenly regalia no woman was more beautiful - while others described her as pale and unattractive. Which is likely to be true? | We think we know a lot about Anne Boleyn, but even the familiar portrait of her has been challenged as a good likeness – and it’s not certain what year she was born in. Her enemies delighted in stories about her being a witch who’d used unfair means to entrance poor King Henry VIII. To the supporters of Henry’s first wife, Catherine of Aragon, she was a scheming “goggle-eyed whore” who bewitched Henry VIII away from his true wife and the true religion of Catholicism. To her supporters, she was an intelligent, cultured and graceful lady with great drive and ambition. | When Henry VIII married Catherine, she was an auburn-haired beauty in her twenties with a passion she had inherited from her parents, Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon, the joint-rulers of Spain.This daughter of conquistadors showed the same steel and King Henry was to learn, to his cost, that he had not met a tougher opponent on or off the battlefield when he tried to divorce her. | Handsome, charismatic and a champion jouster, Sir Charles Brandon is the epitome of a Tudor Knight. A favourite of King Henry VIII, Brandon has a secret. He has fallen in love with Henry’s sister, Mary Tudor, the beautiful widowed Queen of France, and risks everything to marry her without the King’s consent.Brandon becomes Duke of Suffolk, but his loyalty is tested fighting Henry’s wars in France. Mary’s public support for Queen Catherine of Aragon brings Brandon into dangerous conflict with the ambitious Boleyn family and the king’s new right-hand man, Thomas Cromwell.Torn between duty to his family and loyalty to the king, Brandon faces an impossible decision: can he accept Anne Boleyn as his new queen?Links to all my books cab be found at\xa0https://www.tonyriches.com/ | Prince Arthur was heir to the throne of England and the embodiment of the union between Lancaster and York. His wedding to the young and beautiful Catherine of Aragon was one of the first great events of Henry's reign. Then, at the age of fifteen, Arthur's sudden death changed history.\xa0\xa0 | What changed Henry VIII from a renaissance prince into the 'tyrant' we know in his later rule? In this podcast I take a look at the theories and evidence for the possible causes, as well as talk about some of the less well know facts about King Henry. | Margaret was the eldest daughter of Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York, and was born on 28 November 1489 at the Palace of Westminster, a year and a half before her famous brother, \xa0who became King Henry VIII.Henry VII wanted to use his daughter’s marriage to James IV of Scotland to end the wars, stop him supporting Perkin Warbeck, pretender to the English throne, and make a lasting alliance with Scotland.\xa0This podcast tells the story of what happened next. | I chose to write about Mary Tudor, Queen of France, because I’d researched her birth and early life for Book Three of the Tudor Trilogy, about Mary’s father King Henry VII. In the trilogy I’d moved forward one generation with each book, so it appealed to me to write a ‘sequel’ which did the same. I’d become intrigued with Mary’s story of how she risked everything to defy her brother when he became King Henry VIII.My book Mary - Tudor Princess is available from Amazon\xa0in audiobook, eBook and paperback editions | Bosworth 1485: After victory against King Richard III, Henry Tudor becomes King of England.

You set it aside to cool for several days, then reread it. While you’re still pleased with the story, you have to admit it needs more work—not just polishing, but re-engineering for better pace, suspense, and focus. If you’re like most writers, you may also find it’s run considerably over the word length you were aiming for, an important consideration if you’re planning to submit the story to editors.

Has that ever happened at a conference? Probably. But you’re much more likely to come home with a cold than a contract. Does this mean writing conferences aren’t worth your time and money? Not at all. It does mean that you need to know what you can expect to gain from a conference so you can prepare for all it has to offer.

Just like most things in life, social media can have amazing benefits for writers. There are authors whose books were first pitched on Twitter and liked by an editor which led to a book deal. Who knows how many critique groups have formed in writing groups on Facebook. And, of course, let’s not leave out the ability to market your book yourself through your social media channels.

Its strong sense of place, small town drama, and sparse but powerful prose appealed to both of our tastes. The story is about a 12 year old boy and his family and how the summer of 1948 changes, and unravels, them all. Listeners should be aware that this book discussion will cover topics like sexual assault, racism, and suicide.

His personal life is in turmoil, and he's supposed to turn his badge in, yet he can't help but get wrapped up in a small town mystery. Decades-long grudges and hatred surface as he investigates, but it seems like everyone except for Darren just wants to push the racism and prejudice down instead of rooting it out.

Anne submits her first rough draft, Shawn blesses it, says it’s shaping up to be a fresh and original story in its own right, and gives an inspiring look into what’s next in the Story Grid Universe. | In Episode 9 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne turns in a new prologue representing her new POV narrative device, and a few new scenes leading into the middle build. Is the story getting too long? Shawn says it doesn’t matter, and he gives an inspiring talk about the importance for writers of living within the process, rather than for the result. | In Episode 8 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne has a bit of a crisis: though she’s found a way to meet the demands of the experiment, the resulting story idea feels lifeless. Is she building a franken-story from someone else’s parts? How will she give it life? In response, Shawn delivers a rousing talk on talent, inspiration, and the blue-collar work that holds Resistance at bay. | In Episode 7  of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne submits her first two scenes of “Danebury Hill,” her Regency-era take on the beat structure of Brokeback Mountain. Shawn reads them out  and gives some advice on point of view and narrative device, particularly why it’s okay to use an omniscient narrator who can go into everyone’s head. | In Episode 6 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne completes her analysis of micro beats and scene types in Brokeback Mountain, and she and Shawn consider the power of individual word choices in structuring such a lean short novella. | In Episode 5 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne continues finding micro beats and scene types in Brokeback Mountain’s middle build, and learns the difference between the Editor’s view of a story and the Writer’s view. Shawn tells her, “Just be inspired as opposed to being literally crazed about making sure you get everything perfect.” | In Episode 4 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne splits atoms, finding eight micro beats to Shawn’s single beat in the prologue to Brokeback Mountain, and learns just how perfectly Annie Proulx’s lean, precise word choices deliver plot, theme, exposition, symbolism and subtext all at the same time. | In Episode 3 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne and Shawn define some Regency-era analogs for the Wyoming cowboys of Brokeback Mountain, and step into some controversial territory about appropriate representation of underrepresented groups. | In Episode 2 of the Masterwork Experiment, Anne and Shawn review the Editor’s Six Core Questions and use the answers to complete the Global Foolscap worksheet for Brokeback Mountain, laying the groundwork for Anne’s Regency-era novella. | Welcome to the Story Grid Masterwork Experiment!In this ten-episode summer series, Shawn Coyne and author Anne Hawley are breaking a great masterwork down to the beat level to find out whether an experienced writer can create a new and original story from exactly the same building blocks.Episode 1 of the Masterwork Experiment introduces the masterwork and lays out the experimental protocol.
