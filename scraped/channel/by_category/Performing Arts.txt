Episodes 1 and 2 drop Wednesday, April 4th. Join us! | The Most Beautiful Thing in the World! For our season two finale, we\'re tackling the 2013 Tony Award-winning Kinky Boots.\xa0We\'ll find out how the show, based on true events, developed from a little-known British independent film to an unlikely Tony-winning smash hit, now in its fifth year on Broadway.\xa0 Featuring director Jerry Mitchell, composer Cyndi Lauper, book writer Harvey Fierstein, actors Billy Porter, Stark Sands, Annaleigh Ashford and Ellyn Marsh, and producers Daryl Roth and Hal Luftig.\xa0 | Welcome to The Rock! This week, we\'re tackling the 2017 smash hit Come From Away!\xa0When American airspace was shut down on September 11, 2011, 38 planes carrying nearly 7,000 passengers were forced to land in Gander, Newfoundland. For five days, the residents of the town took care of these strangers, Come From Aways as they were called. 10 years later, writers Irene Sankoff and David Hein went to Gander to meet the real-life people behind this now famous act of human kindness, and what resulted was this heartwarming musical.\xa0 For this episode, we too talk to some of the real-life people including Claude Elilott, the Mayor of Gander then and now, and Captain Beverley Bass, whose pioneering life story is told in the show-stopping song "Me and the Sky." We also chat with Sankoff and Hein, Tony-winning director Christopher Ashley, actors Jenn Colella and Caesar Samayoa, the producers, scenic designer and more as we chart the musical\'s journey from a Canadian college workshop to Tony-nominated hit.\xa0 | Happy Holidays! We\'re checking in to say thanks for helping to make season 2 such a great success and to let you know when to expect the final two episodes of the season! | This week we bring you the tale of 2012\'s Bring It On: The Musical. Bring It On\xa0was created from the ground up by some of the greatest talents working in theater today: Andy Blankenbuehler (director / choreographer), Lin-Manuel Miranda (music, lyrics), Tom Kitt (Music), Amanda Green (Music, Lyrics), Alex Lacamoire (Orchestrations), and David Korins (scenic design). For the episode, we\'ll find out how the show developed from a cult hit film to a Tony-nominated fan favorite which broke the mold with its characters and made its way into the Guinness Book of World Records.\xa0 This episode features brand new interviews with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Andy Blankenbuehler, Tom Kitt, Amanda Green, Taylor Louderman, Adrienne Warren, Gregory Haney, Helene Yorke, and the show\'s cheer and Stunt coordinator Jessica McDermott. | For this week\'s episode, we trace The Light in the Piazza\'s fifty-year journey from its first incarnation as a novella by Elizabeth Spencer to a musical idea handed down through one of musical theater\'s most prominent families.\xa0 We follow the musical, written by Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas, as it takes shape at the Sundance Theatre Lab, has its first production at the Intiman Theatre in Seattle, is restructured for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, before making its way to Broaday at Lincoln Center. The show would be nominated for 13 Tony Awards and win 8 of them. It would make stars of its two leading ladies and go down as one of the most important new works of our time.\xa0 This episode features brand new interviews with composer Adam Guettel, book writer Craig Lucas, actors Victoria Clark, Kelli O\'Hara, and Celia Keenan-Bolger, director Bartlett Sher, and Lincoln Center Artistic Director Andre Bishop | FINALLY! With no further ado, we bring you the backstory of THE MOST requested show for us to cover: 2011\'s Bonnie & Clyde.\xa0 In this episode, we\'ll find out how the show developed from an ambitious recording project at Atlantic Records to a Broadway musical adored by audiences, but not by critics. Interviewees include Jeremy Jordan, Laura Osnes, director Jeff Calhoun, composer Frank Wildhorn, lyricist Don Black, book writer Ivan Menchell, producer Van Dean, and La Jolla Playhouse artistic director Christoper Ashley. | "Helene is a slut, Anatole is hot, Marya is old-school, Sonya is good, Natasha is young, and Andre isn\'t here..." We\'re OBSESSED with Natasha, Pierre, & The Great Comet of 1812! Through conversations with the show\'s writer & composer, Dave Malloy, director Rachel Chavkin, producers, set designer and actors, we\'ll find out how the show developed from 70 pages of War and Peace\xa0to the most Tony nominated show of the 2017 season (and all the growing pains in between). | We\'re kicking off season two with 2 episodes about the Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning musical Hamilton. Featuring Lin-Manuel Miranda, Director Tommy Kail, Producers Jeffrey Seller & Oskar Eustis, Alex Lacamoire, David Korins, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Phillipa Soo, and more, these episodes will dazzle both the Hamilton\xa0super-fans and the casual ones as we find out how the show developed from a vacation beach read to a genre-bending international phenomenon.\xa0 Part 2 picks up on the opening night of Hamilton at The Public Theater. The reviews were ecstatic and the creative team began to plan for a Broadway transfer. Hamilton\xa0moves uptown and opens at the Richard Rodgers Theatre just 70 days after closing at The Public. Hamilton becomes the hottest ticket in generations, The #Ham4Ham show is born, and Hamilton earns more Tony nominations than any show in history.\xa0 Download the TodayTix app in googleplay or the app store or visit todaytix.com to see what\'s playing this month and treat yourself to a show.

The radio show first aired on April 26, 1952 and ran until June 18, 1961 on the CBS radio network. The series starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Deputy Chester Proudfoot. Doc’s first name and Chester’s last name were changed for the television program. Gunsmoke was notable for its critically acclaimed cast and writing, and is commonly regarded as one of the finest old time radio shows. Some listeners have argued that the radio version of Gunsmoke was far more realistic than the television program. Episodes were aimed at adults, and featured some of the most explicit content of the day: there were violent crimes and scalpings, massacres and opium addicts.

With stars Eric Owens and Angel Blue singing the title toles, as well as a star-studded ensemble, this new production by James Robinson is sure to transport audiences to the world of Catfish Row. On this episode of The Metropolitan Opera Guild Podcast, Opera News Editor-in-Chief F. Paul Driscoll and author, lecturer, and Met radio commentator William Berger guide us through what to expect from this season’s much-anticipated opening night at the Metropolitan Opera! | On this episode of The Metropolitan Opera Guild Podcast, lecturers Naomi Barrettara and Elspeth Davis are joined by composers Christopher Cerrone and Laura Kaminsky, as well as producer, director, and dramaturg Lawrence Edelson in an interview from this past season’s “Opera in the New Millennium” event. | Called “the greatest tenor in the world” by his colleague and friend Robert Merrill, legendary performer Richard Tucker sang 724 performances spanning more than 30 leading roles at the Met! On this episode of The Metropolitan Opera Guild Podcast, we have Part 2 of our "Celebrating Richard Tucker" mini-series, drawn from a live event this past season. One of Tucker\'s sons, Dr. David Tucker, and biographer James A. Drake give listeners an inside look at the life and career of this great artist. | Richard Tucker was unquestionably one of the world’s most eminent tenors. After beginning his musical career as a cantor in New York’s most prestigious synagogues, he went on to reign over the Golden Age of opera as one of the Metropolitan Opera’s superstars. This episode is Part 1 of a live event at The Metropolitan Opera Guild, celebrating the astounding life and career of America’s greatest tenor presented by one of Tucker’s sons, Dr. David Tucker, and biographer James A. Drake. They take us on an intimate journey, highlighting the life and career of this unparalleled artist! | The evolution of French grand cuisine interestingly paralleled the development of French grand opera beginning in the late 18thcentury and culminating in the late 19th century, particularly in Paris. In this episode, Food Historian and Chef Carl Raymond explores how both food and opera came to be grand against the backdrop of the 18th century Comedie Francaise, as well as the glittering world of the 1890’s Belle Epoque and the great Parisian restaurant and café society. | LES CONTES D\'HOFFMANN by Jacques Offenbach is a tour de force of singing for both villains and victims within the opera’s plot! Since it’s world premiere performance, the four main villainous characters were designed to be sung by the same bass-baritone. And this opera has plenty of victims too, as three tales of doomed love are told from the perspective of the lead character, Hoffmann. On this episode of The Metropolitan Opera Guild Podcast, Met Radio Commentator Ira Siff explores excerpts from Les Contes d’Hoffmann, Tosca, Boris Godunov, and other beloved works, in the last installment of his “Villains and Victims” series. | Soprano Renata Scotto gave a famously chilling interpretation of Lady Macbeth in Verdi’s take on Shakespeare’s play. But Scotto was just as loved for tugging at our heartstrings in the title role of LUISA MILLER. On this episode of the Metropolitan Opera Guild Podcast, Met Radio commentator Ira Siff explores the artistry of legends such as Renata Scotto, Astrid Varnay, and others, in the second installment if his “Villains and Victims” series. | While victimized characters often sing through their death in virtuosic song, successfully bringing a villain to life on the opera stage also takes a special kind of artistry. On this episode of The Metropolitan Opera Guild Podcast, we have Met Radio commentator Ira Siff, in Part 1 of his “Villains and Victims” live lecture series from this past season! | John Dexter’s classic production of Poulenc\'s DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES is currently on stage at the Met during the final weeks of the 2018-19 season and can be seen in cinemas worldwide on May 11th, 2019, through the Met’s upcoming Live in HD broadcast. Poulenc’s opera tells the story of a group of Carmelite nuns who refused to renounce their faith during the Reign of Terror. On this episode of The Metropolitan Opera Guild podcast, lecturer Desirée Mays takes a closer look at this 20th-century French masterpiece. | The Metropolitan Opera Chorus is one of the most revered opera choruses in the world, requiring long hours of rehearsal and a demanding performance schedule. What is a day, week, or year in the life of a Met chorister like? How much time is spent on learning music and rehearsing? How do you get into the chorus in the first place? In this episode, drawn from a live event in the Met Opera Guild\'s Opera Boot Camp series, lecturer and podcast co-host Naomi Barrettara sat down with three Met Opera choristers - Ross Benoliel (baritone), Angela Deverger (soprano), and Danielle Walker (soprano)- to get the inside scoop on a day in the life of a Met Opera chorister!', 'chan_desc': 'Podcast by Metropolitan Opera Guild', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts71/v4/de/55/c7/de55c7f9-c08d-783a-209f-b33eaa5fa9e0/mza_803834587474659010.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2015-10-07'}}

And we WILL continue to produce new episodes with Tony winners, Broadway legends, and today’s brightest theater stars. There are going to be some changes to our release schedule, but again more on that next time. Today we’re excited to share a new episode of one of our favorite sister podcasts, "The Ensemblist." After a four month hiatus, "The Ensemblist" is back to share some of their favorite stories from their website.

Lea, of course, needs no introduction, but since I have to put something here, here goes: In 1989 she was selected to star as Kim in "Miss Saigon"--first in London and then on Broadway where, of course, she won the Tony Award for her work. She would go on to star in "Les Miserables," "Flower Drum Song," and "Allegiance" to name just a very few shows. She was also the singing voice of Jasmine in the Disney film version of "Aladdin" and Mulan in "Mulan." In the Philippines, where she is a mega-star, she is a co-host of the popular TV show "The Voice" Her credits go on and on and on. And now she\'s back on Broadway as Erzulie, The Goddess of Love, in Michael Arden\'s utterly magical production of "Once on this Island" now playing at Circle in the Square.

شهرت دارد. این کارگردان بعد از گذشت هشت سال از آخرین فیلم موفق خود با نام «شاعرانگی»، این بار با اقتباسی هوشمندانه از داستان کوتاه «انبارسوزی» به قلم هاروکی موراکامی، بازگشت قدرتمندانه ای به دغدغه های همیشگی خود داشته است.\xa0این فیلم، داستان «جونگ سو» را روایت می کند. پسری که به طور اتفاقی با دختری به نام «هائمی» آشنا می شود. دختری که از قضا در کودکی با او همبازی بوده است. دختر به سفر می رود و در بازگشت با «بن» بازمی\u200cگردد. پسری از طبقات مرفه جامعه که عادتی عجیب و بارورنکردنی دارد ...سوختن روایت انسان\u200cهایی است که در ناملایمت های دنیای مدرن گرفتار شده اند. آنها نه تنها از درک معنای زندگی عاجزند، بلکه حتی توانایی فهمیدن آنچه در اطرافشان رخ می دهد را نیز از دست داده اند. انسان هایی تنها و تک افتاده که هرچه بیشتر برای درک حوادث زندگی تلاش می کنند، کمتر به نتیجه می رسند. احساس تنهایی، پیچیدگی روابط انسانی، آشفتگی های درونی و اختلافات طبقاتی، مسائلی هستند که انسان\u200cهای فیلم سوختن را با خود درگیر کرده است.فیلم سوختن و نقد آن در پادکست سینماسلف را اکیداً به شما دوستان سینمادوست توصیه می کنیم.\xa0\xa0CSPodcast.ir | Castbox | Apple Podcasts | Google Podcast | Overcast | RadioPublic \xa0|\xa0Stitcher\xa0| Telegram | Instagram\xa0 | جزیره\u200cی شاتر؛ در جدال با خشونت

He was also the creator of The Awesome 80s Prom off Broadway, the co-creator of Altar Boyz and the book writer of last season’s Getting The Band Back Together. Upcoming projects include an off-Broadway mounting of Barry Manilow’s Harmony and a musical based on the movie Joy. He’s also the host of the very-good podcast The Producer’s Perspective. Here’s our conversation... | Taurean Everett made a splash last season in the ensemble of The Cher Show. He brought the house down as Bob Mackie’s Assistant by wearing only a loincloth and a beaming smile. Taurean was also the lead campaign image for this year’s edition of Broadway Bares. It goes without saying that this is a guy who takes care of his body. However, that fitness was called into question when he was injured in an audition toward the end of the summer. Here’s our conversation… | One of the most effective ways Broadway productions share their stories is with what are called “production photos.” These are images captured on a theatre stage, with the sets, costumes, lights and makeup. They are meant to give viewers a glimpse into the world of the play with just a singular image.Think back to your childhood. What plays and musicals turned you on to a love for theatre? I bet as you’re thinking of shows, you’re imagining specific moments - those captured in the show’s production photos. Is it the cast of Rent proclaiming “Viva La Vie Boheme?” Elphaba raising a broom above her head as she defies gravity? Just like cast albums or televised performances, these production photos are an important calling card for a theatre production.Not all the time, but often these calling cards will feature the show’s ensemble. Think back to Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 and those images of its whirling ensemble. Or the current campaign of Moulin Rouge! Featuring four actors with the bohemian ideals tattooed on their bodies. Those both happen to be shots by my guest for this episode, Matthew Murphy. As one of Broadway’s most in-demand photographers, he’s shot everything from the Hamilton’s Lin-Manuel Miranda pointing toward the sky to Alex Brightman’s creepy, kooky glare for Beetlejuice.\xa0I asked Matt into the studio to talk about what makes a great theatre photograph and stories behind creating some of the most iconic theatre images of the last decade. Here’s our conversation... | Closing shows are just part of the big, beautiful cycle of musical theatre. And yet sometimes those closings are so sudden that they defy explanation. Such was the case last fall with the North American tour of Bat Out of Hell - The Musical. While playing its opening stint in Toronto, the show’s producers announced that the multi-city run would shutter its doors before even reaching its second city. Left in the lurch were dozens of performers, including this week’s guest Emilie Battle. Emilie was a member of the original off-Broadway company of Dear Evan Hansen understudying the role of Alana Beck. But in the last twelve months, she’s been a part of two productions that closed prematurely\xa0 Bat Out Of Hell and this summer’s off-Broadway run of an entirely new commercial musical Broadway Bounty Hunter. I asked her into the studio to share these two very different experiences, and how they were at all united. Here’s our conversation... | Todrick Hall is a trailblazer in the world of video. His work has always sought to entertain and engage, uniting his love of music, theatre and Disney with unparalleled production quality. Blasting open the possibilities of online video, he’s also created studio albums, live touring productions and award-winning music videos. But Todrick’s first love was Broadway, as is obvious from the number of times he’s trod the broads on the mainstem. Last week, he finished a run as Ogie in Waitress the musical on Broadway. But he’s also played Lola in Kinky Boots, Billy Flynn in Chicago - both here and in London. And in 2007, he made his Broadway debut in the original production of The Color Purple as a replacement in the show’s ensemble.\xa0 | Jovan Dansberry made his Broadway debut last season in the ensemble of King Kong. Performing both as one of the show’s dancers and as the manipulator of Kong’s left paw proved to be a monumental challenge, one that took him out of the show for months and ultimately stopped him from closing the Broadway production. But for Jovan, the biggest challenge was not the physical recovery but dealing with the stigma of being an injured performer. Here’s our conversation... | A couple of months ago, I sat down with Built For Stage founder Joe Rosko. Built for the Stage is a new way for actors to train as athletes, using personalized coaching through an app to build their bodies for the physical requirements of performing. Over a couple of bourbons, Joe and I discussed over we each try to serve the theatre community and what excites us about championing theatre artists.\xa0Next month, we’re collaborating with Built for the Stage to host the first annual Broadway’s Fittest celebration. To hear more about that and how can participate, stick around for the credits after the interview.\xa0Here’s our conversation with Joe Rosko... | As performers, our bodies are our instruments. We use our physical beings to create sounds, embody characters and tell stories. So when that physical instrument is suffering, how does that affect a performers’ artistry? And, perhaps more importantly, what does it do to a performer’s psyche when they aren’t able to work to the best of their abilities.That’s a conversation I wanted to explore in this new mini-series Hurt and Healed: an honest look into actors’ injuries, recoveries and the stigma that comes from not being able to be your best onstage.There is not a theatre performer who leads with more grace than Caissie Levy. Yes, she’s played some of the most iconic roles in Broadway history - from Elphaba in Wicked to Fantine in Les Miserables - but she’s also a warm soul that pulses with kindness....it’s probably because she’s Canadian, eh?Recently, Caissie (who currently leads the Broadway cast of Frozen as Elsa, opened up on social media about a vocal fold injury she incurred during a decade ago, how she worked towards recovery and the stigma she still sometimes endures as a result. Here’s our conversation... | Welcome back to the second part of my interview with director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw about some of his favorite numbers in his Broadway shows.If you don’t know Casey Nicholaw by name, you’re certainly familiar with the shows that he has worked on. He’s the director and choreographer of Mean Girls, Something Rotten! and Aladdin. He’s a Drama Desk winner, a Drama League winner, an 11-time Tony Award nominee, and one time winner for The Book of Mormon. He’s basically a winner.\xa0He’s also on the record for sharing that in every production he helms, there’s one number he’s most proud of. I thought this was a fascinating topic for a mini-series: for an acclaimed director/choreographer to walk us through some of the most famous and crowd-pleasing numbers in the musical theatre canon. We talked about his time as a Broadway performer, the inspiration for those numbers - as well as how he build a number from an idea to a Tony Award-winning hit. | Chloe Campbell made a name for herself performing in London in four West End musicals. Since making a leap across the pond, she performed in the Chicago company of Hamilton and the national tour of In The Heights. Her Broadway credits include the short-lived Tuck Everlasting and the just-closed production of King Kong.

Currently on her first national tour, Ellisa is showing she has what it takes to make it on her own. Just a guitar, a 30-foot RV, and an insatiable desire to perform. Raised in Los Angeles, Ellisa migrated north and found a home in San Francisco’s creative scene, where she wrangled a seven-piece band to play her music. Her sound is honest and textured, combining elements of jazz, soul, and pop. Ellisa self-produced her debut album Moon & Sun in 2017 to critical acclaim. SF Weekly called the first single, Unravel “as near to perfect as any song could be” and “damn gorgeous.” Ellisa self-released her 2nd album—the Just a Little More EP—in September 2018. With support from her talented bandmates, the 5-track EP boasts a one-of-a-kind, edgy sound that “takes listeners on a trip across all spectrums of love” (WomenCrushMusic) and is “too much of an original to fit into one box” (The Bay Bridged). Since releasing her album, Ellisa has ventured out on a year-long national tour. Living full-time out of their Winnebago, she and her partner Ken are taking the music directly to the people. Ellisa and her guitar have also earned frequent flyer miles in Japan and South America.

Seeing Camp Crush live is like watching two people fall in love in front of you. And it’s true - the band was born when now-married Jen Deale and Chris Spicer discovered they were at the same summer camp together as children, and years later found each other in Portland, OR. With a late 80s mood-pop influence and driving indie rock rhythms, the duo has discovered new territory; a nuanced middle ground between Madonna and Brandon Flowers, Debbie Harry and Win Butler, “blending old school and indie rock into something wonderful” according to Pop Dust.

Hernandez (aka Robonzo) is a part-time professional drummer and vocalist, who performs with multiple bands throughout the course of any given year. While he’s most at home performing on a drum kit, Robonzo also regularly gigs with a Cajon, Djembe and other accoutrements of percussion. He’s worked with original artists and cover bands in and around San Jose, California since 2001. Although he’s a predominately self-taught drummer, Robonzo has in recent years become a student of the acclaimed online educator Mike Johnston at MikesLessons.com. Robonzo played his first gig at a college bar in Arlington, Texas. Within months of that first gig, he was performing throughout the greater Dallas-Fort Worth and the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Thanks to two older siblings, Robonzo’s earliest music influences included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Cream. In addition to his love of the 60s, Robonzo has always maintained a healthy interest in new music and emerging genres. On the business of doing business as a musician and an artist, Robonzo has also maintained an interest in the changing music industry. He recognizes a growing need to educate and help the next generation do more of what they love—make music. In July of 2016, Robonzo and his wife relocated to El Valle de Anton, Panama. Similar to his move from DFW to San Jose in ’99, Robonzo is poised to start over. He’s planning to foster and grow the live music scene in El Valle while researching ways to help other musicians around the world.

He played the Blue Beetle, menaced the Shadow, and narrated adventures of the FBI. Lovejoy could also be heard in supporting roles on\xa0Suspense, but he moved into the starring role in 1951. We\'ll hear him in a pair of radio thrillers: first, a ballad brought to radio life in "The Wreck of the Old 97" (originally aired on CBS on March 17, 1952). Then, he plays a man searching for his brother-in-law\'s murderer in "The Frightened City" (originally aired on CBS on November 10, 1952). | Character actor Lloyd Nolan returns to the podcast for two more visits to "radio\'s outstanding theater of thrills." The big screen Michael Shayne plays a salesman who stumbles into a murder mystery in his new rooming house in "Nineteen Deacon Street" (originally aired on CBS on November 22, 1945).

Maybe the first sign of what’s to come is a laugh-tinged “You will never believe what happened to me at work...”  Or a wistful “Do y’all remember that time...”  But it always comes. Here, in our little corner of the country, they always come. The South has always marked time by its stories. They carry our history. Our fathers and grandfathers. Wars. Hunting trips. Good dogs. Great loves. Brass badges and bank robbers. Our everyday lives.  Arc Stories is the celebration of that great tradition.

@thelyddz in the pod! As an OG member of the original @questcrew, Lydia has been a dancer at heart. As a lover of music and dance, she soon found her love and gift for creating music. She ventured out into the KPOP scene where she became a composer and songwriter for the Korean pop music label @yg_ent_official. With a catalogue of hit songs on the charts, Lydia has had a very extensive and successful career as an artist. All that said, her identity has never been based on what she does, but rather in why she’s doing it. In the ever changing landscape of the entertainment industry, Lydia has been able to base her success not on how many hit songs she’s written, but rather on making decisions that fulfill her life’s purpose. \xa0 For anyone who has ever wondered why they’re doing what they’re doing, this is a very sobering way to take inventory of your “WHY”\xa0\xa0Jump in! \xa0 Instagram  https://www.instagram.com/thelyddz \xa0 YouTube  https://www.youtube.com/juukkes \xa0 — SPONSORS — Audible Free Trial:\xa0https://www.kinjazpodkast.com/audible \xa0 MSTR Watches  www.MSTRWATCHES.COM Discount Code: KINJAZPOD 25% OFF ENTIRE PURCHASE \xa0 KIN Aesthetik  www.store.kinjaz.com Discount Code: PODKAST 15% OFF ENTIRE PURCHASE \xa0 \xa0 — SHOW NOTES — \xa0 (3:00) Married life \xa0 (6:52) Origin story \xa0 (8:01) Step Off Dance Ministry -\xa0https://www.facebook.com/stepoffministry/ \xa0 (8:32) Sodium Dance Company -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/sodiumdanceco \xa0 (9:20) Meeting Ryanimay -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/ryanigram \xa0 (9:33) Meeting Hok -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/hok \xa0 (9:40) Joining Quest Crew and TM Juniors -\xa0http://www.instagram.com/questcrew\xa0&\xa0https://www.teammillennia.com/tm-juniors \xa0 (9:55) Meeting David Yi -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/aznc0wb0y \xa0 (10:22) Dumbfoundead -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/dumbfoundead \xa0 (10:55) Sickstep -\xa0https://youtu.be/ryvY9P973KM \xa0 (11:52) Invert freeze -\xa0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4HU2UsFOzk \xa0 (13:00) Boxcuttuhz -\xa0https://americasbestdancecrew.fandom.com/wiki/Boxcuttuhz \xa0 (14:25) Parents’ support? \xa0 (16:05) When did music start? \xa0 (17:01) Got the opportunity to go to Korea to work with YG Entertainment \xa0 (17:10) Shaun Evaristo & Big Bang -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/shaunevaristo\xa0&\xa0https://www.ygfamily.com/artist/About.asp?LANGDIV=E&ATYPE=2&ARTIDX=3 \xa0 (19:13) YG audition \xa0 (19:26) Meeting Yang Hyun Suk and Teddy -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/fromyg\xa0&\xa0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Park  \xa0 (19:55) First song I wrote \xa0 (21:19) First hit song for Park Bam of 2NE1 “Don’t Cry” -\xa0https://youtu.be/ypit0NcNV-8 \xa0 (21:50) Discovering the path of becoming a songwriter \xa0 (28:00) What type of artist I wanted to be \xa0 (30:40) How I handle transition \xa0 (34:33) Lyle Beniga -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/lylebeniga\xa0& Parris Goebel -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/parrisgoebel \xa0 (35:40) Ellen Kim - https//www.instagram.com/ellenkimchee\xa0& Sheela Awe -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/sheelaawe \xa0 (37:22) How to deal with insecurities \xa0 (49:20) Masta Wu -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/mastawu02 \xa0 (49:24) “Crazy Love” by Francis Chan -\xa0https://www.amazon.com/s?k=crazy+love+by+francis+chan&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhqzwhPGG5AIVmJOzCh0BfgcBEAAYASAAEgIGHfD_BwE&hvadid=241636345348&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9030938&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16540506476446333237&hvtargid=kwd-7240296641&hydadcr=8266_10375025&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_9c1llkpxja_e \xa0 (49:35) “Twilight” -\xa0https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Saga-Book-1/dp/0316015849 \xa0 (51:06) My purpose in life \xa0 (53:50) How do I know if this is for me or not? \xa0 (54:50) How I got over my identity crisis \xa0 (56:45) Success? \xa0 (1:02:44) LIGHTNING ROUND \xa0 (1:04:37) Kim Burrell -\xa0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Burrell \xa0 (1:06:48) Less of / More of \xa0 (1:07:17) Golden Rule \xa0 — SHOW CREDITS — \xa0 Host/Producer: Ben Chung -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/btek_benchung Producer: Mike Fallorina -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/mikefal Producer: Jeremy Lai -\xa0https://www.instagram.com/jdl2012 \xa0  https://www.kinjaz.com/podkast  https://www.kinjazpodkast.com  https://www.instagram.com/kinjazpodkast  https://www.twitter.com/kinjazpodkast  https://www.facebook.com/kinjazpodkast \xa0 | This week we bring you another Live recording from @arenadancecomp Dance Camp!

Dumb is\xa0 among Koreatown’s finest, a “city councilman” as he puts it. Gaining notoriety in the battle rap scene in his earlier years, he made a name for himself as one of the most respected Asian-American rappers of his generation. As a Korean-American growing up in K-Town in the 90’s, Dumb found himself immersed in a mixture of different cultures that ultimately made him a product of an eclectic palette of experiences. From pop culture, to skate culture, to hip hop culture, he was influenced by it all. Listen as he talks about how his love for music and acting has ultimately taken him to places that continue to break ground not only for himself, but for the culture that he is so heavily involved with.\xa0  Dumb breaks down the formula to how he views success. He is laser focused on the necessity to be at the top of his game, all the while being able to evolve with the times. He also gets into what he thinks his actual real gifted ability is. Dumb keeps it absolutely one-hundo at all times, and as you will see from this conversation, that is the secret sauce to his brand and his success.

But today’s guest, Rosa, has spent a lot of time figuring out just how to make us aware of them again. Rosa shares with us why exactly it is that your arms and hands draw so much attention (I hope you have a duh moment like I did!), a good way to build awareness of your arms, and why you should be\xa0\u200bobsessed\u200b\xa0with your hands\u200b\u200b | Can you imagine being raised with Bellydance and not liking it at all, only to find it again as an adult and make it your career? That's exactly how Oreet found her way to being the founder of SharQui: The Bellydance Workout which has been featured on more media outlets that we have space to name right now! SharQui focuses on bridging the gap that can sometimes exist between fitness and dance, and today we dive into how you can incorporate more fitness into your dance as a dance teacher OR a student, and how offering a fitness class like SharQui can be a big draw for those of who either own studios or teach regular classes. | Let's take a moment to step back before we dive into the #21daysofbellydance challenge on Instagram and realize that we want to be doing all of this work on improving our practice and technique from a positive place. Not one of deficiency. Because you deserve it. We'll also discuss the important concepts of consistency and motivation.

He and Joe discuss: growing up in post-war England; how he almost wound up spending his life working at a bank; the fine line between hard work and luck as it pertains to his career; recording hits like "She\'s Not There", "Tell Her No", and the classic Odessey and Oracle album; struggling to find his identity after the band broke up; working as an A&R man for CBS; how drumming saved him during the most difficult time in his life; and the joys of playing with the reunited Zombies, over 50 years after their original run. Be sure to attend Joe\'s show with Trap Set alum Matt Cameron, Mary Timony, Chad Molter and a 12 piece orchestra, at Hollywood Forever Masonic Lodge on November 21, 2019. TICKETS | Ali Koehler\'s propulsive drumming paints vivid pictures with a deliberately minimalist palette, but--due partially to an abusive teacher--she has always had a difficult time identifying as a drummer. Ali tells Joe about growing up in New Jersey; school band; her talent for resolving interpersonal conflict; playing with Vivian Girls and Best Coast; working in clothing production; becoming a mom; and how she has worked to achieve creative heights despite discouragement from an authority figure during a particularly formative period of her life. | Joe met this week\'s guest--Jimmy LaValle--on tour over twenty years ago. A lot has happened in the intervening time, and Jimmy catches Joe up on: the genesis and evolution of The Album Leaf; becoming a film composer; and raising a family. This conversation was a reminder of the magic that is felt on early tours and how that feeling is still within reach if we can learn from experience but also maintain some semblance of childlike wonder. In any case, it\'s always fun to see old friends. | By any external measure, Hrishikesh Hirway is an incredibly successful polymath; but boy, is he ever hard on himself. Or perhaps his success is due—at least in part—to the fact he is so hard on himself…you be the judge! Hrishi tells Joe about: growing up in Massachusetts; the challenges posed by the American pop culture\'s skewed portrayal of Asian men; attending Exeter and Yale; creating music as The One AM Radio; hosting the popular Song Exploder and The West Wing Weekly podcasts; and the psychological chasm between creating podcasts and writing songs. | We\'re moving Trap Set Headquarters! This week, we\'re revisiting our conversation with the incomparable Bill Bruford. Bill happens to be a favorite drummer of last week\'s guest, Danny Carey, who spoke of Bill with loving derision during his episode. See you next week! | Danny Carey is the rare artist with a wildly ambitious imagination, coupled with the virtuosic ability to manifest his singular ideas. Joe joined Danny at his Hollywood studio for one of our loosest, most freewheeling episodes yet! Danny talks about: growing up in Kansas City; his love of basketball; how his Midwestern work ethic helped him assassinate his competition; his love of Bill Bruford, Billy Cobham, and Tony Williams; playing in a country band with Jeff Buckley; the origins and creative dynamic of Tool; and how becoming a father changed his relationship to time. As an added bonus, Tool bassist Justin Chancellor dropped by near the end of the chat. | Billy Brimblecom plays drums with an emphatic crispness, that has made him a valued member of his native Kansas City music scene since the 90s. After achieving many of his childhood musical dreams, Billy was forced to reexamine his priorities when his leg was amputated due to cancer. Although he is still a working drummer, Billy dedicates much of his time to Steps of Faith Foundation, a non-profit that helps amputees access artificial limbs. The organization\'s annual benefit concert is Saturday, November 9, and will feature Jason Sudeikis, Fred Armisen, Will Forte, Wynonna Judd, Sam Richardson, our own Joe Wong, and more! Purchase tickets at: thundergong.org | Joey Armstrong co-founded SWMRS when he was still in grade school, and at the age of 24, he already has decades of musical experience. Joey talks about: the benefits of hailing from a well known musical family; working to develop his own musical identity; how School of Rock changed his life; sustaining a band with his best friends; and who he\'d interview if he guest hosted an episode of the show. | This week, we\'re renovating Trap Set HQ; so we\'re sharing one of our favorite episodes, featuring the great Carla Azar. This episode was recorded a few years ago. Carla is currently busy with several projects, including a new Autolux album. We\'ll return in August with some of our most intense episodes to date! | When he was eleven years old, Steven McDonald co-founded a band with his older brother, Jeff. That band, which soon became known as Redd Kross, became a fixture on the late 70s LA punk scene and--remarkably--is still active today. Steven tells Joe about: precociousness; opening for Black Flag at an eighth grade graduation party; the joy and pain that came along with identifying as a punk; having a romantic relationship with a 26-year-old woman when he was 13; hanging out with Raymond Pettibone; signing with a major label; working as an A&R consultant for major labels; how he reconciles his permissive childhood with modern parenting; playing with Melvins and Off!; working as a producer; and much more!

Directed by Brian J Davis. Cast: Madeline Zima, Helen Hong, Yvonne Zima, Dana Berger, Jenny Grace, Carson Elrod, Bree Elrod, and Cecilia Corrigan. | Bowing to pressure from the underbelly of Reddit and Youtube, Broad Strokes’ spot is taken over this week by a fringe media personality who has a very different take on Hazel Hayes and the quarantine. Tim K Rylander is convinced she’s more of a part of SHV’s story than we knew before. We also meet Wanda Kovacs, Hazel’s former thesis advisor, who gives a TED Talk on what blonde means for the patriarchy and capitalism after the virus. By episode’s end we also suspect the virus has mutated. Written by Brian J Davis & Emily Schultz, Cecilia Corrigan. Directed by Duncan Birmingham. Cast: Madeline Zima, Rob Belushi, Cecilia Corrigan, Rebecca Kush, and Carson Elrod. | Broad Strokes continues its history of SHV and Hazel, who, through her recordings, talks about life in a deteriorating quarantine. Her final recording ends when she’s forced to rescue a friend from the much feared “Room Three.” With Hazel’s fate in limbo we also meet Broad Strokes’ new sponsor, the actress and wellness guru Frieda Wells, who has turned from selling questionable cures to hosting the Lux Festival in the Virgin Isles for “Blondefluencers.” Written by Brian J Davis and Emily Schultz. Directed by Brian J Davis. Cast: Madeline Zima, Helen Hong, Yvonne Zima, Dana Berger, Jenny Grace, Carson Elrod, and Bree Elrod. | Jennifer Lim hosts Broad Strokes, a podcast that is investigating the story of Hazel Hayes and SHV, also known as the Blonde Rabies. In this episode the escalation of the outbreak among blonde women, both natural and bleached, is explained, as well as the spread of misinformation in the media. We first meet Hazel through “The Hazel Tapes,” the recordings she made telling how she went from a pregnant grad student in New York to being forcefully quarantined. The show’s sponsor is Glesumax, the makers of the only treatment for SHV, which calls into question the show’s journalistic independence.\xa0Written by Brian J Davis and Emily Schultz.

Set two years after a virus has infected blonde women with a rabies-like illness, a fictional podcast examines how the virus has changed our culture: from fashionable new fever bracelets, to empowerment pop songs for the infected, to an entirely new understanding of women, gender, and beauty. What begins as the story of Hazel Hayes — the unlikely, eight-months-pregnant hero who reveals government abuses at virus evaluation centers — turns much thornier when her personal life and role in the outbreak becomes grist for conspiracy theorists. Angry, funny, and with dark turns into body horror, The Blondes is an unflinching look at media and viral ideas, illness and profit, and what happens when beauty becomes, literally, deadly. Starring: Madeline Zima, Helen Hong, Rob Belushi, Cecilia Corrigan, Yvonne Zima, Dana Berger, Jenny Grace, Carson Elrod, and Bree Elrod. Written by Brian J Davis and Emily Schultz.

I am joined by casting director, Kaitlin Shaw, who has been working at Tara Rubin Casting for 11 years. She shares with us why she loves being a casting director, what to focus on in an audition and why she thinks of herself as an advocate rather than a gatekeeper. I’m so thrilled to bring this new perspective to the podcast! This episode is sure to leave you charged and empowered for your next audition. \xa0 Take Action:\xa0  Take 5 minutes and jot down all of your beliefs about auditioning and casting directors. Don’t judge it, just get it all out. (This CD doesn’t like me, I don’t have the right rep, I prepare and then I choke. I don’t prepare enough and try to wing it. Etc.)\xa0 After listening to the episode and from a place of power ask yourself if there are any beliefs you can throw out.\xa0 Then pick some that need your honest attention. Maybe you need to do some work with someone on a belief or two.\xa0 Commit to choosing different thoughts that will yield better feelings. Write down 5 new ones that you will begin to practice. (I am good at auditioning. I show up prepared and am able to play in the room. I choose to share my gifts. I don’t need validation from anyone behind the table. I release and destroy the need for anyone to like me.)\xa0  \xa0 This episode is sponsored by Thomas Jones of the Paradox Process. The Paradox Process brings the conscious mind to present by eliminating negative emotions from the past, and clearing anxieties and worries about the future.

You get to be a fly on the wall and see Thomas in action using the Paradox Process! \xa0 Take Action:\xa0 Let’s put into practice the homework that Thomas gave Brittany - you give it a try! The Affirm Clear Exercise: One minute in the morning and one minute at night. Describe who you are in the terms that you want as an already accomplished fact. Affirm the circumstances you want to create and the experience you want to have. For example: “The best is yet to come.” “I do work that I love with people I love and make great money.” \xa0“I am a powerful, creative Being.” “I am excited for what is around the corner” After each statement, say “Affirm Clear”. \xa0 Music by: Joel Waggoner - Unlikely Warrior | This week’s episode is with the Broadway performer and Founder of The Broadway Collective, Robert Hartwell. He is such a light and it really shines through in this episode. We talk about how mindset differs in a dance audition, not being afraid of monetizing our skills, and how “preparation is the most powerful tool”. He shares the incredible transition he has made from leaving a hit Broadway show to becoming a full-time business owner and how he finds his peace in it.\xa0 Instagram: @sirroberttakespics @bwaycollective \xa0 TAKE ACTION:  Get thee to class! Sign up this week for that dance class, acting class, improv class you've been putting off taking. Just do it!  \xa0  Take a moment to write down all of the skills you have and perhaps underrate or take for granted. Brainstorm ideas for how you can monetize. (Feel free to email me back here if you wanna work this one out.)

Other Broadway credits include Thoroughly Modern Millie, La Cage Aux Folles, Hair, She Loves Me, Book of Mormon, Waitress. West End credits include The Book of Mormon, Mary Poppins, Hair. \xa0 We chat about Gavin’s belief that when we open up and are vulnerable with people that is when true connection flourishes. He also credits much of his “success” as an artist to his ability to be vulnerable and bring his authentic self to the stage. We discuss the constant pursuit of finding our true selves while living in a social media centric world. Gavin shares so much wisdom in this episode, take a listen to hear some great storytelling and uplifting conversation about putting in the work!!\xa0Instagram: @gavincreelofficial Andrew Rannells’ Book: Too Much Is Not Enough: A Memoir of Fumbling Toward Adulthood\xa0 \xa0 Take action:  In life think of something that feels vulnerable and open up to someone you trust. Tell them your experience. Take off your mask and bare your heart. Then ask them what comes up for them and hold the space for their truths as well. Take a song or scene or monologue or dedicate your show tonight to seeing how you can bring more of your true, authentic self. No performing. No “getting it right.” Just raw, moment to moment honest.  \xa0 This episode is sponsored by Gavin and my therapist, Thomas Jones of the Paradox Process. The Paradox Process brings the conscious mind to present by eliminating negative emotions from the past, and clearing anxieties and worries about the future. It isn’t about “fixing” oneself; it’s about using an innovative tool to actualize who you really are in the world.

Many of us, including myself, try to seek approval from the world and Thomas talks about how we must look inside ourselves in those moments of doubt. We also chat about marrying the artistic and the business side of the industry. This is the kind of conversation that feeds my soul and I believe will change the narrative of fear and lack many of us “starving artists” have. For an uplifting, inspiring conversation listen now!! \xa0 Take Action:\xa0A Paradox Process Morning Practice  Determine 10 things you are grateful for and repeat “Affirm Clear” after each one. Determine 10 “negative things” and repeat “Detach Clear” after each one.

He was discussed on Tim Held\'s Podular Modcast, and it caused me to check out his work as Dark Sparkler. He also had a discussion with me about recording a spot for the 50th episode of Tim\'s podcast. And then he started (along with Robert Standefer) the Source of Uncertainty podcast, which is the only podcast dedicated to Buchla systems. As you can imagine, Kyle himself is pretty dedicated to Buchla instruments as well. In our chat, we talk about his entry into modulars (from guitaristics), how he selected Buchla as his muse, and how he deals with the \'wandering eye\' of gear lust. We also talk about how he integrates his songwriting skills from the past into his modular music realities of today. It\'s a pretty fascinating view into music making, and it really inspired me to sharpen some of my approaches. You can check out Kyle\'s music at his Bandcamp site (https://darksparkler.bandcamp.com/), and check out the Source of Uncertainty podcast at its locale (https://sourceofuncertainty.podbean.com/). Enjoy! | Ashley Bellouin\'s Ballads album is a revelation. On one hand, you could call it a drone release, but it\'s not quite that. You could call it electronic, or acoustic, or just plain alien and you\'d be right, but not quite. It\'s the best of long-form music: subtly shifting, a dance with the collaborators and instruments, and a curiosity for the ear. Ashley has been discussed in this podcast in the past - she often collaborates with Ben Bracken, and we talked a bit about her instruments in our interview with Ben. But we get into much more detail in this podcast - as well as the thinking and obsession behind the instruments. We also talk a bit about what how she processes interesting sounds into instruments, Max-based processes and location-specific performances. We did this interview in a beautiful farmhouse studio, surrounded by instruments, recording gear, vinyl and books. I\'ll have to tell you - it was by far my favorite location interview ever, but you\'ll be able to tell in was in-person by the natural reverb in the room (and the different recording rig I had to use because I was traveling). Enjoy, check out Ashley\'s work on Drawing Room Records and on her website:\xa0http://ashleybellouin.com/. And try to imagine what instruments you would build to get that sound from your head into the world... | I met a lot of great people at Cycling \'74\'s 2019 Expo. Perhaps the most memorable is this week\'s guest: Andrej Kobal. He wasn\'t really on my radar before that (despite getting a ping from some co-workers about his application), but I ran into him early during the "Science Fair" (demo) portion of the Expo. His corner of the room was constantly filled with people checking out his work, and I quickly understood why: it was an application (with optional iPad-based UI controller) that could make the simplest musical forms dance through a combination of processing, realtime mixing and control automation. It was immediately fun, and Andrej was really excited to share - and the moment was pretty exciting. I bought the software and have been integrating it into my performance system, but Andrej and I have kept in contact, and it\'s led to this interview. I\'m not sure if any previous chat has been as revealing about a person as this one: Andrej is really\xa0into music tech, exploration, working with other musicians as well as taking deep dives into his own work. He\'s inspiring to talk to, to be around - and I\'m sure to work with, too. Check out the software at granurise.com, and check out his videos on YouTube and Vimeo to learn more about the software - and his other work, too. And see if you can\'t embrace the enthusiasm that he has to bring some excitement into your world, too! Enjoy! | I think I\'ve seen the handle VICMOD bouncing around the internet forever. I\'ve also been listening to the music of Cray for a while, too. But only recently did I actually put 2 and 2 together to realize that this was the same person! I\'ve always like the Cray music for its breadth and honesty - it really sounded like a person\'s inner voice, rather than whatever a synth might naturally produce. And in talking with him, it is clear that this is his primary objective: heartfelt improvisation and sound design. From his earliest work with a janky 486 computer to his current obsession with Omnisphere (with Buchla, Serge and Eurorack in-between), Ross has exercised almost any machine you can imagine. The result is a person that is looking to be surprised by his environment - and is constantly searching for those surprises. After our chat, Ross was apparently spurred into digging into the archives, and has release the following for the listeners:  https://vicmodcray.bandcamp.com/album/geometric-patterns-made-of-love-and-understanding You can also check out the whole VICMOD label catalog here: http://www.vicmod.net/ And, as Ross himself says, check out his work on discogs.com to dig into more of his past: https://www.discogs.com/artist/621720-Ross-Healy Enjoy! | Named after the famous Philip K. Dick novel, Scanner Darkly is one of the most dedicated coders in the monome community. He got his start creating the Orca firmware for the monome modular devices, but really caught his stride working on updates to the Teletype - a coding module that features an exposed scripting environment. By adding a lot of new scripting functions (including a complete set of grid support tools), Scanner has made the Teletype a much more exciting for a lot of users. In our chat, Scanner Darkly talks about his background learning coding, his interaction with electronic music and computer, and the variety of opportunities that he is currently pursuing. One of the \'soon-to-release\' things includes some VCV rack work, so a lot more people will get to engage with his work. I think we all have something to look forward to enjoying! You can find Scanner\'s work all over the internet - if you search for Scanner Darkly, you\'ll see that he must have been one of the early people to get access to the name on the net; if a link isn\'t about Philip K. Dick, it\'s probably about him. Enjoy our talk, and if you get a chance, check out his work, or keep a close eye out for his upcoming releases on VCV rack and other platforms. Cheers! | If you spend much time around the Ableton video stash (https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/categories/videos/, you will have seen Ralf Kleinermanns\' work. He is the head of documentaries at Ableton, and he creates some of the most inspirational and motivating artists videos I\'ve ever seen. While it might seem like its a simple matter of finding the right artist and turning on the camera, Ralf talks about the process of choosing an artist, putting together a plan and executing the shoot - as the starting point of the storytelling process. Ralf\'s background really set him up for this gig, too. As a writer in the MI industry, he got a chance to meet a lot of artists, and a lot of the players in the MI industry. As a photographer, he really learn about image and visual composition. And as a student of recording science, he found out he didn\'t really like being a recording engineer! All good educations, and it led to Ralf becoming the artist that he is. Enjoy the interview, and learn more about Ralf\'s work at the Ableton link above, or at his personal website (http://www.ralfkleinermanns.de/). And if you happen to come across one of his Wizoo books in a thrift shop, let me know - it\'s the kind of thing I love collecting. Cheers! | I got a ping from a couple of people about reaching out to Thor Magnusson - and I did a little research. I really liked what I saw: a recent author (of Sonic Writing: Technologies of Material), an avid live coder and dedicate researcher, so I figured he was in my wheelhouse. Then I bought the book and read some of it, and I caught his Ars Electronica performance (https://youtu.be/KhL-JxI0KV0) and was sure of it. Reached out, positive response - and here\'s the podcast! Talking with Thor was wonderful, and he immediately caught my attention by framing music in a psychological position - something I\'d never thought of. From there, we went for quite a stroll, and I came out of it both excited by live coding as an experience, and music as a practices. I love it when an interview can make me feel that way! You should check out the above performance (make sure you check out the graphic display of the work...), learn more about his book at\xa0http://www.sonicwriting.org/, ixi software at\xa0http://ixi-audio.net/thor/\xa0and his github account here:\xa0https://github.com/thormagnusson And enjoy! | Bruce Dawson came on my radar recently for a really interesting project: he is one of the two instructors for the Kadenze course on creating audio applications using the JUCE framework. He got that opportunity by being a C++ developer with one of my favorite sound and plug-in developers, Output. So I reached out, he was into it, and here\'s the podcast! This is also another opportunity to quiz someone on their CalArts experience. There are so many people throughout the industry that have gone through CalArts programs to do great things, so I consider it a great chance to talk someone from there. And Bruce\'s path into CalArts is pretty remarkable as well. A great story, and some good insights into code-work-play-music balance, as well as giving us a chance to think about the details necessary to do the kind of work Output is known for. Enjoy, check out some of Bruce\'s Soundcloud work (https://soundcloud.com/synchronometry) and put some eyes on that Kadenze course (https://www.kadenze.com/courses/advanced-audio-plugin-development/info) Cheers! | Every time I talk to someone from Berklee, I\'m blown away by their enthusiasm, focus and breadth of experience. This week\'s guest, Loudon Stearns, is no exception. From rock operas to online classes, Loudon has his fingers into just about every piece of the musical pie. I was very happy to meet him at the recent Cycling \'74 Expo, and to have a chance to interview him for the podcast. We get a chance to talk about the challenges of teaching at Berklee - as well as being a student. We also talk about the variety of work that he\'s done, and how he approaches the oddities that one runs into with any work of significance. And we talk about his background, which is just damned impressive. Enjoy the chat, check out his work at Berklee (https://www.berklee.edu/people/loudon-stearns) and especially his Berklee Online courses (https://online.berklee.edu/brands/ableton-live). And I challenge you to listen to this interview and not want to learn more about what you do! Cheers! | Christopher Reid Martin is at the center of a lot of artistic worlds. Through his involvement with Coaxial Arts (http://coaxialarts.org/), he is deeply tied into the experimental art world in LA. He\'s also been recording with a variety of groups over the years, and has also been working with Max (and is currently working at Cycling \'74). I wanted to get a chance to talk with Christopher, and to find out how he molds all of these different things into a cohesive whole. The answer is complex, but it seems to be connected to a love of all arts - and particularly the place when multiple media come together. This is clearly why he was drawn to Coaxial, Max and a lot of other stuff that he is into. In our chat, we talked about Coaxial - how it got started, how it operates and how he is involved. We also talk about his musical exploits, including Shelter Death, and the broad variety of other projects that are either on-going or on-hiatus.

It was the #4 show in the Nielsen ratings in its first year, and #3 for the next three years. It was one of the few television shows to spawn a successful radio version. The radio series debuted on November 23, 1958. The show followed the adventures of Paladin, a gentleman-turned-gunfighter played by John Dehner on radio, who preferred to settle problems without violence, yet, when forced to fight, excelled. Paladin lived in the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, where he dressed in semi-formal wear, ate gourmet food, and attended opera. In fact, many who initially met him mistook him for a dandy from the East. When working, he dressed in black, used calling cards and wore a holster which carried characteristic chess knight emblems, and carried a derringer under his belt. The knight symbol is of course in reference to his name — possibly a nickname or working name — and his occupation as a champion-for-hire. The theme song of the series refers to him as “a knight without armor.” In addition, Paladin drew a parallel between his methods and the chess piece’s movement: “It’s a chess piece, the most versatile on the board. It can move in eight different directions, over obstacles, and it’s always unexpected.” Paladin was a former Army officer and a graduate of West Point. He was a polyglot, capable of speaking any foreign tongue required by the plot. He also had a thorough knowledge of ancient history and classical literature, and he exhibited a strong passion for legal principles and the rule of law.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts/v4/b7/ca/50/b7ca5027-4b1f-ce0f-3e45-ce2c11744c0a/mza_8061097963409174490.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2009-10-29'}}

Love Fame Tragedy joins us in-studio to play some of these tunes.\xa0Watch the session here:\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | New York’s top-notch and prolific classical six-piece\xa0group yMusic "serves as a ready-made collaborative unit for bands and songwriters, and has lent its distinctive sound to dozens of albums, most recently In The Blue Light by Paul Simon" (yMusic\'s Bandcamp.) They\'ve played with the likes of Simon, Bruce Hornsby, Regina Spektor, Ben Folds, and English indie\xa0folk trio\xa0The Staves. Their most recent recording is\xa0of music by Marcos Balter, "...which enables us to fly",\xa0a multimedia work,\xa0in collaboration with choreographers Bill T.

Part Dylan, part Dalí, Devendra Banhart’s so-called psych-folk, (or “freak folk”) comes with what might be fantastical or surreal lyrics rooted in voice and guitar -and humble appeals to help Venezuela- the country of his mother. In fact, in naming his latest record, Ma, he addresses “the unconditional nature of maternal love, the desire to nurture, the passing down of wisdom, the longing to establish the relationship of mother to child, and the consequences of that bond being broken.” (Nonesuch Records) He also embraces “Ma”\xa0(間) as a Japanese word which might be translated as "the silence between the notes which make the music” or an “emptiness full of possibilities.” Devendra Banhart joins us to play music from Ma, in-studio. - Caryn HavlikWatch the session here:\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Seratones is a band from Shreveport, Louisiana, who combines strutting groove, fuzzed-out slinky guitars, grounded tremolo organ, lush strings – and soaring over it all, frontperson AJ Haynes’s powerful singing voice, first honed at Brownsville Baptist Church in Columbia, Louisiana. This is music to sear earholes and "replenish your faith in the power of Rock & Roll" (Seratones\' Bandcamp.)\xa0It’s electrifying Southern rock where punk rawness meets soul power, topped with a bit of blues swagger. Seratones plays music from their latest, Power, in-studio. - Caryn HavlikWatch the session here:\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys is also a composer, producer, filmmaker and author. Recently, while recording the track “Vessels” for\xa0Damon Albarn’s world music collective\xa0Africa Express, he met South African electronic producer\xa0Muzi. They have since collaborated on a futuristic Welsh Language pop album, with a couple of verses of Zulu and an English title, Pang! (also partly inspired by Gruff’s visit to Prince’s Paisley Park studio\xa0and the gloss of Prince\'s Around the World in a Day.) Gruff Rhys and drummer Kliph Scurlock play some of this day-glo\xa0processed Welsh pop in-studio. - Caryn HavlikWatch the session here: \xa0 \xa0 | Danish outfit Mames Babegenush cooks up a Nordic-Jewish-Balkan musical stew both manic and melancholy. Their tunes embrace the ambience of Nordic snowscapes\xa0as well as the lively weddings of Romania, all the while incorporating the vibrant dance music and klezmer traditions of eastern Europe. Since their formation some 15 years ago, the group has performed everything from electronic music to string quartets to opera. Mames Babegenush brings their rich blend of Balkan-Klezmer Jazz for dancing to the studio. - Caryn HavlikWatch the session here:\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | The Icelandic duo Hugar is multi-instrumentalists Bergur Þórisson & Pétur Jónsson, who sculpt\xa0dreamlike layered soundscapes using keyboards, guitar, and electronics. Occasionally they’ll include other chamber players, including one Ólafur Arnalds. Sometimes the music is an attempt to “put our everyday experiences into sounds” – like “walking to school in a snow blizzard and riding your bike in the calm midnight sun” (Sony Masterworks). Their latest record is\xa0Varða,\xa0which translates to “cairn” in English. Hugar joins us in-studio to perform some of their music. - Caryn Havlik\xa0Watch the session here:\xa0 \xa0 | Drummer and composer Marcus Gilmore looks to the creative openness of his drum elders – like his grandfather, Roy Haynes, tabla master Zakir Hussain, or renaissance man and drummer Milford Graves - and underscores the drum set as melodic instrument – exploiting all of the potential of the components – bending notes, playing with the natural vibrations, or augmenting his set up with Sunhouse Sensory Percussion. (With thanks to Modern Drummer Magazine’s June 2019 issue.) He joins us in-studio to amaze and delight with his percussive sorcery. – Caryn HavlikWatch the session here: \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | From pop and hiphop to love anthems, Grammy-nominated songwriter Skylar Grey has multiple hits to her credit.

After his death in 1965 Margaretha Infeld took over the company together with her son Peter Infeld. Under the guidance of Margaretha Infeld the company not only found its present-day base in the Diehlgasse, but also became the leading supplier of strings for stringed instruments. Margaretha Infeld played an active role in the company until 1994 when her son Peter Infeld took over the sole management of the company. He led it according to family traditions up to his unexpected death in April 2009. The time after 1950 was marked by a growth of the company. The unrivalled striving of the founders for the highest quality formed the basis for that crucial innovation which was the starting point for the success of Thomastik-Infeld. Right up to the present day this innovation has significantly contributed to the company’s success: a string with synthetic core and flat wire winding. This product – the Dominant string – is probably the most-played violin string worldwide. Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman had already adopted this string innovation when they were unknown violin students. Later both became soloists of world rank. Currently, Thomastik-Infeld and its almost 200 employees produce more than 2,000 various strings for stringed and plucked instruments in the very heart of Vienna, the City of Music. 97 % of the yearly produced units are exported to more than 80 countries all over the world. A strong international focus and the continuing enlargement of business relations remain an essential component of the strategy of Thomastik-Infeld. www.brettybang.com www.instagram.com/brettybang www.facebook.com/brettybang SNAPCHAT: Brettybang | “A truly exceptional talent” (Benoît Duteurtre), “exciting, exact and subtle” (Neue Württembergische Zeitung), “confident” (The Independent), and “elegant” (The Times), violinist Daniel Garlitsky possesses “an exceptional and pure sound” (Ouest France), “incredible precision and character” (Dr K.
