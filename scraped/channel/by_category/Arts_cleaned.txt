Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US.

In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line.

"Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds.

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\xa0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law. We call it Trump Con Law for short.After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on Apple Podcasts and RadioPublic | Everything in Bethel, Alaska comes in by cargo plane or barge, and even when something stops working, it’s often too expensive and too inconvenient to get it out again.

And it turns out that design can completely change whether a five minute wait feels reasonable or completely unbearable. Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing.

As a reminder that discussion about utopias - and the failures and successes inherent in them - is an ongoing one. | What have all of the utopias we've covered so far had in common? They were all largely driven by the will and power of a charismatic leader - usually a man, usually white. How do you build a utopia, then, for people in society who really need it?

Inside the dome, there was a man-made savannah. A rainforest. A farm. An ocean with tropical coral reef. And all of these habitats would be populated with life. Things did not go according to plan. But was it a failure? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | In 1938, Hitler’s chief architect Albert Speer started redesigning Berlin for a New Order, elements of which exist today. The Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin features designs that specifically evoke the Third Reich. Following the end of World War II, the airport became a crucial access point for the US and British to bring food through the Berlin Blockade. It was closed in 2008, and then became a park, and emergency refugee housing. But the buildings remain. What do we do with the everyday reminders of a dark history? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | The Oneida Community was founded in upstate New York in 1848 by John Humphrey Noyes, a former theological student who believed that paradise could be found on Earth through nontraditional sexual and familial structures, including complex marriages and communal childraising. Hundreds of people followed him, and for many years their community succeeded. But the center could not hold, and the community pivoted — into a thriving business that became one of the world’s most prominent makers of flatware. \xa0 | Suburban developments built in the 1950s were idyllic communities and gave many people their first opportunity at home ownership, but typically excluded African Americans. While William Levitt used explicit racial covenants and other tactics to keep his famed Levittown developments white, one builder used racial quotas to create an integrated community — and succeeded, for a while. Can the suburbs be a utopia for all? | Following the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru commissioned famed architect Le Corbusier to design the city of Chandigarh, to signal India’s rise on the world stage. But the city’s architecture and design has become known more for its Western modernist roots, and less as a symbol of Indian nationalism, and furniture that had been intended for the masses are now being auctioned off as high art pieces that wind up in Kourtney Kardashian’s dining room. | Most people today know the story of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in America, from the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, and especially from the 1995 Disney animated film. A gripping recounting of the true story of how the settlement failed and recovered, and the toll it took on the English and Native Americans, shows how failure can be a transformative experience, and also how the stories we tell ourselves about the failures inform the way we live today.

She gives us brilliant tips for looking and feeling instantly more energized (her two-tone blush trick is life-changing), how to look and feel as vibrant as she does at sixty-two, and why she looks in the mirror rarely, sprinkles salt in her drinking water, and eschews foundation. (We also hear about building a billion-dollar brand, authoring eight books, raising happy kids, and maintaining a happy marriage—the woman is more than miraculous.) We found ourselves scrambling to take notes, and you will, too.

She’s also one of the most glamorous people we know. She talked to us about her path from girl growing up in Colombia to self-possessed founder of an enormously successful company. Her strategies—for keeping your skin in beautiful shape no matter what your age, for scheduling asa powerful form of self-care (the woman never procrastinates, believe it or not), and for balancing work and life so they always make you happy—are life-changing. You’ll also find out what goes into a superserum that costs $450, why Harper believes all-natural is the way to go, and why (if you needed more reasons) you should make the shift to clean beauty.\xa0 (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | As perfumer Douglas Little creates sexy, moody, wildly original, stunningly gorgeous scents, he’s changing the toxic fragrance industry. In this episode, he talks about the sexiness inherent in natural materials, what it’s like to make perfume with GP for goop, why his line of perfumes is called Heretic, why the link between sexuality and scent is so powerful, the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of using botanicals instead of synthetic chemicals, and what Flower Porn is all about. From his childhood fascination with the dirt and (sometimes poisonous) plants in the garden and his career in the wild world of luxury perfumes to some shocking things about fragrance—like why it’s one of the most toxic categories in the entire beauty industry and what it is about conventional scents that gives people headaches—Little’s story is absolutely fascinating. He’s so smart and has such a beautiful imagination—who knew that clean perfume could be as sexy and cool as he’s managed to make it? (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Even if you’d never wear bright-red lipstick, bestselling author Rachel Felder’s take on it is brilliant, funny, original, and wildly entertaining. She shares a ton of incredible tips and answers questions we didn’t know we even had: What to do about lipstick when a hookup gets super-steamy? What’s the perfect shade for your skin? What’s the psychology involved in wearing—or even just seeing—red lipstick? Matte or glossy? Do people respond differently to women wearing lipstick? What’s the ultimate way to apply it? Felder is charming, a master storyteller, and full of quirky personal anecdotes that will stick with you long after you’re done listening to our conversation. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | What’s the difference between Botox and fillers? Can cutting out dairy actually help with acne? Which lasers work best for darker skin types? Is there a fix for dark circles? When you just want to look a little fresher, less broken-out, a little less tired, but above all, like yourself, you go to top NYC dermatologist Robert Anolik. He makes you look better, not done. We could have asked Dr. Anolik questions all day—and he could’ve kept answering them, as he seems to know everything on earth about skin. There are so many ways to treat both the face and the body now, and he takes us through which treatments and procedures really work, how to look your best as you age, strategies to cope with acne, and what can be done for everything from undereye bags or a pooch-y stomach to sun damage and wrinkles. He’s smart, he’s funny, and this episode will arm you with precisely what you need to know before you step into the dermatologist’s office (and help you figure out whether you should go in the first place). (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Before Rosemarie Swift was a famous makeup artist for supermodels like Gisele, and before she founded one of the most successful and luxurious clean beauty brands ever, RMS Beauty, she got terribly sick. Her body, overloaded with heavy metals from the conventional makeup she worked with every day, was in serious trouble. Uncovering why and how the toxins in beauty products were affecting her health changed her whole life—diet, lifestyle, and eventually, her career. Swift translated rage into action, creating one the most beautiful natural makeup lines on the planet. Her story is inspiring for sure, but also , shocking, and funny: Swift tells it like it is, no matter what she’s talking about, whether it’s getting her start in a Vancouver strip club, or how she thinks the coconut-oil industry is like the cocaine industry (every one of her gorgeous products is made with the purest coconut oil). The bonus: Her easy but brilliant makeup tips. You’ll learn everything about how to do the prettiest, most natural-looking no-makeup makeup for glowy, healthy-looking skin. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Can a thread lift really replace a face-lift? Are there little tweaks that can refresh your appearance without looking overdone? How and why do different skin tones age differently? What is it we’re registering when someone looks “off”—and what has that come to signify in our culture? We had endless questions for world-famous plastic surgeon Julius Few, and he blew us away with his knowledge, candor, and truly surprising ideas and techniques. In this episode, he talks about the fourth dimension (in terms of beauty), how he stacks less-invasive treatments in place of full-on surgery, and why too much filler can actually make someone look older—plus, he gives incredible tips on how to keep your face and body looking their best long-term. No matter how you feel about plastic surgery, this is a wildly fascinating conversation.(For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | From her first job as an assistant at a hair salon in Australia to her current role as CEO of KORA Organics (a goop favorite), female founder and former supermodel Miranda Kerr talks about all that her amazing career has taught her. Her path to founding one of the most successful skin-care companies in the clean beauty space involved a lot of surprises. After burning out as a world-famous Victoria’s Secret Angel, she woke up to the facts about the toxic ingredients in conventional beauty products—and went to work on the problem as an entrepreneur. And her roles as wife, mother, and daughter bring up issues we can all relate to and, we found, get super inspired by. We love her brilliant ideas on work-life balance, why she prioritizes date nights with her husband, and her (really good) makeup and skin tips that she’s learned on shoots all over the world. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.)hub.) | Nneka Leiba, the vice president of healthy living science at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), talks about clean, nontoxic beauty and the shocking truth behind the largely unregulated beauty and personal-care industry. Leiba and her team assess the health effects of chemical exposure from day-to-day products—and what she tells us is both grim and galvanizing. A few of the topics we go into: why black girls go through puberty much earlier than girls of other races, the most important beauty product to go clean with, why spray sunscreen is a real problem, and much more. If you’ve ever remotely considered going clean with your beauty routine, if you’ve ever wondered why companies would use known toxic ingredients in their products, or if you just want to understand the facts around this issue, this episode is really going to make you think. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | In the premiere episode of goop’s new podcast, The Beauty Closet, hosts Jean Godfrey-June and Megan O’Neill sit down with their boss, goop founder and CEO Gwyneth Paltrow, and really talk. In between discussions about being, in GP’s words, “f*ckable,” nontoxic beauty, the role diversity plays at goop HQ, crow’s-feet, the weird workings of fame on the sense of self, and the upgrade we all get around age forty, GP gives up her best skin, hair, and makeup tips, including what she did to get her wedding-day glow.
