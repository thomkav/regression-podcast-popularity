Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US.

In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we\'re a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line.

"Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors." | Tobacco causes more than seven million deaths every year -- and many of us are far more complicit in the problem than we realize. In a bold talk, oncologist Dr. Bronwyn King tells the story of how she uncovered the deep ties between the tobacco industry and the entire global finance sector, which invests our money in cigarette companies through big banks, insurers and pension funds.

Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC\xa0 Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law. We call it Trump Con Law for short.After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on Apple Podcasts and RadioPublic | Everything in Bethel, Alaska comes in by cargo plane or barge, and even when something stops working, it’s often too expensive and too inconvenient to get it out again.

And it turns out that design can completely change whether a five minute wait feels reasonable or completely unbearable. Transparency is key.Wait Wait...Tell Me! | Before we turned our phones to silent or vibrate, there was a time when everyone had ringtones -- when the song your phone played really said something about you. These simple, 15 second melodies were disposable, yet highly personal trinkets. They started with monophonic bleeps and bloops and eventually became actual clips of real songs. And it was all thanks to a man named Vesku-Matti Paananen. All Rings Considered | There are many walls in Belfast which physically separate Protestant neighborhoods from Catholic ones. Some are fences that you can see through, while others are made of bricks and steel. Many have clearly been reinforced over time: a cinderblock wall topped with corrugated iron, then topped with razor wire, stretching up towards the sky.\xa0Many of the walls in Northern Ireland went up in the 1970s and ‘80s at the height of what’s become known as “The Troubles.” Decades later, almost all of the walls remain standing.

As a reminder that discussion about utopias - and the failures and successes inherent in them - is an ongoing one. | What have all of the utopias we've covered so far had in common? They were all largely driven by the will and power of a charismatic leader - usually a man, usually white. How do you build a utopia, then, for people in society who really need it?

Inside the dome, there was a man-made savannah. A rainforest. A farm. An ocean with tropical coral reef. And all of these habitats would be populated with life. Things did not go according to plan. But was it a failure? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | In 1938, Hitler’s chief architect Albert Speer started redesigning Berlin for a New Order, elements of which exist today. The Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin features designs that specifically evoke the Third Reich. Following the end of World War II, the airport became a crucial access point for the US and British to bring food through the Berlin Blockade. It was closed in 2008, and then became a park, and emergency refugee housing. But the buildings remain. What do we do with the everyday reminders of a dark history? EDITOR'S NOTE: one instance of explicit language. | The Oneida Community was founded in upstate New York in 1848 by John Humphrey Noyes, a former theological student who believed that paradise could be found on Earth through nontraditional sexual and familial structures, including complex marriages and communal childraising. Hundreds of people followed him, and for many years their community succeeded. But the center could not hold, and the community pivoted — into a thriving business that became one of the world’s most prominent makers of flatware. \xa0 | Suburban developments built in the 1950s were idyllic communities and gave many people their first opportunity at home ownership, but typically excluded African Americans. While William Levitt used explicit racial covenants and other tactics to keep his famed Levittown developments white, one builder used racial quotas to create an integrated community — and succeeded, for a while. Can the suburbs be a utopia for all? | Following the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru commissioned famed architect Le Corbusier to design the city of Chandigarh, to signal India’s rise on the world stage. But the city’s architecture and design has become known more for its Western modernist roots, and less as a symbol of Indian nationalism, and furniture that had been intended for the masses are now being auctioned off as high art pieces that wind up in Kourtney Kardashian’s dining room. | Most people today know the story of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in America, from the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, and especially from the 1995 Disney animated film. A gripping recounting of the true story of how the settlement failed and recovered, and the toll it took on the English and Native Americans, shows how failure can be a transformative experience, and also how the stories we tell ourselves about the failures inform the way we live today.

She gives us brilliant tips for looking and feeling instantly more energized (her two-tone blush trick is life-changing), how to look and feel as vibrant as she does at sixty-two, and why she looks in the mirror rarely, sprinkles salt in her drinking water, and eschews foundation. (We also hear about building a billion-dollar brand, authoring eight books, raising happy kids, and maintaining a happy marriage—the woman is more than miraculous.) We found ourselves scrambling to take notes, and you will, too.

She’s also one of the most glamorous people we know. She talked to us about her path from girl growing up in Colombia to self-possessed founder of an enormously successful company. Her strategies—for keeping your skin in beautiful shape no matter what your age, for scheduling asa powerful form of self-care (the woman never procrastinates, believe it or not), and for balancing work and life so they always make you happy—are life-changing. You’ll also find out what goes into a superserum that costs $450, why Harper believes all-natural is the way to go, and why (if you needed more reasons) you should make the shift to clean beauty.\xa0 (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | As perfumer Douglas Little creates sexy, moody, wildly original, stunningly gorgeous scents, he’s changing the toxic fragrance industry. In this episode, he talks about the sexiness inherent in natural materials, what it’s like to make perfume with GP for goop, why his line of perfumes is called Heretic, why the link between sexuality and scent is so powerful, the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of using botanicals instead of synthetic chemicals, and what Flower Porn is all about. From his childhood fascination with the dirt and (sometimes poisonous) plants in the garden and his career in the wild world of luxury perfumes to some shocking things about fragrance—like why it’s one of the most toxic categories in the entire beauty industry and what it is about conventional scents that gives people headaches—Little’s story is absolutely fascinating. He’s so smart and has such a beautiful imagination—who knew that clean perfume could be as sexy and cool as he’s managed to make it? (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Even if you’d never wear bright-red lipstick, bestselling author Rachel Felder’s take on it is brilliant, funny, original, and wildly entertaining. She shares a ton of incredible tips and answers questions we didn’t know we even had: What to do about lipstick when a hookup gets super-steamy? What’s the perfect shade for your skin? What’s the psychology involved in wearing—or even just seeing—red lipstick? Matte or glossy? Do people respond differently to women wearing lipstick? What’s the ultimate way to apply it? Felder is charming, a master storyteller, and full of quirky personal anecdotes that will stick with you long after you’re done listening to our conversation. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | What’s the difference between Botox and fillers? Can cutting out dairy actually help with acne? Which lasers work best for darker skin types? Is there a fix for dark circles? When you just want to look a little fresher, less broken-out, a little less tired, but above all, like yourself, you go to top NYC dermatologist Robert Anolik. He makes you look better, not done. We could have asked Dr. Anolik questions all day—and he could’ve kept answering them, as he seems to know everything on earth about skin. There are so many ways to treat both the face and the body now, and he takes us through which treatments and procedures really work, how to look your best as you age, strategies to cope with acne, and what can be done for everything from undereye bags or a pooch-y stomach to sun damage and wrinkles. He’s smart, he’s funny, and this episode will arm you with precisely what you need to know before you step into the dermatologist’s office (and help you figure out whether you should go in the first place). (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Before Rosemarie Swift was a famous makeup artist for supermodels like Gisele, and before she founded one of the most successful and luxurious clean beauty brands ever, RMS Beauty, she got terribly sick. Her body, overloaded with heavy metals from the conventional makeup she worked with every day, was in serious trouble. Uncovering why and how the toxins in beauty products were affecting her health changed her whole life—diet, lifestyle, and eventually, her career. Swift translated rage into action, creating one the most beautiful natural makeup lines on the planet. Her story is inspiring for sure, but also , shocking, and funny: Swift tells it like it is, no matter what she’s talking about, whether it’s getting her start in a Vancouver strip club, or how she thinks the coconut-oil industry is like the cocaine industry (every one of her gorgeous products is made with the purest coconut oil). The bonus: Her easy but brilliant makeup tips. You’ll learn everything about how to do the prettiest, most natural-looking no-makeup makeup for glowy, healthy-looking skin. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | Can a thread lift really replace a face-lift? Are there little tweaks that can refresh your appearance without looking overdone? How and why do different skin tones age differently? What is it we’re registering when someone looks “off”—and what has that come to signify in our culture? We had endless questions for world-famous plastic surgeon Julius Few, and he blew us away with his knowledge, candor, and truly surprising ideas and techniques. In this episode, he talks about the fourth dimension (in terms of beauty), how he stacks less-invasive treatments in place of full-on surgery, and why too much filler can actually make someone look older—plus, he gives incredible tips on how to keep your face and body looking their best long-term. No matter how you feel about plastic surgery, this is a wildly fascinating conversation.(For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | From her first job as an assistant at a hair salon in Australia to her current role as CEO of KORA Organics (a goop favorite), female founder and former supermodel Miranda Kerr talks about all that her amazing career has taught her. Her path to founding one of the most successful skin-care companies in the clean beauty space involved a lot of surprises. After burning out as a world-famous Victoria’s Secret Angel, she woke up to the facts about the toxic ingredients in conventional beauty products—and went to work on the problem as an entrepreneur. And her roles as wife, mother, and daughter bring up issues we can all relate to and, we found, get super inspired by. We love her brilliant ideas on work-life balance, why she prioritizes date nights with her husband, and her (really good) makeup and skin tips that she’s learned on shoots all over the world. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.)hub.) | Nneka Leiba, the vice president of healthy living science at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), talks about clean, nontoxic beauty and the shocking truth behind the largely unregulated beauty and personal-care industry. Leiba and her team assess the health effects of chemical exposure from day-to-day products—and what she tells us is both grim and galvanizing. A few of the topics we go into: why black girls go through puberty much earlier than girls of other races, the most important beauty product to go clean with, why spray sunscreen is a real problem, and much more. If you’ve ever remotely considered going clean with your beauty routine, if you’ve ever wondered why companies would use known toxic ingredients in their products, or if you just want to understand the facts around this issue, this episode is really going to make you think. (For more, see The Beauty Closet hub.) | In the premiere episode of goop’s new podcast, The Beauty Closet, hosts Jean Godfrey-June and Megan O’Neill sit down with their boss, goop founder and CEO Gwyneth Paltrow, and really talk. In between discussions about being, in GP’s words, “f*ckable,” nontoxic beauty, the role diversity plays at goop HQ, crow’s-feet, the weird workings of fame on the sense of self, and the upgrade we all get around age forty, GP gives up her best skin, hair, and makeup tips, including what she did to get her wedding-day glow.

Some are digital, some are old school, but the most important part is that they help to keep us on the same page (sometimes literally) about our projects, purchases, and more. We’re also sharing the near completion of a long overdue outdoor update that almost sent one of us over the edge... of the roof. Also, could it be true that some people don’t have a de facto “side of the bed” every night? WHAT?! We have questions.\xa0  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-148/ for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | What happens when you move into a smaller house in a smaller town for over two months? That’s what we found out this summer when we stayed at our beach house to manage the duplex rentals - AND IT WAS THE BEST SUMMER OF OUR LIVES. The smaller home and smaller town lessons that we learned really stuck with us when we returned home - and they have already inspired us to make 4 changes to our life and habits back in Richmond. So even if you aren\'t planning to move or downsize, there are some things you could experiment with too. We’re also sharing why we’re fiiiiiinally starting a long-awaited renovation in our house, and one way we\'re kicking a bad habit to the curb and saving over $500 a year (and creating less waste). Plus Sherry goes on the record with her predictions for the 2020 colors of the year.  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-147/ for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | We survived our first summer as Airbnb hosts to 23 different families over the course of the last three months - and, more importantly, so did the duplex itself! But our first rental season wasn’t without hiccups, high anxiety moments, and surprisingly frequent learning opportunities. So this week we’re taking you behind the scenes of a jam-packed few months of learning the hospitality ropes while juggling guests and (more literally) a very full jug of laundry detergent. Sherry also celebrates the end of a very long “personal renovation” and we share how something simple led us to rethink our approach to cooking dinner.\xa0  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-146 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | This week we’re diving into a survey that reveals the top homebuyer regrets - as in what features their homes have that they ended up not loving (and the results may surprise you!). \xa0A new study also concluded some shocking-to-us things about millennial dads versus their baby boomer counterparts - and we have some big feelings about one aspect of the results. We’re also sharing a crappy situation (literally) at our beach houses, and the weird measures we’re taking to resolve it. Plus, more design norms from around the world and our picks for summer entertainment.  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-145 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | We recently made two big changes to our shopping habits that are having both positive and negative repercussions. So we’re sharing what we did, why we did it, and how we’re trying to course correct a few pitfalls that popped up. We also got a refreshing reminder that it’s liberating to acknowledge that you don’t have to be good at everything - especially in a social media world where everyone else seems to have it all figured out. Plus, we share a big hiccup that was narrowly avoided at the duplex, an organizational tool that we’ve fallen hard for, and Sherry’s deep feelings for a certain crunchy green snack.  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-144 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | After over a year and a half of renovation, the duplex officially hosted its first overnight guests!!! And it was an exciting, emotional, and eye-opening test of all the work that we’ve put into it. So we’re sharing what we learned and what we’re changing before it plays host again. We’re also talking about how a house that we considered buying last fall as a long-term rental popped back onto our radar with some surprising news. Plus, how we solved some household frustrations for under $25 - and Sherry rants about a certain paper product while John finds unusual joy in another one.  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-143 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | So it turns out there are some weird spots in the kitchen where germs go to party - so we’re learning more about that (and what you can do about it), as well as talking about why we gave up on those meal delivery kits and found a better solution for our family. We’re also talking about how shopping for your home can be fun, but it can also be frustrating and time-consuming. So we’re sharing our tips for how to streamline your hunt and pick things with confidence. Plus, you’ll hear how our backyard is finally winning the war against our hungry deer, and what new face thing Sherry is obsessed with now. \xa0  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-142 for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | Our recent Chicago meet-up with fellow bloggers Chris Loves Julia, Yellow Brick Home, and Making It Lovely left us with lots of feels (and very full stomachs). But it was seeing one of their homes in person that completely changed our minds about a "design rule" we had proclaimed for our own home (on this very podcast, no less). We’re also sharing what surprised us most about the final phase of getting our duplex ready to rent. Plus the results of Sherry’s latest staging assignment and a dynamic decor alternative to just hanging another picture frame.  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-141/ for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | Home improvement can be stressful, and we’re no strangers to that tension leading to some pretty memorable arguments. So today we’re looking at some data about what do-it-yourself projects cause the most issues between couples to see if we agree (and we share a recent fight we had in the name of data). We also reveal some takeaways from a recent house staging project that we took on together, including the big secret to getting your home ready to sell and how you may have to unlearn everything you know about decorating. Plus, John falls for another lighting product, Sherry ups her face game, and we see if people really do hate textured walls after all.  Be sure to check out younghouselove.com/podcast-140/ for notes, links, and photos from this episode. | Painting our brick house white was just the tip of our home’s exterior update iceberg, so this week we’re sharing more of our plans - including one that’s turning out to be much more complex than we expected. We’ve also got an exciting announcement about a color collaboration we’ve been working on and we\'re sharing more of everyone\'s favorite thing: design norms from around the world, including bomb shelters, frost lines, and… special windows that keep witches out of your house?! Plus we try a strange but awesome subscription box that makes us feel like we\'re on Law & Order.

We find out what it takes to ensure every one of our 488 stores gets the best produce we can find, from all around the world; we talk packaging, and steps we’re taking to reduce our produce packaging; and we’ll answer the burning question… what’s more popular, fruit or veggies?  Episode 16 Transcript (PDF) | In this episode, we’re tackling the questions YOU (our listeners) asked. From the pretty straightforward “How do you decide what to sell?” and “How do you know what your customers want?” to the more philosophical “Why don’t you have WiFi?” and “Why not sell your products online?” We collected your questions and gathered some super knowledgeable Crew Members to help us answer them. Tune in to find out, once and for all, why we don’t carry diapers, and why we do plan to keep introducing limited availability products. \xa0  Episode 15 Transcript (PDF) | We get a lot of questions here at Trader Joe\'s; perhaps surprisingly, by far the most common question has nothing to do with the things we sell or the locations of our stores. The question we get the most is, without a doubt, "Why is everyone so nice?" In this episode we take you inside Trader Joe\'s to find out the answer. Come with us to a Trader Joe\'s store in Chicago, and to a session of Trader Joe\'s University (yep, that\'s a thing). Join in on our chat with some of the people responsible for finding the great Crew Members you encounter in our stores. Discover some of our Crew\'s favorite TJ\'s products. It\'ll be nice. We promise. \xa0  Episode 14 Transcript (PDF) \xa0 | It\'s the episode where we talk about the abundant flowers and plants you\'ll find at your neighborhood Trader Joe\'s. We travel the world in search of the most beauteous blooms and festive flowers, and we bring them to you at prices that really define value. How on earth do we do it? Have a listen. Got a question you\'d really like to ask the folks who make things happen here at TJ\'s? Send it to us at podcastquestions@traderjoes.com. We\'ll use as many questions as we can in an upcoming episode of Inside Trader Joe\'s.  Episode 13 Transcript (PDF) | Come with us on a delicious journey through the freezer case at Trader Joe\'s. Hear how frozen foods can be fresher than the "fresh" foods; come along as we sample some of our Customers\' favorite frozen finds at a neighborhood Trader Joe\'s; find out about some new treats coming soon to a Trader Joe\'s near you. Along the way, we\'ll share some info about how long frozen food keeps in your freezer (a good long time, it turns out), and the very best way to prepare our much-loved Cauliflower Gnocchi. If you\'re a frozen foods fanatic, or even if you\'re more fickle about freezer fare, this episode of Inside Trader Joe\'s will leave you hungry for more. (Figuratively and literally, we hope) \xa0  Episode 12 Transcript (PDF) | Our approach to sustainability is simple. We all want to leave the planet a better place than we found it. At Trader Joe\'s, we\'re working hard to do just that, in part by reimagining how we approach packaging in our stores. We\'ve eliminated certain types of packaging, we\'re reducing other types of packaging, and we\'re taking steps to remove more than a million pounds of plastic over the next year alone! We\'re going to the store, to a recycling plant, and to a next-generation manufacturing facility dedicated to making a positive impact, one plastic bottle at a time. \xa0  Episode 11 Transcript (PDF) | At Trader Joe\'s, we are focused on growing, every day – with every product, in every store. We\'re opening new stores, hiring new Crew Members, meeting new Customers, and developing new products. Whew! In this episode, we talk about finding new store locations, we chat with customers at one of our original East Coast stores, and we look forward to some delicious new products coming to your neighborhood Trader Joe\'s in the year ahead. \xa0  Episode 10 Transcript (PDF) | When we say we travel the world in search of great products for our customers, we really mean it! In this episode, come along with us as we circumnavigate the globe, finding the WOW in locations around the world, from South Korea to Southern California, with stops in places like New Zealand, Thailand, the Republic of Georgia, Puerto Rico, and so many more! \xa0  Episode 9 Transcript (PDF) | It\'s beginning to look a lot like the holidays at Trader Joe\'s! How do we come up with all the great holiday products you\'ll find at Trader Joe\'s every year? How long does it take to make all that delicious stuff come to life? What\'s new this holiday season? And did you know Dog Advent Calendars are a thing? Come Inside Trader Joe\'s and we\'ll help you get into the holiday spirit. Ho Ho Ho ! \xa0  Episode 8 Transcript (PDF)', 'chan_desc': "From our humble beginnings as a small chain of eclectic Southern California convenience stores, Trader Joe’s has grown to become a national chain of 490 (and counting) neighborhood grocery stores, employing more than 43,000 Crew Members.

But the study of humans would be an incomplete one without the study of the clay and ceramic vessels, one of humankind’s earliest innovations.

So they followed those prophecies, and though it took a few hundred years, they made their way down the Saint Lawrence River and then into the Great Lakes region where they found wild rice.

But on a recent visit to California, writer and cook Jasmine Lee began to ask questions about this framing, inspired by an heirloom variety of rice with a beautiful name called, Kokuho Rose. Jasmine, who comes from a lineage of rice merchants in Hong Kong, wondered\xa0 whether it was possible to think about expressions of the land; ie, terroir, without thinking of about the history and politics of land use in the United States. If this heirloom rice is an expression of the land it was grown on, it is also an expression of the trauma and perseverance with the family who worked that land.\xa0Next, Chef BJ Dennis tells us about his move to St. Thomas in 2004, where he encountered black folks from around the West Indies. Upon learning he was from the lowcountry, they preceded to share stories and insight about the Gullah Geechee, a distinctive culture of the\xa0 descendants of West Africa’s rice coast. The experience changed the trajectory of BJ’s career, catalyzing his calling as a chef and scholar of the culture.\xa0 | All fruit come from flowers, but not all flowers become fruit.

Later, by the eighth century, the range used in Denmark was reduced to sixteen…." — George L. Campbell & Christopher Moseley, The Routledge Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets, 2012"Conveniently, one of the Americans … is an anthropology student studying Scandinavian rituals. His in-depth questions provide context for viewers not steeped in Nordic lore, but it\'s still not always clear what he\'s talking about. For instance, looking over a rune carving …, he guesses \'Younger Futhark?\' only to be told no, \'Elder.\'" — Danielle Burgos, Bustle, 3 July 2019Did you know?The word futhark refers to a writing system used by Germanic peoples, and especially by the Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons, from about the third to the 13th centuries. Its origin is unclear, but a likely theory is that it was developed by the Goths from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy, with perhaps some aspects being influenced by the Latin alphabet of the first and second centuries. The word futhark itself comes from the sounds of the first six letters used in the earliest of the main runic script varieties: f, u, th, a, r, k. While eventually fully displaced by the Latin alphabet, futhark was still used occasionally for charms and memorial inscriptions in Scandinavia into the 16th and 17th centuries. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 3, 2019 is:pursy • \\PER-see\\\xa0 • adjective1 : having a puckered appearance2 : proud because of one\'s wealth especially in the absence of other distinctions : purse-proudExamples:"There was a picture of a pale gent with a narrow face and a woman with dark eyes and a pursy mouth." — Stephen King, Misery, 1987"Some guys get all pursy around the mouth when you suggest this, but figure skating is infinitely harder than ice hockey. Every four years at the Winter Olympics, figure skating fans have to listen to a lot of nonsense about how their sport lacks legitimacy." — Sally Jenkins, The Washington Post, 13 Feb. 2014Did you know?There are two adjectives spelled pursy, each with its own etymology. The one describing a puckered appearance goes back to the mid-16th century and has its source in the noun purse ("a receptacle for carrying money and other small objects"); a drawstring purse\'s puckered appearance is the inspiration. The other pursy (pronounced PUH-see or PER-see) dates from the 15th century and can mean "short-winded especially because of corpulence" or simply "fat." This pursy comes from the Old French word pousser, meaning "to exert pressure" or "to breathe heavily"—the same word, etymologists believe, behind the word push. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 2, 2019 is:sawbones • \\SAW-bohnz\\\xa0 • nounslang : physician, surgeonExamples:"After abandoning his destitute family in 1913, Brinkley bought a medical degree from a \'diploma mill\' in St. Louis. An itinerant preacher assured him that he did not have to be a bona fide sawbones to cure the ills of the world." — Bartee Haile, The Courier (Montgomery County, Texas), 19 Jan. 2018"Anyway, his relatives … reminded him that it\'s hard to shine shoes without a heartbeat. So he went back to his sawbones\xa0to talk about the pacemaker." — Phil Luciano, The Journal Star (Peoria, Illinois), 28 Oct. 2017Did you know?Sawbones cut its first literary tooth in Charles Dickens\'s 1837 novel The Pickwick Papers, when Sam Weller says to Mr. Pickwick, "Don\'t you know what a sawbones is, sir? … I thought everybody know\'d as a sawbones was a surgeon." An evocative term that calls to mind the saws that 19th-century surgeons used to perform amputations, sawbones quickly became an established member of the English language, employed by such authors as H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Mercifully, medical technology has improved dramatically since then (the surgical saws used in procedures today are a far cry from the primitive tools of yesteryear), but the word sawbones is still used, often in a humorous context. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for October 1, 2019 is:mitigate • \\MIT-uh-gayt\\\xa0 • verb1 : to cause to become less harsh or hostile : mollify2 a : to make less severe or painful : alleviateb : to lessen the seriousness of : extenuateExamples:"Although Apple Hill receives the bulk of their visitors in October, most of its ranches and wineries are open from mid-August through December.… Last year, October traffic was mitigated by a grant-funded pilot program that brought a shuttle to Apple Hill." — Dylan Svoboda, The Mountain Democrat (Placerville, California), 14 Aug. 2019"More important than treating migraines once they come on is avoiding episodes to begin with, says Diamond. That means taking steps to adjust your work routine and office environment as much as possible in order to mitigate the specific factors that prompt episodes." — Alejandro de la Garza, Time, 27 June 2019Did you know?The meaning of mitigate is straightforward enough: it is most often used to talk about making something, such as a problem, symptom, or punishment, less harsh or severe. Sometimes, however, it appears where the similar-looking militate is expected. That word, which is often followed by against, means "to have weight or effect," as in "your unexcused absences might militate against your getting a promotion." The two words are not closely related etymologically (mitigate descends from the Latin verb mitigare, meaning "to soften," whereas militate traces to militare, another Latin verb that means "to engage in warfare"), but the confusion between the two has existed for long enough that some usage commentators have accepted "mitigate against" as an idiomatic alternative to militate. If you want to avoid criticism, you should keep mitigate and militate distinct. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 30, 2019 is:buttress • \\BUTT-russ\\\xa0 • noun1 architecture : a projecting structure of masonry or wood for supporting or giving stability to a wall or building2 : something that resembles a buttress: such asa : a projecting part of a mountain or hillb biology : a horny protuberance on a horse\'s hoof at the heelc botany : the broadened base of a tree trunk or a thickened vertical part of it3 : something that supports or strengthensExamples:"The root system of one of the cedars has been hollowed out into a den, in which Neasloss finds black bear hair. One of the tree\'s buttresses has been chopped long ago by what he recognizes was a nephrite ax, the green jade axes that the coastal people used until 1846, when they adopted steel axes." — Alex Shoumatoff, Smithsonian, September 2015"The modifications to Isabella [Dam] include raising the profile of the main and auxiliary dams 16 feet, adding buttresses and other safety features, and excavating 100 feet deep to build the huge spillway." — Steven Mayer, The Bakersfield Californian, 28 July 2019Did you know?In architecture, a buttress is an exterior support that projects from a wall to resist the sideways force, called thrust, created by the load on an arch or roof. The word buttress was first adopted into English as butres in the 14th century. It came to us from the Anglo-French (arche) boteraz, meaning "thrusting (arch)," and ultimately derives from the verb buter, "to thrust." Buter is also the source of our verb butt, meaning "to thrust, push, or strike with the head or horns." Buttress developed figurative use relatively soon after its adoption, being applied to anything that supports or strengthens something else. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 29, 2019 is:Elysian • \\ih-LIZH-un\\\xa0 • adjective1 : of or relating to Elysium2 : blissful, delightfulExamples:"On such a balmy summer day, on this Elysian isle, anything seemed possible." — Dorothy West, The Wedding, 1995"No matter what one\'s childhood is, a seeming Elysian remembrance or a parental vendetta, the understanding of the afflatus of a poet lies elsewhere." — Edward Dahlberg, "Hart Crane" (1966), reprinted in The Company They Kept (2006)Did you know?In classical mythology, Elysium, also known as the Elysian Fields, was the paradise reserved for the heroes immortalized by the gods. Ancient Greek poets imagined it as the abode of the blessed after death, but in English the concept has more often been applied figuratively. In his history play Henry V, William Shakespeare used the place-name as a word for a peaceful state of sleep enjoyed by a mere mortal, and 18th-century English lexicographer and author Samuel Johnson wrote in The Rambler that in reading pastoral poetry we allow ourselves "to be transported to elysian regions, where we are met with nothing but joy, and plenty, and contentment…" In Walden a century later Henry David Thoreau wrote that "The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life." | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 28, 2019 is:hegemony • \\hih-JEM-uh-nee\\\xa0 • noun1 : preponderant influence or authority over others : domination2 : the social, cultural, ideological, or economic influence exerted by a dominant groupExamples:"According to Chinese analysts\' telling of World War II, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of China proper in 1937 were part of the U.S. strategy to pit the two Asian nations against each other in an endless war that would prevent either from rising to threaten American hegemony in the western Pacific." — Michael Pillsbury, The Hundred-Year Marathon, 2015"The sweeping restrictions come as New York and other cities fundamentally rethink the role of cars in the face of unrelenting traffic that is choking their streets, poisoning the environment and crippling public transit systems by trapping buses and light rail systems in gridlock. It is becoming a moment of reckoning—and, cars, which once had absolute hegemony over the streets, are losing." – Winnie Hu, The New York Times, 8 Aug. 2019Did you know?Hegemony comes to English from the Greek hēgemonia, a noun formed from the verb hēgeisthai ("to lead"), which also gave us the word exegesis (meaning "exposition" or "explanation"). Hegemony was first used in English in the mid-16th century in reference to the control once wielded by the ancient Greek states, and it was reapplied in later centuries as other nations subsequently rose to power. By the 19th century, it had acquired a second sense referring to the social or cultural influence wielded by a dominant member over others of its kind, such as the domination within an industry by a business conglomerate over smaller businesses. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 27, 2019 is:cleave • \\KLEEV\\\xa0 • verb1 : to divide (something) by or as if by a cutting blow : split2 : to separate (something) into distinct parts and especially into groups having divergent views3 : to subject to chemical cleavage4 : to split especially along the grain5 : to penetrate or pass through something by or as if by cuttingExamples:"The surface you\'re cutting against will have a greater impact on your knife\'s edge than the food you\'re chopping up, assuming you aren\'t regularly cleaving through massive bones." — Paul Stephen, The San Antonio Express News, 10 July 2019"Of course, single-item restaurants are nothing new.... But they don\'t usually serve something so divisive as polenta. You see, the slow-cooked dish of maize\xa0cleaves\xa0opinion like a Justin Bieber concert. You either love it or loathe it—and ever has it been so." — Samuel Muston, The Independent (London), 30 Jan. 2014Did you know?Cleave has two homographs, each with a distinct origin. There is cleave meaning "to adhere firmly and closely or loyally and unwaveringly," as in "a family that cleaves to tradition"; that one is from Old English clifian, meaning "to adhere." And there is the cleave with meanings relating to splitting and dividing, which derives from Old English clēofan, meaning "to split." The two have slightly different inflections. The "split" cleave usually has cleaved as its past tense form, but cleft and clove are both in use as well; as its past participle form (the form that often occurs with have), cleaved is most common, but cleft and cloven are also used. The "adhere" cleave commonly has cleaved or clove (and occasionally clave) as its past tense and cleaved as its past participle. | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 26, 2019 is:frowsy • \\FROW-zee\\\xa0 • adjective1 : musty, stale2 : having a slovenly or uncared-for appearanceExamples:The lamp, discovered in a frowsy Midwestern antique store, turned out to be quite valuable."On good days, I could also manage super boring reality TV shows, like \'Escape to the Country,\' in which retired British couples go on slow searches for frowsy new homes in sleepy towns, and nobody gets excited about anything." — Yvonne Abraham, The Boston Globe, 24 Nov. 2018Did you know?The exact origins of frowsy are perhaps lost in an old, frowsy book somewhere, but some etymologists have speculated that frowsy (also spelled frowzy) shares a common ancestor with the younger, chiefly British, word frowsty, a synonym of frowsy in both its senses. That ancestor could be the Old French word frouste, meaning "ruinous" or "decayed," or the now-obsolete English word frough or frow, meaning "brittle" or "fragile." An early print example of frowsy can be found in Thomas Otway\'s 1681 comedy The Souldier\'s Fortune, wherein the character Beau refers to another character as "a frouzy Fellmonger." | Merriam-Webster\'s Word of the Day for September 25, 2019 is:lèse-majesté • \\layz-MAJ-uh-stee\\\xa0 • noun1 a : a crime (such as treason) committed against a sovereign powerb : an offense violating the dignity of a ruler as the representative of a sovereign power2 : a detraction from or affront to dignity or importanceExamples:"David\'s grandfather, President Eisenhower, had left David all his clothes in his will, and David felt obliged to wear them…. Naturally, it would be something along the lines of lèse-majesté for him to remove the presidential jacket and vest and sit\xa0in his shirtsleeves, so he gamely continued to sweat in the sweltering heat, out of respect for Ike." — Michael Korda, Another Life, 2000"Thai law makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten \'the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent.\' … Though other countries still have similar laws—both Spain and the Netherlands have lèse-majesté laws on the books—Thailand\'s enforcement of its laws may make them the strictest in the world." — Adam Taylor, The Washington Post, 8 Feb. 2019Did you know?Lèse-majesté (or lese majesty, as it is also styled in English publications) comes into English by way of Middle French, from the Latin laesa majestas, which literally means "injured majesty." The English term can conceivably cover any offense against a sovereign power or its ruler, from treason to a simple breach of etiquette. Lèse-majesté has also acquired a more lighthearted or ironic meaning, referring to an insult or impudence to a particularly pompous or self-important person or organization. As such, it may be applied to a relatively inoffensive act that has been exaggeratedly treated as if it were a great affront.', 'chan_desc': "Build your vocabulary with Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day!

You\'re always an actor. I sleep as an actor. I wake up as an actor.... I always think about art and creativity, and that\'s all I want to do.” -Omid Memar This week’s guest is Omid Memar. He’s a fantastic actor who I recently was able to work with for an upcoming movie called 7500 (we actually recorded this episode at the movie’s premiere in Switzerland). Omid’s acting is incredibly honest and real and heartbreaking and human. He also comes from a very culturally-rich background— he’s from an Iranian family, grew up in Austria, moved to Munich, and graduated from a French school. He’s a young guy that’s really just getting started in his career, so I thought he would be perfect to answer this week’s question from Megan Colbert in Springfield, New York.\xa0 Megan asked, “How do you balance the inner need to create with the practical need to bring in a paycheck?” Omid and I talk about what it’s like to be up-and-coming in the industry, and how the artistry and creativity in acting is often overshadowed by the idea of ‘celebrity’. We also talk about the influence of cultural identity when selecting roles, the creative impact that music has had on each of us, and we top it all off with a touching conversation about our grandmothers.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.  ------ \xa0ABOUT THE GUESTS: Omid Memar is a twenty-year old Iranian actor, who grew up in Vienna before moving to Munich with his family in 2008 where Omid graduated in a French school with a dual-degree in German and French. Omid landed his first acting role at 14 in the German film The Famous Five 4, based on the book series by Enid Blyton. Omid also starred in the Austrian TV Mini-Series M - A City Hunts a Murderer, and the short film Invention of Trust where he was honored with Gold in the Student Academy Awards in 2016. Omid stars alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the movie 7500, which will be released on Amazon early next year.\xa0 ------\xa0 \xa0SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Omid:- Instagram: @midopersian People Mentioned:- Passar Hariky (Actor)- Patrick Vollrath (Director)- Sebastian Fitz (Omid’s Acting Teacher)Movies Mentions: - The Famous Five 4 (2015)- Angels In The Outfield (1994) Other Mentions: - Locarno Film Festival- Iran-Iraq War (Sep. 22, 1980- Aug. 20, 1988)- Box Studio in Locarno, Switzerland\xa0 | “A lot of people often think of rationality as actually about removing your emotions entirely, but I disagree with that because emotions are what ultimately make us human...To be truly rational, we have to learn to work with our emotions— not completely eradicate them.’” -Liv Boeree My guest this week is Liv Boeree— a magnificent thinker, writer, and speaker. Liv is one of the most successful professional poker players of all time (she is the only woman in history to win both the World Series of Poker and European Poker Tour Championships). On top of all that, she also just happens to have a degree in astrophysics. She’s an all around fantastic person to have a conversation with, and was particularly great at answering this week’s question from Kent Wilson from Nashville, Tennessee. Kent asked, “When does data-backed decision making begin to have a negative impact on the creative process?” Liv and I get into a great discussion on what constitutes analytical thinking, what the difference is between science and art, and how to listen to your intuition and balance that with data, and logic with reason. So much of creativity nowadays is further and further integrated with data and analytics, and Liv has some great insight on when data is valuable and when you should just go with your gut.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.\xa0 ------ABOUT THE GUESTS: Liv Boeree is one of the UK’s most successful poker players winning both a European Poker Tour and World Series of Poker championship title during her professional career. Before poker she studied Astrophysics, she now focuses her time as a TV host and YouTuber specialising in science, futurism and rationality. She also gives seminars on decision strategy and recently spoke at the annual TED conference about the application of poker thinking to everyday life. In 2014 she co-founded Raising for Effective Giving (REG), a non-profit that promotes a scientific, evidence-based approach to philanthropy known as effective altruism. To date, REG has raised over $11,000,000 for a handful of the most globally impactful and cost-effective charities.\xa0------ SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Liv:- Twitter: @Liv_Boeree- Instagram: @Liv_Boeree- YouTube Channel - LivBoeree.com- Raise for Effective GivingTheories Mentioned:- Game Theory- Scientific Method- Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs- Nash EquilibriumMovies Mentioned:- A Beautiful Mind (2001) People Mentioned:- Donald Hoffman (Psychologist / Author) - Shepard Fairey (Artist / Propagandist) - John Nash (Mathematician) Other Mentions: - Effective Altruism\xa0- Brexit- Burning Man- World Series of Poker- European Poker Tour Champions | “There’s times before my mom and I are about to go onstage to play together, and maybe we just argued right before going on. But there’s something about that moment... where I give her a kiss on the cheek and say, ‘Hey, this started with you and me. Let’s go out there and do this.’” -Madisen Ward My guests this week are Madisen and Ruth Ward, who together are known as the mother-and-son folk band Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear. They’ve appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, NPR’s Tiny Desk Series, and recently released a brand new album called Started With A Family (if you haven’t heard their music yet, I highly suggest you take a listen).\xa0 For this episode, Madisen, Ruth and I tackled a question from Paige Elson from Stockton, California. Paige asked, “What are the benefits and setbacks of working creatively with family?” I’ve always been curious to know how family fits into creativity. Where does creativity come from? Do you get it from your parent’s genes or from the upbringing they provided? Madisen and Ruth brought such an interesting perspective to this question. We talked about how Ruth’s career transformed after she became a mom, how writing and performing music is different when collaborating with family members, what role music played in the Ward household, and we topped it all off with a question about a crab’s perspective.

New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019. ------ABOUT THE GUESTS: Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear consists of Madisen Ward and Ruth Ward. They are a modern soulful/folk music duo from Independence, Mo. The band\'s debut album Skeleton Crew, produced by Jim Abbiss, known for his award-winning work with Arctic Monkeys and Adele, captures Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear in their most natural setting. The two tracked most of the tracks live, sitting across from one another in the recording studio. They didn\'t use a click track. With help from a handful of session musicians, the two Wards captured the sound they\'d been making since those coffeeshop days.\xa0 ------\xa0 SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Madisen and Ruth:-Twitter: @MadisenWardMB-Instagram: @MadisenWardMB-Facebook: Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear-YouTube Channel (One For the Record Series)-MadisenWardandtheMamaBear.comMadisen Ward and the Mama Bear Music Mentioned:-Started With A Family (2019)-Skeleton Crew (2015)-"Dead Daffodils"-"Undertaker and Juniper"MadisenMusic Music Mentioned: -“Skip and the Turtle”-“Weep for the King”-“Big Bad Wolfblood” Other Music Mentioned:-Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards by Tom Waits-“Old Man” by Neil Young-“Clown’s Lament”by @Metaphorest on HITRECORD-Pink Moon by Nick DrakePeople Mentioned:-Isiah Whitlock Jr. (Actor and Ruth’s Brother)-Tom Waits (Singer-Songwriter)-Tracy Chapman (Singer-Songwriter)-Mark Knopfler (Singer-Songwriter)-Bob Dylan (Singer-Songwriter)-The Osmonds (Family Music Group)-Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Composer)-The White Stripes (Musical Group)-Wu-Tang Clan (Hip Hop Group) TV Shows Mentioned:-The Wire (2002-2008)-MacGyver (1985-1992) | For this episode, I’m going to do something a little different. I recently did a TED Talk, and there was something really distinct and special about it. I’m pretty used to performing on stage in front of people as a character or for a show, but it felt different to be on stage delivering in-depth thoughts of my own about an idea that’s important to me.I’m putting this TED Talk on my podcast because it’s about how the creative process can be affected by the attention-driven model of big tech companies, and how you can feel a difference when you try to pay attention vs. get attention.We’ll be back next week with more episodes of CREATIVE PROCESSING. I hope you enjoy. For more TED Talks, subscribe to the podcast TED Talks Daily, where they post a new idea every day. It’s available anywhere you listen to podcasts. Thanks! | “At the end of the day, I’d rather make stuff period than make stuff how I want to make stuff. And specific to us, I’d rather make stuff together even than stuff alone.” -Evan GoldbergMy guests this week are the comedy duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. You\'ve probably heard of their movies Pineapple Express, This Is The End, Neighbors, Superbad, Sausage Party, and most recently Good Boys. They’ve also ventured into the entrepreneurial space with their own cannabis brand, Houseplant. I’ve known these guys are a while, and have had the pleasure of working with them on 50/50 and The Night Before. Seth and Evan are unique in that they do a vast majority of their creative work as a duo. Because of this, I thought they would make the perfect pair for this week’s question.For this episode, Seth, Evan and I discussed a question from Pretince Martin Southwell from Springfield Illinois. Pretince asked, “Have you had people you didn’t get along with personally turn out to be good to work with professionally, or vice versa?” We talked about the origin story of how Seth and Evan’s working relationship began, how their dynamic changes when they work with or involve other people, how they navigate disagreements, and we even debated the existence of extraterrestrial life.If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.

It\'s about a pipe between me and others...I have all these thoughts and I want to express them all, but people are not always ready to receive them. Then when you get together and express something...sometimes I can find a pipe where we can connect.” -Yuka HondaMy guest this week is Yuka Honda- a musician, composer, producer and all around fantastic artist. She’s one half of the duo Cibo Matto, and has worked with a range of musicians: from well-known artists such as the Beastie Boys, Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon, to lesser-known but no-less-incredible artists such as Petra Haden, Mike Watt, and Medeski Martin & Wood. Her latest work is a multi-media operatic theatre piece called No Revenge Necessary. She’s done so many great things over the years, and is a dear friend whom I was excited to sit down and have a conversation with.\xa0 For this episode, Yuka and I explored a question from Melissa Hui from San Francisco, CA. Melissa asked, “How much of creative expression is for ourselves vs. others?” We talked about how ideas, images, and feelings take the shape of clouds inside of our heads. When collaborating, Yuka looks to create a pipe connecting her ideas (or the clouds in her head) to the clouds in other people’s heads. And to wrap off our incredibly uplifting/poetic conversation, we answered a question about what we would do in the face of death.\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.\xa0 ------ABOUT THE GUEST: Yuka C. Honda is a musician/producer/composer/performer. Residing in New York City since the mid-1980s, Honda is best known for the band Cibo Matto. Honda has released three solo albums and has produced recordings by Sean Lennon, Martha Wainwright, Yoko Ono Plastic Band, and Cibo Matto. Currently Honda has been performing and recording with CUP (duo with her husband Nels Cline) as well as with her solo entity Eucademix and ON/IN, a duo collaboration with Akio Mokuno.\xa0 ------\xa0 SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Yuka Honda:Instagram: @EucademixFacebook: @Yuka C.

It’s just whether you try to hide that fact or whether you’re honest about it.”-Shepard FaireyMy guest this week is Shepard Fairey- he is an artist and a self-titled propagandist who is perhaps most known for his HOPE Obama Poster or for his Andre the Giant Has A Posse OBEY Campaign. If you’ve lived near any American metropolis, you’ve probably seen his work stenciled onto the sides of various buildings or as a sticker slapped on the back of a fire hydrant. Recently, his series We The People featured Latinas, Native Americans, Muslims and African Americans, and could be seen at nearly every protest and rally in the country. Shepard’s also quite the philanthropist - he and his wife Amanda started a campaign called Make America Smart Again, which called for Americans be more informed, involved, and engage in healthy dialogues with one another.For this episode, we analyzed a question from Shishuraj Karmalkar from Mumbai, India. Shishuraj asked, “How do you wrestle with the statement that artists are \'selfish\' since they\'re off worrying about their art, and not devoting more energy to political rebellion in troubled times?” Shepard and I discussed how art can transform from something selfish to selfless, the intended (and unintended) message art can convey, and if you can ever truly divorce art from politics. He also answered an off-topic question about God with a reference to the movie Dodgeball, so that was pretty cool.If you have a question about the creative process, that you think would spawn a good conversation on this show, ask me on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter tagged #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes are coming out every Tuesday through October 22, 2019.ABOUT THE GUEST:In 1989, while at Rhode Island School of Design studying for his Bachelor of Fine Art in Illustration (which he earned in 1992), Shepard Fairey created the “Andre the Giant has a Posse” sticker that later evolved into the OBEY GIANT art campaign. In 2008, his portrait of then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama became an internationally recognized emblem of hope. Since then, Fairey has painted nearly 100 public murals, become one of the most sought-after and provocative artists in the world, and changed the way people converse about art and view the urban landscape.SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE:Connect with Shepard Fairey:Twitter: @ObeyGiantInstagram: @ObeyGiantObeyGiant.comObeyClothing.comShepard FaireyArt Mentioned:Barack Obama ‘Hope’ Poster‘Andre the Giant Has a Posse’ CampaignWe the People’ SeriesBowery MuralGod Saves and Satan InvestsMovies/TV Shows Mentioned:Triumph of the Will (1935) *WARNING - literally Nazi Propaganda*They Live (1988)The Loudest Voice (TV Series, Showtime)Dodgeball (2004)People Mentioned:Bob Marley (Singer-Songwriter)Bob Dylan\xa0 (Singer-Songwriter)Joe Strummer (Musician)Dead Kennedys (Band)The Rolling Stones (Band)Chuck D (Rapper)Barack Obama (Politician)George W.

My guest is THE Rian Johnson- he is a writer, director, filmmaker extraordinaire. I was in his very first movie, Brick. He then went on to make The Brothers Bloom, Looper, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He’s an extraordinary thinker, conversationalist, artist, and human being. For this episode, we took a deep dive into a question from Alexandra Kolmanofsky from Louisville, Kentucky. She asked, “How do you get inspired by other people’s creations and create something unique that is completely your own without taking too much from the inspiration?” Rian offered some incredible insight on what distinguishes inspiration from imitation, what are the limitations and advantages of dealing with genre, and if any piece of art can ever be considered “original.” We also seriously pondered whether cereal is, in fact, soup (or not).\xa0 If you have a question about the creative process, share it on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) using the hashtag #creativeprocessing, or by emailing creativeprocessing@hitrecord.org. New episodes available every Tuesday through October 22, 2019. ABOUT THE GUEST: Johnson’s career began at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. After writing and directing a few short films that won awards but did not bring him to the attention of mainstream audiences, Rian decided to make this film, even if it was his last.His first feature film Brick premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 where it won the Special Jury Prize for originality and vision. Always with Ram Bergman producing and Steve Yedlin as his Director of Photography, Rian went on to write and direct Brothers Bloom (2008, starring Mark Ruffalo, Rachel Weisz and Adrian Brody), Looper (2012, starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017, starring Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher).Johnson has also directed many episodes of television including two classic episodes of “Breaking Bad” — both voted in the top 10 best episodes of the series by viewers.\xa0 SELECTED LINKS FOR EPISODE: Connect with Rian Johnson:Twitter: @rianjohnsonInstagram: @riancjohnsonMovies Mentioned:-Brick (2005)-The Brothers Bloom (2008)-Looper (2012)-Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)-Knives Out (2019)-The Evil Dead (1981)-Barton Fink (1991)-Breathless (1960)-A Woman Is a Woman (1961)-Barry Lyndon (1975)-A Clockwork Orange (1971)-Jacob’s Ladder (1990)-Miller’s Crossing (1990)-21 Jump Street (2012)-Hail, Caesar!
