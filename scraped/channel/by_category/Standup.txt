We get into the whole \'PC\' around the phrase, but there is a complete audio track of this happening.\xa0Bubba gets us up to speed on some illegal smuggling going on. As it turns out, in Australia, there is a \'syndicate\' that was bringing in Danish Hog Seamen.

The units can sense people using them in ways unintended, which results in getting sprayed, being blasted with loud noises, and the doors will open...so it\'s not a good place to have a date.The Jethrow then finds a question from Reddit; how do you basically stop someone that is talking...politely. The Honch thinks that going to the bathroom is the answer.

If you\'ve ever been to one, there is probably some major renovations needed, including glitter removal. I guess there\'s a reason for you to go to Wisconcin (if not for the cheese curds.) We wonder if the school uniforms might be a little questionable.We turned to reddit to figure out what is our worst first world problems. As it turns out, Honch eats a lot and over stuffs his body. Jethrow doesn\'t know which of his 3 cars to get rid of, and the D cannot get his USB charger to work for his iPhone. Bubba has issues with the Taco Bell app. Also...Honch resurfaces the pain of his wife ordering Starbucks.So PornHub is actually doing something pretty crazy, but it sort of makes sense. In what they call the \'dirtiest porn ever\', it starts people in very polluted areas to bring awareness to the issue of trash. Every time this clip is watched, money is donated to cleaning up beaches.\xa0In other news..a person in Florida got in a bit of trouble by making a pill in the same of President Donald Trump. The drug (Ecstacy) was in the shape of his head (and organge in color). The man was pulled over....and of course, the drugs were taken.

A man has tried to escape prison by dressing up as his daughter, and well, forgetting to talk like his daughter\'s voice. The Honch elightened us to question where the daughter was...when he was trying to escape as her.\xa0Jethrow then tells us about a time when a telemarketer called him about helping his business. Jethrow keeps the man on the phone for 45 minutes, just to mess with him. Have you ever messed with one?We continue this jail/prison theme that wasn\'t intentional. Did you know that it was illegal to masturbate in jail? As it turns out, a man in Florida that is already in jail...is being charged again. He better have soft sheets, he\'s going to be in for awhile.We end with Honch ending his marriage via. podcast episode. Why you say? Because apparently stupid decisions.

The cops didn\'t have a hard time finding the items, but the man was so angry in the cruiser that he tried to bust his way out. He was charged with assault...(not salt, which you would want to put in a brisket before smoking.)Also, some of us didn\'t know it, but Jethrow was in jail at some point in his life. He then tells us about a man who was intoxicated that busted the window on a cruiser, and then catches pepper spray and spits it back at the cop. What kind of people is Jethrow talking to? Jethrow decided to befriend him so he didn\'t get in trouble.After talking about his jailtime, Jethrow searched the Internet for the finest of questions. A man has grown bored of his job, and wanted a creative way to quit his job. If Honch wanted to leave his mark, he would take a huge dump in filing cabinets. We\'re starting to see a pattern with Honch. Bubba\'s method of leaving is a little more passive aggressive...by sending an email and making an epic exit. We\'ll leave it to all of you to leave your job. Needless to say, you really shouldn\'t do any of these things...we\'re just kidding.A man in Florida man had enough of his neighbor playing loud bass music, so he went upstairs, grabbed roach spray...and shot it in the faces of people, and then proceedes to hit himself nunchucks. He\'s been watching karate kid too many times...but the Honch prefers to watch the West Virginia Ninja.\xa0We end with a man in Belgium who decided to try to create a record for sitting on the toilet. Would you ever try to break a record for sitting on a toilet?\xa0Listen and Subscribe On:iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/delay-radio-comedy-funny-news-funny-stories-fast-ish/id1355526064?mt=2Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2PKE9J2XIDd13xsCzvu5EVGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNjAwODIucnNziHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/31084705Pocket Cast: http://pca.st/itunes/1355526064Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=436282&refid=stprCastro: https://castro.fm/itunes/1355526064Castbox: http://castbox.fm/vic/1355526064?ref=buzzsproutRSS Feed: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/160082.rss | We start this episode with a bunch of people getting whiped out in China. As it turns out, there is a massive waterpark with a wave pool that malfunctioned. People thought that a drunk guy had did it, but it turned out to be an electrical issue. But the wave was high...and it was fast.Also this week, Jethrow is running for president of the united states. But before that, he was laying in bed and talking to his wife. He quickly ended up discussing all of the bad things he would do as President, so every 4 years he\'s going to knock 50 days of the calendar. And it does get worse, we promise. If Honch became president, he would put a BBQ stand on every corner and force everyone to speak in a southern accent.If you\'ve ever been to Woodland,NC you would know that they would be a solar leader in the area (at least we think). So the people in the area have had some general concerns about solar energy. A retired science teacher talks about all this \'sciency\' stuff, and thinks that the solar farms are causing cancer, causing people to leave, and it is going to cause a mass extinction of resources. Apparently they can suck all of the energy from the sun.\xa0Bubba then gets into what really gets him going. He really hates the overuse of the \'engineer\' in some job titles. Making some jobs sound better than they are, but Bubba is actually an engineer.\xa0Listen and Subscribe On:iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/delay-radio-comedy-funny-news-funny-stories-fast-ish/id1355526064?mt=2Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2PKE9J2XIDd13xsCzvu5EVGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNjAwODIucnNziHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/31084705Pocket Cast: http://pca.st/itunes/1355526064Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=436282&refid=stprCastro: https://castro.fm/itunes/1355526064Castbox: http://castbox.fm/vic/1355526064?ref=buzzsproutRSS Feed: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/160082.rss | We start this episode like we do every other week, complete stupidity. We then go into a news story about a man from Idaho, who stacked 30 bars of wet soap in one minute. That is one bar of soap stacked every 2 seconds. Can you do this? We then decided to take on one of David Rush\'s world records...featuring blueberries, lawnmowers (running of course), and growing extra long fingernails. We then discussed the world records we wouldn\'t want to go after, such as eating hot dogs at a nude beach.Once we get off the topic of of records, we quickly get into discussing things you wouldn\'t want to be several times larger than they are. It\'s immediately goes to body parts, bowling balls, and bees. Jethrow hates the idea of giant bees.After talking about having large fingers, the Honch tells us about a woman who went into a McDonalds, got upset, and decided to empty a few gun casings in the restaurant. The bullet went into the ceiling, maybe she was angry over Honch\'s Big Mac.\xa0Lasty, we discuss Arby\'s taking on vegetarians by creating carrots made out of meat to make a mockery of the market, which includes the food world starting to adopt things like Beyond Burgers. You can buy \'meat carrots\' now.\xa0Listen and Subscribe On:iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/delay-radio-comedy-funny-news-funny-stories-fast-ish/id1355526064?mt=2Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2PKE9J2XIDd13xsCzvu5EVGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNjAwODIucnNziHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/31084705Pocket Cast: http://pca.st/itunes/1355526064Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=436282&refid=stprCastro: https://castro.fm/itunes/1355526064Castbox: http://castbox.fm/vic/1355526064?ref=buzzsproutRSS Feed: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/160082.rss | We start off this week\'s episode like every other one, with a terrible introduction (thanks D).We jump right in to news coming out of Las Vegas. Grasshoppers have taken the \'sin city\' by storm. While we didn\'t discuss it, a restaurant used the grasshoppers on their pizza, or if you\'re some sort of fusion place...then there you go. The craziest part of this whole thing is that the grasshoppers show up on the weather radar. We then discussed how Honch cleans...including waxing.\xa0After discussing the \'swarm\', Jethrow digs into the questions that he finds on the Internet. He was curious about what insults sound classy. We also gave Honch a new nickname "two thumbs up Honch". If you have some classy insults that make you sound intelligent, let us know.As we stop talking about \'Old English\' insults, Honch tells us about a woman who is marrying her Golden Retriever, after living part of her life with over 200 unsucessful dates. She was seeking out something that has always worked and has always been there for the better. Dating was not working.In other news, Canada is overly sensitive about womens razors. The country issued a recall...based on well, no one calling to complain about the razor. Can we just stick to positive things like poutine? Razors are designed to work.\xa0We ended this episode by going on...and on...and on about peanut butter.Listen and Subscribe On:iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/delay-radio-comedy-funny-news-funny-stories-fast-ish/id1355526064?mt=2Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2PKE9J2XIDd13xsCzvu5EVGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNjAwODIucnNziHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/31084705Pocket Cast: http://pca.st/itunes/1355526064Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=436282&refid=stprCastro: https://castro.fm/itunes/1355526064Castbox: http://castbox.fm/vic/1355526064?ref=buzzsproutRSS Feed: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/160082.rss | On this episode of Delay Radio, we have a lot of news, some questions from the Internet,naked scooting, and Tesla drivers.We start off this episode trying to talk about the topics we have, but we end up doing Adam Sandler\'s character, Waterboy (and poorly). So to get us started off, imagine if you will...you\'re sleeping in your house (or maybe you are at work), someone breaks in and cleans your house. Here\'s the kicker though, they didn\'t steal anything. They vacuumed, cleaned the rugs, made beds...they did everything. Whoever the would be cleaner was, made some origami roses and left them on the toilet paper.After going on about Honch cleaning his house..the Jethrow searches Reddit for the best questions. What minor inconveniences you can give people? How about if your sleeves rolled down every time you washed your hands.\xa0After talking about ruining peoples\' day, Honch discusses looking at pictures of large men on scooters. Actually...it\'s because a man got pulled over and couldn\'t figure out why, but the cop called out the fact that the man was naked. We then get into the weirdest things that we\'ve done in the nude. The D collected the mail in the nude.\xa0Listen and Subscribe On:iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/delay-radio-comedy-funny-news-funny-stories-fast-ish/id1355526064?mt=2Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2PKE9J2XIDd13xsCzvu5EVGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNjAwODIucnNziHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/31084705Pocket Cast: http://pca.st/itunes/1355526064Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=436282&refid=stprCastro: https://castro.fm/itunes/1355526064Castbox: http://castbox.fm/vic/1355526064?ref=buzzsproutRSS Feed: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/160082.rss | On this episode of Delay Radio, we discuss the finest of bar offers, including free drinks...or free bar shots. \\ people ask. For every goal scored, a bar was offering free drinks for every goal...and let\'s just say that after a 13-1 win by the US team, the bar made a lot of people REALLY drunk. The owners said that they didn\'t think people would really go after it, but I mean, they did advertise it..so they have to honor it. I guess they learned their lesson. We then discuss some of the weirdest drink dares we\'ve done, including a cement mixers. Have you ever had a cement mixer? One word. Curdles. Also a fun facts: Bubba sticks to cheap beer and beer pong, and apparently Jethrow loves Jungle Juice.\xa0Jethrow then dives into questions from Reddit. He finds the best (or worst) questions asked on the platform. This week, lolcheese asks if, "What is the cringiest way someone has demonstrated a lack of awareness." D someone get a finger taken off, and was on his way back from lunch, so he didn\'t immediately know that it was a real finger. Honch was going to college \'when texting first started\', where he witnessed a girl get hit by a car because she wasn\'t paying attention. Jethrow used to work on home Internet for people, so he was on a roof, and the guy he was working with was working on his phone, walking backwards. You should probably pay attention to what you\'re doing before you WALK OFF A ROOF. And as it turns out, he did fall off the roof.If you didn\'t know by now, the Honch goes on the road a lot for work. So he came up with a segment called, "Rules of The Road". He really likes to talk to the guys about his travel stories. Honch goes to a lot of hotels, and he shares his experience with hotel hot tubs and pools. He believes that they are super disgusting, and full of jizz. Gross. We then talk about who knows what, including someone jumping into a city fountain.\xa0Listen and Subscribe On:iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/delay-radio-comedy-funny-news-funny-stories-fast-ish/id1355526064?mt=2Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2PKE9J2XIDd13xsCzvu5EVGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNjAwODIucnNziHeartRadio: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/31084705Pocket Cast: http://pca.st/itunes/1355526064Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=436282&refid=stprCastro: https://castro.fm/itunes/1355526064Castbox: http://castbox.fm/vic/1355526064?ref=buzzsproutRSS Feed: https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/160082.rss', 'chan_desc': "What happens when you put comedians in front of microphones around a pool table?

Yeah, they weren\'t expecting it to go this way. But when do they ever stick to the plan?Big thanks to Endeavor Podcast Solutions for sticking with us... even though we keep giving them reasons not to. | This week, the guys go it alone, revisiting some pressing topics, like censorship, bans, cancel culture and revisionist history. From Shane Gillis to Antonio Brown to Justin Trudeau, it seems like everyone\'s struggling to escape their pasts... even though they probably shouldn\'t have to.Don\'t worry, it never gets too serious. They also discuss vaping, Craig\'s yard planning, Brad\'s latest bout with NYC hotels, and Dave\'s family kissing problems. | Stop everything! A wannabe nerd show runs into a real one? And then there\'s lots of joking and ball busting? Yeah. you want to be here for this one.\xa0For 2.5 hours on Friday the 13th, the guys discussed horror movies, fantasy culture, Star Wars and much more! And no one cried or stormed home to their moms.\xa0 | This week the guys SLOWLY get back into form by doing what they do best -- praising those who find humor where most people never look. They also delve into the logic of a comedy icon, explore the religious threats of a fictional wizard, and wonder whether adult entertainment will one day need more mechanics than fluffers. Also, we cover Fred Durst\'s collaboration with John Travolta ... because that\'s the world we live in. It\'s a slow-burning 90 minutes that gets a fiery boost from alcohol in the second half. | This week the guys try out a new studio for a night (with Dave\'s wife and brother-in-law, to boot) but settle in comfortably by covering familiar territory. Craig is reminded that his face is always a target. Dave still forgets his wife. Brad is still on the girly seltzers, meaning the dead still aren\'t safe. And we anticipate the awful reasons some of us will be remembered. To cap off the night we pull out the big guns and recall the impossible, unbelievable, "its-so-crazy-it-has-to-be-true" legacy of local legend, Uncle Ray. There\'s a ton of hard laughs on our way to answering the question, "Why, Ray?" | What happens when you add two mics and four X chromosomes to Needless to Say? Utter and complete chaos, that\'s what. We recorded nearly three hours of raw audio with our friends Kristy and Mandy, covering a WIDE range of topics, and all that survived was the 1:25 you see here.But that doesn\'t mean we didn\'t have a blast doing it. By now, you know what to expect, and this episode delivers in every way. | Chairs creaking. Cans launching. Coolers slamming. Planes flying. Crickets mating. And in between those sounds, Craig, Brad and Dave discuss Jeffrey Epstein, Patricia Heaton, advertising censorship, deep fake videos and about 400 other topics.Noisy as hell but worth the headache, it\'s the guys how you expect them to be. (And trust us, the show title will make sense about three minutes in...) | This week, the guys limp and crawl their way back to the table to kick off their second 100 episodes. And along the way they discuss some unfinished business from last week, take a few shots at redeeming themselves, then break into the skull for some more randomness about comedians, horror movies and -- ahem -- recent mistakes they\'ve made.\xa0(Also appearing: One mouse and one skunk...)If you were worried that Needless to Say was going to change and evolve, this episode will be all the reassurance you need. | After a few weeks away, Craig, Dave and Brad are back to celebrate 100 episodes of Needless to Say... The boys get a little nostalgic about the show\'s best moments, pay tribute to a local furniture hero, then share the worst, most offensive seven minutes in our podcast\'s history.Also, a lot of friends and family share their best wishes on our big milestone (well, most of them anyway). It\'s a fun, occasionally nice, but still ridiculous episode that should tug on your heartstrings, as well as other body parts.Sincere thanks to everyone that\'s stuck it out with us -- if you ever took part in the show, we thank you, even if we forgot to mention you on the air. We owe you the world. | In the final show before the guys celebrate 100 episodes, they start out asking some deep questions about weather, climate and natural disasters. Then they get back to normal by making fun of Area 51 raiders, Bagel Boss jackhats and the amazing Running Butthole Challenge.Despite their better judgment, this is also the first episode sponsored by Endeavor Podcast Solutions (@podcastendeavor). We just hope it won\'t be the last.', 'chan_desc': "In a world full of political strife, social divide and mounting tensions, does anyone really need another podcast starring three guys in a basement?

Andrew Yang taught me about gookies via Cumtown, which led to the birth of the Gookie Monster. Greta Thunberg is getting attacked, but aren’t we hurting the kids enough already? Is there hope for change or are we all going into the climate gulag once the revolution begins?

If you loved Team America, this is right up your alley, unless you hate chicks. Nicole has faced backlash from critics cis and trans alike, being labeled a threat and threatened herself, all because they were triggered by a funny puppet movie. We have a great talk about comedy and the censorship of the left through Nicole's experience with her film.

But he’s only one man, we all need to pitch in. We have a great talk starting off with Ancient Aliens and then discussing the thing middle-aged men always do- what’s wrong with the country. President Trump is stoking racial fears against Rep. Omar by invoking the old “go back to where you came from,” by leading “SEND HER BACK” chants. Ron and I are no stranger to being told to go back to where we’re from, but we both know that we are Americans through and through. America is dealing with unhealed wounds of a racists past, and Ron and I discuss the problems as we see it, the strategy of deplatforming vs engagement, and Ron’s love of the closeted white supremacist. Ron Bush is a comedian, actor, and producer. Look out for his show, Ron Bush For President, and check him out on  Twitter, FB, and IG!

I also admit defeat in this challenge, but I am not giving up. I still am getting *some* stuff done. Just not as much as I had hoped. Not nearly. And not consistently. And it\'s weighing me down. It\'s the albatross around my neck. Not a good look. I must conquer this overwhelmed feeling with progress. Why is it that every time I attempt to get organized and master this closet, I all of a sudden feel SUPER tired and just want to lay down and watch movies?! UGH! Our minds sure are powerful, aren\'t they? I make myself tired and sap my own energy from dreading simple tasks that would make life easier. Let\'s push through the feelings that weigh us down and force ourselves to get the boring tasks and errands overwith. My paperwork is not done and I know I have nice nuggets of jokes in there. There is tax-related stuff I need. Insurance documents. I need everything to be online and it\'s not. Join me or not. This one isn\'t really helpful in any way. \xa0 | I am very likable so if for some weird reason you don\'t like me, please feel free to suck my dick. If you DO like me, please join me for this podcast. It\'s made for you. Let\'s get wild. \xa0 | I tried to get organized and I meant well. Does that count? Hear me criticize myself about my last episode (yes I heard the squeaking and rustling) and ramble on and on about whatever tickles my bean, such as my hot new neighbor who recently moved in. Warning: I messed up the audio on this one too! I sound a bit far away like I\'m not even holding the mic. It actually sounds like shit and you might want to pass on this podcast altogether. I didn\'t have the input set up properly on my audio recorder (goddamnit) and was recording from the mic inputs on the top of the recorder and not the USB mic like I thought I was using. Dumb.\xa0 Moving on. The day is young and I STILL plan to organize a couple areas today and make progress. How about you? What can you do today to make a dent in the chores but also make time for fun later? Let\'s think on it and take action today. \xa0 | Pick a small area to organize or declutter with me for just ten minutes. We may not see a benefit right away, but we will feel a sense of accomplishment! Spend some time with me as I start to tackle a junk closet. I try to stay focused but it doesn\'t work out too well.\xa0 Join me as I struggle through this horrid chore. This is not an easy challenge. Ugh. Fuckin\' lame. But worth it! \xa0 \xa0 | I\'m back to continue the challenge with you to get our crap organized so we can feel a sense of relief from knowing where everything is. My current issue is power cord organization, and making myself dispose of old electronics and appliances that I KNOW I won\'t use but won\'t part with. I recommend some videos that help motivate me to organize/declutter my space. These ALWAYS work for me. Join me as I continue this very challenging challenge! Let\'s take actions daily towards this. I\'m with you. Next episode, we will declutter and organize an area together. Think of what that will be... Don\'t give up! You can do it!\xa0 | My disturbed mind comes out in this one, so be prepared. I really don\'t stay on topic whatsoever. A reminder that although I am doing some serious challenges that are meant to develop good habits, I am not to be taken too seriously here. This is a comedy podcast, after all. I pretty much fuck around the entire time and digress down different paths. I really enjoy doing whatever I want in this podcast. But I do hope to bring some useful and interesting information to you regarding getting organized and decluttering! Join me, sexy buns. Don\'t leave me alone in organization land? | We are going to start small. We are going to think about why we should get organized and visualize all the time it will save us and the beautiful outcome it will provide. I encourage you to think about three areas you could focus on over the next two weeks of this challenge. Or, pick one daily habit to focus on. But I want you to think about the *why*. Why do you want to get organized? What\'s the benefit to you and/or others around you? What does it solve? What does it free you up to do? Don\'t forget the *what*. What do you need/want to organize? The *when* is NOW and throughout the next two weeks. The who is YOU, baby. You and me, baby. Let\'s do it! \xa0 \xa0 | Topics on the podcast tonight:  Developing the gratitude mindset daily What does it mean to be a content creator? How to create mobile-friendly content  And, as usual, I pepper the conversation with digressions and random observations. I read another article and ridicule it slightly yet praise it as well. Join me on OUR LAST DAY of this challenge!\xa0 Then tomorrow we start getting organized. Join me. Let\'s work toward and plan some wild times. What are you doing to plan some fun in your life? And did you write out what you are grateful for today? It\'s a good practice and lifts the depression cloud.\xa0 Try it. | I read an article for you on search optimization fundamentals that I think can help you think about different ways to make your website better. This can apply to comedians or anyone who has a blog or website. Have you been creating comedy videos or merchandise that you want to sell? You need a website on which to sell it. Are you trying to promote your comedy shows through your website? You need a search-optimized website. The goal is to attract and keep as many people as possible coming to your site. Does this sound boring to you? If it does, then money and expansion and growth sound boring to you, too. Let\'s improve our SEO. Let\'s learn more about it and take actions on it. If you don\'t care about website optimization, you\'ll want to give today\'s podcast a HARD PASS. But the sound is better than yesterday! I am using a microphone today. I hope you have a fantastic Saturday and rest of your weekend! xoxoxo Stay sexy and wild. | I used my phone to record this podcast (I promise I never will again-- I had no choice today) and so it\'s a bit annoying to listen to BUT you will be rewarded with sexual references and innuendo and possibly laughs as I cuss everyone out in traffic. I swear more than usual in this one. Get over it. It\'s exciting today. I also witnessed an accident this morning. And I got behind a car with a license plate I couldn\'t figure out that said "NGHT SHD", which I thought meant Night Shed, which makes no sense.. then after a couple hours of doing this podcast, I am thinking it stands for "Not Shitty"? (Naught shitty)? I still am not sure. Do you know? Get on my morning commute with me. Oh and I also offer inspiring ideas for self-improvement and success! Thanks for joining me. I enjoy you.
