Kailash.   | Episode 100\xa0- I\'ve put together my review of the epic, in its totality. \xa0I discuss the strange way in which the epic goes into fine detail on some parts of the story, and breezes over others. \xa0Some of the most critical moments in the story, like when Dhrtarastra was skipped and then later made king, or during the dice game, or in dealing with the birth & death of Krishna, the story is ambiguous and full of holes. \xa0The only explanation that I can come up with is that the author himself may not have known exactly what took place in those scenes, so he tells us what he knows-- which isn\'t much.I talk about the three layers of religious philosophy in the epic-- Vedic Sacrifice, Karma Yoga, and Bhakti. \xa0I propose that Karma Yoga was an innovation introduced by the Mahabharata, and I believe Bhakti was inspired by the epic, and subsequently the epic was modified to include that religion. \xa0That would explain Krishna\'s promotion from country cousin to Top God...Next, I discussed some of the characters in the story-- reviewing their actions and whether they were fairly rated "good guys" or "bad guys" by the epic, and by modern listeners in general.Finally, I compare the epic with other literature, and compare the religious philosophy of the epic with other works and other religions. \xa0I hope no one gets overly offended! \xa0Please write in my blog and let me have it if I did. \xa0I apologize in advance!   | Episode 99\xa0- This is the final piece that brings us around, back to the beginning. \xa0We covered some of this territory before, back in Episode 2, but at the time, it was hard to explain that Parikshit was Arjun\'s grandson and that Takshaka had an ancient feud with the dynasty going back to the fire at the Khandava Forest. \xa0Also, back then we were anxious to get going with the story itself, and all the digressions with angry brahmins and talking snakes only made things confusing at the time.So now we have re-visited the beginning at our leisure, and now you know the circumstances in which the Mahabharata was first publicly recited. \xa0The burnt snake guts must have still been warm when Vyasa\'s disciple Vaishampayana began the tale.So that\'s all for a while. \xa0I am working on a commentary for episode 100-- reviewing the story and considering what was included and what was left out. \xa0Please visit this blog (http://mahabharatapodcast.com) and leave comments, or questions, or any requests for what I should include in my final summing up of the epic!Thanks, Lawrence   | Episode 98\xa0- This is the first of two episodes that take us from the death of the Pandavas down to the Snake Sacrifice, held by Arjun\'s great-grandson. \xa0We skimmed over this back at the beginning of the podcast, because back then we were unfamiliar with who all these people were. \xa0But now it makes sense to bring it around to the beginning again.Not much is recorded about the life of Parikshit. \xa0We only know about how he died, and the many snakes and Rishis who were involved in the process.So, I\'m not quite through yet!   | Episode 97 - So this is it-- the final installment from the Mahabharata. \xa0Book 18, the Svargarohanika Parva, is done, and the 18 parvas of the Mahabharata are now complete.Please be sure to visit my blog and let me know you made it! \xa0And then treat yourself to something nice, because you have really accomplished something.We\'ve reached the end of the story, but this isn\'t quite the end of the podcast. \xa0You can expect a few more episodes-- an epilogue where the story is carried forward up to the time of the Snake Sacrifice. Following that, if you have any questions or points of discussion, I\'d like to make the 100th episode a summing up of the entire podcast. \xa0If there\'s anything you\'d like me to address, let me know soon!Lawrence   | Episode 96 - Arjun returns home with some bad news and some good news. \xa0The bad news is that they have lost their powers and have lost their friends. \xa0The good news is that they finally get to retire. \xa0Yudhistira doesn\'t hesitate. \xa0He strips off his fine garments and leads his brothers into retirement. \xa0Krpa is put in charge of defense, Yuyutsu is made regent, and Parikshit is king. \xa0Parikshit\'s grandmother Subhadra (Krishna\'s sister) is made Dowager Empress.The Pandavas then take a final tour of India, visiting even the former site of the magical city of Dwarka. \xa0Finally, they head north, for Heaven, with their little dog Dharma.   | Episode 95 - Krishna is dead. \xa0Balaram is dead. \xa0The city of Dwarka sinks beneath the waves, and the refugees of that once-great city are making their way to Indraprastha with only Arjun as their protector. \xa0But the influence of the Kali Yuga pervades the earth, and Arjun is not the man he once was. \xa0When the vulnerable procession is attacked by bandits, his magic quivers run out of arrows and his magical weapons no longer obey his command. \xa0Only a fragment is saved, along with Krishna\'s grandson Vajra, who is made King of Indraprastha.   | Episode 94 - The Dark Age is now unquestionably upon us. \xa0The elder Kurus, living austere lives in the forest, found themselves consumed by a forest fire of their own creation. \xa0Let this be a lesson to all you Hindu campers out there to douse your sacred campfires!!18 years later, things go from bad to worse when news arrives of the death of Krishna and all his relatives. \xa0This story alone is deserving of an extended treatment, but we only get a sketchy account of how things went down. With the death of the Vrshnis, Krishna\'s work on earth is done. \xa0He accepts his fate and embraces death when it comes to him.The Kali Yuga is here to stay, so I\'ll warn you now, don\'t expect things to get better!   | Episode 93 - The white horse returns home, only to be tied to a post, killed, & cut up into little pieces. \xa0The priests do their best to follow the old rules, but there\'s no way Draupadi is going to pretend to copulate with a dead horse!Jump ahead 15 years and Dhrtarastra finally decides to take leave of worldly cares, and he, Gandhari, & Kunti leave for a forest ashram. \xa0One year after that, the Pandavas and many citizens pay a visit to the old folks, where Vyasa allows them all to re-unite with their fallen relatives and friends.While some of the early books went on endlessly, the last few books of the epic are quite short, and we are going through about one book an episode at this point-- the story is nearly over!   | Episode 92 - This is another eventful episode. \xa0Krishna & Arjun take a break and go on a leisure trip to Indraprastha, where it appears Arjun is king. \xa0Both heroes have forgotten the Gita, so Krishna recalls another dialog along the same lines, which is called the Anugita.Krishna goes home, while the Pandavas go prospecting for gold in the hills. \xa0While they are away, Parkshit is born, or rather still-born. \xa0Krishna arrives in time to make good his promise and revives the kid.When the Pandavas return with their treasure, the white horse is set loose and the Ashwamedha is begun. \xa0Arjun follows the beast across the length and breadth of India, defeating all comers and sending them as his guests to the sacrifice. Arjun meets one of his sons, the Prince of Manipur, and gets killed & revived along the way.

The word Yoga means union. Thus any activity which enables us to obtain union with the Divine can be called a yoga. ...The message of the Gita is thus addressed to the fighter- the man of action... life is the battlefield of Kurukshetra which each one of us has to learn to face and fight our way through, before we can reach the other side which is Dharmakshetra. Each chapter begins with the sanskrit chanting of the chapter the english discourse follows.Visit: www.vanamaliashram.org | The second chapter is called Sankhya yoga but actuallyit deals entirely with Vedanta. The eternal nature ofthe atman and the ephemeral mature of the body isrevealed to Arjuna. "The atman is eternal, immortal,never born and therefor can never die. It is pureconsciousness and pure existence. That which isexistent can never cease to exist. This is one of thelaws of physics - energy can never be destroyed. itcan only change its form. One body falls and thejivatman flits to another body through which it canbest fulfill its destiny.

This is one of the most difficult sections in the whole text and provides a key to understanding the whole message. Chapter 3, 4 and 5 of the Gita deal exhaustively with Karma yoga. However we find that even in the 6th chapter the Lord starts by reiterating what has already been said. “Anashrita karmaphalam … He who performs his swadharma without any dependence “anashrita” on the fruits of his action, he is both the karma yogi and the karma sannyasin. Meaning to say one who dedicates himself to perform the bounden duties of his life with no dependence of any type on their results is both a yogi and a sannyasi.Visit:  Vanamali Ashram’s Home Page | The Yoga of Knowledge and Action is the title of the fourth chapter. All existence is a working out or evolving of the One Eternal Spirit. Every Atom...imbued with the will and intelligence of the Spirit... This being the case can we call every man an Avatar? Sri Krishna reveals the secret of action and the ideal of yajna or sacrifice.  Mataji is the author of eleven wonderful books that share the ancient legends and timeless teachings of the Puranas and Vedas in English. Of these Sri Krishna Lila, which describes the exploits of the Blue god of Vrindavan from his birth to His disappearance is a classic. Her other books are Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, The Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga: Essays on the Bhagavad Gita, Gurudeva and The Taste Divine which is a book on Indian vegetarian cooking (published in the US by Suny Press).Sri Krishna Lila has been published in the US under the name of The Play of God and Rama Lila as The Song of Rama.  Her most recent books are Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother and the forthcoming,  Sri Hanuman Lila, (both from Inner Traditions publishers). Visit:  Vanamali Ashram’s Bhakti Yoga Home Page | The Yoga of Renunciation And Action.Is asceticism and non-action superior to action? This is one of the questions Shri Krishna addresses in this liberating teaching. ...once more the central idea of the Gita is postulated... an Infinite Being who is not merely the witness, but the enjoyer of all action done as yajna.

The recipient of the message is Arjuna, the prototype of the struggling human soul who is ready to receive the great knowledge by his close companionship and increasing nearness to the divine Self within himself. \n\n\n\n\nThis symbolic companionship of Krishna and Arjuna, the divine and the human soul is further dramatized by the fact that their dialogue takes place amidst the din and clamor of a battlefield. The teacher in the Gita is therefore not only the God who is transcendent but also the God in man who unveils Himself through an increasing knowledge... \n                                                                     Vanamali, Nitya Yoga.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAldous Huxley, asserts that ‘The Bhagavad Gita occupies an intermediate position between scripture and theology; for it combines the poetical qualities of the first with the clear-cut methodicalness of the second. ‘The book may be described’ writes Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in his admirable Hinduism and Buddhism, ‘as a compendium of the whole doctrine to be found in the earlier Vedas, Brahmanas and Upanishads, and being therefore the basis of all the The later developments, it can be regarded as the focus of all Indian religion...\n\n...But this focus of Indian religion is also one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the perennial philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not only for Indians, but for all mankind’.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) offers an understanding of The Great Mystery, which has inspired many of the giants of the Western intellectual tradition. The transcendentalist poets Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman were students of The Bhagavad Gita. Thoreau wrote: ‘In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous cosmological philosophy of The Bhagavad Gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.’\n\nEmerson, referring to the Gita, wrote: ‘It was the first of books. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age . . . had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.’\n\nThis is a series of discourses on the liberating teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) by Mataji (Mother) Vanamali, Vanamali Gita Yogasram, Rishikesh, North India.\n\nVanamali Mataji is the author of The Lila Hindu World Heritage Library. Her books include: a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  Sri Krishna Lila, Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, Sri Devi Lila, Sri Hanuman Lila, Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, Gurudeva  and The Taste Divine. Sri Devi Lila is published in the U.S. as  Shakti: Realm of The Divine Mother , Sri Hanuman Lila  as  Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of The Monkey God.\n\nEach talk is introduced with the Sanskrit invocations and chanting of the Gita chapter. Then Mataji Vanamali offers a line-by-line illumination of Shri Krishna's liberating teachings.\n\nWe invite you to visit our website: www.Vanamaliashram.org\nand enjoy our Pilgrims Guide, Discourses and Book & Music store.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts/v4/a1/ee/58/a1ee58f0-d65d-11bd-54b5-9c0838fbd867/mza_3281618441493606329.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2009-06-17'}}

We explore what "I Am" means, what consciousness is, how spirit works and the underlying nature of existence. We talk about what is the difference between being "awakened" or being "enlightened" and who thinks of or identifies with either.\xa0 Moreover, the whole talk is a guided meditation that brings you ever deeper into higher states. Enjoy.\xa0 www.SelfAwareness.com  Books on Amazon\xa0 | This is both a talk and guided meditation providing instruction on how to be happy. From the physical aspect, to mental and emotional and then spiritual aspects, we explore all the levels of happiness and peace. Steven shares tools and techniques and guides a meditation. Just listening to this talk will make you feel happy.\xa0 www.SelfAwareness.com\xa0 \xa0 | Author Steven Sadleir reads poetry and prose from his popular book Naked Soul, and takes you on a journey into the Source of love itself within you. In this second reading, Steven focuses on the feminine, women, love and relationship.\xa0 Some of these poems include: Emotions (won 1st place), Passion\'s Lair, The Kiss, Naked Truth, Lost in your love, Walking Together, Empty Beach, Ecstasy, and many others. Think of this as a guided meditation, where we meditate on love and just feel good. Enjoy Steven\'s books are on Barnes & Nobel or  Amazon.\xa0 \xa0 www.SelfAwareness.com \xa0 | Author reads from his book  Naked Soul. Sometimes playful, sometimes introspective and always in awe, author Steven Sadleir bears his soul to you. Allow yourself to just sit back in the jacuzzi of consciousness and be read poems to. Be completely nurtured, loved and supported. Like a bubble bath for your soul.\xa0 | In this lecture, Steven first goes back to Moses, the commandments and the Torah, and then dives into Babayonian and Sumarian accounts of Adam and the Flood. Then to the Dead Sea Scrolls, the world\'s oldest written Old Testament along with the Apocrapha and tables speaking on the Essene sect of Jews in Qumran, John The Baptist and the early Jesus movement.\xa0 We take a moment to go over the first and second century Semetic Gospels that the Apostles were reading, such as the Gospels of Thomas, James and Mary, and then explain Paul of Tarsus and his evangelical movement, coming up to the first compilations of Biblical verses and collections of chapters, the Council of Nicea and a hundred years of deciding what to take as faith.\xa0 Coming up to The Dark Ages, the Reformation, and the first English Bibles and how it changed the face of Christianity. By the end of this lecture you will know more about Christian history than most priests. It\'s all for the love of God. Just wait until to hear what else Jesus said.\xa0 Learn more from Steven\'s book  Christ Enlightened, the Lost Teachings of Jesus Unveiled. \xa0 | Do we live in the End Times? Is Judgement Day upon us? Are we entering an Age of Enlightenment and about to destroy most of the Earth and create Heaven on Earth? Many Jews, Christians and Moslems believe it, and other too in some form or another. Steven draws upon his years of study on world religions for his best-seller  Looking for God, A Seeker\'s Guide to Religious and Spiritual Paths of the World, and  Christ Enlightened, the Lost Teachings of Jesus Unveiled, as well as current events to provide an in depth look at our Age and the times.\xa0 Steven goes over 20 Prophesy\'s that either appear to have been fulfilled or are being fulfilled. Drawing from the Old Testament and New, and the Quaran, an amazing about of things were foreseen thousands of years in the past, were recorded, and either have come about or look like they may...any day. See for yourself. If we are entering the Age of Enlightenment, if Jesus is coming, or any calamities to come, it would be good to know about it. Bless you.  Looking for God  Christ Enlightened www.StevenSadleir.com\xa0 \xa0 | In this talk, Steven goes back to the Bible, Noah, and the story in Genesis about how, after the Flood, the first people\'s spread across the Earth and how it relates to current times and politics. Noah had three sons whose offspring set off to different parts of the world, but few people realize who these people are.\xa0 Shem traveled down from Eden to Ur near modern Baghdad (Iraq) and for 8 generations his descendants his family grew until Abraham was famously called by God (Yahweh) to travel to Canaan. Abraham had two sons, Ishmael traveled to Arabia and became the father of the Arabic people. Isaac the Hebrew. Ham traveled South through the Levant to Africa, his descendants became the Canaanites, Philistine or Palestinian people (who Abraham met when he arrived in today\'s Israel). The third son, Japhet, traveled northerly and then into Europe and one branch became the Ashkenazi Jew (but their descendants did not come from Juda so are technically not Jews). These are the sect that created the state of Israel. Another diaspora created additional migrations to Europe, most of which went to Moorish Spain where they were called Sephardic.\xa0 Understanding these relationships helps us understand the politics of our day, and the changes that are coming.\xa0 www.StevenSadleir.com\xa0\xa0 \xa0 | In this talk and meditation, Steven explains how conscious is expressed within cells, brain cells, and through human beings and other life forms. We practice developing awareness of our innate intelligence and expand our awareness into the collective consciousness. www.SelfAwareness.com \xa0 | In this talk Steven reads from his book The Calling, a Journey Within Your Own Being (on  Amazon), which is a guided meditation through reading, or in this case listening. Here you are guided into the very core of your own being. Here we practice Jhana Yoga, using vedanta or introspection and direct awareness. First we become aware of the physical sound and its affect, then the processing of words, the connections forming meaning, the discriminatory faculty and then the observer of it all. We go to the place before thought, and observe thought from the outside.\xa0 In this journey, we observe the observer, observing. Then sit back and observe that until the observer even disappears. Disappear for a few moments and become the eternal witness. Be the consciousness itself, the being itself. Even a being without a Self! If you like to go deep, this is your playground. Let\'s see how deep you can go.\xa0 www.SelfAwareness.com  To purchase The Calling Book\xa0 | In this talk Steven explains Kundalini Shakti to us, and guides a meditation explaining how the sacred spiritual energy we call Kundalini or Spirit flow in, up and around us and through various centers in our body, chakras, and how they correspond to our nervous system and biology. There is a whole science to Kundalini.\xa0 Steven also shares his experiences with various Kundalini Masters and explains the differences in their yoga and meditation practices, including Swami Sivananda Saraswati, Swami Laksman Joo, Yogiraj Satgurunath, Yogi Bhajan, Grumukh, Swami Muktananda, Gurumayi, Gurudev Shree Amritji, Yogiraj Vethathiri Maharishi, TKS Guru and Shivabalayogi Maharaj, among others.\xa0 It\'s a good overview of kundalini yoga practice and the various lineages which teach it.\xa0 www.SelfAwareness.com\xa0 \xa0', 'chan_desc': 'Uplifting talks and guided meditations from Steven S.

This book tells the story of the making of Hindu in the British colonial Caribbean. Over time, interactions between colonial officials, elite Indians and workers, as well as conflicts over public performances of rituals produced something that many now call Hinduism. But Rocklin argues that this was not necessarily a foregone conclusion, and his book highlights the contingent nature of this process.Learn more about your ad choices.

Kingship and Polity on the Himalayan Borderland (Amsterdam UP, 2019) specifically documents the key roles played by women - especially queen regents - in the modern transformation of state and society in the Indian Himalaya kingdoms. Arik Moran examines three Rajput kingdoms during the transition to British rule (c. 1790-1840) and their interconnected histories and court intrigues. He draws on rich archival records, local histories, and extensive ethnographic research to offer an alternative to the popular and scholarly discourses that developed with the rise of colonial knowledge.For information on your host Raj Balkaran’s background, see rajbalkaran.com.Learn more about your ad choices.

Kamath broaches the practice of impersonation across various boundaries – village to urban, Brahmin to non-Brahmin, hegemonic to non-normative – to explore the artifice of Brahmin masculinity in contemporary South Indian dance.

This work explores Himalayan Hindu religious tradition in the making during the very self-conscious creation of Nepal as the 'world's only Hindu kingdom' in the early modern period.\xa0 Touching on the pan-Hindu goddess tradition, regional ideals of Hindu womanhood, linguistic culture, identity formation and placemaking, Reciting the Goddess makes for a rich read.For information on your host Raj Balkaran’s background, see rajbalkaran.com.Learn more about your ad choices.

Through a careful study of ritual (śanti) texts geared towards appeasement of inauspicious forces (primarily the Atharva Veda and in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā, an Indian astrological work), Marko Geslani demonstrates the persistent significance and centrality of the work of Brahmanical priesthood from ancient to medieval to modern times. In doing so he aptly problematizes the scholarly tendency to demarcate Vedic ritual from popular Hinduism.

What about the common contrasting of Hindu devotionalism as ‘religion’ with tantra as ‘black magic’? Patton E. Burchett's new book A Genealogy of Devotion: Bhakti, Tantra, Yoga, and Sufism in North India (Columbia University Press, 2019) re-examines what we assume about the rise of devotionalism in North India, tracing its flowering since India’s early medieval “Tantric Age” to present day.\xa0 It illumines the complex historical factors at play in Sultanate and Mughal India implicating the influence of three pervasive strands in the tapestry of North Indian religiosity: tantra, yoga and Sufism. Burchett shows the extent to which Persian culture and popular Sufism contribute to a (now prevalent) Hindu devotionalism that is critical of tantric and yogic religiosity.\xa0 Prior to this, argues Burchett, Hindu devotionalism locally flowered in fruitful cross pollination with yogic and tantric forms of Indian religiosity.For information about your host Raj Balkaran’s background, see rajbalkaran.com/academiaLearn more about your ad choices.

It makes us have a tunnel vision and make us overbearing. It transforms into anger, greed and delusion. When desire is obstructed, it becomes anger. In anger we can lose our perspective and ourselves.\xa0Quenching a desire can become greed. Greed can lead to delusion if its directed to relationships and money. They are all intertwined and create a web of thoughts that prevent us to see who we really are.\xa0 We need to pause, we will see Soham. The infinite that we are. \xa0 | We spend so much time making up and breaking up. We exhaust ourselves and we lose our peace. We get angry at one action and write off the whole person and relationship, often over something small and petty.\xa0 We can be so rash and impatient from time to time. Do not snap the stings of love and haste, it cannot be joined easily.\xa0How we response becomes who we are and who we want to be.\xa0 | We're all very similar to each other. Today's verse is about seeing oneness in all beings and things. The emotions we feel are the same. When we watch a movie or read a book, we identify with the characters because we're all going through the same things. \xa0 \xa0 | A line questions many of us ask ourselves are where do we come from and why are we here. All of these questions lead us to the infinite truth. Sometimes, the answers to questions aren't directly visible and we need to apply logic to get the answers.\xa0 | Do you think God talks to you? It's one of the symptoms of someone diagnosed with psychosis is that they hear someone speaking to them and telling them what to do. The similarities between a man of enlightenment and someone with mental conditions is talked about in verse 22 of Bhaja Govindam.\xa0 The person of perfection is childlike in terms of their happiness. They are so spontaneous and uninhibited. They are totally present in the moment and are extremely spontaneous.\xa0 | We come into this world with all the right tools to get moksha but we lose our way. Our determination dwindles and things become hopeless. In this state, we prey. It's extremely powerful, it opens our heart to receive the lord's grace.\xa0Holding onto a chant helps people get through extreme difficulties. When our hearts really yearn, we will get what we want.\xa0 | In verse 20 of Bhaja Govindam, we learn that we need to study the Bhagavad Gita and to workship Lord Krishnaso that we can gracefully accept death when it comes - we could possibly go beyond death.\xa0 Symbolically, the flow of the Ganga represents the flow of knowledge and devotion. To take a sip of that devotion is what we are urged to do. Workship is described in the Gita as to serve mankind. Service is true worship. | Swamini Supriyananda talks about the importance of studying the Bhagawad Gita.\xa0Many of us may not have the dispassion to stay in the Himalayas the way swamis do.\xa0We don’t need to anymore, technology has enabled this for us.\xa0The student of the Gita is for us.\xa0It was also taught in the battlefield - in the middle of an extremely stressful situation.\xa0Gurudev even called it the Arjuna disease. Repetition of the Gita helps us make spiritual progress. We need to keep listening so that we don’t forget.\xa0 | True bliss is experienced on the inside. The story of Lord Ram is a great example of how it didn't matter whether he was in\xa0his grand palace or during exile in the forest. We judge sages by their external traits such as their appearance and access to wealth but they don't judge themselves or us by that. They are firmly rooted in the infinite joy. When we judge, we forget to see inside and only see the outside. If we could see inside, we will forget the outside. | We all have desires; desires we seek to fulfill. The ratio between the number of desires we fulfill to the total number of desires we have can be a measurement of our happiness. Swamini Supriyananda explains how the solution to infinite happiness lies within the denominator (our total number of desires); and how reducing that number guides us to the idealistic state of dispassion.", 'chan_desc': 'Do you ever stop and think about why you do what you do everyday?Australian psychologist turned Hindu Monk, Swamini Supriyananda, provides insightful answers to your contemporary questions and challenges.
