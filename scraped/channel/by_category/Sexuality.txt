Dr. Ehrlich has been a holistic dentist for over 35 years.\xa0 He takes a holistic approach to health and wellness. He has created a comprehensive model of how stress impacts our lives in his book, A Life Less Stressed: The 5 Pillars of Health and Wellness. \xa0 Key Takeaways: ● What stress is good for you ● How sleep can improve your dating life ● How to empower yourself when dealing with stress ● Why it’s important to change your attitude about stress ● The 5 Pillars of Health and Wellness ● Proper sleep hygiene ● How electronics keep the body stressed Dr. Erlich\'s Philosophy on Stress\xa0 [2:20] In our modern world, everyone can relate to stress. Most people can acknowledge that stress affects human health. Stressors are part of our everyday lives. Dr. Ehrlich’s approach to stress has been to identify the factors that makeup stress. Since we can\'t eliminate stress from our lives, the key to managing it is to build up our resilience to it.\xa0 He reminds us that not all stress is bad. Exercise and fasting are examples of good stressors. We need to build good stressors in our lives to challenge our immune systems. As the world becomes increasingly more complex he believes the solution to the problem is simple. Some people get empowered by work and stress and others feel overwhelmed. Changing our attitude towards it can make a huge difference in building resilience. We need to take a holistic view of how the body works. The 5 Stressors in Life to Identify and Minimize [10:12] Dr. Ehrlich says we can reduce stress by working on these 5 things: 1. Emotional Health 2. Environmental Health 3. Postural Health 4. Nutritional Health 5. Dental Health Try making a mission statement for your life and change your attitude toward stress. Resiliency in Dating and Relationships [21:32] If you want to have better relationships and a better life in general, start with sleep and breathwork. The quantity and quality of sleep you get is important. 7-9 hours of sleep is the average amount of sleep humans need to function at their best. People who get 5-6 hours of sleep or less aren\'t getting enough sleep. If you want to be better at dating and be more resilient and give a stronger impression of your true self go to bed earlier and take sleep seriously. It will positively affect your work and personal life. It should be a lifelong habit. A good night’s rest helps to regulate hormones and can rejuvenate the body. To practice proper sleep hygiene: ● Prioritize sleep ● Make it a routine ● Change your relationship with technology ● Drink less alcohol ● Don’t eat 1-2 hours before bed ● Regulate the room temperature ● Have a comfortable bed ● Eliminate excess noise ● Make the room dark at dark Dr. Ehrlich notes that light from the screens we use is affecting our melatonin levels. Get all technology out of your life and your bedroom one hour before you go to bed. Electrical equipment should not be within 5 feet of your head and phones should be set to silent.\xa0 Make a Connection: Dating with Dignity Website DWDVIP Get a Free Coaching Session with Marni on Our Podcast - Sign up Here to Be a Guest On Our Show Join Our Free Dating with Dignity Facebook Group Here! How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE Dr. Ron Ehrlich Website A Life Less Stressed: The 5 Pillars of Health and Wellness Book | Do you pick up on subtle clues others don’t seem to notice? Can you tell by someone’s facial expression what they are thinking? Have others asked you why you are so sensitive? If so, you may be a Highly-Sensitive Person or HSP. \xa0 Marni welcomes the Host of Unapologetically Sensitive, Patricia Young. She is a Highly-Sensitive Person who helps HSPs turn their perceived shortcomings into superpowers. She is passionate about educating them about the amazing gifts they have to offer via online coaching. Her work focuses on building communities, setting boundaries, and being mindful. During this episode, she offers tips for HSPs who are navigating the dating world or are in relationships. \xa0 Key Takeaways:  ● The four characteristics of an HSP ● How an HSP can embrace their strengths ● Dating as an HSP or dating an HSP ● How to get clear on your core values ● Seeing the red flags of Narcissism ● Long-term relationships with an HSP The Four Characteristics of a Highly-Sensitive Person [3:01] Being a highly-sensitive person is more than being emotional or sensitive. If you feel like a misfit or a disruptor in your family, you may be an HSP. You may pick up on things that other people don\'t. Or track or pay attention to things other people don\'t. Do you have these four traits? 18-20% of the population DOES.   ● Depth of processing ● Overstimulation or over-arousal ● Emotional responsiveness or Empathy ● Sensitive subtleties\xa0 Introversion and highly-sensitive are not necessarily correlated but can overlap. Sensitivity is not always valued and often HSP’s bury it. Dating and Relationships for HSPs [14:16] If you are clear about what the values are that you want in a partner then you will embrace someone\'s sensitivity. It\'s not uncommon that the things we love about our partners are also the things that drive us crazy. If you meet someone or have someone that is very compassionate and understanding they may not be assertive or alpha but they have strengths of a different nature. HSP’s can be healers, justice makers, or creatives. Get clear on your core values! We often pick partners that have a piece that helps us heal and we help them heal in areas we rub each other. Beware —Narcissists are drawn to HSP\'s as they need someone to feed their ego. HSP\'s read other people and know what everyone else needs. If you know what the red flags of a narcissist are as soon as you see them say, ”I\'m out of here”. Make a list of what your ideal date would look like. Tips for Highly-Sensitive People [19:43] The longer HSP\'s are in environments that don\'t work for them the more they might get overstimulated. They may need a longer time to recharge. Often, they stretch beyond what is comfortable when they are trying to please others. If an HSP has experienced trauma it can make them feel that they are not enough and not lovable. They may not like their sensitivity and feel as though their feelings run them all over the place. Therapy and coaching can help.

How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE Patricia Young LCSW Website  | Are you notorious for not taking care of yourself? How often do you take five minutes and check-in with yourself to make sure your needs are being met? Marni welcomes Health and Wellness Expert, Aimee Raupp into the Den to talk about self-worth, self-love, weight, and self-care. \xa0 Aimee is a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist in Manhattan who offers fertility treatments and care. She has a Biology Degree and a Masters in Chinese Medicine from Rutgers - She has a beauty care line and she’s been on the View. Today we talk about all of her books including Chill Out and Get Healthy. Yes, You Can Get Pregnant, and Body Relief. \xa0 Key Takeaways:  ● The importance of celebrating yourself ● What optimal health looks like ● How to focus on you ● Why you should quit beating yourself up ● How to stop Self-sabotaging behaviors ● The menopause-mindset connection ● How chemicals affect a woman’s hormone levels ● How to bring vitality back to sex The Picture of Optimal Health [2:29] Aimee says optimal health is easy to identify “it’s when you wake up feeling refreshed and excited about your day. You have healthy bowel movements and vitality on every level. You feel really alive and really happy in your body.\xa0 You feel like you are living your purpose”. If you’re not there yet, it’s ok. Change is hard for some people. If you find yourself arguing in favor of your limitations or arguing to keep your life exactly how it is you may not be ready to shift your life. If it\'s not for you right now, give yourself time to step into your self-worth. Takeaway: If you are going to indulge, enjoy it. Don’t beat yourself up over it. The Advanced Move Toward Vitality [12:41] Aimee recommends focusing on the things that are going right. You have to celebrate the wins in life. Gentle reminders about how great you are go a long way. Chill out and check-in time is when you take 5-10 breaths and ask yourself a couple of simple questions. Try asking “how are you today?” It slows you down for a minute and makes sure you are considering your needs. If you are someone who is already meditating, doing yoga, and living clean but you still have bowel problems or are concerned about fertility you may be constipated emotionally. Takeaway: Chill Out and Get Healthy! Mindset, Menopause, Sex, and Skincare [20:14] Current research shows that our thoughts, beliefs, and mental disposition has just as much as an impact on our biochemistry and physiology as does our actual biology. It’s about 50-50. Take a look at yourself in the mirror every day and find one thing that you like about yourself. Think about what makes you feel good. Add a little vitality to your appearance by wearing a bright color. Dive into your divine feminine energy. Simple things make a big impact. Be alive! Don\'t wait to lose 10 pounds to wear the outfit you love, don\'t put your life on hold, and don\'t beat yourself up. Celebrate where you are. When your internal stuffing is radiant your external package will be too. Aimee couldn\'t find skincare products without chemicals. So, she created her own.\xa0 Her motto is \'if you can\'t eat it you shouldn\'t put it on your skin\'. It’s basically skin care for hormone harmony. Takeaway: Everything you put on your skin gets absorbed into your bloodstream. It really does impact you hormonally.

The cast of men and women in the show may be given direction in which conversations to have but how they respond is very telling.

How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE  I Suck at Dating Podcast\xa0  Addicted to Drama with Sherrie Toews Podcast | What can you learn about the male-female dating dynamic by watching Bachelor in Paradise? Loads. To break down key lessons from the reality TV show about new and budding relationships, Marni welcomes Man Panelist, Chris Gillis back into the Den. Chris and Marni dissect how normal people tackle relationships in the craziest of ways.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Key Takeaways:  ● Why women need to recognize their value ● Men don’t want to be changed ● Characteristics of the new modern-day alpha male\xa0 ● When it comes down to it, women don’t often choose the nice guy ● How women can honestly communicate their feelings without killing a relationship ● The power a woman has over a man ● Men are attracted to feminine women Dating ‘the Player’ [1:44] Dean, affectionately called Deaniebaby, is super handsome and he knows how to make a girl feel special. The issue with Dean is that he has a reputation as a player. So, what if you were dating a Deaniebaby in real life? Signs a guy is not looking for a serious relationship:   ● They tell you using phrases like ‘it’s not you it’s me’ ● Your friends are telling you to be careful During the show, the dynamic between Dean and Caelynn is all about Caelynn not understanding her value. She basically tells Dean how needy she is and you can see him pull away. Good thing for her Dylan was waiting in the wings. Takeaway: Your job isn’t to change a guy. Why are you not being a woman of value? Men run away from women who want to change them. Why Test a Great Guy? Just Be Honest [13:44] Is Katie sabotaging any chance she has for a relationship? “When a guy tells you something he says what he means. There normally aren’t any hidden messages,” Chris says. For Katie to continue asking Chris if he is sure is her way of putting up a wall and all Chris hears is double talk. It is confusing. Takeaway: Guys like a safe bet. Mixed signals confuse them. Ladies if you are dating someone worth it you can\'t mess with them because another girl is going to swoop in to take your place. Tayshia’s treatment of JPJ is an example of this. Takeaway: If you are not sure about someone or are not ready to commit, instead of planting a seed about someone better — communicate with them and tell them you are not ready to be exclusive. The Modern -Day Alpha Male [22:47] Women say it all the time ‘I want an alpha male’ but what does it really mean? Is it aggressive? It is assertive? If that type of behavior isn’t in alignment with who the guy really is do you really want him to change? Nicole tells the handsome, buff, manly Clay he needs to be more aggressive. Then, she follows it up by going out with Mr. Machismo, who eventually got in a fistfight. She realizes she wants a guy who is assertive, not aggressive. Takeaway: A modern alpha guy is more than just muscles and money. He is assertive and can articulate his feelings.

How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE  | Why is dating so hard? Are you saying all the right things but your body is sending signals of anxiousness or defensiveness? To uncover the psychological reasons behind your physiological behavior, Marni welcomes Dr. Stephen Porges, an expert in the polyvagal theory and how it traverses our relationships. \xa0 Key Takeaways:  ● Self-soothing tips for anxious behavior ● Tips for staying in a long-term, happy relationship ● Rewriting your personal narrative ● Recognizing defensiveness for what it really is ● The importance of being present on a date ● Why dating can be terrifying ● Understanding the importance of reciprocity The Polyvagal Theory and Dating-Mating Strategies [4:34] The polyvagal theory explains how our nervous system plays a part in our relationships, even if we aren’t aware of it at the time. Essentially, it influences how we react to others. If your body is in a state of safety, you can be socially and emotionally available. If not, and your body is in a state of anxiety or fear, you may not present yourself as who you really are. We pick up non-verbal queues from one another. If your mind goes to a place of abandonment or loss of trust your body reflects that externally. Dr. Porges says that in our culture we present the supermodel face. It is the presentation of being beautiful but not being available. This is not what our bodies want. Our bodies want people who are interactive, supportive, and reciprocal to who we are. What is really attractive is the emotional safety conveyed through facial expression. In the early moments of starting relationships, we are negotiating safety in psychological space. Why Dating Can Be Terrifying [13:21] There is little predictability in dating. Will he call? Does he like me? When we ask ourselves these questions it is an example of our nervous system searching for predictability. If there is uncertainty, we feel unsafe and it can create a feeling of terror. Relationships aren\'t based on words they are based on how we relate to each other. We need reciprocity to feel understood and emotionally safe. Uncertainty puts us into a defensive mode. How to Self-soothe When You Feel Anxious [21:10] When our sense of self is challenged, it may be because we are framing our personal narratives based on previous traumas. Dr. Porges offers these tools to self-soothe and to calm ourselves down after we have been triggered:   ● Breathing — To calm the body down inhale quickly and exhale slowly. ● Rocking, gently — It triggers the body to feel safe in the presence of another. ● A Quiet Place — if you want to understand what someone is saying go to a quiet environment. These tools can help you manage your body’s reaction to trauma and manage it. The goal of a relationship is to be part of a co-regulation team. And, sensitivity is being aware of your partners de-stabilizations and reflexively supporting them. How to Stay in a Long-term, Happy Relationship [35:59] Be accessible! Dr. Porges’ biggest tip for staying in a healthy relationship is to be vulnerable and accessible with our partners.\xa0 He says, “What we want in our relationships is never to be in a defensive state or to minimize it. We have to understand we are not perfect, we are loving human beings.” Our bodies want to open up and be vulnerable with one another.

How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE  | Do you always gravitate toward the same type of guys even though they never come with the type of relationship you are looking for? To find out why Marni welcomes the insightful Michelle Chalfant the host of the Adult Chair Podcast. Michelle is a therapist, holistic life coach, an author, a speaker an amazing podcast, and developer of the adult chair model, a transformational model of self-realization. She helps humans discover who they are and get unstuck so they can find their power. \xa0 Key Takeaways:\xa0  Why we choose the wrong guys. A process to help fix your picker. How to be compassionate with yourself and give yourself unconditional love. How to overcome emotional trauma and heal core childhood wounds. How to look for someone who complements you, not completes you.\xa0  \xa0 The Adult Chair Model [3:40] \xa0 The Adult Chair model includes the three phases of our lives:\xa0 \xa0  The child chair — Age 0-6 The adolescent chair — Age 7-25 The adult chair — Age 26 & beyond  \xa0 From age 0-6 we are living in the child part of our lives. It’s during this time we learn about emotions, our true needs, spontaneity, intimacy, and vulnerability.\xa0 \xa0 From age 7-25 we live in our adolescent chair which is driven by the ego. During this time we learn about the victim, guilt, blame, codependency, people-pleasing, and perfectionism.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 If we had healthy modeling, we slide into the adult chair at 25. It’s where we live in fact and truth instead of story and assumption. It\'s when we begin to set boundaries, we learn how to speak up for ourselves. We can connect to how we are feeling and thinking.\xa0 \xa0 Most of us don\'t land in our adult chair mentally. We are physically adults but emotionally we are stuck in the adolescent chair.\xa0 \xa0 Traumas can freeze us in time and we have to go back and rescue our inner child. \xa0 Trusting Yourself and Finding Self-Compassion [18:00] \xa0 Michelle says that the adolescent part of use can wear the mask of an adult but still be making decisions from the adolescent chair.\xa0 \xa0 To provide ourselves consistency and unconditional love we should work with our inner child in the following manner: \xa0  Validate them Thank them Question what their needs are Have unconditional love and compassion for ourselves  \xa0 As a result of this process, people say "I just feel so different. I feel more compassion for myself and others.” \xa0 When you start rescuing the younger parts of yourself, you have to keep showing up as an adult. Michelle recommends to just keep going back and reinforcing safety.\xa0 \xa0 Fixing Your Picker [29:34] \xa0 Marni refers back to Hannah B, the Bachelorette to ask Michelle why our pickers are sometimes broken. Hannah originally went for ‘Bad for Her Jed’ until she gained some clarity.\xa0 \xa0 Michelle recommends Hannah or any of you who may have a broken picker, to ask her inner child what happened that made her attracted to different guys. And to find information about what she gets out of choosing someone who is not the best for her.\xa0 \xa0 When we are in relationships we are looking for that person outside of ourselves to "complete" us. When what really need is to do fulfillment within ourselves first and then find someone who complements us, not complete us.\xa0 \xa0 Make a Connection: \xa0 The Adult Chair Website The Adult Chair Podcast Dating with Dignity Website DWDVIP  Get a Free Coaching Session with Marni on Our Podcast - Sign up Here to Be a Guest On Our Show Join Our Free Dating with Dignity Facebook Group Here! How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE | Marni welcomes Bachelor Nation’s Fanclub’s Rookie of the Year, Chris Gillis back to the Den to break down the Season Finale of The Bachelorette 2019. For all of you ladies out there, there are some important lessons to be learned from the episode.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 Key Takeaways:\xa0  The importance of being a direct, honest communicator. Why smart, beautiful, strong women still succumb to the devious wiles of their bad picker. How to break up with a guy without disrespecting him. Why it’s time to move past old-timey beliefs about male and female roles. How to read a guy’s body language during a conversation. Finding the courage to let someone go when they have done you wrong.  \xa0 Bye, Bye Pilot Pete [2:51] \xa0 Pete seemed perfect. He is a gentleman. He has a stable job as a pilot and he was really into Hannah. So, why would she let him go? Marni and Chris discuss the possible reasons Hannah passed on what seemed to be a great opportunity.\xa0 \xa0  Was he was too into her? Is he a pacifist? Was he too nice of a guy?  \xa0 Jed and Tyler Meet the Parents\xa0 [11:53] \xa0 It was obvious when Hannah’s parents met Jed they didn’t believe a singer/songwriter could financially provide for their daughter. Hannah, instead of stepping up to say what was important to her, immediately went into child mode and instead sought approval from her parents.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaway: As an adult,\xa0 you have the opportunity to decide what type of financial role you want your partner to play.\xa0 \xa0 Unlike Jed, Tyler made an immediate connection to Hannah’s parents through his direct and thoughtful communication.\xa0 \xa0 Hannah Chooses Jed [20:10] \xa0 In spite of all the turmoil, Hannah still chose Jed.\xa0 \xa0 Marni’s take — It’s a good reminder to not take things personally. Hannah has an unhealthy picker. She gravitated toward someone who wasn\'t in it for her highest-interest.\xa0 \xa0 During Hannah’s last date with Jed on the boat, we could all feel the tension between the two of them. If Hannah’s spidey-sense was tingling she chose to ignore it because she is attracted to unhealthy relationships.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 When Hannah confronts Jed about a People magazine article stating that he had not yet broken up with his girlfriend before joining the show, he admits he has been dishonest with her. His comments and his body language were signaling that he was done.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaway: When we are dating we don\'t ask enough questions and we just accept what a guy says without asking for clarity. \xa0 Tyler Gives it Another Shot [38:59] \xa0 After breaking up with Jed, Hannah asks Tyler out on a date. Tyler being the class act that he is, made a safe space for Hannah to regain her composure and femininity. He refused to manipulate her.\xa0 \xa0 It exposes and reminds all of us that sometimes we have to let go of something and it takes courage. \xa0 Chris’s take — Hannah had a delectable smorgasbord in front of her and she still couldn\'t eat, she still went heart hungry. \xa0 Takeaway: In the end, a bad picker can get in the way of your finding your true partner. It’s important to learn how to attract the right guy into your life.\xa0 \xa0 Make a Connection: Dating with Dignity Website DWDVIP  Get a Free Coaching Session with Marni on Our Podcast - Sign up Here to Be a Guest On Our Show Join Our Free Dating with Dignity Facebook Group Here! How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE | Marni welcomes dating expert, Damona Hoffman to the den to discuss pre-date texting. This in-depth discussion includes tips to get you out of the app and on to the date. \xa0 Key Takeaways: ● Should you text inside or outside a dating app? ● How often you should text before the first date? ● Is it appropriate to send a follow-up text after a date? ● The #1 thing you can do to become an excellent texter. ● 3 Pre-date texting rules. ● Should you use emojis when texting? ● How to respond to a simple ‘hey’ text. \xa0 Damona is a certified dating coach and the host of\xa0 the long-running podcast, Dates & Mates. She is a TV personality who has been in two A&E series, Black Love and A Question of Love. She is a contributor to CNN Headline News, BET, The Post and Oprah\'s O magazine. \xa0 Traps and Pitfalls of Texting [1:56] \xa0 Traps of pre-date texting: \xa0 ● Remember the whole point of texting is to move forward to get to the date. \xa0 ● One big mistake people make is sharing too much over text. There is very little context in texting and can be too revealing too soon. ● Texting is designed for information, not conversation. \xa0 3 Pre-date Texting Rules \xa0 [7:33] \xa0 The average text is responded to within 90 seconds. If the response doesn\'t happen in 24 hours there is a solid chance it won\'t happen. \xa0 A texting technique to adhere to is to make it feel like you are stepping into the middle of the conversation. Texting is designed for short burst communication and volleys back and forth. You want to be as concise as possible. If you thin it out you are more likely to get a response and it’s more likely to be read accurately. \xa0 3 Pre-date texting Rules \xa0 Keep it simple. Don\'t overwrite. Add emojis or mood modifiers to enhance what you mean. Avoid generic questions and ask compelling questions. \xa0 The #1 thing to do to be an excellent texter is to text like you talk to bring your personality out. \xa0 Is it OK to Send a Follow-up Text After a Date? [25:04] \xa0 In today’s dating scene, it is common place to send a text that night or the next morning. It\'s polite to say thank you, especially if a date bought dinner or drinks. \xa0 One trick is to send a statement or acknowledgement of something that happened on the date. Another technique, is to find a gif that adds humor and fun to the exchange. Think of texting as flirting with technology. \xa0 How to Respond to the ‘Hey’ Text [28:21] \xa0 If you receive a simple ‘Hey’ text respond with something cheeky. It depends on your interest level, of course. If you are using a dating app, and ‘Hey’ is their opening text, don’t respond. It\'s just weak. \xa0 Research says that men are worried about two things in dating: \xa0 1. That they will be thought of as a predator. 2. Being rejected. \xa0 Be clear when texting but give a guy some slack because a guy may not have the same awesome texting skills you do. \xa0 Make a Connection: Dating with Dignity Website DWDVIP Get a Free Coaching Session with Marni on Our Podcast - Sign up Here to Be a Guest On Our Show Join Our Free Dating with Dignity Facebook Group Here! How to Find a Quality Guy Without Going on 200 Dates - FREE | Marni and Man Panelist Chris Gillis commentate a play-by-play of The Bachelor 2019 semi-finals and how it relates to real-life dating obstacles. They break down the obvious narcissism, the mature display of anger, and how to properly handle a breakup. Hannah hasn’t made her final decision yet but Chris and Marni may already know who she will choose! \xa0 Somebody Save Me? [2:43] \xa0 Marni and Chris break down the moment in the Bachelor when it mirrors real-life relationships between narcissists and the people who are attracted to them. They grapple with why someone smart and beautiful like Hannah could be attracted to someone who is emotionally abusive. \xa0 Then, in what was easily the most impactful part of the show, Hannah speaks directly to the viewers and asks for forgiveness for her insecurity-driven choices. Chris appreciates her move and expands on it as an example of the things that make dating so hard. \xa0 Ladies, just because a man likes you doesn’t mean you have to like them! \xa0 How to Be Clear About Breaking Free [15:34] \xa0 Marni and Chris discuss the decisive moment when Hannah moves the podium as a physical boundary, to represent the emotional boundary she was actively enforcing. But even though she was saying it was over she continued to defend herself and create a new avenue for manipulation. \xa0 You have to right to disengage when someone doesn’t respect your boundaries! \xa0 How to Let a Relationship End [22:33] \xa0 If you have ever been on the receiving end of a breakup, you know it can be hard to accept. If the other person believes, even for a minute, there may be a chance to get back together they will act on it. Chris recommends closing the door completely when breaking up with a guy, especially manipulators. Being direct is best when saying goodbye and do not apologize for your actions. \xa0 Predictions for the Next Episode of The Bachelor [31:21] \xa0 If Hannah heals and moves on, Chris predicts a close call between her choosing Tyler or Jed. But Marni says even though Jed is leaking his unavailability, Hannah will still pick him. Remember that Jed is in an offscreen relationship that his parents don’t approve of.

Don\'t miss the October cohort of Power in Pleasure, my 5-week online course dedicated to exploring your pleasure. Details are at dawnserra.com/pleasurecourse. Enrollment closes soon!   This week, I\'m joined by Nora Samaran, author of the essay, "The Opposite of Rape Culture is Nurturance Culture" and the recently published book, Turn This World Inside Out: The Emergence of Nurturance Culture, out by AK Press. Grab the book here.   Nora and I spent three hours chatting the day we recorded this episode, so needless to say there was a lot for us to unpack and explore.   In the main episode for the show, we talk about nurturance culture, rape culture, raising the bar for the relationships we have and what it means to have relational responsibility, how our brains are wired for interdependence, attachment styles and how culturally we value avoidant attachment styles while vilifying anxious attachment styles.   We dive into why there\'s so much heartbreak in swimming against the current of neoliberalism and capitalism when we prioritize interdependence, but also the richness available there.   What does mutuality look like? What does care in our communities look like?   Nora offers some beautiful examples of what it means for communities to protect people facing harm while honoring the humanity of the person or people causing the harm, and how we can be more accountable in ways that nurture us all. She calls it the \'double move\' and it all starts with meeting the need without centering our own shame and guilt.   Then, for Patreon, our bonus conversation is all about gaslighting. It\'s fantastic. Nora shares how the culture we live in lies to itself and creates fictions, why we are all so disconnected and dissociated, why when we\'re addressing patterns of gaslighting and harm it\'s not a "meet in the middle" thing, the neurology of gaslighting, and trauma bonding.

When it first aired, I received loads of emails as a response, and since I\'m taking this week off to tend to me, it felt like a beautiful offering to tide you over until next week. I first saw Andy speak several years ago at a closing panel for Woodhull Sexual Freedom Summit, and I was in awe. You\'ll see why when you tune into our rich conversation. After reaching out to Andy, asking if they\'d like to talk about restorative and transformative justice as well as building resilient communities on the show, Andy also said they were thinking a lot about: -- the way orthodoxies of capitalism and scarcity infuse polyamorous community// polyamory should be inherently anti-capitalist -- the way the state is conspiring with your trauma -- disposability and anxiety and the fiction of moral purity -- resilience and bravery in sex and relationships -- what even is masculinity anyway RIGHT?!?! So, on this week\'s show, we talk about alternative justice, healing, building resilient relationships and communities, letting go of the fantasy of safety and why there are no good people, plus, we explore the power of anger, question what even is masculinity, and feel moved that the kids really will be alright. Patreon supporters - If you support the show at the $3 level and above, a new bonus is landing on Tuesday (so I can continue to take the weekend to rest). Listen and support the show at patreon.com/sgrpodcast Follow Sex Gets Real on Twitter and Facebook.\xa0It\'s true. Oh! And Dawn is on Instagram. In this episode, Andy and I talk about:  Andy’s take on restorative and transformative justice and how finding factors where the whole community can come together to heal is a form of radical love. The ways we\'ve been taught to believe in good versus bad, heroes versus villains, and why that feeds our hunger for punishment and violence. But punishment doesn\'t heal wounds or create strong communities, so what\'s the alternative? The fantasy we have to let go of around punishment and banishment when someone does something harmful, and how safety is an illusion. Why we can banish all the "abusers" from the island if we expect to have community. Andy\'s definition for community and how we can start building that kind of fierce support in a tiny way. The power of our anger, and what happens when the people in our life can hold that anger with us. We also talk about how damn resilient relationships become when we\'re can fuck up and know we won\'t be abandoned or discarded. Cultivating resilience in interpersonal relationships and communities. Knowing how you want your community to be/look like and how it should be a space where you feel safe and supported. The hard work around radical love and that it’s not always rainbows and butterflies. It’s actually really hard work Masculinity: What it would be like if it was not toxic and infused with violent misogyny? What even is masculinity? Imagining a world that just accepts us as who we are and who we want to be, opens the question of whether or not we’ll have a different language for what we have now? The excitement and the honest truth that the kids are alright. They will be. Period.  About Andy Izenson:  Andy Izenson is an attorney with Diana Adams Law & Mediation, PLLC, and is a collaborative practitioner, mediator, and passionate advocate, working to reframe conflict through a compassionate and transformative lens.

The October Cohort of my 5-week online course, Power in Pleasure, is enrolling NOW. We kick off Sunday, October 14th and it\'s going to be amazing. Learn more and enroll here: dawnserra.com/pleasurecourse (it costs as much as a single coaching session but includes six live calls and five weeks of daily emails bursting with powerful prompts and questions). Join us!    This week, it\'s me and you!   First up, I share a fascinating and crucial thread by Nicole Bedera on why rape allegations do not "ruin" lives. Grab the link to read it and share it here.   This is such a relevant conversation, and pairs perfectly with an awesome post that made the rounds this week by Jennifer Michelle Greenberg. You can check it out along with my thoughts here.   In short, speaking your truth about abuse and harm does not ruin lives and we all have a responsibility to take more action around instances of harm. This is not an individual problem but a communal and collective one.   Then, I field your emails.   Libby wanted to share some feedback and thanks, which felt amazing to receive.   From Help Me to Help Myself wrote in because they feel extreme shame around masturbating and don\'t know what to do. They experienced abuse and were raised in a very sex negative and Christian household, so masturbation feels complicated. How can they change their relationship with self-pleasure?   Finally, Brian is worried his fetish means something about his sexuality. You see, he is straight, but he has a fetish for penises and semen, especially around performing oral on a trans person. So what does it all mean and where did this come from?   I do a deep dive into genitals, identity, and sexuality. I also want all of us to check out three articles about sex with trans women. Head to dawnserra.com/ep279 for those links.   Finally, Patrons, this week\'s bonus will be a short reading and meditation with some journal prompts about masturbation and our pleasure stories.

Mare is struggling because she betrayed her partner. He didn\'t want to open their relationship and she did, so she betrayed their agreement and now things are terrible. She feels guilty and ashamed, and wants some thoughts on the whole situation. Anonymous Girl has always considered herself to be straight, but she\'s getting bored of sex with men, and is starting to feel really curious about sex with people of other genders. Should she go for it? And how? Finally, Sydney Faith Rose recently wrote something amazing about how many women are talking about their anxious attachment, but how maybe instead of seeing it as something to fix, it\'s instead a huge sign that there are very good reasons to be anxious right now. I explore some of the limitations of attachment theory and offer some questions for us all to sit with. Did you know you can support the show?

To get us started, I came across two threads all about love and the simple ways we care for each other. I\'d love to hear from you one the little things people in your life do that make you feel loved and what made you think "yeah, I want this human in my life for awhile". Platonic, creative, sexual, romantic - it doesn\'t matter. Let\'s start a love fest. Email me with your story! I also want to take some time to share that a porn performer named Rooster has come forward about abuse they experienced on the set of an Erika Lust film by guest director Olympia de G. I share some thoughts on how we can do better around accountability and complexity, but I think the most important thing is hearing from Rooster and centering their experience. On to your emails. Kate\'s boyfriend has a coworker who is pretty disrespectful with boundaries, but despite that, had an initially shitty situation turn into something super sexy and fun. Go Kate! Next up, Elizabeth has just recently started dating a couple. Things are going great, but the woman asked Elizabeth not to wear crop tops around their daughter and Elizabeth isn\'t sure if she\'s being shamed or not for her clothing. What gives? Finally, CassyBoBassy is curious about body trust. As someone who struggled with dieting and a family who vilified fat bodies, Cassy is starting to see there might be another way to experience pleasure and break-up with shame, but what does it mean to trust your body and how can she feel less lost?

And can they give this person a gift before they leave this job?\xa0 Crushes are totally normal, and there are so many kinds of crushes! Friend crushes, admiration crushes, appreciation crushes, sexual crushes, and many more. It sounds like Crushing is having a friend crush, but let\'s talk about crushes and how we can all enjoy them and validate those feelings without being out of alignment with our values.

It\'s also an important invitation to us all to think about who we critique and who we harm when we take "ethical" stances against certain companies or practices, especially that ultimately then benefit our own interests. You can read Tristan Taormino\'s additional thoughts about the sexuality field and the ways work in this field continues to be devalued and exploited, particularly for people of color and other people who are marginalized. We must all do better. This impacts our abilities to be present with each other. This impacts our abilities to be in our bodies, experiencing pleasure, building a most just world. It matters.\xa0 Read these accounts by Ev\'Yan, Ashleigh, Karmenife, La\'Shaunae, Venus Cuffs, and Cameron and take a few moments to reflect. Tristan is here this week! And it\'s EPIC. Oh how I love chatting with Tristan. And you\'re about to hear why - we GO places in this 90 minute conversation of lusciousness. It all started when I asked Tristan to come on the show to tell us about her ultra personal new memoir which dives deep into her childhood, growing up with a gay dad, losing him to AIDS, and even part of a memoir her dad wrote about his life. In fact, if you want to read snippets and get exclusive updates, support Tristan\'s Patreon:\xa0patreon.com/tristantaormino But, in this episode we also talk about fat phobia, changing and aging bodies, capitalism, white supremacy, the sexuality field, and much much more.

It was a longer and more challenging labor than her last one and the birth and postpartum involved some difficult and scary moments.

She’s had two homebirths (both with our very own kween Karly!) and she came on the show to share about her experiences. On paper, both of her births were very similar – relatively straightforward home births – but her personal experience was quite different each time. Her first birth challenged her in ways she couldn’t have imagined, including a very prolonged pushing phase (7 hours!) and an extremely challenging postpartum period. Given her first experience, she prepared carefully for her second baby, focusing specifically on her bulletproof plan for a healing and restful postpartum period.

We are definitely excited about the upcoming lifestyle travel we have planned and about the fall party scene. It’s been a challenging summer for us as we have been juggling some health issues while still fitting in time for our active swinging schedule. We aren’t complaining. It’s been a great summer but, now back to full health, fall is going to be even better.As with last month’s question about bisexual men in the lifestyle, one of this month's questions really struck a raw nerve with some listeners and we were flooded with answers on the subject of women’s insecurities about the size and shape of their labia. It’s a fascinating topic. In this episode we also discuss, being too soft and gentle in play and, as avid travelers, we talk about the best way to book your lifestyle vacations.As we’ve intimated in the past, Paige has been dealing with a painful and stressful health issue regarding her breast. In our diary story for this show, we pull back the curtain and give you the details of how this injury actually occurred and in doing so, demonstrate how important it is to be respectful, gentle, careful, communicative and responsive during play. | Want to know what happens at the world largest swingers convention when dozens of sexy women kick all their husbands out of the room and, while drinking mimosas, let go of all of their inhibitions? If you're thinking toenail painting which evolves into pillow fights and then a wild all-girl, kitten-pile style orgy… then you would be wrong. But, while not quite as titillating, when, at Naughty in New Orleans, these women pulled out the microphones and pushed record with no men to interrupt or talk over them, the result was some fantastic and insightful conversation. Consider it a girl-power, brain orgy.In this bonus episode, we present Part 2 of the three part series of the recording that happened in that room in New Orleans. If you have not heard Part 1, stop right here. Go immediately to the Two or More to Tango Podcast (Episode 31) and listen to the beginning part of the discussion so you can pick up the conversation here on Swinger Diaries. When you’re finished listening, you will surly want to hear the conclusion which is posted on the Average Swingers Podcast (Episode 115).It was a casual, raw, fun-filled morning of girl talk. I was flattered to be included in the conversation and even more honored to be able to call all of these amazing women, my friends. | We're back from the biggest swingers convention in the world, Naughty in New Orleans, and every year it seems to grow more massive and more exciting. One of the highlights of this year’s trip was a special recording made by the “Ladies of the Lifestyle” (LOL), a group of podcasting women who all got together, with no men in the room, to talk about the topics that affect women in the swinging lifestyle. You’ll be able to hear all three parts of that recoding by tuning into the special bonus episodes soon to be released on the Two or More to Tango Podcast for part one, then right here on Swinger Diaries for the second segment, and then the wrap up of the conversation on the Average Swingers Podcast. We think you’ll enjoy the casual but insightful banter of these sexy ladies.After a fantastic house party last month, for this episode’s The Best of the Lifestyle segment, we were inspired to discuss the characteristics and attributes of the best swinger house parties. We also answer a listener’s question about how to broach the topic of swinging with your spouse in a way that doesn’t cause indignance and insult. However, the most engaging question of this show, as evidenced by the deluge of emails we received, was the topic of bisexual men in the lifestyle and why they are still so closeted in the general swinging population. Our listeners had some pretty powerful replies.We do love to travel and have been to most of the biggest lifestyle venues in North America. This episode’s diary story is about an encounter we had at Temptation Resort in Cancun. Unlike Desire, in this wild party atmosphere where the crowd isn’t always made up of the classic heteronormative male-female couples, Penn came face to face with an obvious and open invitation to explore some play with men and… well, lets just say that the night did end in a pile of same-sex bodies. | We are so lucky. We live an amazing life. Sometimes we have to pinch ourselves to believe it's real. Almost every weekend this past month we have traveled all over the country to visit amazing sexy venues, parties and friends. Even though this podcast is entertainment and information for our listeners, it's also our diary and so in this episode we indulge ourselves with a few minutes of memories as we recount our recent adventures.Because we visit so many great events, in The Best or the Lifestyle we discuss the best themes\xa0 that party planners can use to get the maximum participation by their guests. We then ask a question of our listeners for our own benefit because we don’t know the answer and we get a little lesson about the benefits of separate room play. Our listen’s question is a great one too. It's all about the inconsistency of condom use for oral and vaginal sex in the swinging lifestyle.\xa0We don’t play separate, not really as rule but more as a preference, but this month’s diary story is the memory of an encounter where we pushed that boundary. The experience was interesting but it definitely cemented our feeling that, for us, we will always have and always will prefer to be together when it come to playtime. | Podcasts are such a powerful medium. Not only because they share so much unfiltered, valuable information, but because the create a very real and intense one-sided friendship between hosts and listeners. We know. We are both hosts and listeners of so many shows. In the spirit of wanting to complete the open circle of friendship with our listeners, we have some fantastic events coming up this year and we would love to have you join us. From meet and greets, to NIN, to our annual Desire trip, to the epic Podcast-a-Palooza, we would love to meet you in person. Come travel and party with us!Some topics really touch a raw nerve with listeners and solicit a deluge of responses. This is one of those shows. In the Best one the Lifestyle segment, we talk about the best websites to use to buy your sexy swinging outfits and accessories. Then we discus our question (which we shamelessly stole from themonogamishmarriage.com) about whether or not we SHOULD be telling our kids about the lifestyle. Finally, listeners write in amazingly insightful answers to a request for advice about how to handle a couple that wants an exclusive relationship.Our diary story is a cautionary tale about our friendship with a couple that crossed the line from casual sexy play to deep and real emotional connection. Some people prefer the casual hook ups, some want a long and deep relationship and some are searching for polyamory. The awkward, painful, frustrating friction happens when not everybody is on the same page. | As we decompress and recover from our week in Desire’s lap of sexy luxury last month, we begin to look forward to new adventures. Our next exciting event is this summer’s NIN convention. It should be epic, as it is every year.In this episode’s The Best of the Lifestyle segment, we discuss an often-asked question which is frequently posed by newbies about what, in our opinion, is the best swingers’ dating website and what makes some sites better than others. Once your are on a site, it probably won’t take you very long to get an unsolicited, generic greeting from a stranger. Some sites call it a poke, some a flirt, some call it blowing kisses, but what are you supposed to do with that compliment and vague invitation, answer back or ignore? What’s the proper etiquette? Lastly, as always, we attempt to reply to a request for advice from listeners. This question is about how to approach a couple without intimidating them by the fact that you are a threesome. Thankfully, our listeners, gave some sage advice.Our diary story this month is about a much anticipated get-together with a couple we met online. Prior to the big date, we scoured their profile for every detail. They seemed perfect but, unfortunately they neglected to correctly report one very important detail on their profile and the revelation of some unexpected information changed the trajectory of the evening. | We anticipated it for a whole year but it was worth the wait! This episode was recorded LIVE in the disco at Desire RM where a flatteringly huge audience of people took time away from the week-long naked party to join us and help answer questions. It was another epic week for us and this recording gives you just a taste of the kind of sexy, provocative and fascinating conversations that were had in the jacuzzi every afternoon.\xa0In the Best of the Lifestyle segment our live audience discussed a breakdown of the differences and similarities between Desire RM and Desire Pearl. Then we shifted gears to discuss the best way to make an invitation to another couple for play. Finally, we all struggled with the question of age in the LS. How young is too young and can you ever get over the weirdness of playing with people who are your kids’ ages?Our Diary Story in this show was a very fresh memory. It actually happened at Desire the very night before we recorded. Although we are Desire veterans and experienced swingers, even we struggle with “sealing the deal”. This situation reminded us of the importance of being clear and bold in making the invitation to play, even when it's with great friends, or you just might miss out on some fantastic experiences. | After an unusual week when we found ourselves in two different Midwest lifestyle clubs in two different states in only 48 hours, we got to thinking about clubs and what makes some better or worse to us for our particular party preferences. So, in this episode’s, The Best of the Lifestyle segment, we review Midwest clubs. Because we live in the Midwest, we’ve been to quite a few but not nearly all of them so we’d love to hear listeners’ opinions about their experiences too.Our question for this episode is about whether swingers like the “shock factor” of being able to confuse and titilate observers and eavesdroppers when they are in vanilla settings. To us it seems like the answer comes down to a personal enjoyment or aversion to being an exhibitionist at heart. Our listener’s question comes from a single guy who plays separately with a hall pass and he asks if it's really necessary or even fair that so many couples seem to require verification from his wife before they play. After all, we are all consenting adults aren’t we? But on the other hand, nobody wants to be a home-wrecker either.While most of our diary stories are of our memories of fun sexy play experiences with other people, what’s rarely said on our podcast is that at the end of a fun night of clubbing, we often end up just wanting to play together. Sometimes, like in this episode’s story, just the flirting and watching and sexy atmosphere is all the entertainment we need and the show that naturally exists at a great lifestyle club leads to a hot encounter for just the two of us. | As we begin Book 3 of Swinger Diaries, we recall the milestones we’ve passed on our podcasting journey and then introduce our new format which involves answering one question of our’s, one directly from a listener, and our new segment, The Best of the Lifestyle, where we review the largest swinger’s convention in Canada. It’s a huge hotel takeover that happens every year in the beginning of February and its called Valentines in Niagra.As we will in all Book 3 episodes, we discuss one philosophical question of ours. This time it’s about the veto power and who uses it more often, him or her. Then we we have a conversation about a related question that was asked by a listener about how to handle an unequal attraction to another couple.Our diary story is one of the hardest we've ever re-told. We have avoided recounting it many times in past episodes because, even years later, the memory is still so painful for Paige. It’s an emotional story for us but it reminds us that sometimes, in the sensitive world of the lifestyle, tact and sensitivity are as important as honesty. While growth may come from the discomfort of challenging yourself, for us, first and foremost, this lifestyle adventure is about our fun as a couple and so we consciously choose to pursue only the encounters that we both enjoy. | In this, our final episode of Book 2, we take a few minutes to look back, look around, and look forward to the future of Swinger Diaries. We never imagined that this podcast would become so well-received as it has or that we would make so many contacts with amazing people through it, but as we contemplate the potential of Book 3, we can't help but ask ourselves if we are nearing the end of our show. We think not.The final three questions for Book 2 are as challenging as usual. In this episode we ask our listeners for their opinions on the topic of whether or not its acceptable to prefer play with a person based solely on his or her ethnicity or race. Then we discuss the best tactics for playing “defense”. Lastly, we give our opinions and hear from listeners about whether it’s better to go on swinging vacations with a group or just the two of you.As huge Desire fans, we knew where we wanted to go for our 25th wedding anniversary, but we didn’t know that we would be sharing the celebration with a couple from the other side of the world. While everybody believes they are selective, sometimes, in just the right mood, with the just right attitude, on just the right night, sexy encounters can find you when you aren’t expecting them. This night, the source of our pleasure came in the form of an exotic accent that was so charming that it was irresistible to Paige.", 'chan_desc': 'Dear diary… We never expected to become swingers. We actually resisted it for a long time. Now, we just can’t deny it anymore. Its too much fun and this amazing journey has it given us some secret sexy stories to tell! This podcast, is our attempt to educate, entertain and  “pay it forward” to all the curious, skeptical, and nervous future swingers out there. We hope to expose you to a few things about the joys and benefits of swinging and help steer you away from some of the drama.

She returns to the show to talk about the important topic of the difference between addiction and physical dependence, and what each experience looks like in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Schneider also talks about what physical dependence is, the signs of addiction, and why the two continue to get confused. Dr. Schneider and Rob also discuss how we can manage situations as consumers truly looking for effective pain management, and provide resources where people can learn more and reach out for further help.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [4:53] Dr. Schneider defines physical dependence as the drug-producing a change in your body as a response to no longer taking the drug.\xa0 [6:48] When you stop taking a drug suddenly, you will not only experience withdrawal symptoms resulting from your physical dependence, but you will likely also resume the symptoms responsible for taking the medication in the first place.\xa0 [8:20] Opioids have two different effects. One is that they cause physical dependence, or your body’s response of adapting to them. The other is they cause addiction.\xa0 [9:55] There is a misunderstanding when using the term “chemically dependent” and referring only to an addict. Physical dependency happens to everyone that is on an opioid after a few days, and the body adjusts to the prescribed dosage.\xa0 [13:42] Dr. Schneider categorizes addiction into these following descriptions:\xa0  The loss of control and inability to stop, or to use the medication as prescribed.\xa0 Continuation to use despite significant and adverse consequences.\xa0 Preoccupation with use of the drugs.\xa0  [19:48] Although it is harder than ever to get a prescription for opioids to manage pain, the drug-related overdose deaths are at an all-time high. This is for many reasons, one being that now people are starting to get their drugs on the street, leading to them taking drugs that could be mixed with dangerous and even lethal substances.\xa0 [22:14] There have also been some findings that opioids may treat depression and anxiety, and people may find themselves feeling better not only because their pain is treated, but their mood may be better than ever.\xa0 [26:10] Tolerance is still a concept that there is much misunderstanding about. With opioids, some side effects people develop a tolerance to, and some people continue to have the same effects. Dr. Schneider shares a personal story on how pain isn’t the same due to the disease progression, not the opioids.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com\xa0  Back from Betrayal\xa0  Closer Together Further Apart  Always Turned On\xa0 Jennifer Schneider\xa0  The 5 Most Misunderstood Terms in Pain Medicine   QUOTES:  “There’s been confusion about the word ‘dependent’.”\xa0 “We need to avoid the word ‘dependent’ because it’s good to rely on a medication that can save your life.”\xa0 “Addiction is about behavior.”\xa0 “There are people who are in genuine pain and now the response is ‘You are just going to have to deal with it’.”\xa0  | Dr. Sonnee Weedn, Ph.D., is a clinical and forensic psychologist in private practice in Novato, CA with a newly added satellite office in her hometown of Newport Beach, CA. She is also the author of Many Blessings and a contributor to Making Advances. Dr. Weedn joins the show to talk about the 8 Ways to Wellbeing For Recovering People Workbook, and how her work with Dr. Walsh led her to pull together these foundational habits that create profound results for those in healing and recovery. Dr. Weedn names the 8 ways to wellbeing, and actionable ways we can get started in moving ahead with each one.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [5:20] Dr. Weedn was asked to present at the Tibetan Medical Conference, and she thought long and hard about how to best inform an International audience made up of many types of culture. She was previously introduced to the work of Dr. Roger Walsh, a professor at UC Irvine Medical School, and realized how his evidence-based research could very much work for those in recovery.\xa0 [6:23] Lifestyle habits are foundational to support both our physical and mental health.\xa0 [10:03] These healthy lifestyle habits are cross-culturally relevant, and anyone can do them at little cost. It’s also important for people to note that they won’t see drastic change all at once. The point is not to get overwhelmed, it’s to make little changes here and there that will bring their emotional life into as much balance as possible.\xa0 [13:55] The 8 Ways to Wellbeing:\xa0  Nutrition. Having good, nutritious and pure food is important. Read food labels and feed yourself well. Good nutrition is so important for recovery from any malady, physical or mental.\xa0 Exercise. Exercise keeps the brain healthy and the blood pumping. We are meant to move every day, and even just a brisk walk is a great start.\xa0  Relaxation. Dr. Weedn refers to it as rest without sleeping, and something that takes us away from the hustle and bustle and creates a sense of peace and mindfulness.\xa0 Recreation. This aspect is important, especially for people with addiction.\xa0  Relationship. May be the most important in terms of mental health. The more positive interactions we have, the better off we will be mentally. Good relationship skills can be learned over time.\xa0 Time in nature. Nature is healing. Get outdoors every day.\xa0 Giving back. A spirit of altruism reminds us that there is life beyond us.\xa0 Spiritual Practice that is definable. Whether it’s religious or you make up your own, it needs to emphasize love, acceptance, generosity and meaning.\xa0  \xa0 [31:48] It’s all about accountability, and holding the space for yourself and others to do the work. In the workbook, there are sections where you can name who will hold you accountable.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com Dr. Sonnee Weedn\xa0 Eight Ways to Wellbeing Angeles Arrien\xa0 8 Ways to Wellbeing YouTube\xa0 drsonnee@aol.com  Dr. Roger Walsh\xa0  Tibetan Medical Conference\xa0 \xa0 QUOTES:  “Our daily healthy habits support our mental and physical health.”\xa0 “We have to feed people well in order to help them heal.”\xa0 “This is the work of a lifetime, and it doesn’t happen in 30 days of treatment.”\xa0 “Nature is always changing, and it’s a good place for us to be when we are in change.”\xa0  | Dr. Jennifer Schneider, M.D., PhD, is a nationally recognized expert in addictive sexual disorders and in the management of chronic pain with opioids, an area that certainly needs more exposure. She joins the show to talk about what happens when a betrayed partner feels as though they want to end the relationship and a few real-life examples of why someone may want to leave for good. She gives her own personal experience with the subject and discusses the personal growth that needs to occur in order for someone to walk away. She and Rob also discuss the books they have written together, the importance of support groups, and resources for betrayed partners experiencing trauma.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [1:57] Dr. Schneider is the author of 15 books and numerous articles in professional journals. She and Rob also have written two together, including Closer Together, Further Apart and Always Turned On. [4:00] Dr. Schneider was a betrayed partner herself and discusses the self confidence and awareness she developed to get clarity and realize she was ready to leave the situation.\xa0 [5:26] Betrayed partners need support, and they have to be okay with the independence and inner work that comes with leaving a situation that no longer serves them.\xa0 [13:15] The partner that acted out may have a totally different story after recovery than while they are in a mode of lying and cheating. It is possible that partners will find out later that there are even more lies than they thought, and they have to decide whether they want to stick around to make that distinction or not.\xa0 [15:48] Dr. Schneider found that things shifted for her own personal relationship once she was able to understand the patterns and behavior of her then husband. She took a first step by going to Al-Anon, and began to get the skills and self esteem to build up her own self confidence.\xa0 [18:10] There is power in support from others. Dr. Schneider has found it very beneficial to attend support groups and found the benefits one of the biggest gifts in healing. [21:55] Betrayed partners are going through a major trauma, but Dr. Schneider doesn’t see them as solely a victim.\xa0 [24:02] By healing our own wounds we become less needy and vulnerable, and are able to make better decisions intellectually about love.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com  Back from Betrayal\xa0  Sex, Lies, and Forgiveness  Closer Together, Further Apart  Always Turned On Al-Anon Jennifer Schneider\xa0 \xa0 QUOTES:  “The answer comes from who you are, and what you want from life and yourself.”\xa0 “As long as it’s too fearful to end the relationship, you will stay and make excuses.”\xa0 “All of our needs come up when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable.”\xa0  | Dina Haddad is a family law mediator and principal of Families First Mediation. She joins the show this week to talk with Rob about the options couples have when being together isn’t the best option, and how she helps her clients navigate the often painful and rocky road of not being together. Dina talks about what it is they do in meditation, the difference between mediation and litigation, and why it’s important for couples to try and work together on coming to an agreement that works in the best interest of everyone.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [3:45] Reconciliation can work for some couples, but it is not always the best answer. Dina works with clients who feel they are better off parting ways, and explains the different choices they face when getting divorced.\xa0 [5:02] Litigation uses the court system to complete divorce. Through attorney representation, litigation can be very cut and dry and much of the time is used on rule abiding and procedural matters. Mediation puts the parties in control while still getting guidance and support on the laws through experts like Dina. Mediation is also far less expensive than traditional choices such as litigation.\xa0 [11:10] The process of divorce can be extremely emotionally challenging for all parties, especially betrayed partners who are experiencing much hurt and anger. If it’s appropriate for the situation, Dina can recommend a therapist for her clients to work with throughout the process.\xa0 [13:13] Working with a professional also provides structure, confidentially, and an objective third party.\xa0 [17:28] Dina has created a DIY program for divorce in California called The Complete Divorce. This takes couples from beginning to end in the process and explains all the forms with step by step tutorials. There are also resources provided if they do want to talk with a professional for even further support.\xa0 [23:08] When there is hurt and pain involved, couples will want to punish their partner, come up with scare tactics, or even just make things “fair”. The law doesn’t always cater to this, and this is why it’s important for couples to take a step back and come up with a manageable and efficient parenting plan for all involved.\xa0 [28:12] Parenting schedules can be different for every family, and can suit whatever is best for the children and the parents.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com Families First Mediation San Jose Counseling\xa0 \xa0 QUOTES:  “The scariest part of divorce is being confronted in a very difficult time in your life with a very difficult legal process.” “Healing your relationship doesn’t always mean staying together.” “Everybody has a different sense of fairness, it just depends on what side you are sitting at.”  | Dr. Todd Love is a board-certified coach, licensed professional counselor and licensed attorney with a unique and broad background. He joins the show to talk with Rob about his own clinical practice in Athens, GA and exactly what ADHD is, how we diagnose it, and why it so strongly affects both the healing of addictions and relationship issues. Dr. Love shares his own personal experience with ADHD, what he has seen change in the field of diagnosis and treatment for ADHD throughout the years, the symptoms and signs, and what recovery may look like. Dr. Love and Rob also discuss how it shows up in childhood, relationships, and addiction, as well as resources where someone could get an evaluation.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [2:54] Historically, people thought of ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) as something that affected only children, and more specifically, young males. It is now a more or less equal issue and shows up in more places than just the early childhood classroom.\xa0 [4:38] ADHD is a whole other different type of issue than mania.\xa0 [5:27] If you run into a therapist who has worked with that issue for a while and have safety and understanding, work with this person as they are likely to have empathy and compassion towards that subject.\xa0 [6:08] Up to 20-40% of “intensity seekers” have an existing ADHD problem that is contributing to or the cause of an addiction. Intensity seekers can be thrill seeking or novelty seeking that leads to problem behavior patterns such as gambling, sex addiction and overspending. [8:41] In order to get the ADHD diagnosis, the addiction would need to be quelled. A lot of treatment centers don’t screen for ADHD and instead look for disorders, and they may even have people stop their medications, which makes the problem worse.\xa0 [13:41] It can be a very emotional shift for an adult who gets diagnosed and treated after years of struggling with symptoms and consequences from problematic behaviors due to their ADHD.\xa0 [19:40] The partner of someone with ADHD needs to have compassion and understanding on this issue, otherwise it may cause a lot of frustration, miscommunication, and resentment. Dr. Love makes himself vulnerable and discloses that he does have ADHD, so others know he isn’t being rude or dismissive if he is moving around or distracted while talking.\xa0 [26:43] Official diagnosis come from doctors or neuropsychological testing, since school systems require formal diagnosing. This information can then be brought to a therapist or psychiatrist.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among longer-term prison inmates is a prevalent, persistent and disabling disorder  The Couples Guide to Thriving With ADHD\xa0 CHADD\xa0 ADD.org\xa0 DocToddLove.com  QUOTES:  “Don’t be afraid of those who have worked through their own issues and are now working with you.”\xa0 “You make yourself intimate to people by telling them things you would rather hide.”\xa0 “In order to make it intimate, and for us to be real with each other, I have to tell you my truth.”\xa0 “If you live with someone with ADHD, it requires a consistent compromise to make it work.”\xa0  | Carol Juergensen\xa0Sheets, Coach, Columnist, Therapist and Speaker joins the show today to talk about her best selling workbook and roadmap, Help. Her. Heal, written to help both betrayed partners and addicts overcome the trauma associated with infidelity. She and Rob talk about her focus on empathy towards the betrayed partner, and resources within the workbook where couples can start rebuilding trust and intimacy. Carol is always one step ahead in the field, and spreads her message to thousands using her coaching, videos, books, and podcasts.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [2:28] Many times sex addicts struggle with truly feeling empathatic towards the partner they betrayed. Carol’s techniques and formulas help the addict learn to acknowledge pain, validate the partner’s feelings, and reassure that things in the future will be different. When we work from the premise that the sex addict is the one responsible for the pain, we can start to rebuild (or build) empathy, and it is a cyclical dance of healing for both.\xa0 [5:32] Carol describes her formula for empathy and building trust:\xa0  Acknowledge the issue and the source of pain (take responsibility).\xa0 Validate the feelings of their partner instead of dismissing or minimizing them. Learn to identify what they see on their partner such as anger, sadness, loneliness, fear or happiness.\xa0 Identify the plan in forward-thinking and be ready to be a safe container for all their fears and feelings throughout the process.\xa0  [11:34] After a betrayal, it may not always get back to normal right away or even ever at all. It is important that both parties stick through the process and continue to do their best to be honest and vulnerable.\xa0 [11:51] Carol explains that out of every trauma that anyone can go through, partner betrayal ranks very high towards the top. A trauma bond occurs and if not worked through, the partner will most likely not be able to trust again.\xa0 [13:02] Healing isn’t an overnight process. It may take the same amount of time in healing for betrayal as it does for an addict to heal their brain, sometimes even over 3-5 years.\xa0 [18:40] Working on the relationship provides an opportunity for parents to show their children what it looks like when two adults trust, respect, and listen to each other.\xa0 [23:11] Help. Her. Heal is something the addict will read and buy, but the betrayed partner is encouraged to be in on the work as well. It will work best when they use it and apply the principles together. The work can also be shared with any therapist or clinician the couple is working with.\xa0 [24:55] Carol has the oldest running podcast in the field of sexual addiction and partner betrayal on the internet.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com\xa0  Out of the Doghouse  Help.

Kim and Rob discuss the differences between the Prodependence model vs. Codependence, the interesting results she is finding using this model at her own center, and what is helpful for partners to understand when dealing with betrayal and loving an addict. She and Rob also share why the Prodependence model gives betrayed partners support and compassion in crisis rather than judgment or blame, along with the freedom to examine themselves as much as they wish, when they wish.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [5:05] Betrayed partners are typically in deep trauma and crisis when dealing with the bad behavior of their addict, and understanding Prodependence gives the perspective of supporting them in their desire to just try and be helpful, instead of being the cause or the one to blame.\xa0 [9:30] Kim has her clients look at what is right in the relationship, and what, if anything, is worth saving.\xa0 [11:33] Instead of looking for a pathology or reason the betrayed partner caused the addicts behavior, Prodependence deals with the crisis at hand to try and let the partner feel their feelings and begin to get some sense of safety while in such trauma.\xa0 [13:50] While other models talk more about the betrayed partners history and past, often times they are just there to get support in the moment.\xa0 [16:04] Betrayed partners tend to let go of their own care while attempting to save their relationship and family. In this time of emotional freefall, judging them only produces more fear, hurt, shame and self doubt.\xa0 [22:22] It is very common for addicts to blame the spouse, and that also is very hurtful.\xa0 [24:10] Kim works with her betrayed clients to validate and support them, show them it wasn’t their fault for the addicts behavior, then help them find boundaries and useful ways to show up in the relationship if they choose to continue.\xa0 [26:33] Codependency often calls for detaching from the addict so they can suffer on their own, but this is not always sustainable or healthy for either partners. We have to figure out what is saveable and why they want to be in the relationship, and then work on it from there.\xa0 [29:22] Kim finds it’s a natural process to want more understanding down the road, but they can explore the past later once the crisis is over.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com\xa0 William White\xa0 KBuck@familystrategies.org\xa0 Family Strategies Counseling Center \xa0 QUOTES:  “We have to look at strengths individually, and what has gone right in this relationship and what you want to save.”\xa0 “When you love someone, you just do what you can to make their life better.”\xa0 “Don’t question your love for someone.”\xa0 “What I really need, is just space to feel.”\xa0 “It’s very easy for caretakers to find themselves in a deficit.”\xa0 “The most power you have is a gentle invitation that is offered by example.”\xa0  \xa0 | Dan Griffin, M.A. is an internationally recognized author, thought leader, and expert who has dedicated his life and work to redefining what it means to be a man in the 21st century. He joins the show this week to talk with Rob about rewriting the rules and rigidity of what it means to really be a man, and the benefits men can get when they get in touch with their own feelings and deeply connect with others.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [2:57] A few of the rules that the world has set up for boys at a young age to define what makes a real man:\xa0  Don’t cry. Real men don’t cry, and if you do it shows weakness.\xa0 Don’t ask for help.\xa0 Don’t be weak or vulnerable, or “like a girl”.\xa0 Don’t be gay.\xa0 Be a protector and provider.\xa0 Use sex as the main form of intimacy, and have as sex with as many hot chicks as possible.\xa0 Success defines who we are, and second place is the first loser.\xa0  [8:04] A large portion of men find they have no one to talk to or deeply communicate with, and this further creates a disconnection to self and the tendency to shut out others.\xa0 [11:21] We’re all like fish in the water, feeding off the same environment affecting each other with our actions. When an environment is supportive and fosters growth, it is more likely a man will shine and feel comfortable to show his true self.\xa0\xa0 [12:03] The rules themselves aren’t bad, but get in the way because they mandate without choice. There’s nothing wrong with strength and power, it's rigidity that blocks emotion and connection.\xa0 [14:43] Gay men have an experience of having multiple rules: ones set up for gay men, women and straight men all at once.\xa0 [20:38] We would all benefit if men are able to get in touch with their own emotions, and in turn they could access more empathy and understanding when women share their story. [28:02] Crisis can be an opportunity to get vulnerable and open us up to meaningful, deep conversation.\xa0\xa0 [28:39] Each man has the right to choose what type of man he wants to be, which Dan terms as conscious masculinity.\xa0 [29:44] Men define intimacy via sex, and it is important to talk about breakdowns in the area before it gets to point where the partner cheats.\xa0 [33:18] With suicide rates being higher than ever, the impact of feeling isolated and disconnected is more serious than it’s ever been.\xa0 [35:17] We highly benefit when we go below the surface the people in our lives and show them the true authentic selves.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com\xa0 Dan Griffin\xa0  A Man’s Way Through Relationships\xa0 Terry Real\xa0  I Don’t Want to Talk About It\xa0  Dr. Allen Berger\xa0 American Psychological Association\xa0 The Good Men Project\xa0  QUOTES:  “This is the armor that protects us, and it’s not a well constructed identity.”\xa0 “When you are alone and you look in the mirror, can you hold eye contact with the man that you see?”\xa0 “Such an amazing opportunity for connection and love gets undone because we can’t talk to each other.”\xa0 “It starts with taking a risk, and men have to be willing to take a risk to open up to somebody else.”\xa0 “The man rules are antisocial and narcissistic.”\xa0  | Ian Friedman is one of the most sought after criminal defense lawyers in the country, and a partner at the Cleveland based firm Friedman and Nemecek. He joins the show to talk with Rob about the diverse nature of cases that he takes on, including criminal, cyber crimes and white collar manners. He talks about the law needing to catch up with the new crimes we are presently dealing with, and how sexually based charges fall within one of the toughest areas of law. Ian discusses how he and his clients deal with the potential major stigmas and penalties attached, and resources available to people who want to discover more.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [1:04] Based in Cleveland, Ohio, Ian Friedman has served as chief legal counsel on behalf of individuals and entities from coast to coast and as far as Europe, Asia, and South America. In addition to his legal work, he is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law teaching Computers & Criminal Law.\xa0 [2:38] Despite handling countless murder cases, people look at those that are merely charged with offenses with a hefty amount of judgement and paint the term “sex offenders” with a very wide stroke. To Ian, a sex offender can be many things on a broad spectrum. For example, it can be at 19 year old engaging in a sexual relationship with a girlfriend that is 16, or as far as people exploiting children, or engaging in non consensual physical acts with adults or minors. [4:37] Ian has taught about cyber crime since 2006, and it all changes so fast that it is necessary to talk about present cases in order to even catch up. Cyber crime examples can be online exploitation, hacking, third party intrusions, crypto currency offenses, online stalking and any sort of online financial crimes. He teaches his students to be able to both educate while still showing respect for the bench.\xa0 [7:49] The Fourth Amendment touches about people’s right to privacy and prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. This has also shifted and expanded a great deal as more and more cases deal with uncovering things within a people’s computer and search history.\xa0 [9:53] Misdemeanors could (all jurisdictions are different) be anything from soliciting prostitutes, exhibisionism, etc. These carry very harsh consequences of embarrassment, loss of relationships and work.\xa0 [13:02] Our laws are not caught up to technology, and we are using dated laws to fit new offenses in. There is a lack of understanding, and Ian believes it’s not always law itself but the sentencing of that law.\xa0 [17:55] Charges on sexual offending also have one of the highest rates of false allegations because there can be ulterior motives. This stresses the importance of taking into account the motivations behind an accusation.\xa0 [21:17] When Ian meets with a client for the first time, they are often terrified and mortified. Ian lets them know there is no judgement. He also has set up a network of former clients and family members to help support the new client. Treatment and rehab are not the final step, but more like an important step in the right direction.\xa0 [30:11] Due to the strong stigma and penalties associated with accusations of this nature, it is so critical to work with people who have expertise in this particular area of the law.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com\xa0 American Board Criminal Lawyers\xa0 inf@fanlegal.com Ian Friedman\xa0 Cleveland-Marshall College of Law\xa0  QUOTES:  “It’s a very tough landscape for anyone that finds themselves involved in allegations of a sex crime.”\xa0 “We are dealing with crimes that we weren’t dealing with 6 months ago, and that’s why I can’t even order a textbook for this class.

Tim is the co-founder of Willow Tree Counseling in Santa Rosa, and works with sex addicts and their partners providing individual, group, and couples therapy. Tim is a bright and rising star in the field of sex addiction, and speaks about the expected betrayed partner responses, along with the honesty that must be present in order for true healing and recovery to occur.\xa0 \xa0 TAKEAWAYS: [3:19] Tim co-founded Willow Tree Counseling in Santa Rosa, and this gives an opportunity to people on the central coast of California a place to go during this time of trauma and recovery.\xa0 [5:32] Tim understood addict recovery, and got to understand the trauma betrayed partners really went through after working with a colleague. This folded into the partners sensitivity movement, which also goes along with the idea of Prodependence.\xa0 [7:38] When a partner is betrayed, there are certain “predictable unpredictable” behaviors and responses. This individual has just had their bottom fall out beneath them, and also may have felt denied of their intuition and devalued for quite some time.\xa0 [11:04] Even before a cheating partner is caught, chances are their energy is less than completely loving and connected with their partner. They may start to be even more forgetful, cold or distant, and may be resentful towards their partner to try and justify their bad behavior.\xa0 [16:10] Partners can pick up on this energy can have autoimmune or libido issues before the cheating is out in the open. They can pick up on the possible shame and guilt the addict feels, and these cues can cause real physical and emotional symptoms.\xa0 [19:02] It’s not a comfortable thing to admit struggle and vulnerability, and even tougher when the addict is in recovery. However, it is part of the important process of building back true trust with their partner and loved ones.\xa0 [23:05] Most of the relationships that Tim sees fail occur when the addict isn’t able to do the rigorous work of total honesty and disclosure to make their partner feel safe and understood.\xa0 \xa0 RESOURCES:\xa0 Sex and Relationship Healing @RobWeissMSW  Sex Addiction 101\xa0  Cruise Control: Understanding Sex Addiction in Gay Men\xa0  Prodependence: Moving Beyond Codependency Rob@sexandrelationshiphealing.com\xa0 Seeking Integrity  Tim Stein MFT\xa0  Willow Tree Santa Rosa\xa0  Out of the Dog House\xa0 \xa0 QUOTES:  “It’s hard to love someone and hurt them at the same time.”\xa0 “Every lie is going to be seen as an example about how you are probably lying about everything.”\xa0 “It’s not a comfortable thing to admit struggle and vulnerability.”\xa0 ", 'chan_desc': 'Welcome to Sex, Love, and Addiction.

When I was having trouble in my marriage after losing my son before he was born, I wish I knew about the techniques that I know now. Sexual CPR is helping women and men rekindle their marriage and increase their sexual desire. In the United States, there is so much focus, funding, and research on men’s sexual health. Women’s sexual health, on the other hand, is sorely lacking in understanding. I’ve conducted my own research and spoken to experts in both men’s and women’s sexual health and created Sexual CPR. Cortisol is our stress hormone. Ane when it’s raised in our bodies, our oxytocin, or love, levels decrease. This leaves us feeling unloveable and incapable of giving love. But when our cortisol levers are low, oxytocin has a chance to work the way it’s supposed to - letting us feel, give, and receive the love we deserve. When we learn to reignite our sexual enjoyment, with or without the presence of sexual intimacy, we’re giving ourselves permission to feel happy and enjoy our life again. This not only improves our moods but improves our relationship as well. In order to get here, you need to experience your pleasure. What turns you on? What makes you happy? Spend time exploring these avenues for yourself, so that you can, in turn, help your partner make you happy. Because the number one turn on for men is our pleasure. In this episode, I’m going through the content of Sexual CPR and sharing all the incredible experts who have joined me to create this one-of-a-kind program. You’ll learn how to redefine your orgasm, rekindle your sexual pleasure, and reignite your relationship. Are you having trouble connecting with your partner? How do you define your sexual pleasure? Do you have difficulty reaching orgasm?\xa0  In This Episode:  How men’s sexual health is a much more funded and researched area than women’s sexual health What happens when our cortisol levels go down What happens to our lives when we ignite our sexual enjoyment, even outside of sexual intimacy Why you need to experience your pleasure, know what turns you on, and know what makes you happy How having happiness in your relationship and sex life has an overflowing effect on the rest of your life What you’ll learn in Sexual CPR How you can redefine your orgasm Why rekindling your sexual pleasure starts with you  \xa0 Quotes: “When cortisol goes up, oxytocin, which is our bonding hormone, our hormone of love and connection, goes down. The hormone that gives us the sense and the feeling of love goes down.” (7:06) “Our bodies are intended for pleasure. Taking the time to experience that is critical.” (14:00) “The number one turn on for men is your pleasure. What makes you happy brings him pleasure. Your turn on is his turn on.” (15:16) “Creating happiness on a daily basis gives you the pleasure that fuels you into more pleasurable activities.

The more you know about your hormones and body, the better chances you have with your cancer diagnosis. My guest, Dr. Nasha Winters, is an expert on helping women treat their cancer using integrative healthcare. At the age of 19, Nasha was diagnosed with a terminal cervical cancer diagnosis. Years of poor medical advice and heavy prescriptions to try to fix her hormonal issues, which started from the tender age of 9, led Nasha to learn how to take control of her own health. Many years later, she’s now helping other women get a positive outcome from their own diagnosis. In this episode, learn how Nasha recreated balance in her body. She did this through a combination of both integrative and standard healthcare, which at the time was an incredibly innovative and new approach to treating cancer.\xa0 In Nasha’s practice, she insists on taking a series of blood tests that will give her a good overview of her patient’s health and nutrients. She recommends any doctor working with cancer patients to keep a regularly view over their health levels in order to make sure that treatment plans are working. When you are given a cancer diagnosis, Nasha says there are 5 things to do right away. Even though the first step might surprise you, it makes total sense and will help you on your way to handling your condition. She also explains what happens to our bodies when we take artificial hormones and why this might not always be the best treatment course for women with cancer. We also talk about what types of cancers are hormonally driven and how you can nutritionally support your body over the years. Finally, Nasha shares how she starts and ends her days with intention and how this nurtures her life and why you should, too. Have you recently been diagnosed with cancer? Do you know how to support your hormones as you age? How often do you get your vital levels tested?  In This Episode:  How you can recreate a balance in your body Why you should consider both integrative and standard care for your cancer diagnosis What blood tests will give a good overview of your health levels What the first step to approaching your cancer diagnosis should be What happens when you take artificial hormones How often you should test your vital levels when you have cancer, but also when you’re going through menopause What types of cancers are hormonally driven How you can start and end your days by nurturing your life  \xa0 Quotes: “99% of the patients I work with are coming to me when I’m their last resort. And they’re also coming to me when they’ve already done multiple rounds of standards of care that has, frankly, left them even more broken than they were before.” (16:42) “Human nature pushes us to other things when we’re really young. I know this, I did this dance for 10 years, thinking it’s done now, go back to the way things were. But you cannot heal from the soil in which you got sick.” (42:04) “Probably 98% of the women who come to my practice had been on birth control pills, had taken IVF, had been on hormones of some form along the way, and that seems to have clogged their hormonal metabolism.”\xa0 (50:31) \xa0 Links Get your free guide to The First 5 Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis on Dr. Nasha’s website - just wait for the pop-up!

Plus, it’s something that women should be doing throughout their lives in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Dr. Felice Gersh is with us today to explain how our changing bodies are supported by fasting. Felice is a board-certified gynecologist who has a holistic, well-rounded approach to women’s health. Her integrative insight looks at every aspect of a woman’s body to determine the best course for treatment; so everything is working together to bring your health back into alignment. In today’s episode, Felice describes what happens when our bodies go through menopause at a metabolic level. It’s not only our estrogen production that changes during this time! And she explains how intermittent fasting can improve your health during these hormonal changes. In fact, Felice goes on to say that women should be fasting regularly twice a year from their twenties in order to support their metabolic and hormonal health. Her favorite type of fasting diet is a fasting-mimicking one, which almost tricks your body into thinking you’re fasting when you’re really eating food! Fasting and timed eating can also help you get your circadian rhythm back on track at any time of your life. Next, Felice gives us her medical opinion on how destructive taking birth control pills is to our body and what happens when we control or take away a woman’s natural hormones long-term. She explains why we shouldn’t be taking hormone supplements orally, and how, instead, we should be taking them. And then Felice lets us know how important progesterone is to our bodies at all times.

So we all face this. Every female. We’re all in this together. So we want to make those post-menopausal years really wonderful ones.” (6:25) “To get the label of food, it actually has to have nutrition in it! And most of the things we eat have no nutritive value. So if you put things in your mouth that have no nutrition, that’s not food! It’s like, you might as well lick the street! Do not put anything in your mouth that’s not food.” (17:44) “Testosterone levels go down independently. And by age 40, the average woman has only half the testosterone she had at age 20 and boy, that does change everything.” (39:11) “A period is a vital sign of female health.

Love is medicine; feeling love increases our oxytocin and helps keep cortisol in check, so our stress levels don’t contribute to the heart or other diseases. Razi Berry is a naturopathic doctor who focuses on the way love impacts our health. When Razi was a teenager, she had a severe eating disorder that was causing her heart to stop working. She knows the exact moment when she started to heal: her mother and brother were surrounding her hospital bed and telling her how much they loved her. It was that love, and love she felt for them, that told her body it was time to heal. Razi found herself asking the question “where does healing come from?” often after she was healed. And now she believes that as a society, our lack of love and empathy for one another and ourselves are contributing to chronic and incurable diseases.\xa0 As a society, we have a disconnection from nature and Razi encourages everyone to spend more time outside. Also, we should strive to become more self-aware and connected with nature, so our bodies will start to reattune and heal from the inside out. Razi shares a couple of techniques that help you reconnect with your body and feel the love. She explains how a body scan works and why you should do them regularly. Plus, she gives some examples of how power poses and various playful practices can heal the body and soul. How is your relationship with yourself and your loved ones? Have you ever practiced using body scans? When’s the last time you spent time in nature? In This Episode:  What the hardest moments in your life lead to How love can heal you What has happened in our current society that leads to more chronic diseases How is how we treat nature connected to our health What happens when we have a disconnection from nature How can you become more self-aware and connected to nature What a body scan is and why you should practice them regularly How play is a healing power for the body and soul   Quotes: “The naturopathic philosophy is one that says ‘the doctor doesn’t heal you, healing comes from within.’” (7:55) “It’s not just about love and relationships, but it’s about how these resources of love, in yourself and your relationship with nature, your environment, and each other are really the medicine that we need to get back to healing.” (10:02) “If we don’t know how to love ourselves, how to listen to ourselves, then that’s how we stay stuck in these patterns that take us away from our health.” (13:54) Links Find Out More About The Love is Medicine Project Find Razi Berry Online\xa0 Find Razi Berry on Facebook | Instagram |\xa0Pinterest \xa0 Check out the full episode page Find Dr. Anna Online Follow Dr. Anna on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Your physical appearance is important to you; it’s something we all take pride in. But I think it’s more important that our body is a direct reflection of how we treat ourselves on the inside. Today’s guest, Bree Argetsinger, also known as The Betty Rocker, is all about practicing self-love from the inside out. Bree is a certified Exercise Coach, certified to help you realign your body through manual therapy, and ISSA (International Sports Sciences Association) certified fitness nutrition practitioner. But more than this, she’s an incredibly motivating woman who has been through it all. When Bree was in her early 30s, she burned out her adrenal glands and has spent years learning how to correct them. The Betty Rocker promotes a natural approach to diet, one that includes plenty of whole foods that will help you feel fuller for longer. It can be overwhelming when faced with so many good choices, and many women struggle with this. But through making those healthy food choices and realigning our bodies through corrective exercise, we are well on our way to a better body. Bree actually promotes sitting on the floor while working… or more specifically, working from a variety of positions when you can. We’re not meant to stay still all day!\xa0 As a survivor of assault, Bree understands what it’s like to work through these emotions, which are especially prevalent during perimenopause. Women need to build a strong community around them to help through any and all the emotions that come up during these tough periods of our lives.\xa0 Bree explains what types of exercise we should be doing every day. And she gives us some special insight into what the perfect burpee should look like - spoilers: I’ve been upping my burpee game based on it. If you’ve been seeking preventative healthcare, such as chiropractic or physio, it’s probably not enough. You should also be addressing the muscular movement patterns and improving your bone strength and health. Lastly, self-care, self-love, and embracing “flawsome” is a huge part of Bree’s message and training. It’s so important for all aspects of our health to love ourselves and take good care of our mind, body, and soul. Have you ever felt paralyzed by all the good choices you can make? Do you know how to handle previous emotional or physical trauma? What type of exercise really gets you going?  In This Episode:  How you can burn out your adrenal glands What kind of whole foods you should be including in your diet How we can be overwhelmed with good food choices How you can realign your body through corrective exercises Why you should sometimes sit on the floor when you’re working How physical assault can manifest itself in perimenopause Why you need to build a strong community around you What EMDR is and how it can help you reconnect with yourself What one movement you can do every day to get into your body\xa0 How to do the perfect burpee Why you need to address your muscular movement patterns along with preventative healthcare Why self-love is so important in all your health journeys What it means to embrace “flawsome”  \xa0 Quotes: “I think it’s very natural, as women and men, to take pride in our appearance. And so, I don’t think it’s wrong to care about your ascetics at all. I think that how we look and feel is a by-product of how we treat ourselves.” (17:12) “Consistency matters. If you don’t take action, something small, each day, it makes a difference.” (18:39) “Working on our physical body is a gateway to working on our mind, our spirit, all of the things.” (23:05) “The body doesn’t exist in a vacuum. You can’t look at one organ and say that everything [wrong] is because of this organ, you can’t look at one system of the body and think that it doesn’t affect all the other systems.” (41:09) “Everything is connected. You need to get to the root cause of what’s causing the weight gain, what’s causing the issues. Find a way to love yourself so that you can think about things from an empowered place. You can help uplift the people around you. It’s pretty much everything. You have to be willing to be honest with yourself if you’re going to be asking people to be honest with themselves.” (41:37) “I’m going to create my own version of awesome and I’m gonna represent it, and I’m gonna love myself as hard and as fiercely as I love my best friends.” (45:56)  Links Find Bree Argetsinger Online\xa0 Find Bree Argetsinger on Facebook | Instagram | YouTube | Pinterest Join the free Make Fat Cry 30 Day Challenge! \xa0 Check out the full episode page Find Dr. Anna Online Follow Dr. Anna on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Our health is the most important thing we can have and nurture! And there are so many ways to obtain optimum health, but what our guest, Leanne Vogel, and I have in common is our love and support of the ketogenic way of life. Following a keto diet is one of the healthiest ways to lose weight, keep it off, and balance your hormones. Leanne is a nutrition educator, author, and podcast host. She has spent the last decade reshaping how she approaches food and nutrition so that you can feel happy, healthy, and in control with how you eat.\xa0 When it comes to our health, it’s important to look at it all. What I mean is, we can’t just look at the physical part, but our spiritual and mental health is just as important. And above all, being able to laugh at ourselves is so healthy! When we’re following a diet, we all need to remember that indulging in a sweet or dessert is absolutely okay. We don’t want to deprive ourselves, because deprivation can lead to binging, and ruining all the healthy habits we’ve developed. But that’s why we need to listen to what our bodies want. Men and women have such differing body images. Did you know that you can adjust the way you think about your body? It might take a lot of inner work, but it might also look like leaving relationships with people who put you down. Leanne talks about shadow and limiting beliefs in-depth and how you can recognize when you have them. These types of beliefs are deeply personal, but you have the power to overcome them. She also explains why you should make self-care a priority every single day. Do you know the importance of listening to how your body wants to eat? How do you handle negative self-talk? What do you do for self-care every day?  In This Episode:  Why you need to look at your health as a whole, not just rules, and weight loss How being able to laugh at yourself is healthy Why indulging is okay when you’re eating a healthy, balanced diet How to give your body what it needs How you can adjust your body image How you can establish healthy boundaries for you and your body image What shadow and limiting beliefs are and how you can recognize and work through them How you can work in your self-care into your daily routine  \xa0 Quotes: “I’m more than Keto. I’m so much more than a diet, I’m so much more than this body.” (4:39) “Nobody cares about our body. So many people are so wrapped up in their own stuff, that nobody actually cares about your body. The only person that cares about your body is you and you have the power to adjust that.” (17:46) “There’s so much more to this than weight loss, there’s so much more to this than macros. Yes, the ketogenic diet is super powerful and will change your life but if you’re not willing to put in ‘The Work,’ you’re only going to go so far. Because those limiting shadow beliefs will constantly be behind you, ready to sabotage your efforts, and you need to work through that in order to gain a life you’ve always wanted.” (26:00)   Links Find Leanne Vogel Online\xa0 Find Leanne Vogel on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube | Pinterest \xa0 Check out the full episode page Find Dr. Anna Online Follow Dr. Anna on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Grief affects all of us in so many different ways and can come over you at any point, even when you’re not expecting it. For many, grief stems from the loss of a loved one, but that’s not always the root cause. Grief comes from loss -- the loss of a job, business, pet, friendship, relationship, death, and so many other aspects of your life. My guest and friend, Lindsay McKinnon, is talking about her relationship with grief after losing her two sons in a house fire. The grieving process will look totally different for each individual going through it, but one thing remains static: it will be a long, hard haul. Our culture isn’t taught how to grieve properly, and so many of us feel guilty for trying to live a happy life again. Lindsay has found happiness after loss by turning to, and now teaching, Qoya, a type of dancing yoga. Grief sits in our hips, and the movement and flow of dancing is not only emotionally enjoyable, helps release the sadness. She writes about how our soul meets the body and talks about creating space for that connection. Lindsay also holds retreats to help people work through their grief. In this episode, we talk about how grief can come into your life, even when you think you’ve healed from it. We look at the healing process and how this is a journey that is individual to the person. You need to honor the time it takes for you and your body to heal. Grieving the loss of love is natural, but it’s important to remember that the sadness we feel is a reflection of the joy we felt. How do you handle your feelings of grief? What do you do to remember those you have lost? Do you incorporate movement into your grieving process? In This Episode:  How grief can affect you and come across you even years after a loss How you can heal from tragedy Why you need to honor your time, body, and your own processes in order to heal How you can set intentions to help you step through grief What Qoya therapy is and how it can help with grief What it means to grieve the loss of love  \xa0 Quotes: “Our culture is just not really taught how to grieve. We find ourselves in the midst of it and quite often judging how we’re navigating it. Feeling like we should be doing something other than what we are doing or feeling something other than what we are actually feeling.” (2:10) “What I learned is that the heart can expand. It can include our deepest pain points and our greatest joys at the same time.” (5:57) “Being present in your body, being physical, incorporating that. Realizing physically what you’re feeling emotionally and where that needs to be worked out physically because our different organs hold energy.”\xa0 (14:24) \xa0 Links Find Lindsay McKinnon Online Follow Lindsay on Facebook | Instagram Find Qoya Roanoke Learn more about Lindsay's Retreats \xa0 Check out the full episode page Find Dr. Anna Online Follow Dr. Anna on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | You know the old saying, “if you can dream it, you can do it”? That is pretty much today’s guest’s motto in life. Naveen Jain is a serial entrepreneur and philanthropist who believes in living life without limits. He’s joining me today to tell you how you can start living your limitless life today. Naveen explores life with curiosity, imagination, and exponential innovation to defy any and all limits. He believes that every single person has the ability to create big things, go anywhere they want (yes, even the moon), and change the world. Naveen is an entrepreneur driven to solve our world’s global challenges… and he’s succeeding in a big way. By living with an abundance mindset, Naveen knows that there is no limit to the money available in this world. He wants to create a world where disease is optional, and this has started him on a path to providing affordable health solutions for everyday people. I’ve often said that I left medical school with a degree in pimping pharmaceutical companies, and Naveen agrees, that often medical doctors can do more harm than good. The first thing we need to know is where our chronic diseases come from. Many medical doctors don’t treat the underlying condition and reasons for our diseases but simply medicate the symptoms. Understanding what we need to know about ourselves, and what questions we need to ask, is a vital part of healing our gut. What it comes down to, really, is eating the right foods for our bodies. And knowing that what’s right for me might not be the right food for you. Each body is different and reacts to foods in unique ways. For example, Naveen can’t eat apples, bananas, or spinach - three super healthy foods. When you take the power of your health back into your own hands, you’re gaining the ability to change your life. You’re getting rid of any and all limitations put in place by your body and saying “yes” to becoming a healthier, happier version of yourself. Naveen has kindly given us $200 his company, Viome’s, Gut Microbiome Testing Kit. I’d urge you to take advantage of this incredibly generous offer! Do you feel in love with yourself? Have you ever been tested for food sensitivities? Do you know the difference between an abundance mindset and a scarcity mindset?  In This Episode:  How we, as individuals, can change the world Why medical doctors can cause more harm than good What it means to have an abundance mindset What steps we need to take to become rich Where our chronic diseases come from What questions we need to ask ourselves to heal our gut Why eating the right food for our bodies is the most beneficial thing we can do for our health How to take back the power to take action over your own health Why you need to fall in love with yourself  \xa0 Quotes: “When you get a chronic disease, people say that it’s bad luck. No, it’s not bad luck! It is simply the bad choices we made because we didn’t know what the good choices were.” (7:47) “Limits exist because our imagination, and what we call reality, shows that these limits exist.” (11:31) “We want to create a world for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren where chronic disease is simply a matter of choice. It’s not about luck.” (24:40) “Our goal is to simply not just to tell you what is happening in your gut, but give you the control back so it’s actionable. The only way we can solve this problem is to become the CEO of our health. To take the control back from our own body, our own health, and to realize that we have the power.” (35:20) “Your self worth never comes from what you own.

All too often, women are seeing an increase in their testosterone levels, which is making us feel less comforted and nurtured at home. Today’s guest, John Gray, author of Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, joins me today to discuss how we can nurture our masculine and feminine hormones to create stronger relationships. John has been researching and coaching couples for over 40 years, and he’s sharing what he’s learned about relationships, communication, and having a healthy sex life. To start off, he explains why men are seeing a decrease in their testosterone levels as they grow older, and what you can do to combat this. By opening lines of communication with your partner, you can help nurture their testosterone or estrogen production. John explains what happens when women feel their emotions building up, with little things adding to their problems. And how expressing your emotions and simply talking to your partner can help release that pent up energy. Relationships are all about communication. Men are more likely to do the things you want them to do by simply asking them confidently, not complaining or nagging them. And when you can talk openly to your partner and are comfortable being emotionally naked with them, you’re in a better place to get physically naked. Sex is such an important part of our romantic relationships. John talks us through how we, as women, can encourage a healthier sex life, and how men can prevent their own ejaculation to make sex a longer, more pleasurable experience for both partners. Do you have a healthy sex life with your partner? How do you keep open, honest communication in your relationship? What do you do to nurture your partner’s dominant hormones? \xa0 In This Episode:  Why men are seeing their testosterone levels lowering What foods affect our testosterone and estrogen hormone production How you can treat your partner to nurture their estrogen or testosterone Why doing the little things in a relationship are so important What happens when you have a build-up of emotions How you can encourage men to do more things to make you happy by requesting, not complaining Why women can be hesitant to share their feelings with a man Why you should feel comfortable being emotionally naked with your partner before you become physically naked How you can improve your sex life to ensure you get enough pleasure Why men need to prioritize women’s needs over their own What impersonal sex is and what it does to your relationship Why you have to honor your bodies’ priorities  \xa0 Quotes: “Sex becomes the doorway for men to open their heart. Women don’t understand this because women have to open their heart first before they fully enjoy sex. So it’s the love that allows women to feel more sexually alive.” (10:48) “Connection is a woman’s greatest need. A man’s greatest need is to feel successful. Success increases testosterone. Connection increases progesterone and estrogen, and oxytocin. Which we know, hormonally, is essential for women’s well-being.” (17:49) “You can’t fully feel your positive emotions if you can’t fully feel your negative emotions.” (35:29) \xa0 Links Find John Gray and MarsVenus Online Follow John Gray and MarsVenus on Facebook | Twitter | YouTube Join the KetoGreen Community on Facebook Buy The Hormone Fix \xa0 Check out the full episode page Find Dr. Anna Online Follow Dr. Anna on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter", 'chan_desc': "Couch Talk w/ Dr. Anna Cabeca is an intimate place for intimate conversation about tackling menopause, hormonal imbalance, and sexual health issues with grace and ease.

Or has one of you become more of a parent to the other? When a couple starts to fall into a parent-child dynamic, codependency, rather than a balanced, cooperative relationship starts to emerge. Essentially, this means that the overall patterns of communication and behavior push one partner (either the male or the female) into a parent or a child position within the relationship.\xa0 In this episode, I do the following:  help you take a closer look at what this destructive dynamic may look like share why you shouldn\'t promote this in your relationship suggest two strategies to avoid it  Links mentioned in this episode: FREE Masterclass:\xa0Forgiving & Forgetting is NOT the Key to Healing After Infidelity\xa0www.iditsharoni.com/masterclass for more information go to: www.iditsharoni.com | Today, I want to talk about who can heal your pain after infidelity. You’ll learn who really can help heal the pain, who doesn’t have the power to help, and what you can do if you’re stuck feeling unable to move past the hurt. I dive into the topic by telling you about a contact that I recently received from a spouse who had been cheated on and wanted to be seen individually. There was nothing alarming about this at first, but the person then shared something troubling: a therapist had told this person that seeking individual help to overcome the pain was needed before the couple could healthily recover together. The first issue that I have with this is that sending one partner off to seek help alone is very difficult. I talk about how it takes so much courage to trust anyone after infidelity and that isolating sends a bad message to the hurt partner.\xa0 The second issue I have is that many therapists have the assumption that the pain after infidelity is individual and, therefore, the hurting individual is capable of fixing it. You must remember that forgiveness is a journey that both sides need to go on and that it needs to be earned. The third issue I have is the sense that hurt partners who are not ready to forgive are considered unable to surrender to the process. I provide my opinion that surrender should not be expected because the situation that the couple has found themselves in is not a war.\xa0 Therapy is not a body shop where you check your problematic spouse in to get fixed. The betraying partner needs to understand that they are the person who will help the healing.

Listener discretion is advised.Crissy was molested at the age of four, a pattern of abuse that would continue throughout her childhood and teen years. When she became an adult, various decisions and pressures to please the men in her life lead Crissy to start working as a performer in pornography. For seven years, Crissy performed in pornography, enduring more physical and emotional abuse and surviving several suicide attempts. Her ongoing search for love and approval kept her in the porn industry until she was able to break free from the industry and never look back. Now, Crissy has dedicated her life to sharing her story and helping women in different parts of the sex industry break free. Her story has been featured in several news outlets and magazines, including GQ and Playboy. Hear Crissy’s story in her own words as we discuss the experiences that pushed her into the porn industry and, ultimately, caused her to escape it.One study showed between 66-90% of women in the sex industry were sexually abused as children.To learn more about the harms of pornography on consumers, relationships, and its larger societal impacts, visit FTND.org.

We talk to Sunny's 91-year-old Uncle George. He tells us what it was like growing up as a gay man in Chicago in the 1940s. This was when being ‘homosexual’ was illegal and frequenting gay bars and meeting places could result in jail time. George traveled to dozens of countries throughout the mid 20th century, some more accepting than the US and others downright dangerous for gay travelers. An incident in South Africa almost landed him in prison for murder! George recounts living through the AIDS crisis and losing dear friends, how acting conservative with those he was out to ensured his security, the pain of having to hide his lifestyle & partners from family, the very first pride parades, his opinion on LGBTQ+ issues today, the struggles gay elderly people face, brushes with gay celebrities in the golden age of Hollywood, and more.

We learn how acknowledging your authentic self through community changes your self-perception; self-talk transforms from “it was all my fault, I’m a horrible person” to “I'm ok, I did the best I could, I’m not alone.” We touch on the power of vulnerability, cultivating empathy, and finding the courage to tell the stories people really want and need to hear. You’ll learn how to find community in unlikely places no matter where or how you live and why connecting with others in a non-sexual way is essential in sexual subcommunities. A supportive community is not only life-changing, it can also be lifesaving. Dixie also shares a powerful story about how the community she built and her use of the word “vagina” in that community not only healed trauma for an entire family but stopped a habitual abuser from continuing to commit unthinkable crimes.\xa0\xa0 \xa0  Submit your BDSM & sex advice questions by email to americansexpodcast@gmail.com To support American Sex podcast, please visit patreon.com/americansex (plus you’ll get all episodes early, secret episodes, bonus stories from guests, on-air shout-outs, stuff in the mail & more!)

They answer common questions about the lifestyle-- how do you meet people, what’s the etiquette of attending parties, what do all the acronyms mean, how do you combat jealousy, what are the best ways to start exploring opening your relationship, what are the differences between being a swinger/open/polyamory and do folks that identify differently play well together? We discuss the nuances of swinging in the African American community-- what’s up with the swing lifestyle being so overwhelmingly white, in what areas is that different, and why? Is it true that bias against bisexual men in the lifestyle is more pronounced in black spaces? Dee and Vee also dive into one of their favorite activities, facesitting-- what it’s about smothering, cunnilingus or both? What's the psychology behind it? What’s the proper preparation and technique for the act?\xa0  Submit your BDSM & sex advice questions by email to americansexpodcast@gmail.com To support American Sex podcast, please visit patreon.com/americansex (plus you’ll get all episodes early, secret episodes, bonus stories from guests, on-air shout-outs, stuff in the mail & more!)

Amp discusses other platforms too-- how people are bullying adult creators on Instagram under the guise of ‘indecency’, the age-old question of where to draw the line between art and pornography, plus SESTA/FOSTA and other factors creating the perfect storm of internet censorship across platforms like Patreon, Twitter, etc. We also learn what we can do to personally combat internet censorship (yes, you can make an impact!).

We learn about the latest sexuality research like brain hacking to normalize sexual desire, scientific sex product research, and the very specific laboratory definition of an orgasm that surprisingly fails to line up with what many of us experience in the bedroom. We get into the internal clitoris, vasocongestion, skene's glands, the mystery of sexual vaginal lubrication, and the most sensitive areas of the clitoral glans. Have you heard that men are more sexually visual, orgasms are different based on gender, or the more testosterone someone has the stronger their sex drive is? Dr. Prause tells us why these and other sexual “facts” aren’t true at all. This episode has so much fascinating information, it’s a sex geek’s wet dream!

Amy Jo Goddard has been working for years to put a stop to this practice and is producing a documentary on the issue called At Your Cervix. In this conversation, she tells us how unbelievably prevalent this practice is. She also gives accounts from women this has happened to and from medical students uncomfortable with this requirement but afraid to jeopardize their grades by refusing. We also learn about the dark history of gynecology, the work Amy Jo has done to help make these exams illegal in certain parts of the US, how Gynecological Teaching Assistants can give better training to students, plus she gives tips on how we can protect ourselves when we’re in the care of medical professionals.\xa0 (Content note: If you’re a survivor of sexual assault-- especially in a medical context or someone who has had prior medical procedures under anesthesia, some of what we discuss may be difficult to hear. I want you to know that before listening and reassure you that even if you’re a die-hard American Sex fan & never miss an episode, it’s fine to sit this one out.

The societal messages we receive about our genital hair cause us a great deal of turmoil. Should we trim? Shave completely? Or let it grow free? What do our grooming preferences say about us and how do the people we’re intimate with feel about that? On this episode, we examine your personal stories, difficulties, and strategies for caring for your garden down below. We also speak with Lyndsey Craig, an anthropology doctoral candidate studying cross-cultural pubic hair grooming practices. They say that our modern preference for genital baldness is primarily influenced by pornography & the media. Will Lyndsey’s pubic detective work throughout history tell us otherwise?

Yet the vulnerability, rawness, and emotion are all a part of this life and therefore a part of open relationships. Listen as Dylan, Ginger, and Ryan share their perspectives and strategies for coping, getting your mojo back, and even thriving while healing and integrating traumatic life experiences.

But how about the woman? The three ways women can have orgasms What does the Bible say about sex Is the intercourse you\'re having with your spouse the kind of intercourse that leads to orgasm? The clitoral alignment technique: what is it exactly?  Some helpful things for the wives:  What you can do to allow you to discover new and interesting feelings during intercourse The journey you can take to learn more about the orgasms you can experience Understanding new concepts and ideas that are related to orgasms G-spot vs clitoral orgasm The common anxiety wives experience before intercourse  Also, if you’d like a free 1:1 Clarity Call with Belah -- a $500 value -- she is offering that free to her audience.

Word spread and she\'s now sharing her journey to hundreds of women who used to be in the same boat as she was.\xa0 \xa0 We talk about Christian couples and the usual questions we get from them: -How do I help my wife orgasm? -How do I orgasm during intercourse (from wives)? -How long should I last (from husbands)? -What EXACTLY should I do (from both!)? \xa0 And as Ruth says, men can get so caught up in the mechanics -- but there is so much more to sex than just mechanics! \xa0 What are the things that husbands and wives can do DURING and AFTER intercourse instead of feeling pressured and worried? \xa0 There are actually SO MANY things couples can do to help remove the pressure! \xa0 Whether or not there\'s orgasm during intercourse, there are lots of things that CAN be done so it\'s always mutually enjoyable during intercourse.\xa0 \xa0 Other things we talk about: - What if a husband finishes earlier?\xa0\xa0 - What about gentlemen who last way longer than the women?\xa0 - What makes sex better for HER? - How God wants us to be excited about sex with our spouses \xa0 Also, if you’d like a free 1:1 Clarity Call with Belah -- a $500 value -- she is offering that free to her audience.

Sign up for a time to speak to Belah at www.delightyourmarriage.com/call \xa0 | How do you become MORE attractive to your wife?\xa0 \xa0 What exactly do I mean when I say "attraction"?\xa0 \xa0 Well, it\'s kind of like having a pull towards yourself. Whatever it is that you\'re doing, it\'s going to pull her and cause her to desire you. When you\'re attractive to her, she\'ll also have a physical desire towards you. \xa0 What can you do as a spouse to cause her to be interested again? To be FULLY in the marriage again? \xa0 My theory? Attraction works outside of marriage like this: \xa0You are a whole human being with your own passions and desires and she starts being drawn to your power and confidence. Slowly, through time, you BOTH start to fall in love.\xa0 \xa0 It\'s simple: Chemistry (natural attraction) + spending time with each other = being attracted to someone \xa0 We\'ll be attracted to different types of people our whole lives. It\'s up to us as married people to not spend time with others.\xa0 \xa0 So how do you become the whole man that you want to be?  By desperately seeking her love? By wishing to spend more time with her?  \xa0 This is the kind of work that I do with the men that I work with in The Masculinity Reclaimed program. If you want to get tailored advice and deep insight into your own marriage, you can do so by scheduling a call at www.dym.as.me. \xa0 \xa0 | \xa0 Over the years listeners have asked for my book  Delight Your Husband: The Christian wife’s manual to passion, confidence, and oral sex, to be available on paperback. It is now available! \xa0 And if you get the book, read, and review on Amazon, you can have access to a $97 Masterclass for free! \xa0 The Masterclass will be September 15, 2019! When you do those three things go ahead and email faith@delightyourmarriage.com\xa0And you’ll be on the list! Thank you so so much! | Does sex feel like a duty?\xa0  \xa0When he asks to make love, I believe that he\'s actually doing a really brave thing. He could be afraid of rejection and is actually insecure about it.\xa0 What if you have the opportunity to bring out your husband\'s generosity by being compassionate about his sexuality?   As a side: Dear husbands, If you want your wife to work with me, I encourage you to take the first step in transforming your marriage. By doing this, she\'ll be receptive to transforming herself as well.\xa0 Wives, I want you to know that if your opinion of sex is that it\'s a chore or a duty, it’s probably hurting your spouse\'s feelings. AND sex has to start with having an open heart and a good perspective. Otherwise it doesn’t feel like making love, it feels like you value it as much as washing the dishes. What if you can go to a place of:  Joy, fun and excitement To the point that you physically crave sex  I want you to get there. Listen in for encouragement and new perspectives and tools to make love rather than do your duty.  \xa0If you want to work with me to have the heart and a body (!) that craves sex, go to www.dym.as.me . You\'ll have 40 minutes of my undivided attention for FREE (a $500 value) so we can talk about your marriage.\xa0 | First and foremost, I\'m so glad you\'re planning for sex. Many people let this HIGH priority slip away from their marriage. And they wonder why their marriage turns into a disaster. \xa0 I am GRATEFUL if you are one who puts it on your calendar--it means you DO prioritize it! \xa0 So, I\'m now encouraging you to go the next step and make it sexy. So often I hear from husbands that they make love the exact same way every single time they make love. And "it\'s even on the calendar!" \xa0 Well, 1st- the good news is you\'re making love (!!) and 2nd- ladies, we can plan sex (just not let him in on it!) ;) Listen in for inspiring ideas on how and why to spice things up and how you can plan sex without making him feel like a To Do List item! Aka...plan it sexily! \xa0 How EXACTLY do other people even plan for sex? Planning for sex can look different for many people:  You can plan for sex in other physical aspects  (If you\'re too full from dinner, you might be too sleepy for sex!) \xa0  You can plan for sex emotionally\xa0  (are you emotionally prepared to plan sex?) \xa0 But planning for sex with a "grin and bear it" mindset isn\'t good. It would be awesome if you planned sex with a heart filled with joy and excitement. So how do you plan sex with THAT kind of mindset? \xa0 Well, here\'s a story. \xa0 My husband surprised me with something special on our anniversary: a sunset cruise.\xa0 \xa0 He made sure that the house was clean, the kids had a babysitter, he had flowers everywhere. Well he got the idea from SOMEONE ELSE. Was I mad that he got the idea from someone else? Of course not. \xa0 That\'s the same with you planning sex. Don\'t feel like you\'re not being truthful or being a phony when you plan sex. The important thing is the experience you\'ll both be having, not HOW you got there.\xa0 \xa0 How open should you be to your husband when it comes to planning sex? It depends on where you are in your marriage, emotionally speaking.\xa0 \xa0 He craves you more when you feel good about having sex. But making love is also about you; your own joy and fulfillment.\xa0 \xa0 |  What does it mean and WHY would you actually do it? What if it’s COMPLETELY outside of your personality? What to actually do? (Steamy examples!)  --- Before we dive in… I run a men\'s course called Masculinity Reclaimed: Be respected, enjoy fierce intimacy and love being married again. \xa0 It\'s a program which helps you understand how to be an amazing husband so your wife wants to do this kind of stuff. It dramatically transforms\xa0 marriages.\xa0 \xa0 I work with men in this program and interview their wives who started out rating their intimacy as a 3 out of 10 and then they move to a 7 out of 10 or from a 5 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10!\xa0 --- \xa0 ALL-DAY seduction is:\xa0  not normal for me I don\'t wake up thinking I want to be someone who likes playful touching throughout the day  I thought it was sinful. “Why think about sex the whole day???” was my question. Well, now I’ve changed my tune. Here’s why… \xa0 The reason I do this work:  I love families I love what children have when it\'s a safe, loving family The desire for intercourse isn\'t the motivation. It\'s the answer to "how do we make the world safer"?\xa0 We make better children who have parents who love each other so well that they\'re able to live a trauma-free life  \xa0 God wants children to be raised up in the right, safe, kind environment. And sex is vital to that because that\'s how your husband receives love.\xa0 \xa0 Why do great men of God fall to sexual sin? The sexual sin is great...  35% of internet downloads is pornography “Sex” is the #1 search term Pornography increases marital infidelity rate by more than 300% Adultery destroys your soul God made him with a strong desire  And God gave him that desire; the average man has about 11 erections a day!    \xa0 So where do we go from here? I’m not saying you’re responsible for his fidelity. But I think you have an opportunity to support him in this really sinful world.\xa0 \xa0 Have a system of seduction throughout the day:  Bring up intimacy throughout the day! Touch him!\xa0 Give him a kiss through his clothes --- do it any time of the day! Always change in front of him Tell him "I can\'t wait to do more"  Resources:  Late September, I have a women\'s course called The Delighted Wife: Reclaim Your Sexuality Live In Your Womanly Wisdom\xa0 And Witness Him Cherish You  \xa0  If you want to find out if this is the right step for you, go to www.dym.as.me so we can speak 1:1 to discuss your situation.

And let you know that whatever situation you\'re facing He is with you. He is right there beside you.\xa0 He says: 28\xa0“Come to me,\xa0all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\xa029\xa0Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,\xa0for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.\xa030\xa0For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”\xa0Matt 11:28-30 (NIV) \xa0 God is with you in this situation. Jesus loves you and wants to take your burdens. Love you and praying for you.\xa0 \xa0 Love,\xa0 Belah | Do you wish YOU were into sex more? \xa0 A lot of things are not mentioned in the Bible:  Electricity Vehicles Importance of exercise Internet  So much of our daily life is not spoken about in the Bible! And yet we have no problem doing it, every day. In fact, we’d say it was good, though not mentioned in the Bible.\xa0 \xa0 So, why don’t we have the same view of sex?\xa0 \xa0 Art isn’t mentioned in the Bible but some like painting, some like sculpture, others like charcoal. As with art, if your spouse would like more variety, that\'s okay! If your spouse would like more frequent intimacy, that’s okay! \xa0 God can help you with all of this. He can help you physically crave sex. He can help you want to meet your husband’s particular desire for that particular style of “art”. God cares about being a part of your life --- and your sex life! In a marriage, a man and a woman are free to want to make love with one another.\xa0 \xa0 Resources: If you\'re interested about the women\'s program to be truly free in the areas of VARIETY, CRAVING SEX and grow in your knowledge of all the HOW-TO’s this coming September, you can go to www.dym.as.me to schedule a call to see if it\'s a good fit for you!  | This is our (my husband and I) final conversation about being easygoing, playful and fun together.\xa0 It\'s a bit of insight into our relationship and we believe it\'ll give you some inspiration into where your marriage can go.\xa0 \xa0 I go through the final keys to making your marriage peaceful and walking through life in a state of calm, rather than rushing in a state of stress.\xa0 A couple of things you\'d be interested to hear...  how (and why) my husband responds when he\'s watching a game (live) and he sees I\'m upset. From him. why receiving an apology graciously is just as important as making one. when you\'re more vulnerable, the spouse will be too! someone called me the "calmest person I\'ve ever met".
