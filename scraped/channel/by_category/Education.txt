In part 2 of the episode, you’ll hear Tony interview Bill about his top strategies for success as an entrepreneur – including how to raise capital, the best ways to incentivize employees for performance, and what has made his tech incubator, Idealab, so effective. If you’re a business owner or an investor looking for future trends, you’re going to want to pay close attention, because Bill weighs in on his vision for the future, and tells us about the three technology applications that he believes will unlock human potential and opportunity for economic growth. | In this episode of the Tony Robbins podcast, you'll hear from Bill Gross – an entrepreneur who has personally started and exited from 7 COMPANIES valued at more than $1 BILLION each — that’s more than double tech investor Elon Musk. He is truly one of the greatest unicorn founders of all time. Bill looks for opportunities that are BIG and broken and then brainstorms technology solutions to fix them. Twenty-three years ago, he started Idealab, a company that Tony Robbins is involved with today. In part one of this podcast episode, you’re going to hear Bill’s top lessons of all-time as a serial entrepreneur, and then later in part 2, you’ll hear Tony's interview with him – where he shares his advice on raising capital, how to pitch investors, and his vision for the future – and how that affects your business and your career. | Jenny Fleiss created Rent the Runway, a company now valued at $1 billion, in the wake of the most severe economic recession the United States has seen since the Great Depression. When everyone else was panicking in 2008 and 2009, Jenny and co founder Jennifer Hyman saw an opportunity. The problem they were trying to solve was simple enough: Looking into your closet and realizing you don’t have anything to wear to an important event, like a wedding, but don’t have the budget to buy something new. So they innovated, and created an entirely NEW way to shop by allowing women to rent designer clothing, online, for a fraction of what it actually costs.\xa0 Today, the rental, or sharing economy is booming – companies like WeWork, REI, and Zipcar make it possible for us to experience something, without the cost of ownership. But to put this in perspective, nothing like this existed at the time.\xa0 Jenny shares how she and her co founder got Rent the Runway up and running –\xa0and how they grew the business to where it is today. You’ll also hear Jenny’s philosophy on how she approaches hiring talent at JetBlack, a personal shopping service she co founded after leaving Rent the Runway, which is not only critical when you’re starting a business, but also when scaling it.\xa0 The interviewer for this episode is Scott Harris, a coach, mentor and a speaker at many of Tony’s events, including his business event, Business Mastery.\xa0 | As founder and CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group and Shake Shack, Danny Meyer has grown his empire to include some of New York’s most beloved and acclaimed restaurants and cafes. Together, Danny’s restaurants and team have won an unprecedented 28 James Beard Awards – the food industry’s highest honor. But it’s not just great food that sets Danny’s restaurants apart from the rest. It’s what people experience and feel when they’re eating there. In fact, Danny Meyer’s story is a remarkable testament to the sheer power of hospitality.\xa0 In this episode, we explore the unique and celebrated culture of hospitality that Danny has created. He shares with Tony how he’s managed to scale that culture across Union Square Hospitality Group, as well as Shake Shack, the fast-casual restaurant Danny founded back in 2001. With Danny at the helm, what started as a single hot dog cart in Madison Square Garden is now a publicly traded company with over 250 locations and 6,000 employees.  Listen closely, because Danny also shares the six qualities he looks for when hiring employees – from dishwashers to executive chefs – and what he thinks it takes for entrepreneurs across all industries to succeed in business. | Next up on the Tony Robbins Podcast is the Masters of Business series, where we’re bringing you a collection of interviews and stories from today’s most respected entrepreneurs in hospitality, technology, retail, and marketing. You’ll also get an inside look into the strategy and mindset that Tony has used to grow his own businesses – which together, have combined sales of more than 5 billion dollars a year.\xa0 Stay tuned in for the first episode of the series, where Tony talks to Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, which is the parent company of Shake Shack and many well-known New York City restaurants. | We all experience fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear that we’re just not enough – fear is a common current that runs through all of our lives. For so many of us, fear rules everything and prevents us from reaching our true potential. In this episode, we’re diving into fear – how it shows up, how we handle it in different ways, and how we can use it to serve a valuable purpose and achieve the lives we truly desire. You’ll hear from Tony, as she shares his strategies on how he’s conditioned his own mind to overcome fear and become a successful entrepreneur that impacts the lives of millions. You’ll also hear from Siri Lindley, a world-champion triathlete and coach – who shares how she\xa0 overcame her fear and OCD, and went on to become the best triathlete in the world while finding love and respect for herself along the way.\xa0 And, if you’ve seen the Oscar-winning documentary, ‘Free Solo,’ you might remember Sanni McCandless, whose boyfriend, Alex Honnold climbed El Capitan – the 3,000 foot granite face looming over Yosemite Valley, without any ropes or safety harnesses. Sanni is a skilled life coach, and here she explains how she helps her coaching clients work through their everyday fears. Listen as she shares how she felt on the day of Alex’s free solo climb, and she overcame her own fear of losing him on that fateful day. | Mike Tyson is a household name –\xa0you might know him as the youngest heavyweight boxing champion in the world, or maybe by his cameo in the movie The Hangover. One thing persists above these anecdotes, though: Mike Tyson is a fighter in life –\xa0and he’s a fighter for love.\xa0 Having experienced extreme highs and lows over the course of a long and storied career, Mike has learned to take responsibility for his lows, and use them to learn, grow, and pivot to something new. His attitude toward growth and his deeply felt gratitude for all the gifts of his life have led him to THRIVE in the face of unthinkable adversity (and, at times, in the aftermath of his own disastrous decision-making).\xa0 But how? How does the once self-proclaimed “baddest man on the planet”\xa0transform into the Mike Tyson of today –\xa0someone focused on creating balance, mindfulness and a strong spirit? How does “Iron Mike Tyson” become the man who sees every adversity as a beautiful gift? Get to know the real Mike Tyson on this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast. | Conor McGregor will go down in history as one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. In this interview with Tony Robbins, he shares the bulletproof mindset that took him from being a plumber’s apprentice in Dublin to worldwide fame as the most “Notorious” fighter on the planet and the biggest name in the UFC. You’ll also get an inside look at two of the most anticipated fights in combat sports: Conor’s landmark boxing match with 11-time world champion Floyd Mayweather Junior – and his lightweight MMA title fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov. Conor also explains how he’s driven his new whiskey company, Proper 12, to become an overnight success, and he opens up about his passion for helping others and the philanthropic projects he supports. | Comedian. Actor. Writer. Author. Producer. Network owner. Those are just a few titles that Kevin Hart has on his resume, but his aspirations don’t stop there. By the time he’s 45, Kevin plans to add business mogul to his growing list of accomplishments, joining other entertainers like Oprah Winfrey and Lebron James.\xa0 Perhaps what sets Kevin apart from other comedians and actors is that he is more than just an entertainer for hire. He’s gone from being a cog in the Hollywood machine – to being the machine, by strategically building a media empire, inking production deals with major TV networks and film companies.\xa0 In this episode, Kevin shares his story of how he went from being a shoe salesman in Philadelphia, to breaking through the competitive world of show business and becoming one of the highest paid entertainers in the world. He also opens up about his own human flaws, and how he’s leveraged them to become a better man. | Abby Wambach is a legend – the illustrious and internationally renowned G.O.A.T. of American soccer. The iconic striker and play-maker hailing from Rochester, NY is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, FIFA World Cup champion, and the long-time captain of the U.S. National Team. Leading the charge for the Red, White, and Blue for some 15 years – alongside Mia Hamm, Alex Morgan and everyone in between – Wambach led the USWNT to victory in the 2015 World Cup just before announcing her retirement from the sport of soccer. She is STILL the highest all-time international goal-scorer, with more goals than any other player in the game, male or female. Abby became an icon not only for her talents but also for her leadership and resilience. In this episode, she discusses her new book, WOLFPACK: How to Come Together, Unleash Our Power, and Change the Game, in which she outlines the eight new rules of leadership. Abby is interviewed by Tony’s right arm, creative partner, and former ESPN writer, Mary Buckheit, who has covered Abby’s career through the decades.", 'chan_desc': '“Why live an ordinary life, when you can live an extraordinary one?” Tony Robbins, the #1 Life and Business Strategist, has helped over 50 million people from 100 countries create real and lasting change in their lives.

Hari struggled with depression for most of his life. For two different reasons, he was told it was all in his head. He got some relief with antidepressant medication but not enough. And as a journalist, he wanted to understand why more people were feeling the same way—depressed, anxious, disconnected, lonely. In this uplifting conversation from In goop Health London, Hari shared what he’s learned about the root causes of depression and the potential solutions. He talks about what happens when we don’t get our needs met, why “social prescribing” works, how we can let go of shame and process trauma, and the ways we can connect with one another right now. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | “Being alive and existing isn’t good enough,” says Dr. Robin Berzin. “We want to feel well.” The founder and CEO of the functional medicine practice Parsley Health believes that the scope of our health care system is dated, and that we need to bridge the gap between medicine and wellness. Her work melds the conventional with the traditional, and modern technology with intimate connection. Today Berzin shares her take on lab testing, diet, supplements, genetics, the future of personalized care, and more. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | “We may think we know when people are lying, but basically we have no clue,” says Malcolm Gladwell, journalist and New York Times–bestselling author of Talking to Strangers, The Tipping Point, and Blink. Gladwell explores the assumptions we make as a culture—and debunks them. Elise Loehnen, our chief content officer, asks him about misperceptions, split-second judgments, intuition, and doing the work to understand how someone feels. Gladwell shares some creative solutions that would restructure the way we live, think, work, and relate to one another. And he replaces complacency with compassion and curiosity.(For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | “I want to be frightened and afraid I’m not going to be able to do it,” says actor Sarah Paulson about what draws her to play a particular character. Paulson, who stars as Xandra in The Goldfinch (out now), met Elise Loehnen to talk about the trajectory of her career, life, and love. They talk about the times Paulson felt she was “at the mercy of other people’s opinions,” the years when she felt like she was never going to have an opportunity, and why her whole life changed when a play in New York City fell through. They talk about Paulson’s great manifestation (and how she didn’t realize she was manifesting). They talk about how hard it is to know yourself, what happens when you’re with people who demand authenticity, and what it’s been like for Paulson to capture the public imagination in her relationship with the equally incredible Holland Taylor. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | “Why should you believe that just because you have an opinion that that's the right opinion?” asks Ray Dalio, founder of prestigious investment management firm Bridgewater Associates and author of Principles. GP and Dalio talk about how they hear and hold criticism, how to have tough conversations, and how we can engage in thoughtful disagreement. They explore the rare culture Dalio created at Bridgewater—one of radical transparency, where people are both encouraged and required to speak straight, and where decision-making processes are recorded so that everyone has full visibility into the choice made. And they push us into curiosity. “If you love knowing and you’re attached to knowing, it’ll stand in the way of your learning,” says Dalio. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub and check out Dalio’s app, Principles In Action). | “I have not been able to find a single piece of research that tells me that anything bad happens when women have more money,” says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO and cofounder of Ellevest. Krawcheck joins chief content officer Elise Loehnen to talk about why women make reallygood investors and how money can mean freedom. She talks about how she became the most powerful woman on Wall Street (“in the day,” Krawcheck insists). She shares what she’s learned about the ways men and women look at money and why women are taught to feel so much shame and guilt around it. And she teaches us what to do with money and how to start investing with whatever we have. Bonus: Krawcheck is giving all interested listeners $50 to start investing at Ellevest.com/goop or on the app with gift code goop. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | Brian MacKenzie doesn’t like when people tell him to “just breathe” either. So even though he’s the founder of a (great, practical, helpful) breathing app (State), you won’t hear those words coming out of his mouth. MacKenzie, the founder of Power Speed Endurance and a performance junkie, joins chief content officer Elise Loehnen to talk about tools for dealing with stress and anxiety. He explains the difference between sympathetic and parasympathetic personalities and how we can use this knowledge to plan our day in a way that avoids burnout. He explains why we don’t make good decisions when we’re stressed out (we default to habitual responses). He convinces us of the power of breath, tells us the times and places where mouth breathing is okay, and challenges us to get through a workout with our mouths shut. Learning to control our breath, MacKenzie says, helps us run our nervous system—rather than letting it run us. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | “Ninety-nine percent of the time when we use the word ‘can’t,’ it’s really a euphemism for ‘won’t,’” says entrepreneur Marie Forleo, the author of Everything Is Figureoutable. Forleo’s specialty is bridging the gap between thinking about doing something and doing it. She believes that clarity comes from engagement, not thought. And that fear is directive, and that most of the time, it’s “trying to nudge us to a project or a possibility or a growth edge where there’s magic.” She shares her tools for following fear and for pushing beyond the mental blocks that keep us from tackling our goals. She acknowledges how scary it can be to admit what we dream of doing—and how difficult it can be even to decipher what we want. She encourages us to imagine the worst-case scenario first and figure out how to work our way back from it. And then: Imagine the very-best-case scenario. And take a step, even a small step, toward it. (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | Peggy Orenstein, bestselling author of Girls and Sex, explores the gaps and nuances of intimacy. Today, she talks to Elise about how girls and women are taught that being sexy is important, but being “sexual” is reserved for men. They talk about why women are groomed to think about the potential dangers and harms of sex first—and why we often never learn to prioritize joy (or orgasm). Orenstein’s research involves a lot of fieldwork—she visits fraternities the morning after a party to find out why texting a sexual partner the next day can be so fraught. She helps us reframe the way we think about sex and pleasure. She helps us take back control of our own sexual experience. And she guides us as we try to help our children and the generations behind us to grow into their own fulfilling intimate lives.\xa0 (For more, see The goop Podcast hub.) | This is a handbook for people of all political leanings and persuasions—and for people who aren’t political at all but want to meaningfully engage with an issue. Shannon Watts—author of Fight Like a Mother, founder of Moms Demand Action, mother of five, and self-described type A personality—never thought she’d find herself leading a movement. But she stepped to the front of one, and her life (and our world) has never been the same since. Moms Demand Action is one of the largest grassroots movements in the country, focused on protecting people from gun violence. You’ll be surprised by what Watts has learned about gun sense, buoyed by the victories she’s already had, and convinced by her conviction that there’s a better ending coming. And whatever issue matters to you, you’ll want her road map for getting involved, in small ways or big, to guide you through the practical and the emotional.

It is created. @chasejarvis via @MarieForleo You can\'t stand out and fit in at the same time. @chasejarvis via @MarieForleo | How do you know the difference between when you’re out of your comfort zone (which often kicks up some major fear) vs. when your gut is telling you NOT to do something? This is really important because, as you know, fear is normal and needs to be moved through. It often indicates that an opportunity is ideal for you.

While she loved exploring new communities and cultures with each move, she was also grappling with her identity as a biracial, queer woman, especially attending religious school. So, she turned to art as a way of both expressing herself and also processing her struggles and awakenings. She eventually found her way into the world of advertising, where she’d rise up the ladder, before the call to paint and create would begin to call her back to the world of being a full-time artist. Now, established with her work in galleries, permanent collections and large-scale public murals around the country and world, Sam creates artwork to celebrate people and to inspire pride and recognition for underrepresented communities that celebrates a wide blend of culture, identity, and speaks to the politics and issues that define so much of the public discourse today.

Has this government-approved nutritional guideline — the basis of the modern “healthy diet” — led us astray? If so, how did this happen, and what can we learn from it?

On one hand, you\'re over the moon for landing your dream job. On the other hand, being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer and told by your doctor that you\'ve got two years to live (at best) puts a bit of a damper on the celebration. You\'re determined to remain positive -- after all, you wouldn\'t be the first to beat fatalistic odds if this thing were somehow turned around, so there\'s no harm in being hopeful.

We want the best deal, or the biggest win for ourselves, regardless of what it costs the other party. Think about when you buy a car - are you thinking about the person you’re buying the car from?

Ideally, we want to avoid the latter, but many of us enter into negotiations from a position that pushes the other party away because we try to come from a place of power and strength. No one wants to be taken advantage of so that is understandable. However, the person we are negotiating with doesn’t want to feel pushed around either, and so a different kind of strength must be used when entering into a negotiation, and that strength comes from a knowledge of what you want as well as what the other person wants. When you do your research and have options, you allow the other party to negotiate with you on what they can offer you versus what you are looking for, rather than saying, “This is what I want and you must give it to me or I’m leaving.” That never ends well for anyone.A Word From Our SponsorsShare your vulnerabilities, victories, and questions in our 17,000-member private Facebook group at theartofcharm.com/challenge.

That belief, however, comes from focusing on each person’s bargaining positions rather than our interests. You can do this by focusing on the other person’s interests and what you can offer them that is of little value to you but could be of great value to them. This way you are able to negotiate a win for yourself now while making the immediate loss for the other person worthwhile because of what you can offer that person in another capacity. For example, if you negotiate a discount on a computer repair by offering to write the business owner a great review and tell your friends about them, you are making that discount a win for you and the business owner.A Word From Our SponsorsShare your vulnerabilities, victories, and questions in our 17,000-member private Facebook group at theartofcharm.com/challenge.

The same can be said for your narrative - everything you do either strengthens your narrative or weakens it.For example, if you believe you are not worthy of a promotion at work, you will make decisions every day which strengthen that narrative. However, if you wake up one day and make the choice to believe you are worthy of a promotion, then you can take conscious action to reinforce that narrative by developing positive relationships with your coworkers and supervisors as well as making sure your supervisors know you’re getting the results which make you worthy of the promotion.\xa0Over time your belief in yourself will override the narrative that was holding you back and the new positive, healthier narrative will take its place.A Word From Our SponsorsShare your vulnerabilities, victories, and questions in our 17,000-member private Facebook group at theartofcharm.com/challenge.

Indecisiveness is not a desirable trait - it shows people you are not confident in the path you’re walking through in life and you don’t value your time, because for every decision you don’t make, you are wasting time, the most precious resource any of us has because it’s the only one you can’t get more of.A Word From Our SponsorsShare your vulnerabilities, victories, and questions in our 17,000-member private Facebook group at theartofcharm.com/challenge.

Unfortunately, we only have so much time to think about these decisions so it can save us a lot of time if we at least understand how to approach each one. Small decisions, like what movie theater to go to or what appetizer to get, should take the least amount of our time since they impact our lives the least, and our time is better spent being present or contemplating more important decisions. Big decisions, like where to live or who to marry, should necessitate more time as they will have lasting effects on our lives. And lastly, decisions that are made regularly, like your morning routine or what to eat each day, should be automated as much as possible to reduce the drain on your willpower so that it can be used for resource-intensive tasks like work, or studying, or solving complex problems in your life.

And this idea applies directly to the conversations we have with people, especially when first meeting someone. Many of you will want to control the direction of a conversation and make sure you are able to highlight the good things about you and what you’ve done, rather than listen to what the other person says and allow the conversation to flow naturally by asking sincere questions and relating to what they’re saying without domineering the discussion itself.A Word From Our SponsorsShare your vulnerabilities, victories, and questions in our 17,000-member private Facebook group at theartofcharm.com/challenge.

In a lyrical talk, she invites us to slow down and appreciate stories that take us places we never thought we\'d go and introduce us to people we never thought we\'d meet. "Isn\'t that what this is all about -- finding a way, at the end of the day, to not feel alone in this world, and a way to feel like we\'ve changed it before we leave?" she asks. | Early education is critical to children\'s success -- but millions of kids in the United States still don\'t have access to programs that prepare them to thrive in kindergarten and beyond. Enter the UPSTART Project, a plan to bring early learning into the homes of children in underserved communities, at no cost to families. Education innovator Claudia Miner shares how UPSTART is setting four-year-olds up for success with 15 minutes of learning a day -- and how you can help. (This ambitious plan is a part of the Audacious Project, TED\'s initiative to inspire and fund global change.) | Ethan Lindenberger never got vaccinated as a kid. So one day, he went on Reddit and asked a simple question: "Where do I go to get vaccinated?" The post went viral, landing Lindenberger in the middle of a heated debate about vaccination and, ultimately, in front of a US Senate committee. Less than a year later, the high school senior reports back on his unexpected time in the spotlight and a new movement he\'s leading to fight misinformation and advocate for scientific truth. | Lindsay Amer is the creator of "Queer Kid Stuff," an educational video series that breaks down complex ideas around gender and sexuality through songs and metaphors. By giving kids and their families a vocabulary to express themselves, Amer is helping to create more empathetic adults -- and spreading a message of radical acceptance in a world where it\'s sometimes dangerous to just be yourself. "I want kids to grow up and into themselves with pride for who they are and who they can be," Amer says. | Reading and writing can be acts of courage that bring us closer to others and ourselves. Author Michelle Kuo shares how teaching reading skills to her students in the Mississippi Delta revealed the bridging power of the written word -- as well as the limitations of its power. | In the early 1990s, a scandal rocked evolutionary biology: scientists discovered that songbirds -- once thought to be strictly monogamous -- engaged in what\'s politely called "extra-pair copulation." In this unforgettable biology lesson on animal infidelity, TED Fellow Danielle N. Lee shows how she uses hip-hop to teach science, leading the crowd in an updated version of Naughty by Nature\'s hit "O.P.P." | Kakenya Ntaiya turned her dream of getting an education into a movement to empower vulnerable girls and bring an end to harmful traditional practices in Kenya. Meet two students at the Kakenya Center for Excellence, a school where girls can live and study safely -- and uplift their community along the way. "When you empower a girl, you transform a community," Ntaiya says. | To get young kids to thrive in school, we need to do more than teach them how to read and write -- we need to teach them how to manage their emotions, says educator Olympia Della Flora. In this practical talk, she shares creative tactics she used to help struggling, sometimes disruptive students -- things like stopping for brain breaks, singing songs and even doing yoga poses -- all with her existing budget and resources. "Small changes make huge differences, and it\'s possible to start right now ... You simply need smarter ways to think about using what you have, where you have it," she says. | How do we make sense of a world that doesn\'t? By looking in unexpected places, says mathematician Eugenia Cheng. She explains how applying concepts from abstract mathematics to daily life can lead us to a deeper understanding of things like the root of anger and the function of privilege. Learn more about how this surprising tool can help us to empathize with each other. | There\'s no greater freedom than finding your purpose, says education advocate Ashweetha Shetty. Born to a poor family in rural India, Shetty didn\'t let the social norms of her community stifle her dreams and silence her voice. In this personal talk, she shares how she found self-worth through education -- and how she\'s working to empower other rural youth to explore their potential.

She’s a Telecom reporter for the Wall Street Journal who recently wrote a piece with the self-explanatory title, “The New Ways Your Boss Is Spying on You.” And after Sarah’s interview, Liz presents a couple company surveillance scenarios to Rico and asks him to guess if they were deemed unlawful or not in a suit.Then, we’ll hear from listener Jess who’s lamenting a workless workplace--a situation that’s not as carefree as it seems.

She’s what’s called a “white hat” hacker, with the very James Bond-y handle “Snow.” Stephanie joins Liz and Rico today for a quick-fire round of the SFW classic, “5 in 5,” with 5 cybersecurity strengthening questions in 5-ish minutesThen in this week’s Lingo Bingo, we’ll go through a list of phrases submitted by you, Dear Listeners, including an innuendo that should probably be retired from the office.

And not just because it’s morally the right thing to do, but also because it’s good business.While there’s more awareness of that than ever, there’s the inevitable parallel phenomenon: pushback from workers and management who are weary of talking about it.\xa0Diversity Consultant and Sacred Heart University Professor Janice Gassam has given that phenomenon a name: “diversity fatigue.” Gassam joins us today to talk about why some people feel burned out on diversity and inclusion training, and what can be done to help everyone in the office be more receptive to it.But first, Liz and Rico let listener Deanna have a fantasy exit interview, one where it’s okay to air her grievances. And in our Work Pop segment, we’re looking back at the hilarious Comedy Central sitcom “Broad City,” and what that show can tell us about the perils of intern life.Then later, we’ll hear from listener Sarah, who’s banded together with her colleagues against a manager that she’s described as a “time sponge.”As always, if you've got a burning workplace question and need some advice, don't hesitate to send us an email (that email, unsurprisingly, is also Safe@Wondery.com).

You can examine the stories you\'re telling yourself to see if they\'re really true, and decide if the stories you’re choosing are making your work feel more or less stressful.

With her daredevil husband Maurice by her side, Katia visited over half of the world’s active volcanoes, sailed a boat into a lake of acid, and even escaped out a second-story window into a pile of volcanic ash.About the Narrator:Self-proclaimed activist May Boeve is the Executive Director of 350.org, an international climate change campaign. Founded in 2008, 350.org strives to generate the sense of urgency required to tackle the climate crisis through creative communications, organizing, and mass mobilizations. Boeve has been active in the climate movement since her days at Middlebury College. In 2006, she co-founded and led the Step It Up 2007 campaign, which brought together communities from 1,400 places for a National Day of Climate Action. Four years later, Boeve was handcuffed and arrested in front of the White House while protesting the Keystone XL pipeline. Through it all she has maintained her commitment to fighting for what’s right, and in 2015 Time Magazine recognized her as a “Next Generation Leader.” Boeve is a tireless advocate for the environment and is the co-author of the book Fight Global Warming Now.Credits:This episode of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls is produced by Elena Favilli, Joy Fowlkes and Meg Murnane, with writing by Grace Boyle and narration by May Boeve.

Everywhere she went, audiences were awed and shocked by her masterful dancing and the fury of her feet. She belonged to the Romany, a group of people in Europe known as gypsies and treated as outsiders. But Carmen would not allow her family to suffer prejudice and ignorance. Family was everything to her, and every penny she made, from dancing at taverns or in small market squares to performing in Carnegie Hall, went to support the people she loved most. The world would come to know Carmen Amaya as “The Gypsy Queen.”About the Narrator:Tanja Babich gives the term “early riser” a run for its money, waking up at 2:30 AM each weekday morning to deliver the day’s headlines at ABC 7 Chicago.

A three-time SAG Award winner, Jackie Cruz was named one of the "Top Latino Powerhouses under 40" by The Hollywood Reporter in 2013.

Landing a principal title in “Orange is the New Black,” was a launching pad for her career. Cruz draws strength from a near fatal car accident that almost left her paralyzed.

Today, we’re doing something a little different. Instead of our usual podcast format—where our guests talk about how they achieved their goals and how to get more done—I’m giving the floor over to my good friend and Chief Miracle Worker, Chip Franks, for a training and tutorial to help you get the most out of your Miracle Morning “Scribing” (aka “Journaling”) practice. Among many things, Chip has one of the most effective Scribing practice I’ve ever seen. Though he goes through almost 250 pages in his journal every month, he rarely spends more than about 15 minutes a day scribing. He believes that it is the most important personal-development practice that exists and a powerful way to turn ideas into action.

One of the most inspirational people I’ve ever met, Sean Stephenson – known around the world as the “3 Foot Giant” – passed away last week, after a wheelchair accident. Sean dedicated his life to helping people, and I was blessed to know him as a friend and mentor. Today it is my privilege to share some of his inspiration with you by giving you an opportunity to listen to the last interview that he and I did together. Because of a rare bone disorder, Sean was predicted not to survive at birth. In fact, he’d suffered over 200 fractures by the time he turned 18. However, Sean has survived, thrived, and lived a life that has inspired millions around the world. He’s appeared on Oprah and Jimmy Kimmel Live, has online videos with 10+ million views, been the subject of a TV series for A&E called 3 Foot Giant, and published a book titled Get Off Your But: How to End Self-Sabotage. \xa0 \xa0 Get The Full Show Notes To get full access to today's show notes, including audio, transcript, and links to all the resources mentioned, visit HalElrod.com/286 \xa0 Subscribe, Rate & Review I would love if you could subscribe to the podcast and leave an honest rating & review.

The order was simple: Burn the boats.  He wanted his men to realize that they had no opportunity to retreat, so they had to give this fight everything they had. Failure was no longer an option and winning this battle just became that much more important.  There is much debate about the legitimacy of this story, both in reference to the true intentions of Cortés and whether the actual burning took place at all.  However, regardless of the accuracy in this particular case, this phrase “Burn your boats” has become popular advice in the context of business and success.  In today’s episode, my friend and best-selling author, Tim Grahl, and I discuss why burning your boats may be the wrong strategy and one you want to avoid, and then we share what we believe will be a much better approach for your to take your success to the next level and beyond. \xa0 Get The Full Show Notes To get full access to today's show notes, including audio, transcript, and links to all the resources mentioned, visit HalElrod.com/283 You can also find a special version of the episode on the PremoCast app (iPhone only):\xa0http://blog.premocast.com/episode-283 \xa0 Subscribe, Rate & Review I would love if you could subscribe to the podcast and leave an honest rating & review.

The answer might surprise you. Our cavemen and cavewomen ancestors were biologically programmed to do two things: survive and rest. Our agenda back then was simple: hunt and gather food so that we could sustain life, find shelter, and rest until we needed more food to eat or a new shelter to rest under. We were NOT, however, designed to achieve, to get ahead, or to be successful. So, to this day human beings unconsciously abide by our inborn human nature, and it prevents us from creating and experiencing what we deeply want to create and experience in our lives. On today’s podcast, I share raw, unfiltered thoughts and powerful, life-changing information that can help you transcend your innate human nature (that is holding you back). You’re also going to learn about how society conditions us to want things that don’t make us happy, why you’re always going to be drawn toward taking the path of least resistance, and how to overcome the laws of the universe to do what we need in order to create everything you want and deserve. \xa0 Get The Full Show Notes To get full access to today's show notes, including audio, transcript, and links to all the resources mentioned, visit HalElrod.com/282 You can also find a special version of the episode on the PremoCast app (iPhone only):\xa0http://blog.premocast.com/episode-282 \xa0 Subscribe, Rate & Review I would love if you could subscribe to the podcast and leave an honest rating & review.

Hossenfelder argues that physicists have become overly enamored with the elegance and aesthetics of their theories and that using beauty to evaluate a model is unscientific. The conversation includes a discussion of similar challenges in economics. | Dani Rodrik of Harvard University talks about neoliberalism with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Rodrik argues that a dogmatic embrace of markets has increased inequality and limited who benefits from economic growth. He argues for a more interventionist approach to the economy with the goal of better-paying jobs and more widely shared prosperity. | George Will talks about his new book, The Conservative Sensibility, with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Will argues for a conservative vision that embraces the dynamic nature of life. Topics discussed include the current political landscape, the American founding, James Madison\'s vision of government vs. Woodrow Wilson\'s, Friedrich Hayek, and of course, a little baseball. | Economist and author Daron Acemoglu of MIT discusses with EconTalk host Russ Roberts the challenge of shared prosperity and the policies that could bring about a more inclusive economy. Acemoglu argues for the importance of good jobs over redistribution and makes the case for the policies that could lead to jobs and opportunities across skill levels. | Can a great leader or manager be humble in public?

How did Churchill deal with the mistakes he inevitably made in a long career? Was he prescient or just the right man in the right place at the right time? Was he an alcoholic? Did he suffer from depression? Drawing on his recent biography of Churchill, Andrew Roberts answers these and other questions in this wide-ranging conversation that includes a discussion of the mechanics of writing a 1000 page book on a man who has had over 1000 biographies written about him already. | Author and economist Tyler Cowen of George Mason University talks about his book, Big Business, with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Cowen argues that big corporations in America are underrated and under-appreciated. He even defends the financial sector while adding some caveats along the way. This is a lively and contrarian look at a timely issue. | Arthur Diamond of the University of Nebraska at Omaha talks about his book, Openness to Creative Destruction, with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Diamond sings the sometimes forgotten virtues of innovation and entrepreneurship and argues that they should be taught more prominently as a central part of economics. | Software Engineer Andy Matuschak talks about his essay "Why Books Don\'t Work" with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Matuschak argues that most books rely on transmissionism, the idea that an author can share an idea in print and the reader will absorb it. And yet after reading a non-fiction book, most readers will struggle to remember any of the ideas in the book. Matuschak argues for a different approach to transmitting ideas via the web including different ways that authors or teachers can test for understanding that will increase the chances of retention and mastery of complex ideas. | Shoshana Zuboff of Harvard University talks about her book Surveillance Capitalism with EconTalk host Russ Roberts.

Telling yourself you\'re allowed to relax and then worrying that you\'re really not allowed to be relaxing because you haven\'t figured everything out yet.News flash: Everything will never be figured out. And what I mean by that is: as soon as you figure things out there will be new things to figure out.I am trying to take my own advice. And trying to let myself float in the metaphorical pool.I don\'t usually start these posts with a diary entry like I just did, I usually get right to my F* It Diet advice. So let\'s do it. Here we go.This is one of the most asked questions since my book came out by both book readers\xa0and\xa0by people new to my site or my instagram:AM I ALLOWED TO BE VEGETARIAN/(OR VEGAN) ON TFID?!?Short answer: Yes.But there is also a long answer. There is always a long answer.Long answer: It is totally possible to be vegetarian, or vegan, for the right reasons🌹. But (BIG but), when you are dealing with chronic dieting, disordered eating, or eating disorders, it is rarely (fully) for the right reasons.EVEN IF you tell yourself you are only being vegetarian for ethical reasons, if you have some sort of eating issue, then a disordered and fear-based reason for being vegetarian is often tangled in\xa0with your ethical reasons. A lot of people hide their disordered eating, even from themselves, behind vegetarianism or other moralistic ways to eat, and call themselves responsible, instead of acknowledging it is still a manifestation of control issues.A lot of people recovering from eating disorders adopt veganism or vegetarianism as a sort of buffer, because it feels safe. "Ok I\'ll eat more, but I\'ll only eat ___________". It\'s another (socially acceptable) set of rules and another way to exert some control over your eating that makes you feel safe. It\'s understandable. And it\'s common. But there is still more to unpack on the reasons why you are eating the way you are eating.It\'s also a common expression of orthorexia (a fear of impurity and a disordered worry about food and health.)Here is a barometer: if you are doing it because you genuinely care, but you don\'t feel any sort of stress over slipping up and eating some soup with a little butter or stock in it, then it\'s closer to a healthy relationship for you.If you are trying to be vegetarian or vegan and you over worry, over think, over scrutinize menus, and get panicked when think you might have eaten something that doesn\'t fit your rules, that\'s a big sign that there is something else going on, and that being vegetarian might not actually be the healthiest for you at the time.So! If you are recovering from dieting or disordered eating, and want to be vegetarian (or vegan) for whatever reason, I would say: see if you are willing to go through a time where you are either not vegetarian or vegan, or in the very least, see if you can stop being stressed or over-worried about it.Sustainability matters, but your mental health matters too. It isn\'t mutually exclusive.This is a matter of constant checking in on why we do the... | Here is another podcast episode with life updated and answering your questions!!!!I\'m going to take a 3 month podcast hiatus to focus on The F*ck It Diet Book Club, see you at the end of the summer! | IN CASE YOU HAVEN\'T HEARD ME YELLING ABOUT IT ALL OVER MY CORNERS OF THE INTERNET, MY BOOK IS OUT! You find lots of purchase links here (or read the beginning for free).Today... there\'s no new post. Just a new podcast episode where I ramble, tell you to buy my book, and answer some listener questions! ENJOY. | Lots of people have been asking me: "Is TFID the same as Intuitive Eating?"It is and it isn\'t. They have the same goal:\xa0body trust, appetite trust, and food trust,\xa0with different ways of teaching and explaining how to get there.A lot of my writing over the years has talked about how I turned (what I thought was) "intuitive eating" and "listening to my body" into a diet. I turned it into a weird stressful attempt to eat the smallest amount possible. I interpreted good advice through a fat-phobic, food fearing, diet culture belief system.Lots of people do the same thing I did: they take good advice and twist it into a diet that they convince themselves is not a diet,\xa0because they let themselves eat a few squares of dark chocolate 3 times a week! Moderation is intuition! Right?! (UGH!)But... the more I\'ve been asked to answer if TFID is the same as intuitive eating, the more I realize it\'s important to reflect on how I\'ve referred to IE over the past seven years of writing this site, as well as in my book that\'s coming out in less than a month.First of all, Intuitive Eating is a book written by two registered dietitian nutritionists, Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, that came out in 1995. The book is revolutionary in its genre and field, completely evidence based, and I recommend you read it.However, my experience with official Intuitive Eating and the official Intuitive Eating book is actually pretty limited, which means the way that I\'ve referred to it (or not referred to it) should probably be examined. In fact, the book Intuitive Eating and Geneen Roth\'s books are mixed up in my mind at this very moment as I write this. Maybe that\'s because there is a hunger scale in both of them? (And I DEF turned that hunger scale into a diet.)I only read Intuitive Eating book once, when I was 18. And I\'m not positive if I even finished it because I became a raw vegan 2 weeks later.I obsessively dieted as a teenager. I went on every fad diet that existed at the time. It was disordered, it was extreme, and I felt more and more and more out of control with food the more I dieted. When I read the book Intuitive Eating, it was the first time I realized that my dieting was dysfunctional. Before then, I thought that this was just the way it had to be. I remember the book really spoke to me.But I still didn\'t fully understand how deep it all went for me: culturally and metabolically and emotionally and on and on. And I didn\'t see how messed up my relationship was with weight,\xa0and how that was actually the core of the whole thing.I needed very, very explicit instructions to F*** IT: f*** all diet and weight loss noise, and be willing to gain weight and take up space and be angry and prioritize my mental health over my desire to be a pretty little thing. But I was also young, and clearly needed to suffer a little more before I really understood that dieting was\xa0always\xa0going to backfire.(***I bleep curse words for iTunes)Weeks after reading the book, and just a few weeks before I went off to college, my mom told me she had cancer, and we both became raw vegan to try and heal all of our earthly ills (it didn\'t work) (my mom is fine, but not because of raw veganism, she ditched it soon after starting chemo) (also, I have complex feelings about pharmaceutical companies too, but raw veganism was still not the answer).(Yes I was a raw vegan in freshman year of college.)I was raw vegan for almost a year - and then after I realized it wasn\'t "working" (read: I was less healthy, starving all the time, horrible skin, horrible digestion, and crazier than ever around food), I started trying to "eat intuitively" again... for 6 years. My general idea was that if I could listen to my body, and "not eat too much," that that\xa0was intuitive. But I didn\'t revisit the book, instead, for six years I did some version of "listening to my body sooooo closely and constantly trying to eat the smallest amount possible". | I started writing about how to\xa0heal from disordered eating and body hatred seven years ago, back when I was f---king* sick of being afraid of rice, and being full, and gaining weight. My life was hijacked by the obsession with beauty and thinness and health and purity. And I was f---ing\xa0over it.I didn\'t start this website to become instagram famous or become a "thought leader" or "influencer" in this space. (Ew?) I didn\'t set out to work with people or run groups. And I definitely didn\'t think I was going to have a book coming out on not-dieting. I was just a writer --and I was anonymous for the first three years.I was just f---ing exhausted of diet culture and my own f---ing brain\xa0and I felt\xa0very strongly that I needed to write about it, for my own sake, on a little blog that no one read.I was writing about what I was applying to myself as I clawed my way out of the miserable hole I was in.\xa0We all just needed to f---ing\xa0eat\xa0and rebel against absurd body standards.I kept writing, and learning, and eating, and writing. Eventually I put together workshops and courses, teaching some of the ways I helped myself process fear and resistance and diet culture. I\'ve always had a special interest in the way we avoid our bodies, and our emotions, and our humanity, plus all of the subconscious cultural beliefs we are operating under that need to GTFO.My "expertise" is on how we are afraid of our hunger - and how that will always mess up our eating. And a huge\xa0part of that, if not the core underlying factor, is our fear of our bodies, and our cultural fear of, and misconceptions about, fatness. That\'s always been clear to me: Fat-phobia\xa0is the reason we are messed up around food, and the reason we fear gaining weight above anything else.But still, no matter how much I care, or how important it is to me: I will always inherently have\xa0blind-spots in writing about the full scope of these issues, because of my many privileges. It\'s just a fact.I am not an ultimate authority on body image, body acceptance, body positivity, or fat liberation, even though I know how important those things are.My thin privilege inherently becomes one of my shortcomings on this subject. In the BIG PICTURE, me learning to accept my body isn\'t really that radical, because I have always naturally been on the thinner side. And even when I\'ve yo-yo\'d A LOT, I\'ve always had thin privilege.A thin girl saying: "stop dieting! we should be allowed to get full and gain weight" feels safer to people. (But still ...not that\xa0safe. People still tell me I am giving dangerous irresponsible advice). But if I were fatter saying the exact same thing, so many more people would say: "Woa woa woa, stop trying to make excuses for your lack of willpower and laziness. Stop \'glorifying obesity\'. Stop leading people into disease."\xa0And then they\'d probably tell me to die of heart disease along with other explicit and aggressive threats.I have always been able to say things that people in larger bodies also say, and people listen to me, because they assume TFID is "working" for me, because I am thin. And this is based on major misinformation about how much control we have over our weight, and what weight\xa0means\xa0about us and about our health and our habits... and all the other s#@t our culture teaches about fatness.So that is one of the first problematic things - I have been given a voice and a platform\xa0because\xa0of the systemic prejudice I am trying to talk about - the assumptions we make about people based on their size. The assumption that I\'m doing something\xa0right,\xa0and that fatter people are doing something wrong.Also, TFID is meant to be for every body and every size: the instructions are the same. But one piece of those instructions is to rebel against societal beauty standards, and a fat person learning to rebel against society will experience a lot more pain and pushback than me\xa0being like, "oh, | Some people assume that The F*ck It Diet is unnecessarily extreme.They assume it\'s a steady diet of donuts, McDonald\'s, and fried ice cream for the rest of our short little lives. That we\'re a group of lazy anarchists who are reveling in our newfound food-related health problems, and not taking any personal responsibility for our health, and who refuse to make any attempts at self-improvement.Or they think: Why can\'t we just be balanced? Why can\'t we just enjoy cake every so often but mostly try to eat a healthy, moderate diet?The answer is because: we\'ve tried that.Also, chronic dieting is somewhere on the eating disorder spectrum, so for people who\'ve become obsessed with dieting, trying "to be balanced" doesn\'t work. It doesn\'t heal us. And\xa0ironically, it perpetuates feeling totally out of control with food.There is nothing wrong with true balance, but for many people, "just trying to be balanced" becomes the new diet. Not to mention that after years of restriction and dieting, balance\xa0is\xa0eating a hell of a lot, for a good chunk of time.The beautiful thing I found, once I truly allowed myself to eat with total abandon, is that my body actually spoke up. After years of bingeing and restricting and bingeing again, once I stopped judging myself for eating and stopped trying to micromanage my weight, my body actually\xa0finally\xa0felt fed, and my lifelong food obsession melted away.Note: I\xa0never\xa0thought that could happen. I thought I was born a food addict, and would die a food addict.The F*ck It Diet is the (seemingly) counter-intuitive way to stop feeling insane around food. Allowance paves way for easier, nourishing health choices, and getting in tune with what your body wants and needs. It\'s a way to get to a place where you can easily feed yourself a varied diet, without too much overthinking, and get on with your life.However, I know it feels more complicated for some people. I understand why people still fear certain foods, especially if they don\'t feel well, or if certain foods make them feel sick. And some foods really do make people feel sick.\xa0I understand this first hand: wanting to heal your obsession with food and dieting, but wondering if you\'re actually causing your own pain and misery, and fearing that you need to be avoiding certain foods.And so here are a couple things I want to remind you about food, weight, dieting, and health that may calm you down.The biggest issue with dieting is assuming that weight is the\xa0cause\xa0of our health problems. That\'s like blaming coughing for causing your cold. Weight can be symptom of underlying health problems, (and it can also just be... your body). But either way, focusing on weight loss is not your best bet to improve health, not matter what.Stress from weight stigma has also been shown to cause the health problems that are blamed on the weight itself - including increased mortality.The other issue with dieting is assuming that you can\'t trust your hunger and your appetite, and that the less you eat the better. No. That makes no sense. That is not good for you. That is not supportive of health\xa0or\xa0a good relationship with food. It\'s not supportive of a strong metabolism, or good digestion, or good sleep, or anything really.The Fuck It Diet is calorie positive. Calories aren\'t a problem or the problem. Same with carbs, sugar, fat, and protein. Food is good for us.So... once you can step out of both of those ways of thinking (demonizing weight and demonizing hunger/food) you can eat however makes you feel good. For people who have food sensitivities or who feel better eating a certain way, you can do whatever feels good and right, as long as you have healed your relationship to food and weight. Does that make sense?And once you have healed your relationship to food, if a certain food makes you feel terrible, you can re-evaluate your relationship to it. Do you\xa0want\xa0to eat it if it makes you feel bad? | I am in the last stages of finalizing my book, and I just found a glaring error about\xa0weight\xa0and starvation which shows\xa0my bias and assumptions about weight.In the book I wrote that if a famine never ended, you would eventually become emaciated and die.BUT THAT ISN\'T TRUE.If a famine never ended, you could still die in 8-12 weeks,\xa0even if you\'re fat,\xa0because your body would break down your muscles to convert to ketones to keep your brain and body running, and in the absence of food, would weaken your heart so much that you\'d die. If you still had some access to food, and were eating only a little, the same thing could happen, just slower.You can also die just from not having the electrolytes to keep your heart working.You will die from malnutrition whether you are skinny or fat.And if you don\'t need to be skinny to die of starvation, guess what the fuck that means about dieting? Still think weight and weight loss are fully within our control?!?!Also, the fact that I had it wrong in my book (a book that talks a\xa0lot\xa0about how weight stigma affects our relationship with food) is\xa0scaryyyyyy to meeee. It also just goes to show how deep weight stigma and weight assumptions run.(And yes, I just emailed my editor in a panic that this HAD TO BE CHANGED, even though it is VERY last minute.)So while we are at it, let\'s talk about some more weight facts:You can have anorexia in a fat body.Anorexia does not make everyone skinny.You can still be fat even if you barely eat anything.You will still experience the same effects of starvation and malnutrition, no matter what your external weight set point is.A person\'s weight does\xa0not give you any information about how they eat\xa0or\xa0their health.Our weight is not really as easily manipulated and controlled as we think - we have\xa0weight set ranges\xa0that are set by genetics. The body does\xa0not\xa0want to be above or below our particular range.Most (if not all) weight loss studies have only looked at the short term results. And the ones that have looked at long term results have seen weight regain\xa0and\xa0poorer health\xa0because of the diet and weight cycling and stress/stigma.Every health problem under the sun seems to be blamed on a\xa0high weight,\xa0but weight is just a scapegoat. Sometimes weight gain is a\xa0symptom\xa0of other health issues, but blaming the issues\xa0on weight\xa0is not only missing the mark, but also may be causing the very health problems it claims to be fixing.Yes, weight stigma is terrible for us, and the health problems blamed on weight\xa0(including increased mortality!) are more likely caused by the weight stigma itself.Weight stigma is the real national health crisis,\xa0not\xa0"obesity". "Obesity" being called a health crisis alone\xa0is\xa0weight stigma - see how cyclical this gets???In addition, weight\xa0cycling and dieting\xa0are detrimental to our health. Especially yo-yo dieting or restrictive fad diets that are focused on\xa0weight loss.People can and do improve their health\xa0without\xa0losing weight.People also hurt their health by focusing on weight loss.And I haven\'t even touched on the MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT of weight focus, dieting, weight stigma, and body fixation.I can\'t believe that I got that tidbit about starvation so so so wrong, even with all of the other things that I know about weight, health, and weight stigma. So here is to doing better, here is to learning, and here is to listening.The truth about weight stigma and fat phobia, is that\xa0it permeates the very air we breathe. None of us can avoid it.\xa0We all have it and can perpetuate it,\xa0even with good intentions,\xa0and we need to just be super aware of our assumptions.I\'ve probably missed some other essential facts too, so, message me on instagram and let me know what I\'m forgetting about the BASIC PHYSICAL FACTS ABOUT WEIGHT AND WEIGHT STIGMA.Oh and pre-order my book! I promise I\'m fixing that mistake! The book tackles weight stigma and diet culture... | Some of the angriest comments I get on instagram are from people who swear that the keto diet is helping them and that I\'m soooo incredibly ignorant and/or deceitful for saying that the body prefers carbs.However, for every comment where someone is swearing by keto, there are twenty more comments with people saying that they too tried keto, with hope bursting in their hearts, only to find that after a few months it had fucked up their metabolism, hormones, energy levels, sanity, and has been really hard to recover from, mentally and physically.I\'ve spent a long time trying to decide how to be diplomatic and to not claim to know what\'s best for everyone\'s body. Because-- everyone is different.\xa0Some people are allergic to fucking tomatoes. We\xa0are all different.I\'m also not a doctor or nutritionist or dietitian so I have no authority\xa0or desire to weigh in on diets that people claim are medically necessary and helpful to them. TFID is concerned with the mental and spiritual ramifications of chronic dieting, it just so happens that there are very physical consequences to dieting, too.So in my attempts to be diplomatic, I say things like: I\'m so glad you feel good on keto, but this is an account for people trying to heal from chronic dieting or disordered eating, and your comments about keto do not belong here. And many\xa0many people have had opposite experiences on keto.I\'ve also compared keto to wheelchairs or mobility devices. Meaning, just because a select number of people are benefitted (read: children with seizures, maybe), that doesn\'t mean that it\xa0cures\xa0any underlying condition, and also doesn\'t mean that people who\xa0don\'t\xa0need keto/mobility devices should be using them, in fact if they do, it will probably make things worse in the long run. (I also asked Anna Sweeney,\xa0MS, RD, LDN, CEDRD-S, who uses a wheelchair,\xa0if this was a cool comparison and she gave me the green light.)But the most honest thing I can say about the keto diet is: what the fuck do you think I\'m going to say?\xa0Keto is a very, very restrictive diet, and therefore it has no place in or on or around The Fuck It Diet. It has no place in the lives of people recovering from disordered eating or eating disorders.And if you are someone who\xa0is\xa0on the keto diet and you feel great, then you don\'t need the Fuck It Diet either. Why are we fighting? If your diet is truly supporting your mental and physical health: that\'s\xa0great. Round of applause. Most people don\'t have that experience, and I\'d love for you to check in with me in two or three years and tell me how you\'re doing, too.More frankly: I don\'t care how you eat, Pamela. Eat a no-carb-diet to your heart\'s content. I have no desire to evangelize you. If it is \'working\' for you - I\'m not going to try and tell you it\'s not working.If you want  to know what I think,\xa0the short term "benefits" of the keto diet, and any diet for that matter, are just that: short term. The long term effects can be physically and mentally devastating, and have yet to be truly studied.So, where does this leave us?Do you need to do keto?If you want to recover from chronic dieting: NO. HELL NO.But could keto cure your chronic health problems?\xa0Probably not. It was shown to help children with epilepsy in the 1920s, but it still comes with side effects (kidney strain, hypoglycemia, dehydration, GI issues, etc). Are those side effects worth it for kids with epilepsy? Yes! Potentially! Is it the cure-all that people claim it is? I don\'t think so.Will keto help you lose weight?Temporarily, yes. Like all diets. But now we are getting into our usual TFID rigemroll. Diets backfire longterm. It\'s how we are wired. And, diets and weight loss can actually negatively impact health, against all our cultural common knowledge. We are all confused about weight loss and health. We are assuming weight loss is always good for us - often it\'s not\xa0.But more importantly, | Lots of people ask me, “ok -- I can get behind the “no dieting” thing, but aren’t there foods that are inherently …\xa0shitty?\xa0Shouldn’t I still avoid shitty food, even while I’m “not dieting”?Here\'s the thing -\xa0 and it\'s important: If I told you stop dieting but to try and avoid or even limit “shitty food,” that would first of all, be a rule, which is a diet, which would turn into restriction in many people’s heads and fuck up their eating anyway.But people would also think,\xa0oh jeez… So there IS food that I should be eating and food I shouldn’t be eating? But which food is shitty food? I thought we were neutralizing food? What will happen to me if I do eat it? If it\'s a sometimes thing, how often is it okay to eat shitty food? Should I really just avoid shitty food always? \xa0And that way of thinking is not the Fuck It Diet, and it will\xa0not help you.Look, let me play devil\'s advocate with myself. If we zoom way out: We have polluted our planet and our food and our water and our air and our soil and our homes. We have. It’s a fact. It goes way, way deeper than food or packaged food or "shitty food". There are way worse things in the air than whatever food additive you\'re afraid of or whatever fried food you\'re avoiding. Pollution is everywhere. I could make you afraid of drinking water and taking a breath and taking a shower. But that would not help you.\xa0You could easily spend every moment of your day thinking about it and worrying about it and trying to avoid all pollution - but you cannot avoid it. You can’t. It’s a dark reality.I actually care\xa0deeply\xa0about environmental sustainability, and cleaning up our planet, but I also care deeply about helping people heal disordered eating and restore their mental health and quality of life, and focus on resilience instead of fear.In a way, pollution and disordered eating are\xa0both\xa0issues of quality of life, and they aren’t mutually exclusive. You can feed yourself organic foods when you want or when it is possible, you can vote with your dollar, (if you have the luxury and privilege of being able to afford it), you can volunteer for environmental sustainability groups and charities,\xa0and\xa0eat packaged snacks when that’s what you crave, or when that’s all that’s available.We can and should be able to do\xa0both.Food perfectionism has gotten you nowhere. Stress over the food you eat is arguably worse for you than the food itself. Stress has been shown to change gut microbiota, can shut down or slow digestion, and raise inflammation. The lining of the gut is literally a part of our nervous system, and every process in our body is interconnected. Stress physically affects your body, your nervous system, and your bodily functions and processes.On the other hand, under calmer circumstances, our bodies are wired and equipped to take the good from food and process out the bad. These are all reasons to just surrender during this process and let yourself eat whatever food you want, “whole” or “shitty” or somewhere in between.Fuck it, listen to your body, and eat the funfetti. | Maintaining a low weight is one of my core values. How am I supposed to be happy if I sacrifice one of my core values?I have heard something like this again and again, and I think...\xa0maintaining a low weight is one of your core values? Like treating others the way you’d want to be treated and being honest?Maintaining a low weight is not a core value. It’s a fear-based ingrained societal standard, created to make money off of your insecurities. Keeping your weight below\xa0where it wants to be\xa0relies on fear and fixation. The only thing we like about it is the high of fitting in, getting praise, feeling safe, and the temporary relief that comes when we reach a goal weight. Whew, now everyone will leave me alone and approve of me. Now I’llllll leave me alone.That\'s until it isn’t good enough anymore, or we gain it back and feel horrible about ourselves, and the cycle continues.Better focuses like health, self-care, movement, eating what feels good, and dressing yourself in clothes you like aren’t even core values. They are, however, awesome ways to take care of yourself. Feeling healthy and strong and embodied is a perfectly legitimate desire or goal, but living in a constant food and weight obsession is not.“Staying healthy and thin/fit” as a core value also relies on the belief that health and weight are fully within your control, and that controlling your food and weight will actually lead to better health - all things that that have been proven untrue. Goals and core values that are more self-loving and self-forgiving will almost certainly end up being better for your overall health anyway.A core value that’ll serve you better is “prioritizing your needs” or “taking care of yourself,” and if you have a weight obsession or eating disorder, prioritizing your needs is gonna look a lot like The Fuck It Diet and eating what you want.You have every right to remain someone who judges your daily worth based on your weight, but it’s not gonna be fun for very long.', 'chan_desc': 'This podcast is for chronic dieters who want support navigating diet culture, and learning to eat normally.

Over the years I have gotten extremely good at reframing almost any negative situation of adversity that I encounter and it has made a HUGE impact in my life.\xa0 I often get asked how I am able to remain so positive and how it always looks like life is “perfect” on my side. The truth is, life is FAR from perfect, but I have learned to find the silver lining is just about EVERY situation I come across. Today’s episode, is specifically targeting toward phrase you should never say if you want a successful business. In general, as an entrepreneur, it is quite common to encounter a slew of limiting beliefs that can hold you back from building the business of your dreams. Things like failure, saturated markets, Instagram algorithms, etc., can make you feel like you have NO chance in finding success.\xa0 Well, I’m here to change that story for you! Today we are talking about 6 phrases to never say if you want a successful business and a reframe for each phrase in case you ever catch yourself saying them!\xa0 P.S Guess what?!

Something that I’ve struggled with in the past was constantly justifying my actions when I wanted something. I couldn’t possibly have a luxury car AND my perfect soul mate. I shouldn’t dare to dream of having my ideal healthy body AND a million dollar business.\xa0 On today’s podcast episode, I want to explain why I believe “Because I WANT to” is a good enough response when you’re asked why you want a desire. Not only do you not need an excuse for others, but you also don’t need to explain your reasoning to your EGO either.\xa0 If your Higher Self is calling in a desire, that is ENOUGH reason to want it. Anything you’ve ever wanted simply is a desire that needs absolutely NO explanation. This podcast episode is more of a reminder than a lesson and I hope it leaves you feeling inspired and ready to go after your biggest dreams, JUST because you want to! P.s.

This belief usually stems from the thought that entrepreneurs can “control” how much money comes in and a 9-5 income is FIXED.\xa0 On today’s episode, I want to share with you why money is NOT fixed and where is ACTUALLY comes from.\xa0 Most people believe and see money as paper or in physical form, when the truth is, it is 100% ENERGY. When you see money as energy and believe to your core that YOU, and only you, have full control over how much money comes into your life, money manifestation becomes effortless.\xa0 Get nerdy with me and tune into today’s episode to learn about quantum physics behind money and exactly how to step into the version of yourself that has all the money he/she desires.\xa0 In This Episode You Will Learn:\xa0 Where money comes from (8:54) Fact that money is energy (9:48) What your subconscious mind does to energy we see (11:11) Collapsing Timelines (12:58) How to embody the version of yourself with money (15:15) There is no such thing as FIXED money (20:00) \xa0 Questions I Answer: What is your relationship to money?

This is a question I have spent YEARS trying to understand and articulate in the work that I put out into the world. On a daily basis we hear a voice inside our heads. Sometimes it’s feeding us thoughts of love, excitement, and calm energy, while other times the voice causes a physical response filled with fear, anxiety, and panic. So how do we know if our intuition is trying to tell us we’re in danger?\xa0 Recently, when I was flying home after a girls trip to Texas, I was blessed with an experience that IMMEDIATELY made this concept CLEAR. In a whirlwind of panic and frantic thoughts, I ran off a flight thinking my intuition was warning me of a dangerous situation.\xa0 Yes...I can’t believe I did that either! Tune into this episode and learn why this incredibly frantic situation blessed me with a lesson I will now forever teach my students.

Some people I met for the first time and some were long time friends I was catching up with, but there was one thing that particularly stood out to me. I realized that ALL of our conversations were centered around BIG ideas, changing the world, expressing massive gratitude, and discussing SOLUTION.\xa0 The conversations that we have on a daily basis with all the people in our life play a MASSIVE role in our reality. What you focus on in conversation is what you are manifesting in your life.

But what actually happens to the plastic if we just throw it away? Emma Bryce traces the life cycles of three different plastic bottles, shedding light on the dangers these disposables present to our world. | In the 13th century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission to take over Eurasia, swiftly conquering countries and drawing them into his empire. But, legend has it that there was one obstacle that even he couldn’t overcome: a towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass. M Jackson explores the ancient methods of growing glaciers and how they can be used to combat climate change. | This animation is part of our new series, "There\'s a Poem for That," which features animated interpretations of poems both old and new that give language to some of life\'s biggest feelings. Check out the full series here: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTheresAPoemForThat | In 132 CE, Zhang Heng presented his latest invention: a large vase he claimed could tell them whenever an earthquake occurred for hundreds of miles. Today, we no longer rely on pots as warning systems, but earthquakes still offer challenges to those trying to track them. Why are earthquakes so hard to anticipate, and how could we get better at predicting them? Jean-Baptiste P. Koehl investigates. | A shooting star crashes onto Earth and a hideous blob emerges. It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides. It’s also unstoppable: no matter what you throw at it, it just re-grows and continues its rampage. The only way to save the planet is to cut the entire blob into precise acute triangles while it sleeps, rendering it inert. Can you stop the blob from destroying the planet? Dan Finkel shows how. | The talented herbalist Xu Xian had just started his own medicine shop where he created remedies with the help of his wife, Bai Su Zhen. One day a monk named Fa Hai approached him, warning him that there was a demon in his house. The demon, he said, was Bai Su Zhen. Xu Xian laughed. How could his kind-hearted wife be a demon? Shunan Teng traces the tale of the immortal white snake. | You’re on an airplane when you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing seems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle you and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air in the atmosphere. What exactly is turbulence, and why does it happen? Tomás Chor dives into one of the prevailing mysteries of physics: the complex phenomenon of turbulence. | In the 1600s, the Dutch East India Company employed hundreds of ships to trade goods around the globe. In order to fund their voyages, the company turned to private citizens to invest money to support trips in exchange for a share of the profits. In doing so, they unknowingly invented the world’s first stock market. So how do companies and investors use the market today? Oliver Elfenbaum explains. | Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, Neolithic farmers began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization. Today, the world produces roughly 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. Paul Kindstedt shares the history of one of our oldest and most beloved foods. | It’s late, pitch dark and a self-driving car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear at the same time. With no human at the wheel, the car uses smart eyes, sensors that’ll resolve these details all in a split-second. How is this possible?

Is that correct?Ms. Samuels:  Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training?Bill:  I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms.Ms. Samuels:  Yes and no.  Let me see if I can clarify that.  The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.Bill:  Could you elaborate on that?Ms. Samuels:  Sure.  What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it’s in writing.  Bill:  Let me see if I have that right.  This contract is for six months of training, but if it isn’t cancelled, continues for another six months.  Is that right?  Ms. Samuels:  Yes, that’s right.  Bill:  Okay, that’s clear enough.

Sarah Centrella joins the show today to tell Sher, Nance, and the DreamTribe how to envision, articulate, and create exactly the lives we want. Sarah gives us a juicy new sneak peek at her soon-to-be-released book, #FutureBoards, which is all about creating vision boards that bring forth our dreamiest dreams. She shares her own story of hitting rock bottom and how she used the power of daydreaming, hope and ‘What If?’ thinking to turn her life around. Sarah describes why her methods are different than all the rest, and how we can all get started right away with manifesting the best versions of our lives. \xa0 Takeaways: ● Sarah’s new book #FutureBoards will be available at Target stores nationwide in July. It’s all about creating vision boards that actually work. ● The timing of this week’s episode is perfect for Sheri and Nancy. They are working their Pillar Pages and both feel something big bubbling up. As they look forward to a summer break, Sarah’s techniques for manifesting the future are exactly what they need right now. ● Daydreaming is a warm bath for your spirit. It is a gentle way to give yourself hope and explore all those powerful ‘What If?’ thoughts. ● Sarah hit rock bottom when her marriage ended, but she used the techniques she teaches today to reinvent herself. ● Words matter. #FutureBoards is different than a typical vision board because it works on shaping what it is we want first, then putting a visual behind it that feels right on target. ● Whatever you focus on is going to make its way to you, so why not make it something you desire? ● Over the summer, Sher and Nance will check in about their FutureBoards. They invite the DreamTribe to do it along with them! \xa0 Mentioned in This Episode: The Beautiful No Reflections  #FutureBoards\xa0 Pinterest\xa0 Sarah Centrella Gordana Biernat  Under the Tuscan Sun  Provence, 1970 \xa0 The Pillar Shop is filled with so many fabulous goodies to treat yourself and your loved ones.

Her show, The Wellness Mama Podcast, focuses on natural living and ways to improve your life and the lives of those in your care. She’s just a wellspring of wisdom, this one.\xa0 In this week’s episode, Katie joins Sher and Nance to talk about the Health + Wellness Pillar, how she overcame her own challenges and created a wellness culture at home. Katie shares a few fail-safe practices to find structure and happiness.\xa0 Listen DreamTribe, we all know this is true: it’s about spending time with who really matters and making sure we honor those non-negotiables! \xa0 Takeaways: ● Nance is in Cleveland taking care of her mom and shoring up the Friends + Family Pillar with some of her dearest and oldest friends. ● When you’re traveling (or at home) yum yourself up with plants, good workouts, and meditation… and keep an eye on the booze! ● While Nancy is surprising herself and sticking to her Orangetheory workouts even while traveling, Sheri manifested a Soulcycle fire alarm and evacuation. ● Katie’s journey started in 2006 when she took her health into her own hands by researching the answers to her health questions and problems. Her background in journalism helped her get answers that would ultimately enlighten many other mothers looking for information. ● Katie uses the same systems in her home life with her six children that she does in business. ● Self-care is not always about taking care of your own needs. It can also mean delegating and finding ways to reduce the stress of having to do everything yourself. ● Two of the healthiest things you can do: nurture close friendships and move your body every day. ● When something conflicts with your non-negotiable, it doesn’t make it on your schedule!\xa0 \xa0 Mentioned in This Episode: The Beautiful No  Today’s Children Set to Live Shorter Lives Than Parents Kolbe Index\xa0 The Wellness Mama Podcast Wellness Mama \xa0 The Pillar Shop is filled with so many fabulous goodies to treat yourself and your loved ones.

Today’s guest is a bonafide rockstar in Japan, and with the June 4 release of his new book Happy Money, he is about to be just as huge here in the U.S. His nickname, the Happy Millionaire, says it all. Get your notebooks out DreamTribe! This could be life changing.\xa0 Sher and Nance refer to Ken as the “Marie Kondo of money.” Ken tells us how to get joyful about all aspects of money, and that includes earning and spending. He offers tips for avoiding what he calls “financial constipation”, how to actually enjoy paying bills, and ways to get things flowing in the Money & Abundance Pillar. \xa0 Takeaways: ● Happy Money is money that gives you a smile when you receive it, and joy when you spend it. It’s a far better mindset than unhealthy money, which causes frustration, guilt and despair when you spend it. ● When you appreciate where your money is going — the goods and services you’ve gladly received — you reframe the story you tell yourself about spending.\xa0 ● You can’t worry and appreciate at the same time. ● Financial constipation is hoarding and holding on to money, and we need to release! Money flows in and out, and we need it to move to be “regular.” ● A likable spirit draws in opportunity and in turn, more money. ● Don’t find security in the amount of money in your bank account; focus more on being rich in the deep and meaningful relationships you have with others. ● Practice saying thank you, to everything in your life. Want a raise? Appreciate your boss more. Better relationship? Appreciate your partner. It’s all about the ‘thank you.’ ● You are responsible for the charge of energy associated with your flow of money. If you positively charge the energy flowing through you, you can increase the money you make, and the speed at which it flows to you. \xa0 Mentioned in This Episode: The Beautiful No  Happy Money: The Japanese Art of Making Peace with Your Money, by Ken Honda Ken Honda \xa0 The Pillar Shop is filled with so many fabulous goodies to treat yourself and your loved ones.

This week, Sheri and Nancy have the ULTIMATE girlfriend conversation with this world-renowned author and master storyteller. Best known for the global phenom, Eat, Pray, Love, Liz is back with a juicy, sexy romp of a book, City of Girls, out on June 4.\xa0 Sheri and Nancy were both mesmerized with how Liz seems to shoot love out of her heart like a cannon, and to be “of” this world but not “get tangled” in it. They walked away from the chat with some life-changing golden nuggets, especially Liz’s goal of “being love in every room” that she enters. Becoming Love. Wow. That sounds like a Pillar goal for sure. Don’t miss this convo, DreamTribe. It’s a good one.\xa0 \xa0 Takeaways: ● Has the dynamic changed between Sher and Nance since they have moved to different cities? Yes, of course, but it’s for the better because now they have even more to talk about and catch up on. ● They both agree that mood management is the name of the game. Your mood alone can drastically change your experience. ● Liz Gilbert is here! Her new novel, the summer read we’re all looking for, City of Girls, is out on June 4. It is a page-turner about a young woman and her adventurous life.\xa0 ● Be like Liz, and let your love shoot out at others like a T-shirt cannon. Lol. ● The more we can be in love with ourselves, the more we can be there for others. Self-care is a daily practice, and it’s never too late to start. ● In the middle of life, it’s easy to think there’s no one to support and take care of you. Challenge this by writing down how many people (friends, family and even strangers) have supported and taken care of you just on that day alone. Feel the gratitude of how loved you are and know that you couldn’t be alone, even if you tried. ● Be the love in the room. If you are alone in the room, be love for yourself. \xa0 Mentioned in This Episode: Elizabeth Gilbert  City of Girls  Eat, Pray, Love @elizabeth_gilbert_writer \xa0 The Pillar Shop is filled with so many fabulous goodies to treat yourself and your loved ones.

And while you’re there, join the DreamTribe!   | In her can’t-put-it-down best-seller, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, Lori Gottlieb describes her life as a therapist and as a patient following a soul-crushing breakup with her fiance. Her fascinating stories struck a chord with Sheri and Nancy. Does the thought of having an hour alone with an expert helping you sort out your limiting beliefs and maladaptive patterns sound just as good to you as it does to Nance? Maybe therapy is the answer — for ALL OF US. If self-evaluation is on your bucket list, Lori shares important tips: What to look for in a therapist, why we are our own worst bully, and how to reframe self-talk about all the possibilities that show up in the middle of life. Sheri recounts her worst therapy story, and Lori agrees it is like nothing else she’s ever heard before. Don’t miss this conversation where we peel back the layers and look therapy square in the face. \xa0 Takeaways: ● Nancy is forever grateful to Sheri for being her free-of-charge de facto therapist for years, but still, she yearns for actual therapy and plans to find a great one in Seattle. ● Maybe You Should Talk to Someone came from a place of Lori listening to her inner wisdom. She put down her pen and stopped writing a book about happiness (which was making her anything but happy) and decided to tell the truth about what was going on in her life. ● Even as a therapist, Lori herself was struggling with the feeling that “half her life was gone” following a sudden breakup… and it’s a common thought she hears from others. ● Therapy is a process of uncovering patterns and becoming conscious about all the ways we self-sabotage and limit ourselves. ● Learn from Sheri and pick a therapist who will stay awake during your sessions! ● A great therapist will listen and hold you accountable, and the best session is often one where there is no agenda. ● We tend to think that the future happens later, but we are creating it in our minds every day. \xa0 Mentioned in This Episode: In Treatment  Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed, by Lori Gottlieb Dear Therapist\xa0 Lori Gottlieb The Beautiful No \xa0 The Pillar Shop is filled with so many fabulous goodies to treat yourself and your loved ones.

A way to appreciate even a day stuck in the airport or putting out fires.\xa0It’s an exercise from Seneca. He said that a person who wraps up each day as if it was the end of their life, who meditates on their mortality in the evening, has a super power when they wake up.\xa0“When a man has said, ‘I have lived!’,” Seneca wrote, then “every morning he arises is a bonus.”\xa0And you know how it feels when you’re playing with house money or when your vacation is extended. In a word? Better. You feel lighter. Nicer. You appreciate everything. You are present. All the trivial concerns and short term anxieties go away—because for a second, you realize how little they matter.\xa0Well, that’s how you ought to live. Go to bed, having lived a full day, appreciating that you may not get the privilege of waking up tomorrow. And if you do wake up—which we hope for all of you—it will be impossible not to see every second of the next twenty four hours as a bonus.\xa0Because they are. | The philosopher and writer Nassim Taleb once said that, “Hard work will get you a professorship or a BMW. You need both work and luck for a Booker, a Nobel, or a private jet.” His point was that certain accomplishments are within the reasonable grasp of someone making incremental gains each day. Outsized success and outlier accomplishments require that and extreme luck or timing.\xa0This is worth considering for all of us who grew up being told the world was a meritocracy. Of course, it isn’t. Plenty of brilliant people fail to succeed for all sorts of reasons, and plenty of not-so-brilliant people find themselves successful beyond their wildest dreams. The world is a random, even cruel, place that does not always reward merit or hard work or skill. Sometimes it does, but not always.\xa0Still, perhaps a more usable and practical distinction to make is not between hard work and luck, but between what is up to us and what is not up to us. This is the distinction that the Stoics tried to make and to think about always. Pioneering new research in science—that’s up to us. Being recognized for that work (e.g. winning a Nobel) is not. A committee decides that. The media decides that. Becoming an expert in a field, that’s up to us. We do that by reading, by studying, by going out and experiencing things. Being hired as a professor at Harvard to teach that expertise is not (think of all the people who weren’t hired there over the years because they were female, or Jewish, or Black). Writing a prize-worthy piece of literature—up to us. That’s time in front of the keyboard. That’s up to our genius. Being named as a finalist for the Booker Prize is not.It’s not that luck, exactly, decides these things, but it is very clearly other people that make the decision. Marcus Aurelius said that the key to life was to tie our sanity—our sense of satisfaction—to our own actions. To tie it to what other people say or do (that was his definition of ambition) was to set ourselves up to be hurt and disappointed. It’s insanity. And it misses the point.Do the work. Be happy with that. Everything else is irrelevant. | In one of his letters, Seneca tells us of an old Roman pleasantry that friends would exchange when greeting each other: “If you are well,” one would say after inquiring how someone was doing, “it is well and I am also well.”\xa0It’s a nice little custom, isn’t it? If you’re good, I’m good, and everything is good. Nothing else matters.\xa0But of course, because this is Seneca, he couldn’t just leave it there. In fact, telling us about this old expression was just a device to make a point. A better way to say it, he writes, is “‘If you are studying philosophy, it is well.’ For this is just what ‘being well’ means. Without philosophy the mind is sickly, and the body, too, though it may be very powerful, is strong only as that of a madman or a lunatic is strong.”The point is that to the Stoics, the practice and study of philosophy was the only way to make sure all was well, no matter what was happening in the world. At war like Marcus Aurelius? Study philosophy in your tent at night. Unable to submit to Caesar’s tyranny like Cato? Read a little Socrates before your dramatic suicide. Shot down over Vietnam like James Stockdale? Say to yourself, as he did, “I am leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.” As in…even in a POW camp, I can still practice and pursue philosophy…and be well for it!Nobody knows what the day or the week has in store for us. As much as we take care of ourselves and eat well, so much of our health is outside of our control. But the one way we can make sure that we are always well, that we are always getting better (mentally, spiritually, if not physically) is by the books we read, the questions we ponder, and the conversations we have.\xa0Now get studying! | Why did Marcus Aurelius study philosophy? What were Seneca or Confucius or Buddha trying to achieve as they pored over their books or sat deeply in thought? What have archery masters and Olympic boxing instructors and generals tried to instill in their students and soldiers?Their aim was, and always has been, stillness.\xa0These thinkers and doers and leaders and achievers, they all needed peace and clarity. They need their charges to be centered. They needed them to be in control of themselves. Because what they were doing was really hard! Just as what you do is really hard! It’s not easy to hit a target or wage a battle or lead a country or write a play. Stillness is the way you get there—internally, mostly—because the world in which we attempt to do these things is often incredibly un-still.Nearly all the schools and disciplines of the ancient world had their own word for stillness. The Buddhists called it upekkha. The Stoics called it apatheia. The Muslims spoke of aslama. The Hebrews, hishtavut. The second book of the Bhagavad Gita, the epic poem of the warrior Arjuna, speaks of samatvam, an “evenness of mind—a peace that is ever the same.” The Greeks had euthymia and hesychia. The Epicureans, ataraxia. The Christians and Romans, aequanimitas. In fact, the last word Marcus Aurelius heard from his dying stepfather, Antoninus, was aequanimitas. Equanimity. Stillness.Picking up where The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy leave off, Ryan Holiday’s new book, Stillness is the Key, endeavors to bring this ancient ideal into our modern-day lives. A collection of stories drawn from all walks of life, and all schools of thought, Ryan’s book illustrates practical ways to bring some essential stillness into your life.\xa0It’s fascinating, both Epictetus and the Daodejing at one point use the same analogy: The mind is like muddy water. To have clarity, we must be steady and let it settle down. Only then can we see. Only then do we have transparency. Whoever you are and whatever you’re doing, you would benefit from having more of this clarity.\xa0In the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy had to wait and see—he had to be still when everyone wanted him to rush into action—to know if his gambit with the Soviet premier would work. In the midst of a busy public life, Winston Churchill had to find hobbies—painting and bricklaying—that would allow him a chance to rest and restore his mind. The art of Marina Abramovic is defined by her presence, her ability in many cases to sit there and do nothing but be—which is one of the toughest things in the world to do.\xa0With stillness, we have a shot at greatness. Not just greatness in performance, but also greatness in personhood. In being human. No one can be a great parent when they’re frantic. No one can be a good spouse if their mind is elsewhere. No one can be creative, in touch with themselves, if they are disassociated or detached from their own soul. The key to the good life—to greatness itself, as Seneca said—is stillness. It’s apatheia. Ataraxia. Upekkha. Euthymia.\xa0Whatever you call it, you need it. Now more than ever before. | Following today’s politics is easy. You turn on the news and a bunch of pretty people tell you that your side is good and the other side is irredeemably evil. You pull up social media and you get a bunch of rage profiteers telling you what to be outraged or angry about. Everything is simple and clear cut, compromise is unnecessary, and, in the end, none of it really matters anyway because the world is going to end in 2024 in nuclear holocaust, 2050 from climate change, or any day now in the rapture.\xa0Needless to say, that’s not very valuable or very philosophical. What is a Stoic to do? Especially when politics and participation in the polis and empire was so essential to Zeno and Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. Well first, they’d urge you to turn backwards to better understand the present day. Even the early American founders knew this. As John Adams wrote to his son in 1777:“There is no History, perhaps, better adapted to this useful purpose than that of Thucydides…You will find it full of Instruction to the Orator, the Statesman, the General, as well as to the Historian and the Philosopher.”\xa0Indeed, people in the State Department right now are reading Thucydides to better understand the rising threat of China. Countless millions—including many of the Stoics—have read it over the last 2000 years to understand the ethical dilemmas inherent in leadership, in war, in politics, and in life. Because Thucydides was so smart, so timeless, he is able to teach lessons to us even now. And because the countries and the events are so distant and impersonal to us, we can actually hear them and learn them.And if we’re smart, we can apply them to the political situations we face today. The ones that could desperately use less partisanship and less virtue signaling and a lot more actual wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage. | At the beginning of The Odyssey, Zeus utters a famous lament that must, one imagines, be shared by all gods and parents and presidents alike:This is absurdThat mortals blame the gods! They saywe cause suffering but they themselvesIncrease it by folly.At the heart of Stoicism is an admission that life is unfair and largely out of our control. Bad stuff happens to everyone, the vast majority of it not even remotely our fault. Nobody asks to die. Nobody asks to be lied to or smacked by a natural disaster or leveled by some freak accident. The Gods, or luck, or Fate—that’s who is responsible for these untimely deeds (to us at least).\xa0But the Stoics also agree with Zeus’s complaint: That humans take this misfortune and compound it. We make things worse than they need to be. By complaining. By quitting. By getting upset about them. By placing blame. By trying desperately to undo what must happen, or to outsmart it by scheme or by bargain. We add folly on top of misfortune.That’s really the plot of The Odyssey if you think about it. Odysseus is too clever for his own good, and it gets him into trouble constantly. He was almost home, but then he took a nap and his curious men—who he refused to explain himself to—opened a bag of wind that set them back. He was free of the Cyclops—who was awful, yes—but then he had to taunt him, not content to leave well enough alone. It was the costliest of all the errors he made. The whole story is Odysseus making a bad situation worse, over and over again until he is rescued by Athena.The key to life may not be brilliance or power. What if it’s just not being stupid? What if it’s just not increasing our troubles by adding folly and hubris and greed on top of them? There’s no guarantee, but it’s worth a try…Support the show | Late last year, a man named Ken Watson died at age 87, but before he did, he made sure to gift wrap fourteen presents for his two year old neighbor.\xa0 He’d always told her that he’d live to be 100, and when that looked like it wasn’t going to happen, he decided he’d need to plan ahead. Which is why, after his death, his own daughter came around with a large bag of presents—enough to provide one per year until the little girl turned sixteen years old.\xa0It’s a beautiful little story that warms the soul. But today, let’s make sure it does more than that. Let’s actually learn from it.Today’s politics have become sadly lopsided, wherein the elderly now make up one of the largest, most intractable, and most self-interested voting blocs. Despite mounting problems on multiple fronts—from the climate to Social Security to immigration to income inequality—we’re unable to come up with common sense solutions, in part because this group is more concerned with protecting their own short-term interests rather than their grandchildren’s long-term ones. It’s shameful and it’s a betrayal of the goodness that someone like Ken Watson so touchingly illustrated.\xa0There is an old Greek proverb that reads, “A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.” It’s one the Stoics would have agreed with. While Marcus Aurelius and Seneca took pains to discourage chasing legacy or posthumous fame, they did believe it was the philosopher’s duty to serve the common good—to contribute to the Roman Empire in a way that would allow it to stand for future generations. That’s what this notion of sympatheia is partly about as well: we are all connected and related to each other. The idea that life is a zero-sum game, that the ticker starts at zero when you’re born and resets when you die, is ridiculous and pathetic.\xa0While we don’t control what other intransigent people decide to do with their votes, their money, and their influence, we can at least commit to being a little bit more like Ken Watson in our own lives. How can we make sure that we’re investing in and protecting the interests of the people that come after us? How can we pay forward the bounty (and privileges) that our ancestors bequeathed to us? What trees are we planting that others will one day sit beneath?\xa0That’s our job—as citizens and as Stoics. Yes, we have to live here in the present moment and that should be our primary concern. But that cannot come at the expense of the many moments that our children and their children and their children are entitled to experience as well.\xa0Be good to each other. Plant trees.Support the show | You know sometimes you hear a quote or an aphorism and you think, That’s it. That’s me. That’s my philosophy for life.\xa0Well it turns out that is a pretty common and timeless thing. At the very least, we know it goes back to the time of George Washington. Washington’s favorite play was the play Cato, about the Roman Senator and Stoic philosopher by Joseph Addison. This play, which was written in 1712, was hugely famous in its time, and, with some irony, it might be called the “Hamilton” of the day. It was so familiar to the people in the late 18th century that it could be quoted without attribution and everyone knew exactly where the line came from. And Washington in particular liked to quote one line that must have spoken to him the way those quotes speak to us now—where you just know that nothing will capture what you think and feel about life better than that.\xa0“Free,” he said in a letter to a friend after the Revolution about his return to private life, “from the bustle of a camp and the intrigues of court, I shall view the busy world ‘in the calm light of mild philosophy,’ and with that serenity of mind, which the Soldier in his pursuit of glory, and the Statesman of fame have not time to enjoy.” In fact, in the book The Political Philosophy of George Washington, the author Jeffry H. Morrison notes that in a single two week period in 1797, Washington quoted that same line in three different letters. And later, in Washington’s greatest but probably least known moment, when he talked down the mutinous troops who were plotting to overthrow the U.S government at Newburgh, he quoted the same line again, as he urged them away from acting on their anger and frustration.\xa0In the calm lights of mild philosophy. That’s Stoicism. That’s using Reason to temper our impulses and our emotions. As Epictetus said, it’s about putting our impressions up to the test. It’s what Marcus Aurelius talked about when he said that our life is what our thoughts make it. That what we choose to see determines how we will feel.\xa0We must follow this advice today and every day. It served Cato well and Washington even better. All that we see must be illuminated by the calm lights of mild philosophy. So we can see what it really is. So we don’t do anything we regret. So we can enjoy this wonderful gift of life we possess, whatever our station.Support the show | You try to turn on your television, only to find that the batteries in the remote are dead and no one bothered to replace them. Your computer freezes in the middle of finishing something important and you lose hours of work. You’re running late for your child’s soccer game because they’ve been fooling around instead of getting ready to play. You’re trying to change lanes on the freeway, but another driver is too close to your car and won’t give you room to maneuver. And the worse, they flip you off.\xa0What’s the natural response to all of these situations? To get angry.\xa0But, remember, to the Stoics, our “natural” instincts and emotions were something to always question. And sometimes, something to regard with outright skepticism. “The cause of anger is the sense of having been wronged,” Seneca wrote, “but one ought not trust this sense. Don’t make your move right away, even against what seems overt and plain; sometimes false things give the appearance of truth.” \xa0Not everyone has an “anger problem” but anger is a problem for everyone. We all cause ourselves harm through it. We drive people away. We act unreasonably. We say things we regret. We shave minutes off our life–or in some cases, put ourselves in outright danger.\xa0Anger is a problem that people have dealt with for thousands of years. Marcus Aurelius struggled with his temper, and surely his wife did too. Nuns and saints–for all their good work–also had to work at pushing anger away, at making sure they didn’t make themselves miserable. The good news is that all these wise–and very human figures–have developed some pretty brilliant strategies for dealing with their excessive anger. They discovered real insights on how to keep your problems in perspective; how to cool down in the moment, when your anger is pushing you out of control; how to tame your emotions and stay in charge of your temper.\xa0And as usual, the Stoics have some of the smartest and most applicable insights. That’s why we created Taming Your Temper: The 10-Day Stoic Guide to Controlling Anger. 10 days of challenges, exercises, video lessons, and bonus tools based on Stoic philosophy. Materials to help you deal with your anger in a constructive manner. We will give you the tools that you need, not just to manage your anger, but to leave it in the past, so that you can focus on what’s important–living a virtuous and fulfilling life.Learn from the wisdom of the great thinkers and leaders of history: Marcus Aurelius; Seneca; Abraham Lincoln; Mr. Rogers; and others as well. Use our unique exercises to break free from the cage that anger has built around you and see the world, and yourself, in a new light. Each day, watch a new video from Ryan Holiday, author of The Obstacle is the Way, Ego is the Enemy, Stillness is the Key, and The Daily Stoic, as he explains the ideas behind the words and sheds light on our path.Being able to control your anger is a difficult but worthwhile goal. It will take time and effort—and it won’t be free—but by changing your perspective and developing techniques to control your temper, it will ultimately be achievable—and life-changing. Take the first step on the path to a calmer and more fulfilling future. Check out Taming Your Temper: The 10-Day Stoic Guide to Controlling Anger today.Support the show | When one looks at the dark moments of history, it’s hard not to be a little afraid. Look at what people have done to each other—look at how bad things have gotten. In Seneca’s time, many horrific acts were not only common but commonly accepted. Like decimation, a common enough practice, where one in ten people were killed just to send a message. And that word lives on in the lexicon two thousand years later. Perhaps the terrifying capriciousness of a practice like this is why Seneca tried to reassure himself that there was little use in being scared.He writes in one of his essays how that if an invader came and conquered your city, the very worst he could do is sentence you to what you’ve been sentenced to from birth—death. Yes, a Hannibal or a Hitler could throw you in chains and drag you away from your family—but the truth is that you were already being dragged away. Yes, each second that ticks by on the clock takes us one instant away from our families. But, “since the day you were born,” Seneca writes, “you are being led thither.”\xa0Sometimes the first time our civilizations realize just how vulnerable we are is when we find out we’ve been conquered, or are at the mercy of some cruel tyrant. We realize that we are mortal and fragile and that fate can inflict horrible things on our tiny, powerless bodies.\xa0So we should study history then for two reasons: One, to gain some humility. We are not nearly as safe or important as we think we are. In the end, each of us is only a statistic. Each of us is at the mercy of enormous events outside our control. Two, to prepare for the reality of this existence. We may face trying times, but nothing can stop us from being brave in the face of them. We can still, always, as Stockdale said, decide how to write the end of our story—and to write it well.Support the show', 'chan_desc': "The audio companion to DailyStoic.com's daily email meditations, read by Ryan Holiday.Each daily reading will help you cultivate strength, insight and wisdom necessary for living the good life.

So many people respond with, "I don\'t like confrontation", when I suggest a boundary.  Setting boundaries is tough to do if we were not modeled healthy boundaries growing up. Even if we came from a pretty healthy family, few people grew up with healthy boundary modeling.\xa0  In today\'s show I talk about what boundaries are, how to set them, examples of healthy versus unhealthy boundaries and the four key steps and "how to\'s",\xa0 to setting healthy boundaries.\xa0  I also discuss what to do when boundaries "backfire" and we are met with upsetness or anger from another at our simple request.\xa0  I end with a few take aways of what boundaries are and are not and what to do if you are in a toxic or even abusive relationship.\xa0  Boundaries are a necessary part of our lives and a key to healthy relationships. This show is filled with great tools and tips to help you to start better taking care of yourself and learning how to set a simple request and teaching other people how to treat you.\xa0  The Adult Chair San Antonio https://theadultchair.com/san-antonio\xa0  The Adult Chair Membership (September Theme-I Matter) https://theadultchair.com/membership\xa0  Boundaries and Defenses https://theadultchair.com/podcast/160\xa0  Boundaries versus Confrontation https://theadultchair.com/podcast/26\xa0  How do I feel my Emotions https://theadultchair.com/podcast/80\xa0 | We can never have enough self esteem!

I unfortunately get asked this question all too often. I find that what feels "normal" is actually toxic but due to low self esteem or loss of self, we find ourselves living in not so healthy or even unhealthy, toxic relationships.\xa0 In today\'s show I go over 6 signs of toxic relationships. I explain what to look for in toxic relationships and how to know if you are in one.\xa0 I also offer next steps to heal and transform yourself out of the toxic relationship.\xa0 https://theadultchair.com/events\xa0  The Adult Chair San Antonio October 24-26 | \xa0 What would you think if I told you that joy could be part of codependency? Well it can! Codependency and I have been friends for too many years to count (most of my life). However, in my discovery of this, I have found joy in learning who I am as an Adult and taking my childhood back. I might even say that I find it now as a gift as I now get to discover who I am and it\'s an exciting journey to take as an Adult. I feel my inner child come through me with excitement and wonder with all of the new thoughts, ideas and plans "we" have for my future. The journey can be an exciting one when we shift our idea about codependency and step out of victim mode. Just because we grew up codependent or are experiencing it now doesn\'t mean our lives are over! It means our lives can begin and the time is now to experience the joy that comes with this self-discovery process.

That’s the overriding message of the show today and it comes thanks to the story of a fabulous client we’ll call “Carolyn.” She’s graciously offered her story for this week’s show as a demonstration of owning your own stuff, and making great strides in breaking the damaging patterns and programs that play over and over in our lives. Thanks to her work with the Chairs, she’s found grounding and hope in moving forward through relationship addiction and more. https://TakeCareOf.com\xa0 Promo code: Adult For 25% off your first Care/Of order. \xa0 | Yuck...Shame!

In reality, we have the equation backwards, says innovation researcher Efosa Ojomo. In this compelling talk, he offers new thinking on how we could potentially eliminate corruption worldwide by focusing on one thing: scarcity. "Societies don\'t develop because they\'ve reduced corruption," he says. "They\'re able to reduce corruption because they\'ve developed." | Civilization rests upon the existence of language, says language creator David Peterson. In a talk that\'s equal parts passionate and hilarious, he shows how studying, preserving and inventing new languages helps us understand our collective humanity -- and gives a quick lesson on High Valyrian, one of two languages he created for "Game of Thrones" (along with Dothraki). "Language is not merely a tool," he says. "It is our legacy, it\'s our way of conveying what it means to be human." | With fascinating research and hilarious anecdotes, neuroscientist Camilla Arndal Andersen takes us into the lab where she studies people\'s sense of taste via brain scans. She reveals surprising insights about the way our brains subconsciously experience food -- and shows how this data could help us eat healthier without sacrificing taste. | The US health care system assumes many things about patients: that they can take off from work in the middle of the day, speak English, have a working telephone and a steady supply of food. Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US. In this eye-opening talk, he shares stories of the challenges low-income patients face -- and how we can build a better system for all. | Conservationist and TED Fellow Moreangels Mbizah studied the famous Cecil the lion until he was shot by a trophy hunter in 2015. She wonders how things could\'ve gone differently, asking: "What if the community that lived next to Cecil was involved in protecting him?" In a quick talk, Mbizah shares the state of conservation in her home of Zimbabwe -- and why she thinks that communities living with wildlife are the ones best positioned to help them. | The average farmer in America makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store.

What began as an art project to showcase beautiful, multi-hued blossoms has become a living archive of rare heirloom specimens and their histories, a hands-on (and delicious!) way to teach people about cultivation and a vivid symbol of the need for biodiversity to ensure food security.

In this episode, Joanna Bale asks ‘Why do we need food banks?’ She talks to LSE’s Aaron Reeves and Laura Lane, as well as Daphine Aikens, founder and CEO of Hammersmith and Fulham food bank, and some of her clients. | Speaker(s): Michael O\'Sullivan | The liberal, globalised world order is withering according to Michael O\'Sullivan in his new book The Levelling: What\'s Next After Globalization which he will talk about in this lecture. The levelling is the process of ironing out imbalances like indebtedness and inequality, and proposing new ideas and frameworks to kickstart the next world order. The Levelling will involve the levelling of political accountability and responsibility between political leaders and “the people”, the levelling of institutional power—away from central banks and defunct twentieth-century institutions such as the WTO and IMF and toward new treaties (on risk and monetary policy) and new institutions (for example, a truly effective and powerful climate body and an institution or agreement that oversees cybersecurity). It will also involve the levelling out of wealth between rich and poor countries and between the very rich and “the rest,” preferably with “the rest” enjoying both better organic growth and a greater share of this growth. Then the levelling out of power between nations and regions is what the concept of the multipolar world is about, and within it, different regions will have different reserves of power. Michael O’Sullivan, is the former chief investment officer at Credit Suisse. Michael joined Credit Suisse in July 2007 from State Street Global Markets. Prior to joining Credit Suisse, Michael spent over ten years as a global strategist at a number of sell-side institutions and has also taught finance at Princeton and Oxford Universities.

But while urban planners are quite good at taking gravity into account, they tend to ignore market forces entirely in their designs, resulting in city development that too often fails to address the needs of their residents. Following the release of his recent book,  Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities, Alain joined Tyler in New York City for a discussion of the politics affecting urban centers, his advice to Robert Moses, whether the YIMBY movement can win, why he loves messy cities, what he got wrong about Shenzhen, why the Moscow subway is so wonderful, whether cities can move, favorite movies about cities, the region of the world most likely to start a charter city, how to reform the World Bank, his top three NYC planning reforms, why Central Park is the perfect size, and more.

But writing a memoir about it all is also a daunting prospect. The format itself is a challenge: how do you convince the reader you’re worth spending time with? How do you paint a relatable portrait without oversharing and losing your dignity? For Samantha the answer was settling upon a purpose for her memoir and ruthlessly cutting out everything not in service of that. Tyler and Samantha discuss that purpose and more, including what she learned as an Irish immigrant, the personality traits of good diplomats (and war correspondents), relations with China, why democracy is so rare in the Middle East, the truth about Richard Holbrooke, what factors mitigate against humanitarian intervention, her favorite memoir, how to get NATO members to spend more on defense, and whether baseball games are too long.  Transcript and links Follow Samantha on Twitter Follow Tyler on Twitter More CWT goodness: Facebook Twitter Instagram Email | As a graduate student, Hollis Robbins helped Henry Louis Gates, Jr. unravel a mystery about the provenance of a mid-19th century book. Robbins helped date the book by discovering allusions to popular literature of that period\u200a—\u200aher focus at the time. The realization that this perspective would bring valuable insight to other 19th century African American literature prompted her to make that her specialty. Now a dean at Sonoma Sate University, Robbins joined Tyler to discuss 19th-century life and literature and more, including why the 1840s were a turning point in US history, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Calvinism, whether 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained are appropriate portraits of slavery, the best argument for reparations, how prepaid postage changed America, the second best Herman Melville book, why Ayn Rand and Margaret Mitchell are ignored by English departments, growing up the daughter of a tech entrepreneur, and why teachers should be like quarterbacks.

Masha Gessen knows the answer all too well, having dedicated her career to writing and reporting about Russian society from both within and outside her native country. A true polymath, Gessen’s wide-ranging books and articles cover mathematics, history, human rights, counterterrorism, and much more. Masha joined Tyler in New York City to answer his many questions about Russia: why was Soviet mathematics so good? What was it like meeting with Putin? Why is Russian friendship so intense? Are Russian women as strong as the stereotype suggests\u200a—\u200aand why do they all have the same few names? Is Russia more hostile to LGBT rights than other autocracies? Why did Garry Kasparov fail to make a dent in Russian politics? What did The Americans get right that Chernobyl missed? And what’s a good place to eat Russian food in Manhattan?

This, along with a family scattered across half-a-dozen countries, establishes him as a true cosmopolitan, a label Appiah readily accepts. Yet he insists it is nonetheless possible to be a cosmopolitan patriot, rooted in a place, while having obligations and interests that transcend one’s national identity. He joins Tyler to discuss this worldly perspective and more, including whether Africa will secularize, Ghanian fallibilism, teaching Jodie Foster, whether museums should repatriate collections, Karl Popper, Lee Kuan Yew, which country has the best jollof rice, the value of writing an ethical advice column, E.T. Mensah, Paul Simon, the experience of reading 173 novels to judge the Man Booker prize, and what he’s learned farming sheep in New Jersey. We're coming to New York City!

Across more than a dozen books, he’s created vast story worlds driven by futuristic technologies that have both prophesied and even provoked real-world progress in crypto, social networks, and the creation of the web itself. Though Stephenson insists he’s more often wrong than right, his technical sharpness has even led to  a half-joking suggestion that he might be Satoshi Nakamoto, the shadowy creator of bitcoin. His latest novel,  Fall; or, Dodge in Hell, involves a more literal sort of brain-picking, exploring what might happen when digitized brains can find a second existence in a virtual afterlife. So what’s the implicit theology of a simulated world? Might we be living in one, and does it even matter? Stephenson joins Tyler to discuss the book and more, including the future of physical surveillance, how clothing will evolve, the kind of freedom you could expect on a Mars colony, whether today’s media fragmentation is trending us towards dystopia, why the Apollo moon landings were communism’s greatest triumph, whether we’re in a permanent secular innovation starvation, Leibniz as a philosopher, Dickens and Heinlein as writers, and what storytelling has to do with giving good driving directions.  Transcript and links Follow Neal on Twitter Follow Tyler on Twitter More CWT goodness: Facebook Twitter Instagram Email | Going back and forth between Canada and Japan during his childhood sparked Eric Kaufmann’s interest in the question of identity. As a foreigner in an international school, he encountered young individuals from at least 60 other countries, and this made him think more about national identity and how people affiliate and interact with one another. Now as an academic, he explores how demographic changes\u200a—\u200amost notably caused by ethnic migration and assimilation\u200a—\u200aare the key to understanding Brexit, Trump, and pretty much every major issue du jour. Kauffman’s latest book Whiteshift, which examines how declining white ethnic majorities will respond to these changes, is on Tyler’s list as one of the best books of the year. The two discuss the book and more, including Orangeism in Northern Ireland, Switzerland’s secret for stability, what Tocqueville got most wrong about America, predictions on Brexit’s final form, why Portugal seems immune to populism, how Notre Dame should be rebuilt, whether the Amish\u200a—\u200aor Mormons\u200a—\u200awill take over the world, and much more.

So how has his nearly twenty years in the business world affected what he’d write and teach now? Is learning Shephard’s lemma really that important anymore? Tyler asks Hal these questions and more: why aren’t there more second-priced auctions\u200a—\u200aor prediction markets? How have the economics of sales changed with the internet? In what ways did his hiring criteria change between academia and business? What could we learn from the sack of Rome? When should economists avoid looking at the literature? How are we always eking out victory in the war on spam? And what are people least likely to understand about Google? Fear not\u200a—\u200aHal has an answer for it all.  Transcript and links Follow Hal on Twitter Follow Tyler on Twitter More CWT goodness: Facebook Twitter Instagram Email | What are the virtues of forgiveness? Are we subject to being manipulated by data? Why do people struggle with prayer? What really motivates us? How has the volunteer army system changed the incentives for war? These are just some of the questions that keep Russ Roberts going as he constantly analyzes the world and revisits his own biases through thirteen years of conversations on EconTalk. Russ made his way to the Mercatus studio to talk with Tyler about these ideas and more. The pair examines where classical liberalism has gone wrong, if dropping out of college is overrated, and what people are missing from the Bible. Tyler questions Russ on Hayek, behavioral economics, and his favorite EconTalk conversation. Ever the host, Russ also throws in a couple questions to Tyler.  Transcript and links Follow Russ on Twitter Follow Tyler on Twitter More CWT goodness: Facebook Twitter Instagram Email | Ezekiel Emanuel is a reflection of his upbringing: a doctor for a father who loved to travel, a mother interested in policy and community activism, and all the competition and friendship that comes with growing up closely with two brothers. Put those together and you wouldn’t be surprised that the result is someone who has worked at both the highest levels of, medicine, policy and academia\u200a—\u200athough the intense interest in jam might surprise you. Do we overrate the importance of doctors? What’s the importance of IQ versus EQ in the practice of medicine? What is the prospect for venture capital in biotech? How should medical training be changed? Why does he think the conventional wisdom about a problem tends to be wrong? Would immortality be boring? What would happen if we let parents genetically engineer their kids? Tyler questions Emanuel on these topics and more, including the smartest thing his parents did while raising him, whether we have right to medical self-defense, healthcare in low- versus high-trust institutions, and much more.

It's one of the things we take the granted the most but pay a very high price if it crumbles. Civic duties might not be as sexy as catchy habits or yoga poses but they are key to living peacefully and creating the conditions so people can flourish. In this episode we talk about the relationship between democracy and happiness, what democracy is, what helps and what hinders democracy. Also if flamingos and giraffes could have babies with each other and then talk, that's exactly what I sound like in this episode. | Today we're talking about masculinity, femininity and what's in between.

Today that number is closer to two million. Many factors account for this change including lower water quality, a warmer climate and sea lions. Hundreds of sea lions gather at the base of the Bonneville Dam eating salmon that are trying to make their way up river to spawn. Humans are going to great lengths to scare off the sea lions in hopes of preserving the salmon run. Chris examines the tensions between man and animal, telling the story from the point of view of the sea lion. | Learn how you can support The Wild and can get early access to new episodes and bonus content by going to our donation page.Two hundred years ago grizzly bears roamed the North Cascades, but today there are less than twenty, maybe even just one or two.

My new framework called The Trinity of Radiant Vitality, and how to leverage it to get much more done in a day than most people do in a month. 4.

Why is deciding on something so difficult, whether it’s deciding what to have for dinner or whether we should move across the country? This week, we talk with neuroscientist David Redish about what is actually happening in our brains during the decision-making process. Then, we're joined by Lifehacker’s managing editor Virginia Smith to figure out how our moral, social and legal frameworks inform the decisions we make. | On this smaller episode we’re diving into the topic of small talk. Is it there real value in shooting the breeze, or is it just inane jibber-jabber? Wherever you stand on the topic, you’re going to be called on to engage in small talk sooner or later—so how do you get more comfortable with it? Our producer asked the people who are probably the most fluent in small talk: bartenders. Then, Melissa and Alice are joined in the studio by Lifehacker staff writer Nick Douglas to discuss their varied feelings on idle chitchat, and if there’s any value in talking about the weather. | This week we’re talking about impostor syndrome—the psychological phenomenon wherein people question their successes and have an internalized fear of being discovered as a fraud. We’ll hear from Lifehacker’s staff writer, Nick Douglas, who explains why he keeps something called a “brag file.” We’ll also chat with clinical psychologist Dr. Jessamy Hibberd, author of the book The Impostor Cure. And our producer takes to the streets to find out how people deal with their own feelings of inadequacy. | We all think we’re experts at “doing nothing,” but there’s a difference between numbing out by staring at Facebook and truly letting your mind rest. There are concrete benefits to doing absolutely nothing—like actually being present in your life and noticing what’s around you. To help us constructively veg out, we’ve brought in essayist Pico Iyer, Lifehacker’s Human Resource Columnist Rob Walker, and artist and educator Jenny Odell, whose new book teaches us how to resist the “attention economy.” We recommend listening with your feet up and your eyes closed. | Memory is a strange thing. What is a “memory,” anyway? Where does it live? And where did we put our keys? We’re unlocking the secrets of memory and how to improve ours with a little help from our friends. First, we’ve got staff writer Nick Douglas with a technique that will help you learn anything. Then staff writer Beth Skwarecki explains just how scientists sucked the memory out of one snail and put it in another—and what this means for all of us. Finally, four-time USA Memory Champion Nelson Dellis talks to Alice and Melissa about how he went from being a guy with an average memory to a, well, champion. And we play a memory game that listeners can play, as well. | We’re living in a time of secrets. Whether it’s the health-care bill, Russia’s secret connection with our recent election, or the lies we all tell, secrets plague all of us. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of “Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are” explains what the Internet can tell us about the prejudices, fears, and fetishes we’re hiding. We talk with our Lifehacker writers about a Reddit thread where Redditors shared secrets that, if revealed, would ruin people’s lives. Psychiatrist Eileen Wachter visits the studio to discuss the psychological effects of keeping secrets. And our producer takes to the streets to find out what sort of secrets we’ve been keeping for other people. | This week we’re talking about solo travel, from the best destinations to how to make friends once you’re there. We’ve got packing secrets, veteran travelers’ must-have apps, and a slew of magical stories from around the globe. | Calling all insomniacs, tossers, turners, blanket hogs, disco nappers and snooze button pushers!

So how does a person go from candidate to nominee to Leader of the Free World? We asked some heavy hitters for the inside scoop on running for President.\xa0Settle in for a long and strange ride with Former Governor and Democratic nominee for President, Michael Dukakis, CNN political analyst Bakari Sellers and founding partner of Purple Strategies, Mark Squier. | It\'s time for the 2nd annual winner of our Student Contest! Our winners are Jessie Aniloff, Katie Bruni, and Tara Czekner from Anthony Micalizzi\'s class at Villa Joseph Marie High School\xa0In their podcast, On the Bench, they share their thoughts on representation in the Supreme Court, citing the work done by the four female justices to take the bench thus far.\xa0 | We at Civics 101 adore Schoolhouse Rock and that sad little scrap of paper on the steps of the Capitol. But today we try to finish what they started, by diving into the messy, partisan, labyrinthine process of modern-day legislation.This episode features the voices of Andy Wilson, Adia Samba-Quee, Alizah Ross, and Eleanor Powell.\xa0 | A tug of war, a balancing act, two dancers dragging each other across the floor. This is the perpetual ebb and flow of power between the states and the federal government. How can things be legal in a state but illegal nationally? Are states obstinate barricades to federal legislation? Or are they laboratories of democracy?Today\'s episode features Lisa Manheim, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Washington School of Law and co-author of The Limits of Presidential Power, and Dave Robertson, Chair of the Political Science department at the University of Missouri St.Louis. | The Supreme Court, considered by some to be the most powerful branch, had humble beginnings. How did it stop being, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, "next to nothing?" Do politics affect the court\'s decisions? And how do cases even get there?This episode features Larry Robbins, lawyer and eighteen-time advocate in the Supreme Court, and Kathryn DePalo, professor at Florida International University and past president of the Florida Political Science Association. | There are 535 people who meet in the hallowed halls of Capitol Hill. They go in, legislation comes out. You can watch the machinations of the House and Senate chambers on C-SPAN, you can read their bills online. But what are the rules of engagement? Where does your Senator go every day, and what do they do? What does it mean to represent the American people?Our guides to the U.S. Legislative branch are Congressman Chris Pappas, Eleanor Powell, Stefani Langehennig and Emmitt Riley. | In this episode of our Starter Kit series, a primer on the powers of the President, both constitutional and extra-constitutional.

Ours is a system designed to counterweight itself, to stave off the power grabs that entice even the fairest of us all. The U.S. government is comprised of humans, not angels, so each branch has the power to stop the other from going to far. The only catch being, of course, they have to actually exercise that power.In this episode, with the inimitable Kim Wehle as our guide, we learn what those checks actually are, and how the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches (ostensibly) keep things democratic.\xa0 | An announcement of our new series, airing on July 2.', 'chan_desc': "What's the difference between the House and the Senate?

Often, when we feel stuck or unhappy in life, we wish our current days by in search for 'better' days. However, this idea that life is a series of checklists that we have to get through in order to be fulfilled begets much anxiety, resentment, and even depression.

Not only does it have wonderful music but it also has pearls of wisdom.\xa0 Oh yea, and gender issues. In this episode I talk about the psychology inside this great show. I also talk about how you know when something you read online is probably true (hint: if what you read is boring then it\'s probably true) and other ways to judge the value of psychological research. And finally, it looks like we might have been wrong in prior research: rich people are probably also happier than you (surprise!). | In this episode I talk about whether there really is a bible code, anti-vaccination beliefs and whether jellybeans cause acne. It\'s all part of how we humans love to find patterns in the world and the amount of wiggle room we\'re willing to give ourselves to find them. Too often we make the Look Elsewhere error. And not just of everyday folk do this - scientists can as well. We\'ve got to be more careful in our thinking if we\'re going to find relationships that really do exist in the world - and then make important decisions based on our findings. | Most of us have heard of Anton Mesmer and Jean Charcot. They were some of the first to dabble in the "mind cure" using hypnosis and the power of suggestion. But what role did syphilis play in the development of psychology? You\'d be surprised. Join me and authors Dr. Allan Ropper and Brian David Burrell as we discuss their new book called "How the Brain Lost Its Mind". | There are too many knee-jerk, brief (and incorrect) explanations for why the US is experiencing such a rise in hatred and violence. Claiming that violent perpetrators are "mentally ill" is wrong.\xa0 We have research and we understand the dangerous path that some young men get involved in and which ultimately leads them to violence. The right answers are more subtle, but we do know them and we do know what to do about them. We take another look at Significance Quest theory. | I talk about tech many times here on The Psych Files so where do I learn about Phone Addiction, Voice Assistants, Smart Watches and so forth? By listening to tech podcasts. There\'s a new one out I really like. It\'s called Waveform with MKBHD and I\'ve got a clip from the show to listen to. I\'m already learning a lot so check it out!Click here (http://bit.ly/WaveformPF) to subscribe to Waveform with MKBHD | I haven\'t talked about sleep problems yet here on the Psych Files so I brought in the perfect person to talk to us about sleep and insomnia. Dr. Shelby Harris has written the Woman\'s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia and I learned a lot about how Cognitive Behavioral therapy is applied to this specific problem. Dr. Harris also has some tips you\'ll want to hear to help you get a better night\'s sleep. | I\'ll bet you\'re like me and you enjoyed the Disney musical Beauty and the Beast. As wonderful a story it is, let\'s take a moment just to acknowledge that there are some themes in the show that are, well, not so nice. I’ll take a look at this show from an angle of toxic masculinity in the Gaston character and possibly co-dependency in the relationship between Belle and the Beast. I promise - it\'ll still be fun. | Have you ever wondered if you\'re really being true to some inner person of yours? Wondered if there isn\'t someone else inside that you that you\'re supposed to be actualizing? Guess what? Maybe not. What is authenticity anyway? That\'s what we\'ll explore in this episode, along with a discussion of some of the doubts being cast on the famous Stanford Prison Study by Philip Zimbardo. Maybe it\'s actually not time to updater the textbooks after all. | In the last episode I talked about the potential downside to having most of our digital assistants speak to us using a female voice. "Q" - will give us an option. Here\'s my interview with Emil Rasmussen, who will give you some of the background behind Q and his hopes for the future of Q. | Why do our digital assistants such as Alexa, Google Home, Siri and Cortana have "feminized" voices and what are the effects of this trend? That\'s what I explore in this episode. Are there negative effects of using female voices in the devices we talk to and who talk to us? Are there alternatives? Turns out there is an alternative - a "genderless" voice. What does that sound like? Tune in to find out as we explore gender roles, expectations and equality.I’d Blush If I Could (https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416.page=1)We tested bots like Siri and Alexa to see who would stand up to sexual harassment (https://qz.com/911681/we-tested-apples-siri-amazon-echos-alexa-microsofts-cortana-and-googles-google-home-to-see-which-personal-assistant-bots-stand-up-for-themselves-in-the-face-of-sexual-harassment/)Why Siri and Alexa Weren’t Built to Smack Down Harassment (https://www.wired.com/story/why-siri-and-alexa-werent-built-to-smack-down-harassment/)Hey Siri, stop perpetuating sexist stereotypes, UN says (https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/tech/alexa-siri-gender-bias-study-scli-intl/index.html)Is it time for Alexa and Siri to have a “MeToo moment”? (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexa-siri-other-artificial-intelligence-voice-assistants-gender-bias-unesco/)Female voice assistants fuel damaging gender stereotypes, says a UN study (https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613569/female-voice-assistants-fuel-damaging-gender-stereotypes-says-un-study/)My WIX site and online learning experience (https://www.explorelearning.online/) in which I re-create the experiment conducted by Loftus and Palmer on eyewitness testimony.The reason digital assistants acquiesce to harassment isn’t just sexism or gender inequality in the tech world, as disturbing and prevalent as those may be. No, the explanation lies elsewhere, I believe. These machines are meant to manipulate their users into staying connected to their devices, and that focus on manipulation must be laser-like. To clearly state that harassment toward digital assistants is unacceptable would mean having some standard, some line that can’t be crossed. And one line leads to another, and soon you’re distracted—the user is distracted—from selling/buying merchandise, collecting/sharing data, and allowing a device to become ensconced in their life.The moral standard most compatible with engagement is absolute freedom of expression, the standard of having no standards.\xa0– Noam Cohen, “Why Siri and Alexa Weren’t Built to Smack Down Harassment”', 'chan_desc': 'The Psych Files is a podcast for anyone who wonders why we do what we do.

They were told he had a 50% chance of survival.During Cannon’s year and a half of treatments, Melissa saw the horrific effects first-hand. They watched Cannon suffer through surgeries and “diluted” chemical treatments meant for adults, which caused him loss of hearing and decay to all of his teeth. They watched their son bleed from the inside out and be dragged to death’s doorstep in their quest to save him. They know this tragic reality all too well. They know there has to be a better way. They know that no other child should have to suffer the same as their child.This experience motivated her to spend hundreds of hours researching and learning about the enormous lack of funding and research dedicated to pediatric cancer and effects, such as secondary cancers, that occur as a result of antiquated treatments.Out of their unwavering faith and commitment, they founded Cannonball Kids’ cancer. Out of their anger, they became determined to be a part of the solution. Out of their persistence, they know funding research will unlock the cure.

Reinforcement is something that comes after a behavior that causes an increase in the probability of that behavior happening again in the future. There are two big warnings signs I see when I think, "This isn\'t actually reinforcement." When I am told a "reinforcer" doesn\'t work or when I see a "reinforcer" used before a positive behavior occurs (in hopes that it will), I know this is reinforcement gone wrong.In this episode, let\'s explore how reinforcement goes wrong and what you can do to make sure it doesn\'t with your learners.

In reality, we have the equation backwards, says innovation researcher Efosa Ojomo. In this compelling talk, he offers new thinking on how we could potentially eliminate corruption worldwide by focusing on one thing: scarcity. "Societies don\'t develop because they\'ve reduced corruption," he says. "They\'re able to reduce corruption because they\'ve developed." | Civilization rests upon the existence of language, says language creator David Peterson. In a talk that\'s equal parts passionate and hilarious, he shows how studying, preserving and inventing new languages helps us understand our collective humanity -- and gives a quick lesson on High Valyrian, one of two languages he created for "Game of Thrones" (along with Dothraki). "Language is not merely a tool," he says. "It is our legacy, it\'s our way of conveying what it means to be human." | With fascinating research and hilarious anecdotes, neuroscientist Camilla Arndal Andersen takes us into the lab where she studies people\'s sense of taste via brain scans. She reveals surprising insights about the way our brains subconsciously experience food -- and shows how this data could help us eat healthier without sacrificing taste. | The US health care system assumes many things about patients: that they can take off from work in the middle of the day, speak English, have a working telephone and a steady supply of food. Because of that, it\'s failing many of those who are most in need, says Mitchell Katz, CEO of the largest public health care system in the US. In this eye-opening talk, he shares stories of the challenges low-income patients face -- and how we can build a better system for all. | Conservationist and TED Fellow Moreangels Mbizah studied the famous Cecil the lion until he was shot by a trophy hunter in 2015. She wonders how things could\'ve gone differently, asking: "What if the community that lived next to Cecil was involved in protecting him?" In a quick talk, Mbizah shares the state of conservation in her home of Zimbabwe -- and why she thinks that communities living with wildlife are the ones best positioned to help them. | The average farmer in America makes less than 15 cents of every dollar on a product that you purchase at a store. They feed our communities, but farmers often cannot afford the very foods they grow. In this actionable talk, social entrepreneur Mohammad Modarres shows how to put your purchasing power into action to save local agriculture from collapse and transform the food industry from the bottom up. | Artist Sarah Sze takes us on a kaleidoscopic journey through her work: immersive installations as tall as buildings, splashed across walls, orbiting through galleries -- blurring the lines between time, memory and space. Explore how we give meaning to objects in this beautiful tour of Sze\'s experiential, multimedia art. | In a hopeful talk followed by an empowering performance, musician and TED Fellow Muthoni Drummer Queen shares how industries like music, film and fashion provide a platform for Africans to broadcast their rich and diverse talents -- and explains how the shared experience of creativity can replace attitudes of exclusionism and othering with acceptance and self-love. | Artist Sam Van Aken shares the breathtaking work behind the "Tree of 40 Fruit," an ongoing series of hybridized fruit trees that grow 40 different varieties of peaches, plums, apricots, nectarines and cherries -- all on the same tree. What began as an art project to showcase beautiful, multi-hued blossoms has become a living archive of rare heirloom specimens and their histories, a hands-on (and delicious!) way to teach people about cultivation and a vivid symbol of the need for biodiversity to ensure food security.

Many leaders are asking, “How can we work together to solve big problems in such a divided world?” In this episode of the GLS Podcast, Bozoma Saint John sits down with Paula Faris to discuss the challenges of showing up as your authentic self in the middle of this division. They discuss how the solution to big societal issues begins with individual relationships, and how authenticity can be the pathway to genuine connection in your friendships, work teams and organizations. | Resource management is a critical skill for leaders, and it is also rarely discussed. However, the best leaders know that the ability to maximize output from limited resources can be the difference between leading a struggling organization or a thriving one. In this episode, Kim Simios sits down with Craig Groeschel backstage at the 2019 Global Leadership Summit to discuss the implications of his opening talk, Bend the Curve. Craig unpacks the GETMO (Good Enough To Move On) principle and draws out application for how leaders can bend the curve in their own organizations. | Jason Dorsey’s research into generations provides leaders with information to help build bridges both in the marketplace and in the workplace.

Episode 6 introduced Sanyu, a young idea on a mission to break out of the Poet\'s overcrowded headspace and reach his audience with her most meaningful contribution. After escaping the "Research and Development" faculty of George\'s Mind, Sanyu participated in a version of Episode 8 that simply wasn\'t all that, by her standards. Determined to deliver unprecedented value to the audience, Sanyu decides to "save" Episode 8 from averageness, fighting off insecurities and the ever-changing conditions of a creative mind. The ensuing adventure is a story of hope, fear and sacrifice relevant to anyone who dares to dream big. In many ways, Sanyu embodies the message of the podcast, put most aptly by Victor Hugo: nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.Featured songs:Ambush "Man Can\'t"; Dun Dee "Ooh Wee"; KwayorClinch "Renting"; Mucky “It’s On Me”; Jorja Smith "The One"; Maverick Sabre & George the Poet ft. Jorja Smith "Follow the Leader"Written by George the PoetOriginal score by BenbrickProduced by Benbrick and George the Poet  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | On a mission to find the best use of his platform, George casts his gaze 2000 miles across the Mediterranean Sea to explore the modern Libyan slave trade. Ugly truths about corruption, accountability and the rule of law force him to consider Ugandan politics in comparison to the last years of Gaddafi\'s Libya. Eventually, he finds hope in an unexpected message from an old friend.Featured songs: Mega - ChariotWritten by George the PoetOriginal score by BenbrickProduced by Benbrick and George the Poet  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | A stroll down memory lane takes George to the beginning of his journey with poetry, before a call from a friend reminds him how far he still has to go. Asking about an idea George had previously shared, (“Sanyu”), the friend complains that George is overthinking, hoarding his potential and ultimately shortchanging the world. What follows is a Disney-style dive into the life of an idea in George’s mind. From the clubs of Kampala, to the corners of the imagination, to the frontline of Ugandan politics - the journey is crazy.Featured songs: Radio & Weasel ft.

Or mind-read? Or travel time? All of these are easier than you think. Every time you press play you step into another world and open yourself up to someone else\'s experience. This might not sound like a groundbreaking discovery in an era of constant verbal and visual bombardment, but the potential of this truth is limitless. In his own wildly unconventional way, George the Poet uses music from his environment to convey this point. All you have to do is press play.\xa0Featured songs:\xa0Mucky - It\'s On MeMaleek Berry - Gimme LifeBonnie Beretta - Team BonnieGuala - Guala Gala1011 - Next Up?Written by George the PoetOriginal score by\xa0BenbrickProduced by\xa0Benbrick\xa0and George The Poet#HYHGP  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Following a highly publicised run-in with the police, George looks at the fraught relationship between his community and law enforcers.

In a move from journalism to drama, George departs with the documentary-style narration of previous episodes to deliver a heart-wrenching story of resilience and neglect in London\'s inner city. Enlisting the help of rising star Jade Alleyne, poet Sophia Thakur as well as his own brothers, Freddie, Michael and Kenny Mpanga, George introduces a small universe of characters whose witty exchanges offer insight into their respective environments.\xa0Featured songs:Chika Dole - TouchAbi Ocia - RunningWritten by George the PoetOriginal score by BenbrickProduced by Benbrick and George The Poet#HYHGP  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | George explores the roles of family and formal education in the lives of marginalised young people. With more elaborate scene-setting, his lyrical stream of consciousness flows over a soundscape that is increasingly cinematic and journalistic. The Poet argues that inner city music acts as a pressure valve for voiceless young people who face systemic disadvantage. Expanding on the points of the previous episode, he advocates for youth having space to "speak their truth", and for listeners to take consideration of the problematic realities behind this art.Featured songs:\xa0Klashnekoff - MurderMore Fire Crew - OiSo Solid - 21 SecondsWritten by George the PoetOriginal score by BenbrickProduced by Benbrick and George The Poet#HYHGP  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | In the series debut George invites his listeners to step into the speakers and join him on a meandering ride aboard his own train of thought.

Rest. Regenerate. Do what it takes to be well. Our culture confuses productivity-output-achievement with self-worth. To unhook from that fiction: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | When things are brutally difficult with somebody, sometimes the healthiest thing is to have a non-verbal, encouragement convo. When you can’t safely/bravely express yourself in this realm, then use an esoteric channel—speak to the other person’s Higher Self.  It might be the best conversation you’ve ever had. daniellelaporte.com/withlove | I’ve gotten in the habit of creating a “What I Trust” list before a big gig or opportunity, or when any situation feels wobbly. Often we’re fixated on firing up endorphins (and there are times for that), that we forget that feeling assured and comforted is where the real power is. Calm and centered is magnetic. The “What I Trust” list is for focus and soothing your nervous system. Instead of mustering bravado about things that we hope are true, we root into what we viscerally know we can rely on. So… what do you trust? daniellelaporte.com/withlove | It’s too late in the day, and too hot, crowded, and a little too painful on the planet, to be focused solely on personal attainment. Manifestation is a technology, and like all technologies, I pray that we use it to generate more loving realities for ourselves and for each other. You can still reach for the dream job, the healthy bod’, and the love of your life. You get to want what you want. Always. I’m saying: want all of those things, AND incorporate other people’s wellness in your vision. Pray that when you receive those things, it will make you more generous, more joyous, more healthy… more able to contribute to the collective happiness of everybody around you. This episode is a roundup of the potential mis-steps of popular manifestation techniques, and an invitation for something deeper and unifying. daniellelaporte.com/withlove | The first thing to do with that inner critic voice is to have compassion for it. (This is counterintuitive because we live in a performance-based culture that thrives on judgement.) Approach with love—then instead of creating further separation from your heart, you’re building a bridge. Anytime you bring compassion to a situation you will see it more clearly. Compassion is the light of Love. It’s the true power source. Speak of it often. Here’s some direction: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Our Shadow Self is not an evil-twin personality that we have to master. It’s our neglected inner child—our deep sensitivity. Our greatest opportunity for building strength comes from the work of healing our woundedness. I know this because I lived it: learning to love my most wounded self was my ultimate restoration. Encouragement for your journey: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Making new friends in your 30s, 40s, and onwards — it’s never, EVER too late. Your longing for sisterhood is both primal and divine. Friendship is the medicine. It's the elixir that we need right now, more than ever. Your desire is so HEALTHY. Friendships are my primary religion\xa0so here’s what I suggest… daniellelaporte.com/withlove | We can all understand the importance of starting our day in an intentional way. But before we jump into new habits, we need to look into our psyche and examine what’s really up when we wake up. Each of us has a pre-existing relationship with “mornings”. And it matters. Menus of morning habits are easy to come by (harder to practice). But habits are only bandaids unless we get beneath the surface of our behavior and relating. That’s what most productivity methods fail to ask. What were mornings like for you growing up? What does your ideal morning *feel* like? Welcome to Morning Therapy (but, like, not therapy) with Danielle! I struggled with mornings for a long time. There was a kind of resistance to starting the day, even when there was the presence of joy. I decided to take a deeper, psychological look—and it shifted everything for me. With a little help from my psychotherapist, essentially I created my own therapeutic approach to mornings.\xa0 Morning mindfulness is how you activate your superpowers. Your steadiness and strength. And your connection to the sacred—everything we need on the graceful and the challenging days. So, how do we power up our pre-day? First, we go deeper. \xa0 daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Are you attracting jerks because you’re a jerk? Maybe. Maybe not. Sometimes the jerk is there to show you how you do NOT want to feel or be treated—because contrast is one of our most powerful teachers. The flipside: what they may be here to illuminate is how you DO want to feel and who you truly are. I am a 100% yes to the theory that we attract certain people into our lives to teach us certain things. And—everyone is not your complete reflection. Here’s what I mean… daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Love is one of the most wrung out, misused, and challenging concepts in philosophy, and (more specifically) in self-help teachings. And if “love” is a confusing concept… then “self-love” is utterly mystifying.\xa0 This episode is a long strand of pragmatic and esoteric pearls for self compassion. It’s a reminder that deepening our self-love expands our ability to love others. Real love is mystical and very palpable. It's holy and it's human. It's poetic… and it gets the job done. How do we love ourselves—and each other?

Rest. Regenerate. Do what it takes to be well. Our culture confuses productivity-output-achievement with self-worth. To unhook from that fiction: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | When things are brutally difficult with somebody, sometimes the healthiest thing is to have a non-verbal, encouragement convo. When you can’t safely/bravely express yourself in this realm, then use an esoteric channel—speak to the other person’s Higher Self.  It might be the best conversation you’ve ever had. daniellelaporte.com/withlove | I’ve gotten in the habit of creating a “What I Trust” list before a big gig or opportunity, or when any situation feels wobbly. Often we’re fixated on firing up endorphins (and there are times for that), that we forget that feeling assured and comforted is where the real power is. Calm and centered is magnetic. The “What I Trust” list is for focus and soothing your nervous system. Instead of mustering bravado about things that we hope are true, we root into what we viscerally know we can rely on. So… what do you trust? daniellelaporte.com/withlove | It’s too late in the day, and too hot, crowded, and a little too painful on the planet, to be focused solely on personal attainment. Manifestation is a technology, and like all technologies, I pray that we use it to generate more loving realities for ourselves and for each other. You can still reach for the dream job, the healthy bod’, and the love of your life. You get to want what you want. Always. I’m saying: want all of those things, AND incorporate other people’s wellness in your vision. Pray that when you receive those things, it will make you more generous, more joyous, more healthy… more able to contribute to the collective happiness of everybody around you. This episode is a roundup of the potential mis-steps of popular manifestation techniques, and an invitation for something deeper and unifying. daniellelaporte.com/withlove | The first thing to do with that inner critic voice is to have compassion for it. (This is counterintuitive because we live in a performance-based culture that thrives on judgement.) Approach with love—then instead of creating further separation from your heart, you’re building a bridge. Anytime you bring compassion to a situation you will see it more clearly. Compassion is the light of Love. It’s the true power source. Speak of it often. Here’s some direction: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Our Shadow Self is not an evil-twin personality that we have to master. It’s our neglected inner child—our deep sensitivity. Our greatest opportunity for building strength comes from the work of healing our woundedness. I know this because I lived it: learning to love my most wounded self was my ultimate restoration. Encouragement for your journey: daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Making new friends in your 30s, 40s, and onwards — it’s never, EVER too late. Your longing for sisterhood is both primal and divine. Friendship is the medicine. It's the elixir that we need right now, more than ever. Your desire is so HEALTHY. Friendships are my primary religion\xa0so here’s what I suggest… daniellelaporte.com/withlove | We can all understand the importance of starting our day in an intentional way. But before we jump into new habits, we need to look into our psyche and examine what’s really up when we wake up. Each of us has a pre-existing relationship with “mornings”. And it matters. Menus of morning habits are easy to come by (harder to practice). But habits are only bandaids unless we get beneath the surface of our behavior and relating. That’s what most productivity methods fail to ask. What were mornings like for you growing up? What does your ideal morning *feel* like? Welcome to Morning Therapy (but, like, not therapy) with Danielle! I struggled with mornings for a long time. There was a kind of resistance to starting the day, even when there was the presence of joy. I decided to take a deeper, psychological look—and it shifted everything for me. With a little help from my psychotherapist, essentially I created my own therapeutic approach to mornings.\xa0 Morning mindfulness is how you activate your superpowers. Your steadiness and strength. And your connection to the sacred—everything we need on the graceful and the challenging days. So, how do we power up our pre-day? First, we go deeper. \xa0 daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Are you attracting jerks because you’re a jerk? Maybe. Maybe not. Sometimes the jerk is there to show you how you do NOT want to feel or be treated—because contrast is one of our most powerful teachers. The flipside: what they may be here to illuminate is how you DO want to feel and who you truly are. I am a 100% yes to the theory that we attract certain people into our lives to teach us certain things. And—everyone is not your complete reflection. Here’s what I mean… daniellelaporte.com/withlove | Love is one of the most wrung out, misused, and challenging concepts in philosophy, and (more specifically) in self-help teachings. And if “love” is a confusing concept… then “self-love” is utterly mystifying.\xa0 This episode is a long strand of pragmatic and esoteric pearls for self compassion. It’s a reminder that deepening our self-love expands our ability to love others. Real love is mystical and very palpable. It's holy and it's human. It's poetic… and it gets the job done. How do we love ourselves—and each other?
