Needless to say, this bill, if passed will have a huge impact on DJI, the world’s largest drone manufacturer.But apart from DJI, this move will also impact the end-user – in this case, government agencies. Now, considering performance and price, DJI drones are often the sole choice for many government applications.So, will this proposed ban end up hurting the American consumer much more than the Chinese manufacturer? Is this a knee-jerk reaction fueled by fear rather than rationale?In yet more DJI news, we reveal some interesting details about DJI Airworks 2019, the annual drone conference being held in Los Angeles, CA from Sep 24th-Sep 26th. According to industry rumors, DJI has some interesting launches lined up for this event. From farming equipment to hardware for the Matrice series, listeners will get a sneak peek into this event.New Skydio Drone FootageOur next big drone story is about the soon-to-be-launched, Skydio R2. Skydio just released some Skydio R2 images which highlight the drone camera’s impressive dynamic range. From previous teasers, we had learned about the drone’s build and its flying capabilities.In today’s show, we speculate on the Skydio R2 release date and pricing.With DJI facing huge challenges on multiple fronts, will an American-manufactured, Skydio R2 provide drone pilots with a much-needed alternative?Phantom 4 RTK Updates and New Mapping WorkflowOur last story is about the Phantom 4 RTK. DJI has released a new SDK remote which allows third-party developers to use the Phantom 4 RTK for complex mapping missions. Further, professional drone mappers now have the option of utilizing the base station as a rover. This shall be particularly helpful as a high-grade GNSS rover is prohibitively expensive.To utilize the base station as a rover, mappers will have to connect the remote control to the rover, and then utilize the remote control to control the rover.As we have discussed in previous ADU shows, to facilitate RTK corrections, a connection to an Ntrip network needs to be established via a cellular or WiFi network.Now, with the new workflow, connection to an Ntrip network needs to be established from the copter to the remote. After talking to multiple drone mappers and researchers, we reveal that many mappers are facing issues establishing this connection. So, can you overcome this issue to and seamlessly use this new mapping workflow?Other topics discussed in today’s show include the “Storm Area 51” event, the “Heathrow Pause” and Phantom 4 Pro availability.

While most photogrammetry processing creates point clouds then other data products from that, React creates only an orthomosaic. This orthomosiac gives users a live visualization of a large area to make navigational decisions, logistical decisions, and material decisions. When companies need environmental information fast, drone mapping and react have become that answer.When disaster strikes and response teams need to know which streets are blocked, which houses need resources and which civilians need evacuation...React provides the information seamlessly and quickly. Working in environments without cellular data isn\'t a problem with React, simply insert the drone SD card into your computer and start processing anywhere. In a few minutes, your completed orthomosiac will display on the screen.Users can take measurements, area measurements, mark locations and showcase GPS coordinates of specific areas. Easily export your situational awareness data via PDF or GeoTIFF. Quickly measure burn areas and strategize response planning. Pix4D React will change disaster planning, tactical implementation and decision making as a whole.Recently crashed your drone?

They requested a full inspection of the door.\xa0The inspection was carried out by a ground engineer who then performed a pressurization leak check. In order to carry out this check without requiring the aircraft\'s engines, the pressurization system was set to "manual". However, the engineer failed to reset it to "auto" on completion of the test. After the aircraft was returned into service, the flight crew overlooked the pressurisation system state on three separate occasions: during the pre-flight procedure, the after-start check, and the after take-off check. During these checks, no one in the flight crew noticed the incorrect setting.\xa0The aircraft took off at 9:07\xa0with the pressurization system still set to "manual", and the aft outflow valve partially open. As the aircraft climbed, the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased. As it passed through an altitude of 12,040 feet (3,670\xa0m), the cabin altitude warning horn sounded.\xa0The warning should have prompted the crew to stop climbing,\xa0but it was misidentified by the crew as a take-off configuration warning, which signals that the aircraft is not ready for take-off, and can only sound on the ground. In the next few minutes, several warning lights on the overhead panel in the cockpit illuminated. One or both of the equipment cooling warning lights came on to indicate low airflow through the cooling fans (a result of the decreased air density), accompanied by the master caution light. The passenger oxygen light illuminated when, at an altitude of approximately 18,000 feet (5,500\xa0m), the oxygen masks in the passenger cabin automatically deployed. Shortly after the cabin altitude warning sounded, the captain radioed the Helios operations centre and reported "the take-off configuration warning on" and "cooling equipment normal and alternate off line".\xa0He then spoke to the ground engineer and repeatedly stated that the "cooling ventilation fan lights were off".\xa0The engineer (the one who had conducted the pressurization leak check) asked "Can you confirm that the pressurization panel is set to AUTO?" However, the captain, already experiencing the onset of\xa0hypoxia\'s\xa0initial symptoms,\xa0disregarded the question and instead asked in reply, "Where are my equipment cooling circuit breakers?".\xa0This was the last communication with the aircraft. The aircraft continued to climb until it leveled off at FL340, approximately 34,000 feet (10,000\xa0m).\xa0Between 09:30 and 09:40, Nicosia ATC repeatedly attempted to contact the aircraft, without success.\xa0At 09:37, the aircraft passed from Cyprus\xa0Flight Information Region\xa0(FIR) into Athens FIR, without making contact with Athens ATC.\xa0Nineteen attempts to contact the aircraft between 10:12 and 10:50 also met with no response,\xa0and at 10:40 the aircraft entered the holding pattern for Athens Airport, at the KEA\xa0VHF omnidirectional range, still at FL340.\xa0It remained in the holding pattern, under control of the auto-pilot, for the next 70 minutes. Two\xa0F-16\xa0fighter aircraft from the\xa0Hellenic Air Force\xa0111th Combat Wing were scrambled from\xa0Nea Anchialos\xa0Air Base to establish visual contact.\xa0They intercepted the passenger jet at 11:24 and observed that the first officer was slumped motionless at the controls and the captain\'s seat was empty.\xa0They also reported that oxygen masks were dangling in the passenger cabin. At 11:49, flight attendant Andreas Prodromou entered the cockpit and sat down in the captain\'s seat, having remained conscious by using a portable oxygen supply.\xa0Prodromou held a\xa0UK Commercial Pilot Licence,\xa0but was not qualified to fly the Boeing 737. Crash investigators concluded that Prodromou\'s experience was insufficient for him to be able to gain control of the aircraft under the circumstances. Prodromou waved at the F16s very briefly, but almost as soon as he entered the cockpit, the left engine\xa0flamed out\xa0due to fuel exhaustion\xa0and the plane left the holding pattern and started to descend.\xa0Ten minutes after the loss of power from the left engine, the right engine also flamed out,\xa0and just before 12:04 the aircraft crashed into hills near Grammatiko, 40\xa0km (25\xa0mi; 22\xa0nmi) from Athens, killing all 121 passengers and crew on board. | Anna Rice fell in love with aviation as a child, as she accompanied her flight attendant mother on trips to Europe. She attended Metro State College of Denver (now Metropolitan State University of Denver), majoring in Aviation, and was selected as an intern at American Airlines. After graduation, she became a CFI and then a pilot for a small airline, and was on track to become a pilot with American Airlines when the attacks of September 11th crippled the U.S. airline industry. She continued to work as a CFI until another airline job became available. THEN another career hurdle appeared, the airline pilot age limit raising from 60 to 65. That caused total stagnation in upward movement at her airline, and she was furloughed. When she had children, she saw the furlough as a blessing, as she was able to stay home to raise them, and she bypassed her recall until the children were older. She is now back at her airline as a B737 First Officer. | The introduction of the Advanced Qualification Program (AQP) in the early 1990s marks another stage in the evolution of error management. Under AQP, a voluntary program, the FAA allows air carriers to develop training programs specific to their individual needs and operations. A condition for AQP authorization is the requirement to have a CRM program that is integrated into technical training. To accomplish this objective, air carriers began to “proceduralize” CRM by incorporating desired behaviors into operational procedures and checklists. Although AQP is a voluntary program, the FAA Flight Standards Service encourages air carriers to participate. AQP provides for enhanced curriculum development and a data-driven approach to quality assurance along with the flexibility to target critical tasks during aircrew training. The AQP methodology directly supports the FAA’s goals for safety enhancement. The primary goal of AQP is to achieve the highest possible standard of individual and crew performance. In order to achieve this goal, AQP seeks to reduce the probability of crew-related errors by aligning training and evaluation requirements more closely with the known causes of human error. For example: a. Crew Performance. Most accidents are attributed to crew error. Traditional training programs focus on individual training and evaluation. Under AQP, the focus is on crew and individual performance in both training and evaluation. b. CRM. Most accidents are caused by errors of judgment, communication, and crew coordination. Traditional training programs focus primarily on flying skills and systems knowledge. Under AQP, competence in flying skills and systems knowledge are integrated with CRM skills in training and evaluation throughout the curriculum. c. Scenario-Based Training and Evaluation. Most accidents are caused by a chain of errors that build up over the course of a flight and which, if undetected or unresolved, result in a final, fatal error. Traditional training programs, with their maneuver-based training and evaluation, artificially segment simulation events in such a way as to prevent the realistic buildup of the error chain. Under AQP, both training and evaluation are scenario-based, simulating more closely the actual flight conditions known to cause most fatal carrier accidents. d. Additional Benefits. Added benefits that are expected for individual applicants will vary, but may include: (1) The ability to modify training curricula, media, and intervals. (2) Crew evaluation as well as individual assessment. (3) Improved standardization across fleets and flight personnel. (4) Shift from programmed hours to proficiency-based training. (5) Access to innovative training ideas and research. (6) Opportunity to achieve more efficient training. | Under Chairman Sumwalt’s leadership, the agency’s ranking in the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government has advanced 33 percent to the agency’s current position of Number 6 of 29 small federal agencies. He is a fierce advocate for improving safety in all modes of transportation, including teen driver safety, impaired driving, distractions in transportation, and several aviation and rail safety initiatives. Before joining the NTSB, Chairman Sumwalt was a pilot for 32 years, including 24 years with Piedmont Airlines and US Airways. He accumulated over 14,000 flight hours. During his tenure at US Airways, he worked on special assignment to the flight safety department and served on the airline’s Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) monitoring team. Following his airline career, Chairman Sumwalt managed the corporate aviation department for a Fortune 500 energy company. In other notable accomplishments, he chaired the Air Line Pilots Association’s Human Factors and Training Group and co-founded the association’s critical incident response program. He also spent eight years as a consultant to NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) and has written extensively on aviation safety matters. He has co-authored a book on aircraft accidents and has published more than 100 articles on transportation safety and aircraft accident investigation. Chairman Sumwalt earned an undergraduate degree from the University of South Carolina and a Master of Aeronautical Science (with Distinction) from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, with concentrations in aviation/aerospace safety systems and human factors aviation systems. In recognition of his accomplishments, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of South Carolina, and an honorary doctorate from Embry-Riddle. He is an inductee into the South Carolina Aviation Hall of Fame. | In RFT 086 we discussed Stabilized Approaches. According to AINOnline fully 96 percent of all airline flights conclude with stabilized approaches. Of the 4 percent that are not stabilized, virtually NONE of them (3%) result in a go-around! FAA recommends that approach stabilization start as far out as possible. Simply stated, a stable approach is a 3-degree glide path, executed on-speed and fully configured for landing. It\'s easy to calculate a 3-degree glide path - simply take half your groundspeed and multiply it by 10 to get the vertical speed to maintain the 3 degrees. Since the go-around is not performed nearly as often as a normal landing, it is essential that the crew review the procedures involved in a go-around when they brief the approach. | From LinkedIn: Chris “Elroy” Stricklin is an award-winning leadership author, a highly sought after motivational keynote speaker and a Combat-Proven Senior Military leader retiring after 23 years which culminated with CEO-Level leadership of a 7,000-person strong, $7B worldwide organization.

Founded in 2009 by pilots and friends Brad Childs and Jonathan Plesset, the organization become a recognized 501c(3) entity in 2012. Since then our teams have conducted a wide range of missions including hoarding cases, saving animals from dog fighting rings and natural disasters, and helping overcrowded shelters. We now have the capability to respond to a huge variety of rescue needs both near and far. During the devastating hurricanes in 2017, PAART made its first international journey, heading to the storm-ravaged island of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands to rescue not only 42 animals, but two rescuers who had found themselves stranded on the island for weeks. Our reach stretches from Texas to Florida and all the way up the East Coast to Massachusetts. We have conducted rescue missions as far inland as the Mississippi River. While Pittsburgh is in our name, it actually makes up less than 10% of the area we cover. Our rescue partners are many, ranging in size from large organizations like The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), and North Shore Animal League America, as well as small shelters in remote areas of West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and beyond. One of our newer partners is St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center in Madison, New Jersey. With an increasing population disparity in the northern states, St. Hubert’s serves as a hub for animals heading into New England where rescue dogs are scarce but people still want to have the fulfilling opportunity to rescue a beautiful, healthy animal who otherwise would have met a devastating fate. | mmonly known as “takeoff safety s The second segment requirement is often the most difficult one to meet. Segment two begins when the gear is up and locked and the speed is V2. This segment has the steepest climb gradient: 2.4 percent. This equates to a ballpark figure of around 300 feet per minute, and for a heavy airplane on a hot day with a failed engine, this can be a challenge. Often, when the airlines announce that a flight is weight-limited on hot summer days, this is the reason (the gate agent doesn’t know this kind of detail, and nor does she care; she just knows some people aren’t going). The magic computers we use for computing performance data figure all this out, saving us the trouble of using charts and graphs. All we know is that we can either carry the planned load or we can’t. Second segment climb ends at 400 feet, so it could take up to a minute or more to fly this segment. Think of all the obstacles that might be in the departure path in the course of 60 seconds or more. Third segment climb begins at 400 feet, and here the rules can vary. The climb gradient is now half of what it was before: 1.2 percent. However, we are also required to accelerate to a speed called VFS (final segment climb speed). In graphs and publications, the third segment of the climb is often depicted as being a flat line for the acceleration. In many turboprops, that’s exactly the way it’s flown. The airplane is leveled off (and the pilot is using a very tired leg to overcome the increasing yaw tendency via the rudder) and accelerated before the final climb begins. In jets, however, there is generally enough power in the remaining engine to avoid a level-off. If the airplane can continue to accelerate during the third segment, it may continue to climb, so long as it can do so without a decrease in speed or performance. In fact, during the climb it must continue to meet the climb gradient while accelerating to VFS. Third segment climb ends upon reaching VFS. The fourth and “final segment” begins upon reaching VFS and completing the climb configuration process. It is now permissible (and maybe necessary) to reduce thrust to a Maximum Continuous setting. The climb gradient is again 1.2 percent, and VFS must be maintained to 1,500 feet above field elevation. ore. Third segment climb begins at 400 feet, and here the rules can vary.

Steve shot down five enemy aircraft in Vietnam, making him the first (and only) Air Force pilot ace of the war. Most striking is his description of almost getting a sixth MiG, and the iron discipline involved. Before you listen to Steve Ritchie\'s interview, please read this passage from Hamfist Over Hanoi, based on a true story: “Now before I tell you what I consider the most important quality of a fighter pilot, and this goes for you WSOs also, I\'m going to tell you a story.” “During Operation Rolling Thunder, an F-105 flight lead was in an extended engagement with a MiG. He was performing repeated high-speed yoyos, gaining on the MiG with each yoyo. One more yoyo and he would be in a firing position.” The Colonel paused and looked around the room. We were all transfixed in rapt attention. “Just as he was about to get a firing solution, his wingman called Bingo.” Bingo meant that the fuel had reached the predetermined quantity where the flight must Return To Base.\xa0 “What do you think Lead did?” Colonel West made eye contact with each of us. I was hoping he wasn\'t expecting any of us to answer. “Lead did what he was supposed to do,” he continued, “he disengaged by doing a quarter roll and zoom, and he RTB\'d. And I\'ll tell you why he did it. He did it because he had flight discipline. And he had trust. He trusted that his wingman wouldn\'t call Bingo unless he was really at Bingo fuel. And he, the Flight Lead, had established that Bingo. He gave up his MiG because he had discipline. If he had taken one more slice, done one more yoyo, he could have had that MiG. But he would have put his wingman in jeopardy. He did the right thing. He had discipline.” “I expect, I demand, that all my pilots exhibit discipline. I don\'t expect anyone to be perfect in his flying. You\'re going to make mistakes, and you\'re going to learn from your mistakes. But I do expect everyone to have perfect discipline. If anyone in the flight calls Bingo, you RTB, whether you\'ve accomplished your training or not. If anyone calls Knock It Off, you discontinue the maneuver. And if you find yourself out of control below 10,000 feet, you eject.” “Does anyone have any questions?” Nobody uttered a word.', 'chan_desc': 'The Ready For Takeoff podcast will help you transform your aviation passion into an aviation career.

But mental and emotional issues can also cause problems if brought onto the flight deck. One of them is grief—the human response to losing someone or something we cherish. But even though they’re often unwilling to admit they need help coping with grief, pilots don’t have to do it alone.

We talk with the pilot of Qantas Flight 72, An Airbus A330 that pitched down without control input and without warning a decade ago. The pilot of that aircraft says of the MAX 8 accidents, “the road is different, but the destination is the same.” Our roundtable of pilots and aviation journalists looks at the growing complexity of flight deck automation, our increasing dependence on it and the lack of training available to pilots for cases in which the automation fails.

In this episode, Wilson Khors and his copilot become so transfixed on making it through a tiny hole in a line of convective weather over San Juan, Puerto Rico, they simply disregard the option of turning around. They’re not alone. Even some of the most experienced pilots have done it. In part, they’re using weather depiction strategically. But is that really wise? Topics the episode will cover:  The hazards of trying to fly through rather than around convective weather. How weather depiction varies tremendously based on who and where you are. The advantages of using weather depiction strategically to avoid storms rather than tactically to pick a path through them.

Enrique, the Publisher & Editor in Chief of Airways Magazine, also joins the production team, bringing in numerous guests from the industry to be featured in this season\'s interview segment. This new season will be edited and cured by our new team member, Jeffry Nova, a professional radio veteran who\'s taking The Airways Podcast to a new level of quality. In this episode, David Neeleman exclusively tells Airways\xa0Managing Editor, Chris Sloan, the tentative launch date of his new startup, code-named Moxy. Rohan, Vinay, and Enrique analyze three topics drawn from the top headlines in the commercial aviation scene:  Boeing mothballs the launching of the 777-8X. Cathay Pacific changes its top management. Tokyo-Narita gives way to Haneda as the prime airport for US carriers.  Tune in, The Airways Podcast is here! |   Airbus is taking a majority stake in Bombardier\'s troubled CSeries Program (0:35) which Rohan likes to call, "the mic drop." As if Vinay doesn\'t have enough reasons to call Rohan out for being a stereotypical millennial, Rohan insisted that Vinay humor a discussion about a potential United - JetBlue merger (23:35) which was a topic raised by some high-ups at Wall Street (aka Hunter Keay) a few weeks back, and how it would address some gaps in the United network, i.e. the Southeast, which has been a hot topic as of late. Onto more concrete topics, we dive into Q3 2017 earnings season by discussing Delta\'s results (34:10).\xa0   \xa0 | We start off by wishing Vinay a Happy Birthday, but certainly, a "mediocre birthday" (his words) pales in comparison to the continued woes for AirBerlin and Alitalia (1:10) after we perform a health check on Europe\'s biggest ailing carriers (for now). And the drama doesn\'t end there: Ryanair, which once appeared to be one of the highest bidders for some of Alitalia\'s assets, is suffering from extensive operational and commercial fallouts over a pilot shortage (16:35). With no end in sight, will they be able to recover from a tarnished image in spite of its, "Always Getting Better," program oriented around customer service? However, not all is woeful in Europe: Turkish Airlines seems to have recovered from a crummy 2016 and placed a blockbuster order for 787-9s (30:18) and may have more orders in the pipeline from both Boeing and Airbus. Furthermore, Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic JV partner Delta will be\xa0adding new routes and cities to Europe in Summer 2018 (36:30), diversifying beyond traditional bread-and-butter markets and going places where long-haul LCCs are absent.\xa0 | School\'s in session, airlines routes are proliferating and Vinay and Rohan are back on U.S. soil after a busy summer filled with work and travel. We\'re ready to hit the ground running after an extended hiatus, thanks to our listeners who awaited our return! We start off by examining the consequences that natural disasters have on air travel (4:07) in light of the recent tropical storms in hitting the U.S. and Caribbean coasts and how airlines have to respond tactically from a pricing and inventory perspective to surging demand. Next, we evaluate the latest salvo of transatlantic routes (15:25) across the Atlantic to medium-sized markets like Nashville and Indianapolis, among others. Against this backdrop, however, will be transatlantic capacity reductions in the form of Air Berlin (25:05), whose August 15 insolvency filing resulted in widebody aircraft lessors asking for their A330s back, and subsequently, Air Berlin is cutting the majority of its long-haul routes. Speaking of transformation, Minnesota\'s "hometown carrier" Sun Country Airlines is revamping its business model (32:10) to become more, "ultra-low-cost carrier" - like. Not-so-Minnesota Nice? What will the long-term impact be? Finally, Rohan and Vinay do a pulse check on basic economy (37:23) in light of United\'s recent decision to scale it back on domestic markets just as American rolls it out to more markets. Why the sudden reverse in course?\xa0 | Vinay breaks down all of the action from day one of the 2017 Paris Air Show in a solo podcast. \xa0  If you enjoy the show, please consider contributing to our IndieGoGo campaign. | Vinay and Rohan kick off the show discussing Qatar\'s diplomatic spat with several Middle Eastern neighbors (0:45), which may spell sinister things for Qatari aviation. Rohan and Vinay don\'t expect the situation to subside very quickly, or at least without repercussion. On a more positive note, they discuss United Airlines\' announcement of nonstop service from Los Angeles to Singapore on the Boeing 787-9 (12:44), which certainly took everyone by surprise, even though an 18-hour flight in 9-abreast seating doesn\'t sound like many peoples\' cup of tea. North of the US border, Canada\'s WestJet will be taking a huge step as its pilots voted in favor of unionization (22:25) under the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA). Will its flight attendants be next? Back on US\xa0soil, Donald Trump has expressed interest in privatizing Air Traffic Control (29:00). What could this spell for US aviation, and who may be against the idea? If you enjoy the show, please contribute to  our Indiegogo campaign. \xa0 | Vinay and Rohan kick off the show discussing the fact that Air India is still in growth mode (2:05) and will be expanding in Scandinavia, not to mention stated intentions to grow in the U.S., thanks to the electronics ban that has affected Gulf competitors operating to the U.S. Will Air India fill the remaining void for the underserved nonstop U.S. - India markets? They then move on to discuss the great "Terminal Shuffle" at LAX airport (12:58) last month went relatively smoothly, which we talk about in greater depth, since this was precipitated by Delta and its desire to become closer to SkyTeam partners at LAX. Alaska will begin services to Seattle\'s Paine Field (22:25) in the fall of 2018, starting with 9 daily services. What does this mean for Alaska, now that it will be operating at two airports in the same metropolitan region, not to mention its home city? Finally, Vinay and Rohan give their updated take on the infamous electronics ban and the potential for it to expand to Europe (30:30).  Remember to support the Airways Podcast on Indiegogo! | It\'s been some time, but Vinay and Rohan lend their thoughts on the UA 3411 incident with Dr. David Dao, along with some commentary on some minor follow-up stories that have taken place since (2:32). Next, WestJet is launching an ultra-low cost carrier - WestJet Lite? WestJet Encore Minus? What are the implications (15:10). Emirates is doing what was unthinkable three years ago: cutting US capacity in wake of the electronics travel ban (27:19) - or is it? Finally, Jet Airways is growing again, leveraging its burgeoning relationship with Air France - KLM and Delta in Europe (34:33).\xa0 \xa0 Bonus: Rohan and Vinay discuss the new kick-starter campaign to help us get HUGE on Indiegogo, along with some of Vinay\'s, "thoughts" on Chris Christie\'s aviation policy.\xa0 \xa0  Support the Airways podcast on Indiegogo', 'chan_desc': "Welcome to the Airways Podcast, the digital audio extension of one of the world's leading aviation publications, Airways Magazine (www.airwaysmag.com).

But airline management would fight hard to create a tiered system of pay. Learn how Behncke and ALPA leveraged the precedent set by Decision 83 to set up the pilot pay system airline pilots enjoy today, and how this issue galvanized all airline pilots to "think collectively and work collectively." | Expert maneuvering by ALPA\'s first president, Capt. Dave Behncke helped propel ALPA from a small lobbying group to the most respected voice for airline pilots in Washington. Through ALPA\'s advocacy in the early days of the National Recovery Administration\'s "Code Hearings," ALPA was able to secure the foundation of the pilot compensation system in the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, which is still in use today. | The early days of ALPA\'s presence in Washington were filled with political maneuvering spearheaded by ALPA\'s founder, Dave Behncke. Through ALPA\'s support of President Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal, ALPA positioned itself into a formidable force in commercial aviation which allowed ALPA to advocate for the pilot compensation system which is still in use today. | The Century Airlines Strike of 1932 was quite the spectacle during the early days of commercial aviation. Not only was it a pivotal event in the history of commercial aviation, but it was key to positioning ALPA as a major player in the labor movement as well as the aviation industry. Learn how missteps by E.L. Cord and smart maneuvering by ALPA founder Dave Behncke led to ALPA securing higher standards for airline pilots throughout the industry. | E.L. Cord was the owner of Century Air Lines, but more importantly, his name was the rallying cry for organizing pilots in the 1930s. The Century Air Lines Strike of 1932 gave ALPA its first opportunity to negotiate a labor dispute between its members and management. In this first part of Chapter 6, we\'ll learn how E.L. Cord\'s ambitious plot to turn a profit at the expense of his pilots led to the first strike in commercial aviation. | In this episode, we hear the conclusion of the Livermore Affair and learn how this tragedy set the groundwork for ALPA\'s critical role in setting high standards for aviation safety, eliminating the practice of "pilot pushing," and setting the bar for aviation safety for pilots, passengers, and cargo. | In 1937, a young widow by the name of Lorna Livermore helped ALPA shed light on the practice of “pilot pushing” with the public for the very first time when she sued Northwest Airlines alleging that “Pilot pushing” is what killed her husband, pilot Joe Livermore. | The Airmail Pilots\' Strike of 1919 was one of the earliest organized actions taken by pilots. This 4-day strike led to concessions by Post Office management to eliminate the practice of "weather pushing" and to increase safety for airmail pilots. The roots of modern-day pilots\' unions can be traced back to this important event in aviation history. | This week, we’ll hear about how the deadly practice of “pilot pushing” played a huge role in Capt. David Behncke’s drive to organize his fellow brother pilots. | This week, hear about the 24 "key men" who saw themselves as good "company men" but were labeled as "troublemakers" by their airline management.

Marc and Joby sat down to create a short list of potential co-hosts.\xa0 One of the first names on their respective list, was Brandon Anderson.\xa0 Brandon, a former guest of the show, brings all the attributes our audience wants, starting with a passion for aviation.\xa0 We\'re excited to have him join the crew.\xa0 WELCOME BRANDON!  There is so much more, as you will hear listening to this week\'s episode of SimpleFlight radio.\xa0 In addition to learning about Brandon\'s background, the conversation touched on philosophical topics, like personal minimums.\xa0 We\'re interested to hear your perspective on the items discussed. \xa0\xa0 As always, we love hearing from you and ask you share your ideas with the entire SimpleFlight Facebook and Instagram community\xa0\xa0@simpleflightradio  \u200b Thanks for being a part of the SimpleFlight Family!! | Oshkosh 2019 is in the books!!!\xa0 It was a record breaking event, with many noteworthy outcomes that are sure to fuel an exciting year in aviation.\xa0 One item we like, is that OSH represents the anniversary of our first show, 7 YEARS AGO!!! We can\'t think of a better way to kick off Season 8, than with a repeat guest and a SimpleFlight favorite, Boldmethod!!!\xa0\xa0 Boldmethod (boldmethod.com) co-founders, Aleks Udris and Colin Cutler, join Al and Marc to give all of us a peek behind the scenes of the brand they\'ve built and the life they lead.\xa0 There are lots of surprises related to the time and effort required to get to the end result.\xa0 What isn\'t surprising is the quality, energy, and insight they bring to all their followers.

Passion.\xa0 In today\'s world, it\'s not uncommon to find pilots that are making their way back into the sky after an extended hiatus.\xa0 What is less common is to come across a pilot that after being "bitten" by the flying bug, immersed himself into the journey that included earning his private and instrument ticket, the purchase of a plane, and taking trips that previously were only dreams.\xa0 That\'s when the story makes a 180 degree turn.\xa0 Because in this case, the pilot voluntarily decided it was time to walk away.\xa0 \xa0  Listen in to this week\'s episode of SimpleFlight Radio as Marc and Al sit down with Kirke Machon, a Chicago-based GA pilot that embarked on and completed a journey that most only dream about.\xa0 And once the dream was complete, had the strength and conviction to walk away.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 We found the discussion empowering and uplifting.\xa0 We hope you do as well.  As always, we love hearing from you and ask you share your ideas with the entire SimpleFlight Facebook and Instagram community\xa0\xa0@simpleflightradio  \u200b Thanks for being a part of the SimpleFlight Family!!! | We often think of airports as just pieces of concrete, maybe a control tower, and a place to land. Its easy to forget about the people behind the scenes putting their best foot forward to make your airport run!  This week, we sit down with Jamie Abbott, the Executive Director at our home airport - Chicago Executive (KPWK).\xa0\xa0Jamie has some incredible stories on how he and his team work hard to keep the airport safe, valuable to the community, and make a home for your favorite Aviation Podcast, SimpleFlight Radio!  As always, we love hearing from you and ask you share your ideas with the entire SimpleFlight Facebook and Instagram community\xa0\xa0@simpleflightradio | Ask most pilots, and they will tell you that learning to fly was one of the most rewarding and challenging things they have done in life.\xa0 And while similarities exist, each pilot\'s journey is unique.\xa0 Something that can be depended on are the many challenges that will be faced throughout the training process.\xa0\xa0  This week\'s episode of SimpleFlight Radio has Marc and Al\xa0 talking with Kseniya Polinsky, a friend of the show, who recently earned her Private Pilot certificate.\xa0 Like all of us, Kseniya, had to answer the questions of how to go about getting started, finding a school, a CFI, and establishing a timeline that made sense for her, while life around her continued to change.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 Kseniya\'s story serves as a reminder that the path is not always straight, but it is within the student\'s ultimate control.\xa0 The crew enjoyed hearing about her strategies for understanding and navigating both the human and technical factors that come into play during the process.\xa0 Of course, establishing, and when necessary, reestablishing momentum is a topic we can all identify with.\xa0 We hope you you enjoy the conversation as much as we did.  As always, we love hearing from you and ask you share your ideas with the entire SimpleFlight Facebook and Instagram community\xa0\xa0@simpleflightradio  \u200b Thanks for being a part of the SimpleFlight Family!!! | As a General Aviation pilot, many of us think of flight planning in terms of\xa0weather, NOTAMs, fuel planning, altitude selection, routing, timing, and ensuring the pilot and plane are capable of making the flight.\xa0 From there it\'s executing the plan.\xa0 Simply, Plan The Flight and Fly The Plan.\xa0 The burden is on the PIC.\xa0 In the world of the airline pilot, many GA pilots assume the Dispatcher does all the flight planning and then delivers the plan to the Captain, without further\xa0discussion.\xa0 Nothing could be further from the truth.  This week\'s episode of SimpleFlight Radio has Marc and Al\xa0 talking with James Tochihara, former International Dispatcher for United Airlines.\xa0 One lesson learned is\xa0the Dispatcher is an essential crew member\xa0responsible for the safe and comfortable completion of the flight.\xa0 That means, their\xa0vigilance, communication, and decision-making continues until the plane is parked safely at the destination gate.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 James takes us through the role, responsibilities, and skills that come into play, as well as a day in the life of a Professional Airline Dispatcher, including the emotional connection to every flight they\xa0touch.\xa0\xa0September 11th was discussed, with James recommending a video (https://bit.ly/2UmhCKS) to hear the story from 5 dispatchers.\xa0\xa0So welcome to this week\'s episode.\xa0 We hope you find the conversation as\xa0enlightening as we did.\xa0\xa0  As always, we love hearing from you and ask you share your ideas with the entire SimpleFlight Facebook and Instagram community @simpleflightradio Thanks for being a part of the SimpleFlight Family!!! | It\'s a surprise to no one that the most common conversations in aviation, center on people and planes.\xa0 And why not... it makes for great hangar flying.\xa0 This week, Al and Marc were reminded of another very important aspect of aviation... The Airport.\xa0 We\'re not talking about the runways, but how the airport serves as a hub for bringing people and planes together.\xa0 Airports have personalities that are born out of the stories and the people who make them happen.\xa0 This week, the SimpleFlight crew visited a shining example of the perfection that happens when it all comes together.  Poplar Grove Airport (C77) is a very special place.\xa0 It\'s not because of chance, but rather the owners of the airport, Steve and Tina Thomas, designed it that way.\xa0 They built a culture years ago, which they protect, strengthen, and live\xa0 7\xa0x 24 x 365.\xa0 After a tour of the field, which was too short for their liking, the guys had a chance to sit down with Steve and Tina and talk about how they make the magic happen. \xa0 When you listen to this week\'s show, you may hear about a flight school, a maintenance shop, a museum, and an air-park, but what you\'ll feel and\xa0think about is the history, the passion, and a very special community.\xa0 You can read about Poplar Grove on their website:(www.poplargroveairmotive.com), but\xa0if you ever in the Midwest, drop by C77 and say hi to Steve and Tina (and the dogs).\xa0 You may never want to leave.  As always, we love hearing from you and ask you share your ideas with the entire SimpleFlight Facebook and Instagram community\xa0\xa0@simpleflightradio  \u200b Thanks for being a part of the SimpleFlight Family!!!', 'chan_desc': "Welcome to the SimpleFlight Radio show!

Airways, the board game & softball, an avgeek game. Food galore, from the AirMos burger manual to the LHR AA chorizo hot dog, to the not-really-parisian Admirals baguette. UA Polaris confusion and AA absent service (ok, more like hit-and-miss): Paul and Alex compare their US travels (there's also AeroMexico, JetBlue, and Paul flies the longest possible AA route with a pajama). From windows shades (down) to wearing shades at facial boarding (and we debate facial recognition at airports around the world and how we feel about it all). Is the US mobile passport worth it? How to spot you're in a 757: the fierce take off, and interior pieces falling off. Paul has his best flight since we started recording, on Qatar in a Q Suite, and then gets baffled by an epic customer service delight in Doha. What would you do with 28 million, buy the Japanese Air Force One 747 of fly the new ANA seats (with a MASSIVE HUGE SCREEN) continuously for the rest of your life? Stockholm ARN secrets: the underground lake that warms and cools the airport, and the transfer trick between T5 and T2. Betsy is back in a very cool beer can. | Flight 098. Shinkansen Gran Class, Four Seasons Mexico and Popeye Chicken sandwich, are we still an aviation podcast? The Eagle's Nest at LAX. Aer Pluto Lingus. SFO goes stupid with plastic. The 777x decompressed explosively. The 737 MAX is still wingless. Alex gets BA at the top of their game for an almost-diverted flight. NRT gets e-gates and Tokyo will get aircrafts over it (point your finger at HND). Qatar insists on business buses. Norwegian could get WOWd.  WOW is reborn by the way of a Le Carre enigma. Paul finally flies AA, loves the B&O headphones. ANA goes BONX (and Alex goes ANA). Delevingne coffee at Heathrow. AA illogical re-re-refits. We meet listeners, thank you so much everyone (and for your patience!). Extraordinary times in Hong Kong, at HKG and for Cathay. Is Detroit DTW our #1 US airport? A magnificent Livermore Fest. | Flight 097. The TWA hotel is everything we wanted. Long haul narrowbodies, a new old debate. USB-A versus USB-C, a new new debate (we just want good power!). Delta goes all in for good economy food, the US goes all in for the Open Skies (fifth freedoms, please!!). The cool Virgin Pride flight. The not very cool alone-in-the-dark-forgotten-by-Air-Canada experience. The under water 747 (and a few others to dive into, pun intended). The Brussels airport Stella, the 747 Microsoft simulator cockpit (that's one option), the PW2000 engine BBQ. American retires its MD80 and Qantas goes domestic for the end of its 747s. The cheap ERJs and the gone CRJ. What is the S in A321S (not SSSS, that's another story). The new Istanbul has Segway wheelchairs and some surprising live indoor mapping help. Uber chooses Melbourne for its VTOL trials (no FREE-something stupid rebrand) and MEL goes 3 runways (with a wind situation). Singapore extends the A380, but Air France will not (AT ALL). The passing of Continental (this time for good), and the passing of the father of Airbus (what a man, what a legacy!). | Flight 096. Emirates fleet rejigging, 787 trashing, and basic business. The airport Lambo is nicer than the new Air Force One. What's in a name, MAX or no MAX, and other Boeing decisions. IAG steals the Paris Air Show PR. The A321XLR is amongst us. After beers and whisky, BA goes sparkling. What does Embraer actually stands for (it's a fun one). Space Jet gets a mystery sale. Do you need a door in your seats? Qantas retires its 747, pushes the 380 to its end. The Sunrise 4th zone, after the cabin, cockpit and lavatories, it's not a cargo nightclub. The LHR expansion finally revealed (for 2070 surely). A Turkish seat malfunction (the switches are amazing). The bespoke Airbus lettering (made by hand?). Germany blocks Norway (well, a Norwegian 737 MAX, haha). Lufthansa will also price its business seats. SkyTrax announces its 457th awards of the year (Qatar and Singapore are on top). A new way to enjoy Cathay First. The new IST is a big bet but impresses. | Flight 095. EVA bakes pizza. Finnair does whisky. Airbus goes 50. Uber goes NY copter. Alex flies to South Africa, misplaces stuff (angry breakfast and angry lounge shower follow). Paul flies the Q Suite to Singapore, marvels at the Jewel waterfall (rain vortex!). United goes green. AF/KLM goes V plane. Alex survives a chipped E190 with rocky suspensions to Toronto. Paul falls in love with Singapore Airlines (again!) but damages a bin. The future of Changi T5. The A220 becomes enhanced. De Havilland is back. Introducing the MRJ CRJ Space Jet (or something). VIP Terminals. Paul flies EVA, loves the lounge pizza, the rest, well… Alex gets a crush on Toronto. Why YYZ? | Flight 094. Niki Lauda the legend who pushed death aside. Beers and more beers: Betsy makes a come back, BA adds a secret First Class bottled beer, and more on the Speedbird 100 (toilet clog, anyone?). From Nando's to Taco Bell, zeitgeist food in travel (and debating whether there is one or two Michelin star airport restaurants worldwide). BA goes whisky, JetBlue opts for treason (I mean, Pepsi, really?). United goes Spiderman, Avianca and women liveries. Alex flies the SWISS 77W, in 7A (Paul's favorite seat), but gets his wifi gobbled up (and Paul offers a trick to avoid paying for Swiss throne seats, and how to get an F experience on the cheap). None of us get thrown out of a plane (but one stupid passenger did in NZ, good!). Iberia measures your carry-on in augmented reality, and we measure the worst Aeroflot 1492 surviving passenger. Delta tests free wifi for all, no matter the seat back IFE comeback, and MUC tests what AMS already offers, seamless X-ray scanning. Cathay Move Beyond business, and attempts to move beyond a very murky HNA / HK Express situation (Alex wants to never move beyond the HK theme park however). Boeing fails to regain trust, whilst the 737 MAX is still thrustless. Google's superapp, Amazon's supperairport (and flight search!). Qatar reshuffles its fleet (and hates the 340, yay!) and goes Canada whilst Etihad goes Serbia. The South American game, some losers, some winners (a Ryanair of LatAm). Paul flies to a WeChat airport (in the midst of removing paper strips in its tower). The incredible LY001 747 history, along with a record that will never be broken. The TLV security measures, past and present, from VIP to sheruts. | Flight 093. Paul sounds like a robot (sorry, guys), Alex sounds authoritative (he's always right, no?). The BA Speedbird 100 beer (when need Glen to assess it!). Some on-board pop that foams too much (Alex is the worst passenger). On-board food: increasing portions, farm-to-plane, rooftop potatoes. After the on-board food: the toilet to passenger ratio revealed (but also how to cram gold in a lavatory). Don't get too much on-board food: getting weighted to board (do the 7 layers of clothing count?). The future of ISL Ataturk and Mexico's airports (and BER, the Fyre Festival of airports). The tricky category C airports in Europe, Innsbruck, LCY and others that require special training (and specific technologies). The continuing acts of customer experience contritions by BA (afraid of JetBlue maybe?) and United (but it goes only so far). JAL really did name its low cost Zip Air Tokyo (and used Word to create the logo). The best Priority Pass lounges awards. Tons of feedback. And the uncertain future of the Sukhoi Superjet 100, after the sad tragedy. | Flight 092. Alex loves Innsbruck 3000. Paul loves running in CDG 3000. We adore the new TWA infinity edge pool 3000. We love the new United livery 3000. We love tiny airports that behave like big ones, 3000. We love the BA coronation chicken 3000, the best shot haul airplane food in Europe. We love Emirates and Qantas IFE data 3000, and luxury brands love Emirates 3000. We're fascinated by the post Jet Airways Indian market, 3000. We do not love United crew who resell ticket, Emirates First passengers who steal bottles, or Cathay staff who steal cutlery, 3000. We're intrigued by the Japanese low-cost market, 3000, baffled at the Hong Kong Airlines infighting, 3000, and by the Taiwan airline heirs saga, 3000. Lufthansa loves Europe 3000. We're aghast at the Boeing Charleston revelations (3000?). We wish the US3 would actually stop whining, 3000. The new Japan era isn't 3000. United, 3000, Avengers, assemble …what? Yeah, Paul should really stop with those bad Endgame puns in those notes …3000. | Flight 091. Warning, doesn't contain images of any aircraft in distress. BA pizza app delivery to Lagos (so many questions!). Risk of cheese smell upon landing at Moscow DME (does that make immigration go faster?). Virgin Atlantic unveils a half door (but it has nice colors). Paul flies BA First with round buttons (but fix that 789 IFE remote for Pete's sakes!!). Alex bids his Etihad way up (just to be jarred by the backward seating). JetBlue announces the worsts-kept secret in the industry: it's coming to Europe (and we devise their winning strategy for LCY). Flying in style: in-flight bars or lounges (more precisely, being alone or not). The DME Navigator lounge seat Paul and Alex fight over. The New Istanbul looks grandiose (congrats! And thank you for our ever-incredible listeners for the pictures just after opening). Ethiopia overtakes DXB (kinda) and DWC decides to wait for the Heathrow's third runway (kinda again). Grand Stansted Tour hilarious rant. Why is Jet Airways even trying anymore? We can't avoid discussing the 737 MAX. And DEL, well, we'll let you judge… | Flight 090. BA flies to the wrong destination (Ryanair mocks, but did worse) and introduces its shortest hop ever. WOW is gone, Jet Airways is close to be gone, but StarLux goes bold. AMS has a direct view on the luggage delivery system (WHAT?!). Astana is no more (just the name of the city, we recorded 079 just at the right time!). Cathay buys Hong Kong Express (did we call it?). ANA gets its first A380, and a very cute one. The Russia 860-seater double-decker escalator-filled plane that never was (but engineers designed folding wing tips). The Irkut MC-21 flies to compete with the 320/737. Qantas mulls crazy ideas for its ultra long haul flights (but, really, a space to stretch our legs is all we'd hope for). The LHR hawk is so smart (the Singapore stowaway too?). Cool flight deck stories at Delta (family goals!) and JetBlue (PA goals!). More to the 737 story. The RIX airfield that you can't miss. And yes, BA introduce the Club Suite …what do we think?", 'chan_desc': 'We know air travel - the highest rated show on everything air travel.

Some numbers suggest the rate is as high as 70%.

The environment is busier and the communication with air traffic control can be daunting. It’s a transition that we’ve made this past year as our home airport went from a small, non-towered airport to a very busy Class C airport. On Episode 37, we’ll share some of the characteristics of Class C airspace and the requirements of flying into it. Additionally, we’ll cover how with a little planning, preparation and communication skills, you can make flying in a busier environment enjoyable.

The petition says delivery drones will fly autonomously but with one operator for each drone in flight. Eventually, Amazon would like to have one operator for multiple drones "subject to FAA approval based on flights and simulations that demonstrate required levels of safety."The FAA will take public comments on the petition until August 28, 2019.

We\'ve all known that the Aviation Industry has had a history of being an environment that lacks diversity and inclusion. Thankfully, there are organizations out there like "Fly For The Culture" who are trying to change this paradigm and bring about change to our great industry. I\'m so stoked to have Jerome Stanislaus on the show today, from Fly For The Culture, to talk about the change they are bringing about. This change is catching a lot of big support too! We chat about life, Fly For The Culture, Jerome\'s personal beliefs and what it was like to be on National TV with CBS Evening News. Jerome not only loves his craft but he\'s willing to put aside his short term dreams to make sure that others can achieve their dreams in aviation. This is not an episode that you want to miss!--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | Coming in hot with another episode of the #AskTheAvGeek Show! This week on the show I am happy to introduce another DFW native, Mr Brandon Maso to the audience! Lucky for you all, this is Brandon\'s 2nd time on the podcast but 1st as a solo guest. Brandon is bringing a lot of great aviation experience to the podcast today even though he is still so young! Brandon has and still instructs, he\'s flown sim\'s, small jets, Part 135 and now finds himself in the right seat of a Boeing 767 with a Cargo Carrier! Not only does he have a plethora of experience, but he\'s bringing it to us with his entertaining attitude. Brandon is becoming a good friend of mine and an aviator I think you guys will really enjoy hearing from! Like Brandon, make sure your not taking yourself so serious all the time!--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | The podcast is back after a 2 week break but were coming back with a great episode of the #AskTheAvGeek Show. This week on the show I am so happy to have Ian Rodriguez on the podcast! \xa0Ian is with me and we are digging into the topic of what it\'s like living the Flight Instructor life. Ian has had a very interesting path to his CFI/I but he is giving everyone the whole story. Ian is bringing so much truth in this episode! We really dig into some topics that are very important to student aviators when it comes to their work and relationships with CFI\'s. I believe everyone will take something away from his story or his experience and this is one you don\'t want to miss!\xa0--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | After a week off, the #AskTheAvGeek Show is back for another episode! This week we\'re moving to the military side of flying, as I have LTJG Steele Phillips on the show with me today. Steele is a MH-60S Pilot out of Virginia and is laying everything out there for #AvGeekNation on what it takes to become a Naval Aviator. There seems to be a lot of mystery on how people get those coveted Wings of Gold in the military, but Steele is giving everyone the information they need to decide if this is a career for them. \xa0Not only is Steele giving the audience the steps he took, especially through ROTC, he also gives us the other ways you can receive a coveted Naval Aviator slot. It\'s people like Steele that keep our country safe everyday, so I appreciate everything that Steele and his fellow Sailors are doing to keep the United States safe!\xa0--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | So if you\'ve followed the podcast, back in Ep. 027, I spoke with my wife about how one should introduce someone new to aviation. Today, I\'m actually going to go through step-by-step exactly what I do, when I introduce someone to flying. This is such an important topic today as more people are gaining an interest in this industry, primarily driven by the fact that the pilot job market is booming. Doing introductory flights is not about your skills or what you want to do, it\'s about your guests total experience. I want to thank my Pastor Luke Davidson for being an awesome co-pilot and testing me with so many questions during our flight. It\'s an awesome experience introducing somebody new to aviation, but you have to take the right steps to make sure your guests feel as safe and as comfortable as possible...especially if your guest has a wife and 5 kids!!!--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | Welcome back everyone for another weekly episode of the AvGeek Chronicles Podcast!I’m very excited for today’s episode because this is an episode my guests and I have been trying to schedule for a couple weeks now, Thankfully, we are finally making it happen! I am so excited to introduce AvGeek Nation to the Davis Family this week as they join me for a new episode of the #AskTheAvGeek Show. If you’re out there on Instagram and YouTube, you’ll know them formally as The “There By Air” Crew.I absolutely loved having the opportunity to have the Davis’s with me this week and I know all the listeners out there are really going to fall in love with this young family. As soon as I found them, I loved all the fun they were having! Not only are they sharing their passion of aviation with their own little family but they are documenting their travel journeys and bringing us along as for the ride…even if it means it may get a littttttttle windy.\xa0I hope you all enjoy this weeks episode! Don\'t forget to give the new instagram profile a follow which you can find at @avgeekchronicles!--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | After last weeks solo pod, talking about a topic that not all aviators enjoy talking about, I\'ve got another #AskTheAvGeek Show for everyone! This week on the podcast I am happy to introduce #AvGeekNation to Ryan Hunt! Ryan joins me all the way from Georgia. If you\'ve been following the podcast, you\'ll remember that Ryan has a pretty big relation to another #AskTheAvGeek Alum. If you don\'t know what I mean, you\'ll have to listen to today\'s episode. Ryan is a commercial pilot, A&P, warbird pilot, and a member of the AOPA Fly By Crew. Ryan is another young, successful, and accomplished aviator. Ryan epitomizes doing the right thing is always the right thing. What\'s crazy about Ryan\'s story is it share\'s a lot of similarities to my story, but he knew aviation was his calling. Following his families footsteps laid an important foundation for his future. You\'ll always find Ryan at the airport and you\'ll probably see Cayla out there with him flying and advocating for youth in aviation. Ryan is another great addition to the podcast as he shares the same purpose this podcast was built on. Ryan just wants to share his passion with the rest of #AvGeekNation!--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | This week I’m dropping a solo pod and were talking about a topic that every aviator knows very well… how exactly should you pay for Fixed-Wing Flight Training. I recently had a listener send me a DM over on Instagram asking me if I could talk about this topic as he had it on his mind and if I could get some opinions on it. I told him the topic was perfect for the podcast! I took his question and am going to break it into 2 different podcast episodes. This week, we are going to talk about whether you should take out loans for Fixed-Wing Flight School! I’m going to devote this episode to Fixed-Wing Training and I’ll follow up with an episode on Rotorcraft Training. I feel they each deserve an episode because they are so different. I give my opinion and then I bring in the opinions of a few of my past #AskTheAvGeek Show guests. What’s your opinion about this topic?--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | After last weeks group episode of the #AskTheAvGeek Show, I\'m bringing in another new guest this week. This week on the podcast I am happy to introduce #AvGeekNation to Cayla McLeod. Cayla joins us all the way from Georgia. Cayla is the youngest guest featured so far on the podcast but she boasts an already incredible aviation resume! Cayla is a Private Pilot, a member of the AOPA Fly By Crew, Communications Coordinator for Triple Tree Aerodrome, the Liberty Foundation Tour Coordinator, and doing this all while being a student at the University of West Georgia. We all have our stories on how we got into aviation and Cayla\'s story started with Candler Field Museum Youth Aviation Program. If you\'ve seen Cayla on Instagram, you could probably guess that her passions are "Planes and People". She now wants to bridge those passions to help the next generation of pilots accomplish exactly she did. You\'ll always find Cayla and her boyfriend Ryan Hunt out there flying and advocating for youth in aviation. Cayla is another great addition to the podcast and proving once again that it will be the younger generation that keeps pushing the aviation industry forward. In this episode, Cayla shares her passion and energy with all the listeners.\xa0--- Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/avgeekchronicles/support | On this episode I\'m doing something I haven\'t yet done on the podcast.. welcoming 2 guests on 1 episode! I\'m very thankful to have the opportunity to have both Aaron David and Brandon Maso on the show this week for a special edition of the #AskTheAvGeek Show. As you all know I had Aaron on last year as a solo guest on the #AskTheAvGeek Show but this time he came to Dallas/Fort Worth for Type Training, so I couldn\'t help but get him back on the podcast. I\'m also welcoming new comer Brandon Maso to the podcast, as we\'ve become good pilot friends here in DFW. On this episode of the podcast we talk about all the in\'s, out\'s, good, and bad of Type Training and thee whole process. Luckily, Brandon has tackled Type Training from the Cargo side while Aaron is tackling Type Training from the Corporate side. Both their views made for a great podcast episode.

So you can listen to these podcasts in your car, your boat, your plane, and even on your treadmill and you can find the not so straight and level podcast anywhere you listen to podcasts. Just search for not so straight and level. I want to start out this episode by giving a sincere, a nod of appreciation to Todd Simmons, Andrew Simmons, Jim Richmond and Jeff Smith for taking the time to talk about Todd's 2018 accident at Dewey. Moore air strip in Idaho on camera. If you've not seen this video, you need to, the link is in the show notes. It's also in the Supercub update newsletter.  Well, the weather can be kind of frightening when you're in new Holstein. Okay, well it's not all that frightening. We did have a couple pretty good storms when we were there this year. One on Friday night at night and then on Saturday afternoon. Now we know the Saturday afternoon storm hit at least 50 miles an hour because that's what it takes to blow over a porta potty. And we did have one go over. Fortunately it was a fairly newly installed port-a-potty and there was no one in it. The speculation is is that it would require at least 70 miles an hour to blow over a port a potty where it occupied at the time all this wind and all these airplanes tied down led to a lot of discussion about how to tie down airplanes. And there's a good thread that came from the new Holstein event this year on the website. I'll put the link down in the show notes or uh, you can search for it on the website.   All this weather caused us to move the big dinner on Saturday night over to the main hangar. I think we'll continue to do this in the future as it makes it easy for folks coming over from Oshkosh to decide, uh, to come on over as they won't have to drive through a lot of mud or sit through a lot of rain to attend the big dinner on Saturday night.  Many of you already know that a number of years ago new Holstein did a big upgrade, did the terminal and down supercub.org we all got together and raise some money to help put showers in that facility as well so that when we're camping there, we have the luxury of taking showers in the morning. Because of that, we have also over the years tried to help the city with their airport and uh, their outreach to the community. Randy Corfman, many of you know as dr Randy, the flying gynecologist who helps all of us out with our medicals and runs the medical matters forum on the website has really taken a huge role in organizing our relationship with the city and airport days.  He has organized all of the young Eagles flights, the STOL demonstration and the flour drop that we do. On that day. Randy has corralled a large number of volunteers who if I started to try to name them, I would name them. I would certainly miss more than a few but many thanks to all of you that help put on this event. It's sort of in the background. I also want to say many thanks to the pilots that flew young Eagles, the pilots that flew flower drop kids and uh, the pilots that flew in the stole demo, some of you did all three and you should get some sort of medal of honor for doing all of that and we greatly appreciate it. I know Randy appreciates it.\xa0 I want to also, while I'm talking here, say a special shout out to uh, Paul and Dana Osmanski who helped organize new Holstein this year. They did about 95% of the heavy lifting for the organization, the flying and the logistics and uh, hopefully they'll continue to do that in the future. Steve Lewis and Jeff Russell where our fly out chairs again this year and thanks so much to them for doing what they do. Speaking of fly out to, we had some new ones that were kind of fun. We flew up to Jade Bateman's a field, uh, just not too far from Appleton and uh, had our not too far from green Bay and had a wonderful breakfast up there even though the weather wasn't perfect. That was on Saturday. Then we had planned on Saturday afternoon to fly to Kelly's Creamery, a really unique, uh, ice cream parlor where they were going to let us land in their alfalfa field while we couldn't do it on Saturday. We ended up making many trips over there the rest of the week since it's only about 20 miles from new Holstein landing in the field and uh, enjoying some ice cream with the locals.  One of the things that was most fun about this is that on a, I believe it was Monday night or possibly Sunday night, I can't exactly remember when a good group decided to fly over there. Uh, Kelly's Creamery actually announced it on social media beforehand. So when we showed up there were about a hundred people there to see us fly in. Coincidentally, there was a group of pilots there from Thailand who had come up from air venture or come down actually from air venture in a bus to have some of this world famous ice cream. They knew nothing about us flying in there and were they surprised when we did? So we had a great opportunity to talk as with them, which was not easy. And uh, they were especially surprised when some of the pilots flying into that field were women. However, nothing got them more excited that learning that Steve Lewis was a helicopter pilot and one of them shook Steve's hand for at least 25 minutes as all of them took pictures of this pilot from Thailand and Steve Lewis,  We have a lot of volunteers for new hosting flying one in particular. Every year has done great things for the event and all of us for as long as any of us can remember. And that's Ron Sitzman. He provides the sound systems for us. I provides a vehicle to drive around, helps us out with a lot of the other logistical items, puts up the American flag for us every year and uh, greatly appreciate Ron's volunteer and a efforts in this event. He could not even be with us this year yet. He had everything staged for us so that when we arrived it was already and very easy for us to put together and go. So thank you Ron for doing all that you do. We greatly appreciate you. It would also be remiss for me to not mention all of the folks from the city, from the police force to the mayor, Diane Reese and uh, especially though, uh, Perry Welch airport manager who goes out of his way during this event to make all of us very comfortable as well as managed the chaos that happens on airport day. He was an air traffic controller, a janitor, just about any hat you can think of. Perry had heard on at one point during that week. So thank you Perry for all of your efforts.  Another fun thing that happened at new Holstein was Brad Damm from CubCrafters showed up in the NX Cub, which is that new a nose wheel market test aircraft that cubcrafters has produced based on the X Cub. Now it had a really snazzy 393 cubic inch engine in it and boy was that a hoot to fly. Now a lot of people on the internet who have seen the videos of this airplane and seeing all the talk about it have been a poo-pooing it and I can understand that, but I would just say to you, go fly this airplane and then let me know how you feel. It was a whole lot of fun and I do think they have a, there will be a market for a plane like this. So I've watched for it in the future.  So while I was at airport days this year, the only other person that has been to every new hosting flying came up and shook my hand is Si Smith from Janesville, Wisconsin. Many of you know, Si and his sons, James and Matt, all aviators and have all been around new holstein and a lot of other supercub.org events. They base their planes at the Broadhead airport, but uh, it was great to see SI again. He's the only one who's made it to every one of them other than me. Thanks Si. I look forward to seeing you again there next year.  So finally I got off my rear end and moved from our ancient old crotchety web provider to a new slick, fancy snazzy web host. And I had been putting this off for many years and finally got the job done and largely without a hitch, although we have had some complaints of some problems here and there. Many of these are coming from Alaska and many of them are folks that are on MTA online, which it apparently is the largest provider in Alaska, but it seems to be in certain areas there that have some problems with performance connecting to the website since we moved. It's really important to me to know if you're having problems and because we'd certainly like to address them. I'd like to figure out what's going on. We haven't exactly figured out what this problem is in Alaska, but we have narrowed it down to a certain area.  If you're having problems with the website, you can simply reply to the super Cub update email and let me know. Or you can use the contact form on the homepage to send me an email or just email steve@supercup.org so I was flattered to be asked this year to be a part of the Tullahoma AOPA fly-in in their STOL demonstration that they're doing their a myself and of course a number of other pilots will be in the Stol corral in Tullahoma, which is coming up in mid September. If any of you are going to be there and look for me, I'll be around N994CC there and banging around the pattern here and there. So I hope to see some of you folks there.  A lot of you remember the paperwork snafu we had with the Johnson Creek flying this year and at the time this all happened, there was not much we could do about it. The other day I spoke with Dan Connor, who's the airport manager for the Idaho division of aeronautics and there've been some changes that have happened at a aeronautics and they are now working on trying to find a way to make their flying agreement a little more flexible for organizations and groups that want to get together at Johnson Creek. And I believe smiley Creek is one of their other airports. So we don't have the answers yet. We're not sure where they're going. But a number of folks in Idaho are working on this and we look forward to there being some improvements to the way this process of the process of using these airstrips for groups as handled.  Believe it or not, we're just a couple days away from September and that means that we're a month away from the deadline for calendar photos. So the next year is 2020 and so this will be the 2020 calendar.  And one of the things I was thinking about doing here was looking back a little bit with some of that 2020 hindsight. We've had some great calendar submissions over the years and I may slip a few of those in here and there or do a page that is specially dedicated to some of the great cover photos that we've had over the years. This doesn't let you off the hook though. I still need your calendar photos. The link is right on a big banner on the supercub.org homepage. You simply click that and submit your photos. I don't care if you took them with your iPhone or your Android phone or whatever. As long as they have good resolution and it's a good quality photo, it can certainly be in the running to be in the 2020 Supercub calendar.   I hope you will stay tuned for more audio updates, uh, including the series that I call extraordinary adventures of ordinary aviators. It's about everyday pilots going on extraordinary trips or having great going to great destinations and doing great fun things. So I've got one of those coming up in interview this week if I can nail her down. And um, we'll look forward to having an update about that here. Maybe in the next week or two. I hope y'all have a great labor day weekend. Thanks for listening in and we'll talk to you next time. \xa0 | Steve Johnson founder of SuperCub.Org introduces this new aviation podcast.\xa0\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'Host Steve Johnson founder of SuperCub.Org talks aviation and other subjects with all kinds of folks.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/dc/be/1a/dcbe1a1f-020c-e60a-9ab9-9830246ab633/mza_94790066117517092.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-19'}}

Ahead of AviaDev Europe 2019, IATA provided us with a very interesting infographic which you can already check out on our Linkedin showcase page. So with Daniel we discussed facts and figures highlighted in this infographic but also other interesting topics like European single sky, IATA´s initiatives towards decreasing the impact of aviation on climate change and also how IATA – as an airline association can support airports, too. | MIDAS Aviation has been a great supporter of AviaDev and earlier this year we formed AviaDev Consult together, so it´s been a true pleasure to have Deirdre on the podcast. However, the topic we discussed was not that pleasant. We took a close look on the sad news from the beginning of this week: Thomas Cook going into liquidation. Deirdre analysed how big Thomas Cook actually was, which decisions and market circumstances brought them to collapse, which airports will suffer the most and what can we expect next on the market. | Tony Barker is the CEO and owner of Paxport – travel solution company based in Sweden and UK. The team of Paxport will join us in Valencia at AviaDev Europe 2019 and in the interview Tony explained how their business model works, what would be his number one advice for the airlines, what airports can take away from what Paxport delivers to the airlines, and if Paxport is concerned about Brexit. Also, Tony describes what he loves about the analogy of petrol stations vs. airlines/airports. | This time I had a guest with whom I´ve done my first ever podcast interview – Patrick Zeuner, head of airport partnerships at kiwi.com is back on the podcast after more than a year.

With Patrick we discussed how´s the last year been for kiwi.com, what´s their main focus right now and Patrick also shared with me some new exciting projects they are working on. Last but not least, we both work remotely for our companies so we also touched the topic of remote offices. | Within our partnership, we bring a special episode every month with Max Oldorf, CCO of Ch Aviation where we will be discussing interesting stories from the world of European aviation. This is our third joint episode and this time, we feature planned changes in Icelandair´s fleet, future of Thomas Cook Group, airlines with the youngest fleet and a battle that recently started at London Southend Airport. | This is a very special episode recorded on site in the old Terminal 1 at Budapest Airport during a great event Budpaest Airport has organized together with anna.aero for the 7th time – the Budapest Runway Run. After the run we talked to Balazs Bogats, head of airline development here at Budapest Airport about hot aviation news for the Hungarian main gateway. | In this episode we´re talking to Mike Robinson, Aviation Development Director at AviaDev Europe. Mike joined our team earlier this year after spending more than 3 decades in the aviation industry. Mike shares with us his exciting aviation journey and explaining why regional airports are close to his heart. Also, Mike spent 15 days of this summer doing something truly extraordinary which he shares with us too – 179 miles long walk from Exeter to London, in Roman legionary armour and equipment (weighing 40kg), raising money for Parkinsons UK. If you want to support the charity too, you can donate here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/mike-robinson179 \xa0 | Phil Forster is responsible for returning the recently rebranded Teesside International Airport, back to it's former glories.\xa0 In this episode Phil talks to us about the massive opportunities his airport has to position itself as the gateway for an entire region which includes the Tees Valley, Yorkshire Dales and North Yorkshire. | In this episode we´re talking to Jordi Ruiz, Communications Manager at Castellon Airport. Castellon Airport is one of the host sponsors of AviaDev Europe 2019 so Jordi will share with us the story of this airport, its recent successes and also, he will outline what kind of experience delegates can expect this October in Castellon as the gala evening will take place in the wonderful Sala Opal at the Port of Castellon. | In this episode we´re talking to Stanislav Bujnovský, who is now in charge of commercial activities at Ostrava Airport in Czech republic. Stanislav shares with us the story of Ostrava Airport, the challenges they face but also a huge success which they accomplished recently by acquiring a scheduled long haul cargo route.

В нашем подкасте он расскажет, что сподвигло его заняться таким непопулярным и затратным видом спорта, объяснит, чем wingsuit отличается от base jumping, какой самый частый отказ у современных парашютов и какой тренажер в недалеком будущем может стать олимпийским видом спорта.

Но одно недавнее событие, вызвало живой интерес со стороны наших слушателей и подписчиков и дало повод пригласить для разъяснений специалиста, который работает именно в этой птичьей теме. Знакомьтесь, сегодняшний гость нашего подкаста бывший авиационный орнитолог, а ныне дрессировщик птиц Иван Дзюбак. Мы постарались осветить множество разных вопросов, связанных с этой службой. Где учат на орнитолога для аэропорта? Зачем стрелять из пушки по воробьям? Как реагируют птицы на крик умирающей чайки и какая птица настолько умна, что практически никогда не столкнется с самолетом? А также ястреб или сокол, птицы на ПМЖ или «туристы» и многое другое. Разговор получился очень насыщенный и интересный.

Наша сегодняшняя гостья Катя Авдеева расскажет о том, как она стала RAMP-агентом, в чем заключается ее работа, раскроет свои профессиональные секреты и даст ответы на неожиданные вопросы.Подписывайтесь, слушайте и делитесь новыми выпусками со своими друзьями в социальных сетях! \xa0Сайт подкаста https://www.nebonutye-audio.ru | Когда мечта стала реальностью.

A good vision is a story you tell. one that can be backed up with some potential to come true, and conveyed by someone with passion and influence. The Cislunar-1000 is a vision of our future in cislunar space from United Launch Alliance (ULA). It revolves around creating an economy and community with 1000 people between the Earth and the Moon. 1000 people is a number that necessitates a certain type of thinking, technology and systems to support it. It is a shift in mindset in the same way that baking 1 cake is different problem than baking 1000 cakes, or building one bicycle in your garage vs creating a factory to produce thousands of them. Solving the problems that will lead to getting 1000 people in space will have very different demands than our past endeavours. | After two decades of ISS being the only game in town when it comes to space stations, things are finally starting to change. The decommissioning for ISS is in early planning stages now and the progress happening on new replacement stations from NASA and China, and perhaps Russia, as well as privately owned stations are starting to look like they are potentially close to finding a viable market. The future of space stations is looking bright. \xa0 Hi, my name is Matt Warren and I am the host of Moon to Stay, a show dedicated to exploring the moon. \xa0 In 60 years of human space travel fewer than 600 people have been in space. And the maximum number of people who have been there at the same time is 13 - a record set in 1995. \xa0 The good news is that since the ISS has become fully operational we have maintained a continuous presence in earth orbit. The ISS crew complement of between 3 and 6 people has been held since the year 2000. The limiting factor in putting more people up on the space station at the same time has not been the size of the station, but on our ability to have escape vehicle capacity to leave in the case of an emergency. \xa0 The ISS is currently scheduled for end of life in the late 2020s. There have been discussions at NASA about how to do that. \xa0It’s a complicated international investment and different parties may have different ideas for what to do with the modules and equipment they have up there. \xa0 In the case of the Russian modules, rumours are that they are investigating the potential of taking their components off to re-use on a Russian space station. NASA is potentially looking at the possibility of finding a way to off-load the operational aspects of the station to private industry. Certainly de-orbiting the whole thing would be dangerous and seemingly wasteful. \xa0 China meanwhile has quietly already launched 2 short lived experimental space stations and is planning a larger modular Chinese station to call their own. \xa0 NASA and international partners have shifted their focus to the new Gateway station. \xa0A small orbital outpost in heliocentric orbit of the moon - our first attempt at building something outside of Earth orbit. Though not designed to be permanently crewed, Gateway builds on the same modular design principles used for the ISS and will create new obligations to get astronauts out to lunar orbit on a regular basis for the foreseeable future. \xa0 This is I think one of the biggest lessons from operating the ISS for the last 20 years. \xa0A great way at ensuring stable funding over a long time horizon, across multiple changes in governments is to have complex international agreements and sunk costs into the infrastructure that would be a waste to very publically abandon. \xa0 In the private sector, things might finally be approaching a point where lower cost reusable rockets from SpaceX and Blue Origin make a privately owned and operated space station something that has a viable business case. NASA has been advancing a vision of increased private activity in space starting with the successful goal of privatizing the supply rockets to the ISS. Now they are looking into finding ways to make it possible for private industry to operate space stations. \xa0 The best benefit from introducing multiple companies to operate at the same time (rather than picking a single contractor to build something like say - the space shuttle) is that we get diversity of ideas and visions. A variety of rockets to choose from, with different trade offs for cost, payloads, and scheduling. Paying companies for the service, rather than time and materials contracts puts pressure on the supplying company to work on things that can deliver value to more customers than just NASA. They still need to go out and drum up other business to make things work financially. \xa0 When it comes to space stations we need the diversity of ideas more than ever, because there is wide open un-test potential for what to build, and unknown, untapped demand for things we might want to do in space if it was more affordable to do so. \xa0 This is why companies like Bigelow aerospace has attached a test module to the ISS to validate it’s inflatable module technology and prepare for a more ambitious development of an orbital space hotel. \xa0 Axiom space is a private company that likewise has developed conceptual modules for expanding the ISS and building independant space stations. They have proposed a future of expanding and replacing modules over time on ISS, essentially to rebuild it into something new. \xa0 Blue Origin has submitted a proposal for a space station that looks to be based on a New Glenn upper stage. They are in the early stages of discovering the viable business strategy for building space habitats. \xa0 Other companies like - SNC, Space Adventures, SSL/Maxar, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman all have their own visions for what the biggest opportunities are for using a space station be it for science, in space manufacturing, tourism or for servicing other activities in space. \xa0 Space stations are central to the future commercialization of space and part of the bigger picture of expanding human influence out to the moon. We can’t have a human presence in space without a place for humans to stay. \xa0The rockets are coming that will make it more possible than ever to get people up in greater numbers and lower cost. The next challenge will be to build enough places for them to stay and work when they get there. \xa0 Thank you for listening to this episode of Moon to Stay.

Too early, customers aren’t ready, the market doesn’t exist, or the technology isn’t mature enough to work. Too late and someone else has a commanding lead in the market. Timing a startup has to be perfect. The new space economy features many of the same dynamics. There are certainly many brilliant visions for our future in space whose time is not yet here. | When we finally start to get a presence on the moon, one of the things we will do is build habitats and bases. Places to center our activities, to store our stuff, build things, sleep in, to create industries and operate businesses in. etc. What are the options for how to build these places on the moon and what are some of the the variety of strategies we could employ for designing our future habitats on the moon. | show notes: https://mattwarren.co/mts How will we get around on the moon? Mobility is a primary need and it will be important to have a reliable way to move people and things in order to do the science we want to do and collect the resources we need. The Apollo rover had some design innovations, where have we come since then and what does the future look like for lunar surface transportation? The Apollo lunar rover used to drive around on the surface of the moon was a fascinating vehicle who’s history really demonstrates the enginuity and ambition of the engineers of the day. | Show notes: https://mattwarren.co/mts The European Space Agency is championing the idea of creating a base on the moon with similar multinational cooperation as is currently seen on the international space station. Allowing partner nations to contribute their own expertise and interest into the program. Is a moon village doomed to fail or is it the most promising plan for the future of the moon. Let’s find out. In 2016 ESA director Johann-Dietrich Wörner unveiled this vision. The idea is to build on the existing international relationships, partnerships and processes used for the ISS - the largest and most successful international project in human history. And to extend it to a new international endeavor on the lunar surface. Like the ISS, companies and countries can join and contribute to the project in their own way, leveraging their own unique expertise and aligning with their own goals. It is certainly a laudable goal, and the prospect of sharing the costs across more than a hundred organizations and governments has some real benefits. | The moon’s gravity would make some sports infeasible, others would be more entertaining, and it would open the doors for new kinds of games we could create. One thing for certain, broadcasting the first lunar sports on ESPN would attract a lot of eyeballs. | The Moon Race is an effort to reignite people’s interest in space again. It will drive the development of several key technologies which haven’t gotten the attention we need for a sustainable moon settlement.. Airbus and a collection of international partners have created a series of goals and prizes focused on developing some of the missing pieces. Airbus has partnered with Jeff Bezo’s Blue Origin, the Mexican space agency, the European Space Agency and Vinci the international construction company to form a new non-profit organization called “The Moon Race” They are giving a new slant to the prize incentive concept that was rebooted by the X Prize foundation a decade ago. | In the world of Aerospace, aluminum is perhaps the most used material. It has some great properties that make a lot of sense for building things that need to fly. First and foremost is the weight. Aluminum is lightweight which makes it more efficient for something that you are going to have to accelerate and decelerate and lift into the air. Every kilogram added to a vehicle, removes a kg of potential payload, so making rockets and planes with aluminum is better than steel in that regard. Aluminum is also stable, it doesn’t rust like iron, or explode like sodium metal. It is rigid and strong unlike lithium or gold. All in all, Great properties to have for building things with. With more than 100 years now of experience building things with aluminum for aerospace, it’s also a material we understand quite a lot about. There are well understood alloys of aluminum that can be referenced easily by engineers and acquired very cheaply. | NASA’s new goal of getting astronauts to the south pole of the moon in 2024 comes at the same time as NASA is fighting to maintain it’s shrinking budget before congress. It was in this proposed budget that NASA had actually scaled back it’s investment in the SLS rocket system capable of reaching the moon due to slipping timelines on the part of Boeing and sub-contractors to deliver a working rocket. It doesn’t look like there will be a bold budget to match the bold demands that the white house is placing on NASA. Instead, most of the money will likely to come from cutting costs. \xa0 This goal puts everything on the table and will probably force some difficult decisions, and even tougher arguments. The plan was to build the Gateway station which orbits the moon, establish gateway as a base of operations and then proceed to the lunar surface for missions. 5 years isn’t enough time to build the full gateway first so something will have to give. To further complicate the matter are the international partnerships - Canada has publically commited to being a partner on the Gateway, JAXA, Roscosmos, and ESA have also designed modules that will be part of the station. Should NASA be forced to change the timelines or even re-think the whole station itself in light of it’s new goals that would create some backlash from international partners already invested into the Gateway concept.', 'chan_desc': 'There is a race to get back to the moon.
