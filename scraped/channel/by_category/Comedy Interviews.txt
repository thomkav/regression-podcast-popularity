We walk through a few different performances of the joke, specifically from her album Good One (ha), her appearance on Conan, and a small, little-known indie podcast called This American Life.What was originally a 30 minute joke was whittled down to half that length for the album, with various encounters with Taylor Dayne (all of them true) shuffled in and out.Also included: Tig presses Jesse regarding the cuteness of her children.Follow Tig on Instagram.This episode originally aired on March 19, 2017. | In Jesse\'s first "holy shit, I\'m interviewing this person" interview, "Weird Al" Yankovic explains what went into his song "Word Crimes" from his 2014 album Mandatory Fun.Based on Robin Thicke\'s multiplatinum, misogynistic club theme "Blurred Lines", Al\'s parody goes the educational route and confronts the multitude of offenses committed against proper grammar and syntax. In true Good One fashion, Jesse breaks down "Word Crimes" to the syllable, having Al walk him through brainstorming the concept, navigating communication with Thicke\'s camp, and ultimately recording and releasing the parody.Also included: all of the parody ideas Al went through before landing on "Word Crimes".Follow Al on Twitter.Listen to "Weird Al" wherever you get music.Apple MusicSpotifyGoogle PlayThis episode originally aired on March 5, 2017. | Haven\'t bothered to check out the Good One back catalogue yet? Well, don\'t worry. We\'re digging out the classics to bring to you while you wait for our next season. In this proto-episode of Good One, hear the interview with Jerry Seinfeld that inspired this whole show. Recorded live at Vulturefest in 2015, Jesse was given the opportunity to interview Jerry in front of a live audience. The conversation is based around a clip from Jerry\'s series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee (now on Netflix), but quickly branches out to include Jerry\'s history with his Seinfeld costars, his past and present material, and even the his feelings on filming a new special--something that wouldn\'t happen until two years later in 2017.Also included: Jerry really, really doesn\'t want to use a mic for Q&A.Follow Jerry on Twitter.This episode originally aired on May 14, 2017. | In the Season 6 finale of Good One, we finally deconstruct the legendary joke "The Aristocrats" with the help of its most infamous teller, Gilbert Gottfried.This one\'s marked explicit for a reason, folks.You\'ll hear Gilbert\'s personal history with the joke, along with his retelling of his set the night of the Hugh Hefner roast, where he launched this joke into the public eye. Jesse asks Gilbert about the evolution of his onstage persona and his relationship with audiences.Also included: Jesse\'s Bubbe\'s favorite joke, and Gilbert\'s shortest version of "The Aristocrats".Follow Gilbert on Twitter and listen to Gilbert Gottfried\'s Amazing Colossal Podcast wherever you listen to your podcasts. | Nate Bargatze is one of the the few comedians whose funniness Jesse couldn\'t fully put his finger on. He wrote about Nate\'s Dead Horse joke in April 2018 after Nate performed a shortened version of it on Jimmy Fallon. It was an atypical joke for late night not only because of the length of the joke, but because it was a story about an actual dead horse. But Nate pulled it off, and he pulled it off again in his 2019 Netflix special The Tennessee Kid.Nate talks to Jesse about how he balances punchlines with a conversational joke-telling style, and what actually happened to make him want to turn a dead horse into a joke. They also touch on Nate\'s father being a clown and magician, and how that upbringing gave Nate the specific ability to make extraordinary and fantastic parts of life seem...regular.Also included: Nate\'s best heckler.Follow Nate on Twitter. | Whitney Cummings released her latest stand-up special Can I Touch It? on July 30, 2019. Its title can be read a few different ways, one of which being a question of what is and isn\'t ok for comedians to joke about.Jesse talks to to Whitney about tackling sensitive topics in her act, and how it relates to #metoo and feminism. Whitney reflects on past jokes and behaviors, and how it makes sense at this point in her career to be self-critical.The conversation also focuses on her rigorous daily writing process, in which she spends hours researching topics to determine what\'s already been said about it. Also included: Whitney picks her favorite roast jokes--by her and about her.Follow Whitney on Twitter and watch Can I Touch It? on Netflix. | Danny McBride walks Jesse through the opening scene of his new HBO series The Righteous Gemstones. Along the way, they also touch on the first scenes of his other series and films, including Eastbound & Down, The Foot Fist Way, and Vice Principals.Danny talks about where he wanted to go after Vice Principals ended, as well as the research that went into creating a show about Christian megachurches and superstar preachers. Jesse also asks Danny about how he constructs his antiheroes, and the different ways he utilizes the writers rooms on each of his projects.Also included: dick symbolism.The Righteous Gemstones premieres August 18th on HBO.Follow Danny on Instagram. | This week we\'re looking at the greatest joke of all: death. More specifically, the twenty-two deaths that occur over the course of the Netflix series Russian Doll.Jesse talks to Leslye Headland, the show\'s co-creator, writer and director, about the protagonist Nadia\'s (Natasha Lyonne) journey episode-by-episode, and the significance behind each death she experiences. The show uses death to explore overcoming trauma and self-destructive behaviors under a deeply dark yet comedic veil.Just a heads-up, this episode\'s going to spoil the entire plot of the show. So if you haven\'t seen it yet, we\'re recommending you go watch the show now.Also included: Natasha Lyonne says "cockroach" funny.Follow Leslye on social media.You can watch Vulture\'s supercut of all of Russian Doll\'s death scenes here.Watch Russian Doll on Netflix. | Jesse speaks to Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, the creators and co-writers of the tv-show The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.Despite the titular Mrs. Maisel being a fictional comedian, Jesse wants to know where she might draw her material from, and how she might write and perform comedy within the context of the show. Jesse asks Amy and Daniel about Mrs. Maisel\'s creation, and how they go about writing and pulling off a realistic standup performance.Also included: the parallels between Mrs. Maisel and Breaking Bad.Watch The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel on Prime Video. | Comedian, writer and actor Emily Heller talks to Jesse about a joke from both her album Pasta and her Comedy Central standup special Ice Thickeners. Despite being recorded about six months apart, her delivery and wording is almost exactly the same in each version.Jesse and Emily go over her meticulousness and handling of tropes, as well as the writing retreats she employs to develop new material.

El comandante de la Brea, Kefrén Velázquez, fue el súper invitado especial de Siempre es Lunes Live: Primer Aniversario y se encargó de poner los huevos a peso. Cuando ya nos habíamos dado par de palos y la lengua estaba más pesada, Kefren nos hizo contestar preguntas frente a la Gentuza celebrando el primer aniversario en vivo. Hubo bailes sensuales, lágrimas y muchas mandás pa’l carajo. | Terminamos el mes celebrando nuestro primer año compartiendo con la Gentuza en vivo desde Restaurante Latidos en Santurce, Puerto Rico. Fue una noche de imprudencias, vergüenzas en público y mucho alcohol. La Tormenta Karen nos asustó, el temblor nos hizo cambiar de ropa interior casi tanto como Gigi hace retumbar las redes sociales, Willie Colón contra todos, y la lloradera reguetonera contra los Latin Grammy. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | Nos fuimos en brote con tres horas hablando bazofia pero, no importa porque our content is gooood. La gente estuvo muy intensa esta semana; el tipo que se metió por la ventana, Tempo abandonando su guagua, Arcangel por poco vuela alto, Kany vs Gigi, y Canovanas recordándonos el caso del Cerro Maravilla. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | Si el calor puñetero de estos días no te ha derretido, acompáñanos a hablar mierda. Esta semana todos fuimos fiscales y abogados con las vistas del caso de Arellys, hay un nuevo ángulo en el caso de Kevin Fret, llega una nueva superhéroe a tubazo limpio, Lugaro no se la deja montar en vivo, Doña Gigi viaja a Washington, y Capitán America “janguea” con J-Go, entre par de bazofias más. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | La semana estuvo intensa, entre los asaltos a choferes de Uber, la revolución estadista, La Taína vs Dimary Castro, y las veganas defendiendo la virginidad de las gallinas, por poco nos quedamos hablando hasta el martes; pero nos mantuvimos firmes como la papada de Ray Reyes. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | Si otra gente puede celebrar su cumpleaños un mes entero pues, ¡nosotros también! ¡Que se joda! Aunque los boricuas en Puerto Rico se libraron de Dorian, no dejamos de hacer el ridículo y por supuesto que nos los tripiamos, casi tanto como Donald Trump nos tripea con sus tuits. Los empleados de Cadillac Uniforms pelean por lo suyo, igual que Julian Gil por su hijo, y un pezón de la Burbu provocó la furia justiciera en Instagram. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | Gentuza, esto se acabó. Este debería ser el último episodio porque, ¿a dónde subimos después de esto? ¿Qué más queremos de la vida? Estuvimos jangueando con la leyenda Luisito Vigoreaux, hablando pestes del prójimo, haciéndole preguntas imprudentes de su vida, y dándole al hígado sin piedad. Es un milagro que esto pudo subir. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | Las iguanas son tan malas que cuando se desaparece la playa de Ocean Park las desgraciadas se mudan a la Florida. De eso y par de cosas más hablamos esta semana, con la ayuda de la cantautora Natalia Lugo y el comediante José “Titito” Sánchez. Fue un episodio sufriendo calenturas ajenas; desde videos porno amateurs, hasta Katy Perry y Domingo no tan Plácido tocando gente sin permiso. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | Alexis Sebastián y Exnier regresaron para asistirnos en la noble obra de hablar pestes de los demás. Entre el vertedero que dejó Ricky Rosselló, el quickie de Pierluisi, la nueva Gobernadora, la descarga de Coscu, el papelón de Rubén Sánchez, y la aparente nueva carrera de Indy Flow, hay mucho que cubrir. Redes sociales: Tío Macetaminofen Marisol Guzabra El George Siempre es Lunes | ¿Volvemos a la normalidad? ¿O seguimos? Como quiera, el pelú influencer abiertamente gay, Oscar Navarro, visitó la madriguera para ayudarnos hablar bazofia del decepcionante segundo chat, los que dejaron botellas abandonadas, los pro-Ricky defendiendo su gobernador “elesto”, Beatriz Rosselló despidiéndose como buena guerrillera, la nueva estrella tuitera Tommy Torres, y mucho más.

We also come to the conclusion that the person who most needs to wait tables for one day is Trump, which could be a great career option for him after he gets fired from being the president. | We get right back into our discussion of the "man-tality" behind "family friendly" chains like Twin Peaks and Hooters after last week\'s titillating exploration of the role of Playboy Bunnies serving food and drink. The gals discuss some recent taco related injuries and enjoy the heck out of your Server Submitted Stories! Then, we invite former counter server and revered Los Angeles food writer and critic Katherine Spiers of Smart Mouth Podcast to talk about the insanity of bakers, the glory days of food criticism and as a server how to keep it cool when someone is reviewing your establishment. | We are back with a two-parter, a deep dive, a true exploration of America\'s favorite pastime: eatin\' a steak while lookin\' at tits. In this episode we talk about the dawn of The Playboy Club in 1963 and the "iconic" look of the food and cocktail servers - Bunnies. We learn that Gloria Steinem went deep cover as a Bunny to do a journalistic expose\' and inform the public about the work uniform that caused bleeding, chafing, and internal organ crushing.

Why does this final step of service seem to be so hard for customers and servers alike? Why can\'t anyone do math? Why can\'t someone just be a hero and put down a credit card for the table? UGH. We read your always hilarious and infuriating Server Submitted Stories and then our pal Georgia Hardstark drops by the pod den to talk about her decorated career in the service industry and her time as a lunch lady! | Today we talk voluntary torture: DOUBLES, and discuss the logic behind agreeing to live in the restaurant from morning to night.

Join us as we discuss the events that took place, the conspiracies involved, and theories on who the heck this man is and where in the world he could be!\xa0 After learning of the Voynich Manuscript, The Somerton Man, and the DB Cooper case... it\'s safe to say that the world we live in truly is WEIRD. \xa0 \xa0 | I\'ve got that Somerton, Somerton Sadness! Hi weirdos! Welcome to YET ANOTHER Unsolved Mystery!\xa0 These are some of our favorite episodes and FOR GOOD REASON because jeez oh man these cases just keep getting weirder and weirder. Last week we discussed the Voynich Manuscript and you\'ll get a little bonus Voynich theory at the beginning of this episode.\xa0 This week Lauren is bringing us one of our all time favorite mysteries; the case of the Somerton Man (aka Tamam Shud.) Picture this... a guy found dead on the beach in 1948.\xa0 No ID. No apparent cause of death.\xa0 And in his pocket is a strange note that just says "Tamam Shud." And now imagine... that this is the LEAST CRAZY THING ABOUT THIS CASE!!\xa0 Join us as Lauren takes us through the days of the investigation, the theories as to what may have went down, and even some RECENT UPDATES in one of the strangest mysteries in history. Join us next week for our final mystery... which is... ALSO a mystery.\xa0 Follow us on social media @keepitweirdcast to get clues to our next episode!\xa0 \xa0 | Uh oh, weirdos. It\'s time to solve a mystery.\xa0 Solve a mystery from history. A historical mystorical. Ashley and Lauren were joined by comedian and writer Hanna Bowens for another edition of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES!! We had so much information on each of our stories that one recording session turned into THREE EPISODES!! That\'s right, prepare to scratch your noggins because you\'ve got three weeks of conundrums. This week Ashley is bringing you an hours worth of notes on the VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT!\xa0 This 600+ year old book is written in an unknown language and no one knows who wrote it.\xa0 After carbon dating, protein testing, and the scouring of historical documents; the more we learn about the manuscript the more confusing it becomes. Head over to our Facebook page to see all of the artworks we reference towards the end of the episode. If you or anyone you know has any information on Mr. Voynich and his prized manuscript... call the number on your screen now. \xa0 | Hi Weirdos!!\xa0 Welcome to another edition of LISTENER GHOST STORIES!\xa0 The spookiest episodes in town! Listener Ghost Stories/Strange Tales/Real Life Spooky Stories are the episodes in which Lauren and Ashley read real life stories SENT IN BY YOU!\xa0 This week we run the gamut of emotions; we get scared, our hearts swell up, we get nervous, and yes... we even cry. From the grandpas we miss dearly to the intruders in our homes.\xa0 From the most unique place to see a ghost to the places that make you say "Duh, this place is obvi haunted." From the soldiers in Vietnam to truckers on the highway; this episode truly has it all. So tuck those toesies under the blanket so the monster can\'t chew them off and prepare to get scared. \xa0 WARNING: Listener Ghost Stories episodes include sound effects and music.\xa0 Sometimes they can be jarring. | Welcome Weirdos, one and all! This is PART TWO of our Personality Disorder episode!\xa0 Ashley and Lauren are joined once again by stand-up comedian Justin Foster to chat about mental health disorders! Last week Ashley taught us about Schizotypal and Paranoid Personality Disorder and this week Justin is teaching us all about Antisocial Personality Disorder AKA SOCIOPATHS!\xa0 Sociopaths are incredibly fascinating for many reasons; one of which is their association to a large number of famous serial killers. Lauren is discussing the very controversial topic of Dissociative Personality Disorder AKA MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES!\xa0 We ask all the important questions: What causes it? Where do these personalities come from?\xa0 Where does the host go?\xa0 Can you treat it? And even: Does it exist? In this episode we talk about some very sensitive disorders, discuss brutal and disturbing cases, and try to show you the ways in which people with severe personality disorders can still live a very fulfilling and "normal" life.\xa0\xa0 But remember, weirdos.\xa0 Theres no such thing as normal... | Hi Weirdos! Welcome to our very first mental health episode!\xa0 We\'ve always wanted to dive into psychology & mental health and our hilarious guest, stand up comedian Justin Foster was itching to discuss sociopaths so we jumped at the opportunity to discuss PERSONALITY DISORDERS!  This is an episode we\'ve always been interested in, but extra cautious to record. There are a lot of stigmas involved in mental disorders and chatting about them on a show dedicated to all things "weird" was something we had to be very cognizant of.\xa0 The three of us all have experiences with psychological disorders and it was really special to be able to sit down and discuss them, alongside personality disorders this week! In part one we are talking about Schizotypal personality disorder (STPD) and Paranoid personality disorder (PPD.) The history of the disorder, the symptoms, the treatments, and even some cases where the disorder took over and things went a little too far. Next week Justin will be telling us about sociopaths and Lauren will be getting into the controversial topic of Dissociative Disorder (multiple personalities.) \xa0 This episode was sponsored by FabFitFun! #fabfitfunpartner \xa0 Middle Child:  https://www.soundcloud.com/MiddleChil...  https://www.facebook.com/middlechildm...  https://www.twitter.com/middlechilddan  https://www.instagram.com/middlechild... https://www.youtube.com/middlechildmu... \xa0 S E S H:  https://www.facebook.com/zachodonnell...  https://www.instagram.com/zodonnell/  https://twitter.com/seshcurry  https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Cyk8..  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...

Last week Billy taught us everything we could possibly know about werewolves and we were in RARE form, let me tell you.\xa0 Maybe it was a full moon? This week we\'re taking it a little more seriously, Ashley is going to be talking all about werewolves in pop culture and the different ways that lycanthropy is represented in film and television!\xa0 Werewolves have always been a great way to mirror society and some of the issues we don\'t feel comfortable talking about.\xa0 From sexual orientation, puberty, race, and even STDs!

Billy and Ashley are joined by their hype man, Handsome Joe (aka DJ Jazzy Joe) as Billy teaches us all about where the legends began, the different versions of lore from around the world, lycanthropy as a disease, how to kill a werewolf, how to *become* a werewolf, and so much more.

In the meantime... oil your sticks. | Welcome, weirdos, to part TWO of our TIME TRAVEL episode!

This week is all about theoretical science.\xa0 Ashley is going to be teaching the crew about Time Paradoxes and the different things that would and wouldn\'t be possible when it came through traveling through time.\xa0 Most importantly, the things we\'d have to worry about if time travel were possible. And as for our guest this week- we are joined once again by Madigan Haggerty of\xa0 Your Angry Neighborhood Feminist (podcast) and she ventured to the darkest corners of the world wide web to find some REAL (?) life time travelers to learn their stories!\xa0 Have a blast, y\'all.\xa0 And make sure you grab your towel!\xa0 | Great Scott, Weirdos!

Vaev tissues claimed to get you sick today, so you\'d be inoculated later. And people were willing to pay big bucks for these chic snot rags.The viral success of this fake health product (akin to Goop and Raw Water) lead to a Comedy Central digital show called Control Room, where Leeper plans to devise future commentary on why we\'re so gullible online.

Some see it as a way to turn found time into easy spending money. Others view it as crowd-sourced slave labor. \xa0While the majority of Mechanical Turk workers make very little money doing repetitive tasks like identifying images or taking surveys (and often give up on the platform entirely), there are some who have optimized the process to actually generate decent incomes. By studying the time-to-pay ratios of certain tasks and using basic tech tools to filter through millions of tiny jobs constantly posted to mTurk, so-called "Alpha Turkers" can turn small pockets of spare time into $200-$500 a week, which isn\'t bad if you also have a full-time income. \xa0Alli and Jen talk to Mike Naab, a longtime mTurker who makes decent money from the platform, and wrote the ebook Side Hustle From Home: How To Make Money Online With Amazon Mechanical Turk to help others do the same. Naab shares his tips, tricks, tools, and philosophies about mTurk, how he\'s leveraged it to his advantage, and why it\'s probably not for everyone.

And dating or marrying across countries comes with a huge list of expenses and immigration headaches. While people from different countries meet and fall in love all the time, why would anyone seek out a relationship with these complications from the start?The "mail order bride" concept has been around for centuries, and the modern equivalent are dating apps that facilitate specific international relationships: ColumbianCupid, JamaicanDating, ChinaLoveCupid.\xa0 There\'s even a hit reality TV show called 90 Day Fiancé that has brought these apps into the zeitgeist. But as journalist Paul Schrodt discovered, while people sign up for these apps under a variety of circumstances, there is a prevailing theme: white American men of means connecting with attractive women from economically disadvantaged countries.So, are these apps about fetishizing ethnicity and forming transnational relationships? Or is there something deeper to be gleaned from the successful marriages born of international dating apps? Alli and Jen talk to Schrodt about his experience using the apps and connecting with single men and women from around the globe.Read Schrodt\'s piece in GQ here: https://www.gq.com/story/90-day-fiance-international-dating-appsSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1PJoin us on Discord: discord.gg/2g1pEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.comTalk to Alli and Jen:https://twitter.com/alligoldhttps://twitter.com/joonbuggerCall the show and leave a message!

Could the fact that her husband was very recently a high-ranking Disney executive have anything to do with her success?\xa0Having read Girl, Wash Your Face, Molly has her own questions about Hollis’s originality, and we highlight some of the more absurd passages from Hollis’s bestseller, peering into the mind of a self-proclaimed “level-5 book nerd.” But first we hear from her fans, and learn just what it is that makes her brand of "you go girl" so appealing.\xa0Listen to the end to hear from Rachel and just what she has to say about showing the "Tylers" of the world your boobs.\xa0\xa0SOURCES:\xa0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZpVspIBqyPr0cTAl2bVyURMESA_9qJeV2ZUW1_DpPs/edit?usp=sharingSupport the show | How much would you pay for a Reese\'s Pieces package, half-eaten by Charles Manson during a prison visit in 2002? What about Ed Gein\'s scalpel? Do you have a spot on your wall where you would hang a painting of Pogo the Clown by John Wayne Gacy, the Killer Clown himself?\xa0We hope that by the end of this disturbing episode your answer will be a resounding, “No thank you – my collection of Beanie Babies will suffice.” In this episode, we discuss Andy Kahan and his quest to stop killers from profiting from their hideous acts of violence and resulting notoriety. We go over which killers are the top sellers and why, as well as why Son of Sam Laws haven’t historically held up in the Supreme Court.\xa0Side note: In this episode, Molly refers to Sharon Tate as Manson’s “main victim,” when she meant that she was his most famous and talked-about victim. We don\'t want to diminish the murders of Voytek Frykowski, Steven Parent, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Steve Parent, Gary Hinman, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.

Then we cover our favorite scandal of all — our own. We got a lot of angry backlash on Twitter and in the "My Favorite Dumpster Fire" Facebook group after we put out our episode covering the My Favorite Murder hosts and fandom. We talk about what the critics got right, but not without offering a few critiques of our own.\xa0 | From her humble beginnings as a boring hotel heiress, Paris Hilton has always known how to seal the deal. This season has featured a lot of baby-voiced celebrities, and we\'re closing the curtains with the woman who perfected the art. According to Nicky Hilton, Paris learned early that a super-soft voice meant that you could always get what you want from men — even if what you wanted was a doll house full of gerbils. She\'s given us a line of perfumes that defined the smell of the early 2000s, and, arguably, invented the Kardashians (remember when Kim was a humble closet organizer on "The Simple Life"?) We review the legal drama behind her sex tape, the questionable ethics of watching it, and the sad, sad life of her former lover and poker champion Rick Salomon.\xa0Sources:\xa0Kim and Paris Timeline:https://www.bustle.com/p/this-kim-kardashian-paris-hilton-timeline-explains-everything-about-their-tumultuous-friendship-8271056DJ Hilton in Ibiza:\xa0http://time.com/4964680/dj-paris-hilton-ibiza/Rick Salomon/ Sex tape:\xa0https://people.com/celebrity/pamela-anderson-weds-rick-salomon/https://www.businessinsider.com/paris-hilton-opens-up-about-her-infamous-sex-tape-leak-2018-4Fragrances:\xa0https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/53nvp3/paris-hilton-profile-2015-19-fragrances-and-counting-heiressIvanka and Paris friendship:https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-ivanka-trump-was-a-kardashianEarly Paris:\xa0https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2000/09/hiltons200009 | In what sense is Dr Phil a Doctor?

Lynne Spears liking #FreeBritney posts makes it seem like much more than a rumor, and after looking at a couple of other cases of conservatorship, we\'re convinced that something is not right. Besides the conservatorships of stars like Zsa Zsa Gabor and Amanda Bynes, we\'re also trying to figure out just who the hell Sam Lufti is and how his mismanagement affects Britney to this very day. This is the episode that made us realize we don\'t want to be famous, but we do want to be part of the SWAT team that airlifts Britney out of LA. | Brittany Murphy\'s untimely death at 32 left Hollywood rattled. Had the Clueless star finally succumbed to a suspected drug addiction? Or did her creepy husband (who didn\'t want an autopsy) have something to do with it? Her mother blamed toxic mold, while husband Simon Monjack suspected her failure to get a part in Happy Feet 2 had broken her spirit. Her estranged father swooped in with an even more unlikely theory that involved the Department of Homeland Security – and yet, it\'s the theory that has one of the Yeah No Yeah hosts totally convinced. Kelsey Lawrence, founder of Very Famous Magazine and pop culture savant, joins us to sort the tabloid rumor from the hard evidence. | Mike Boudet is the true crime enthusiast behind the massive hit podcast Sword and Scale. Fans love his take-no-prisoners style and raw, uncut audio from interrogations and real-life horror. His detractors say he\'s a doxxer, a misogynist, and an all-around creep. Meanwhile, Mike styles himself as edgy, persecuted, and a crusader for free speech.

I recently sat down with Aug to discuss his careers as a musician, author, and comic. Along the way we touch upon Van Halen, overcoming introversion to become a world-class performer, Chinese astrology, and, of course, the birth of Young Southpaw.

That’s because it features an in-depth conversation with comedian Frank Murgalo. Before being a comic, Frank was a Marine, a copier salesman, owned a staffing agency, and was a financial advisor—and those are only the jobs we know about. I asked Frank how he got into stand-up comedy and I think he only answers it after speaking with me for an hour, because his life before stand-up was so very interesting. Listen in as we discuss how Frank lost\xa012lbs in one day during basic training, how he became a master of making bigger rocks into smaller rocks, and how Mad Men wasn’t very far off when it came to certain elements of client service, but these are all his stories to tell so listen in and hear them all. For all you comedians out there, Frank books a paid bringer show at Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, CT on Thursday nights and as of now he’s still looking for some comics for September 12th. The show is hosted by the one and only Pat Oats who is a tremendous comic and very generous with his time and advice so get some stage time, a few bucks in your pocket, and some mentorship.

It worked wonderfully for a while, until it didn’t. At the age of 33, Karen faced an undiagnosed illness—she didn\'t know what to call it, and neither did a team of five doctors.\xa0This forced Karen to reimagine what success means, and at that time success meant getting healthy. When things were asked of her, Karen would pause and ask herself, will this help me achieve my goal? She realized that she could no longer say yes to everything and this her filter changed her life. Eventually Karen was properly diagnosed, and while her health returned she didn’t abandon her newfound philosophy—instead, she continued to be more selective about the projects she took on and learned how to work through others and lead others more effectively to get work done. Her story was so powerful that she was encouraged to speak about it publicly and that led to someone encouraging her to capturing it in book form. In Success with Less Karen provides the guidance that we all need to get through the crossroads we all face. For our career, our relationships, our health and our life: what we really need is less than what we imagine. And we won\'t find what\'s missing by striving, racing, acquiring and struggling. That\'s because what we need is inside of us, right now, and this book shows us how to find it.

He started his own company and serves as an independent marketing research consultant to many leading global corporations. He’s also an avid runner and said goodbye to his running shoes as a way to reduce pain in his hip and back. Not only did the pain go away, but he gained wonderful insights while he ran. In Connections in the Raw: Musings of a Barefoot Runner, Kevin chronicles stories and insights from years of barefoot running. He shares his perspective that deep connections exist in our lives between us and the Creator, other people, and with nature, and that we all have access to wisdom that is rewarded to all who will listen.\xa0 When he’s not out for a run or working with a client, Kevin spends his time trying to make the world a better place. He is passionate about education reform, specifically in underserved communities. He has sat on the boards of various schools and spends most Friday mornings reading to third- and fourth-graders at a school near his home in Norwalk, Connecticut because he believes nothing keeps one grounded like visiting schools and interacting with young people. He has been a vegetarian for over three decades and loves reading, martial arts, sports, and the theater. He is active in his church where he facilitates a Bible study group and teaches Sunday school. Kevin is married to his wonderful, giving wife who is a marriage and family therapist, and they have three adult children, who occasionally go for a run with him—wearing shoes. | Zaida Alfaro is the youngest of six children and was born into art. Her mother is a painter, composer, and musician who taught Zaida how to play the piano at the age of twelve.\xa0 She became a professional musician at eighteen and, having been burned by a bad recording contract, is now an independent recording artist and performer. As a lover of cozy mysteries, Zaida decided to take her musical experiences and put them on paper. The result is The Last Note: A Miami Music Mystery. In this first novel she combines her background as a musician, her love of her hometown of Miami, and her Cuban culture to spin a tale of music and murder. In this interview we discuss her early influences as a singer and songwriter, the importance of having faith and support during the writing process, and how perseverance led to her earning a publishing contract with Cozy Cat Press.

Matt Pavia, his son,\xa0teaches English and American studies at Darien High School in Connecticut. Together, they collaborated on a book telling the stories of Vietnam Veterans who were from the town of Stamford, Connecticut. After thousands of hours of research and hundreds of hours of in-depth-interviews with Veterans or, in some cases, relatives and friends of those who died in the war, Tony and Matt conclude that these veterans have often been portrayed in an unfair way through both pop culture and the media. This is not a book of war stories, but one that shows a generation that is much more accomplished than what most give them credit for. Listen in as we discuss Tony’s personal memories of that period of time including what life was like as a teenager during such a time of cultural change. Matt does a great job explaining how they went about conducting the research for the book as well as the challenges they both faced when cold-calling Veterans and convincing them to share their experiences for the book. What was most fascinating to me about this conversation was hearing how their perceptions of this war and the veterans who served in it were changed as a result of writing this book. Tony and Matt’s book can be purchased by clicking here, and while it focuses on the lives of Veterans from one small but diverse part of Connecticut, the stories you will read about can be applicable to Vietnam veterans from Anytown USA.\xa0 Happy listening.', 'chan_desc': 'The Uncorking a Story podcast features conversations established as well as up and coming comics and authors.

They want an athletic program.Of course we can’t please everybody but decided that perhaps we should enter the world of big-time college sports. So meet Don Silleman, our newly appointed Director of Athletics (AD for short)s. We offered a pretty impressive compensation package to lure Don to our campus. He couldn’t resist and took early retirement from his old job in Greenville to come on board.You’ll meet Don in this episode and hear some of his early plans for our athletic program. And of course one of those will be to start a football program right out of the gate. And we are not talking about playing any rinky-dink junior college or even youth league. Don wants us to aim high so we plan to start by offering to play Clemson in Death Valley as soon as they have a slot open. Gary and I weren’t so sure about this until Don mentioned we could make some good money for the school win or lose. Of course we don’t plan to lose…There are lots of good things ahead for the Gary & Mark Podcasting University.Check out all our episodes, videos, university information on our website at: www.garyandmark.com.We wish to thank our continuing sponsor Saluda Outfitters – home of Green River Eddy’s Tap Room & Grill where this episode was recorded.

Two decades later he remembers it like he just walked off the trail. Most people only dream about such an adventure and those who actually start the journey call it quits a few hundred miles in. Chuck is one of those who made it! Only a small percentage ever complete the entire trail.Just in case you’re not all that familiar with the AT, the “long trail” starts at Springer Mountain, Georgia and ends at Mt. Katahdin, Maine – or you can hike north to south. It crosses 14 states in its journey and passes through multiple national forests, national parks, state parks, etc. Chuck can tell you it’s a mentally and physically challenging undertaking.Today Chuck lives in Saluda, NC where most of our podcasts are recorded. Chuck is very active in the local community and even twenty years after his AT hike he’s still hiking and is a volunteer trail maintainer for FENCE, a nature center in Tryon, NC.At the end of our podcast the Board of Trustees & Founders of “The Gary & Mark Podcasting University” presented Chuck with the very first Honorary BS in Podcasting with Honors (and extra honors) to Chuck.Learn more about the Appalachian Trail at. www.appalachiantrail.orgThis episode was recorded at Saluda Outfitters, a major sponsor of The Gary & Mark Show.

And I’m proud to say we made it through the conversation without a single mention of a PSL. | It’s about time somebody said something about the White Claw epidemic in our country, so we took it upon ourselves to clear some things up. Are they Texan? The real question is, would you rather party with George Strait or the cast of the Jersey Shore? | We’re taking it on the road to Dallas this week, y’all! From what’s really behind the title of "America’s Team” to everything fried coming out of the State Fair this year. We’ll give ya a hint, Big Red Chicken Bread. Y’all better come hungry to this episode! | I was appalled that anyone would lump our great state in with the likes of Maine and Alaska, but here we are. Today, I take on a fairly ridiculous debate that was waged on Twitter about Texas and its standing as the most prideful state. | Heaven forbid one day we have to leave this beautiful state we call home and move somewhere over yonder, BUT if that day comes we deserve a true Texas send off. On this episode we put together a five course meal that even our southern mothers could be proud of. | How do y’all take your tea? Sweet? Unsweet? Sugar with a hint of tea? 50/50? Arnold Palmer? Flavored? With lemon? Light ice? All the ice? Now that you’re clear on what we’re debatin’, let’s get to it! Because there’s always a right and a wrong in our office. | Here\'s a Texas Fire Rant on rules of the road that many Texans seem to miss out on. Between blinkers, waves, and the left lane, all Texans need to hear this. | Of all of the subjects our audience asks that we weigh in on, the great beans in chili debate has to be the biggest and longest running. Today, we make a statement. | When we heard our graphic designer pronounce New Braunfels as “New Bronze Fulls” for the 80th time today we knew something had to be done. Lessons had to be learnt. We phoned in a few friends and got to the bottom of some good old fashioned Texas pronunciations on this episode.', 'chan_desc': "Featuring the founder of Texas Humor, Jay B Sauceda and the team behind the content, Y'all Need This Podcast is the show that debates and discusses what it means to be Texan.
