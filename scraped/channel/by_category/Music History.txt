We follow him for a little while and he leads us to...Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground.We get to know Lou and the Velvets, and the scene from which they sprang: Andy Warhol’s Factory. We meet a Factory hang-around, an angry young woman with good reasons to be angry, but she takes it way too far, with tragic consequences.\xa0And we’ll meet the first Punk Rock band: The MC5, and the revolutionary political milieu they occupied. Wayne Kramer of the MC5 has some things to say about that, and about a fateful MC5 gig at the Fillmore East.\xa0Finally, we’ll meet one of our favorite artists ever, who came from the same scene as the MC5: Iggy Pop. We say “Amen” to Iggy Pop.\xa0We wrap it back around to Simon & Garfunkel, and their take on the anger and disappointment, on the turmoil of the late 1960s. An offer of comfort and healing is the first big Pop hit of the 1970s.Listen to episodes 1-16 of Rock N Roll Archaeology and all our other podcasts at www.pantheonpodcasts.com | We start our tale of Paradise Lost in Buena Vista Park, San Francisco, in the fall of 1967. Hippie, the Devoted Son of Mass Media, is dead, and the San Francisco Diggers are conducting the funeral.\xa0From the funky streets of the Haight we head east a couple miles to the Fillmore West, and meet a complicated man, concert promoter Bill Graham. It was during these early years in San Francisco that Bill created the rock concert experience.\xa0Then a brief trip to Texas, where Janis Joplin cleans up and then heads back; to San Francisco to find her family. We get to know Janis a little better, and talk about her early work with Big Brother and the Holding Company--and what happened when Janis left Big Brother.\xa0We’ll spend a little more time on the Big Picture. Politically, culturally, in pretty much every way, 1968 was a pivotal year, in America and around the world.\xa0Then across the Bay, to the lands that lie East of Eden. We’ll meet two very different acts, that interestingly enough, have similar stories: Sly and the Family Stone, and Creedence Clearwater Revival.\xa0We close it out with a short meditation on the aftermath of the Summer of Love. We still dream it and dance to it.\xa0 | An impressionistic look at the interplay of Rock N Roll and Culture in Los Angeles during the latter half of the 1960s. There are familiar elements: storytelling, critical discussion and commentary, and lots of Rock N Roll attitude. But this one is different from most of our previous RNRAP offerings. | We open in Manila, in the Republic of the Philippines, July 3rd, 1966. The second stop of the Far East leg of the Beatles’ 1966 tour starts out weird and ominous, and gets worse from there. By the time the tour sputters to a halt—late August in San Francisco—the boys are almighty sick of it. | We open at Waldo Point Marina in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. Otis Redding takes a break from the road on Bill Graham’s houseboat, and comes up with a signature song. | Jimi’s astonishing, supernatural talent was forged in poverty and neglect as he grew up in Seattle. We talk about that, and about the night Elvis came to town. After a short stint in the Army comes to a humiliating end, Jimi takes it on the road and spends the next four years paying his dues as a sideman. | We start by taking a clear-eyed look at the infamous seaside “Riots” in the resort town of Clacton, United Kingdom and several other towns in the summer of 1964. The British press were WAY over the top in their depiction of these events, but they did document the first schism, the first big division in Rock music and culture: the traditionalist Rockers versus the Modernists, or “Mods.” | Episode Ten opens up with Christian narrating at the site of the Bricklayer’s Arms Public House, in Soho, West London, where Brian Jones met with two younger men, school chums, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, in the fall of 1963. | This show will contain familiar elements — storytelling, commentary, and musicology — but it is also a bit of a departure. It takes place mostly in the mid-sixties, but we’re not following a timeline or building a story: it’s more of a mosaic, a think-piece. | The show opens December 27th, 1961, at the Cavern Club where Pete Best calls in sick, and the boys bring in Richard Starkey - Ringo Starr to the world - to sit in on drums, his first paid gig with the Beatles. It clicks musically; the band really swings with Ringo on drums.', 'chan_desc': 'An episodic overview of the history of Rock Music.

It’s carefully researched, fully scripted and highly produced...a little bit academic in tone, because we do our homework.\n\nBut we throw in a lot of fun too: music, storytelling, commentary and quotes, lots of sound design.

And helping us to paint that multicoloured, multilayered picture is Mark Lewisohn, reading passages from his unrivalled The Beatles: All These Years – Tune In. The music:Too Much Monkey BusinessI’m Talking About YouI’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry (Over You)I Just Don’t UnderstandA Shot of Rhythm and BluesAin’t She SweetLonesome Tears in My EyesI Got a WomanSoldier of Love Sweet Little SixteenYou should’a been there! | “It\'s rip-roaring, infectious stuff, with the accent on beat throughout,” wrote Derek Johnson in the New Musical Express.“Beatles For Sale is going to sell, sell, sell. It is easily up to standard and will knock out pop fans, rock fans, R&B and Beatles fans,” predicted Melody Maker’s Chris Welch.Nevertheless, the Fab Four’s fourth album has received mixed reviews down the years, especially when rated within the context of their musical canon. Worked to the bone with film, TV, radio, press and global concert tour assignments, The Beatles were also under pressure to deliver a couple of LPs per year. Unable to sustain the standard set by the all-Lennon-McCartney A Hard Day’s Night, its composers still produced some magnificent work, yet a few mediocre tracks, out-of-tune guitars and uncharacteristically questionable artistic choices gave the finished record an erratic quality that has resulted in divided opinions among listeners—including those discussing it on this show.Under-appraised and underpraised, Beatles For Sale is put under the microscope for a well-earned reevaluation. And what no one can deny is that even the group’s sub-par output—in the eyes and ears of some—outstrips that of most other artists. | What John Lennon described as "the most miserable sessions on earth" were recalled by George Harrison as "the low of all time". Yet, while such statements may have accurately reflected their respective mindsets, they also helped fuel widespread misconceptions about The Beatles’ January ’69 ‘Get Back’ project that evolved into the ‘Let It Be’ film and album.The fragmented, shoddily-edited Michael Lindsay-Hogg-directed ‘documentary’ has also played a significant role in spreading the negativity, as have certain self-acclaimed experts’ uninformed opinions because of their failure to listen to all of the tapes. For, therein lies a very different, far more rewarding story that will likely be revealed in Peter Jackson\'s new version of the movie. Regardless, that’s what Richard Buskin and Allan Kozinn (pinch-hitting for Erik Taros) focus on here: the many ups as well as the downs that took place at Twickenham Film Studios in the run-up to George temporarily quitting the group—and the project then relocating to The Beatles’ own Apple facility.In so doing, Richard and Allan not only examine the long as well as short-term causes for the disharmony—including the personalities involved and their invariably fascinating, often-enlightening interactions; they also provide a fly-on-the-wall perspective on the thoughts and discussions that helped shape the Fab Four’s still-reverberating artistic decisions. | Such was the growing British interest surrounding The Beatles by mid-1963 that, on 1st July, fans gathered outside the EMI Studios on Abbey Road where the group was recording both sides of its next single: ‘She Loves You’ and ‘I’ll Get You’.Since the late-Sixties, ‘She Loves You’ has been short-changed; dismissed by many as just catchy MOR pop compared to the Fab Four\'s subsequent, more experimental tracks. In reality, this one was every bit as groundbreaking: a unique, infectious, beautifully-crafted rock belter that saw the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team hit the ball out of the park before, five days later, they and their colleagues accomplished the same inside Studio Two.‘She Loves You’ was unlike anything that had been heard before—in various ways. So, where did it come from? And what were the ingredients in its creation? Take a deep dive into a true classic. | How, when and where did our passion for the Fab Four first get ignited? What form did it take and how has it evolved, personally and professionally? Our friend Mark Lewisohn, the group’s foremost biographer, joins us for an informal chat recorded at Erik’s home studio that provides perspective and reminiscences from both sides of the Atlantic, reaching back more than 55 years to our initial encounters with John, Paul, George and Ringo on TV, radio, record and in print. It’s been a lifelong love story, focusing on not only the music, but also the personalities… and the humour. As such, this episode speaks to fans everywhere.The Music‘I’ll Get You’‘She Loves You’‘Here There and Everywhere’‘The Inner Light’‘Look at Me’‘The Beatles Movie Medley’‘All My Loving’ | During a taped business meeting attended by three Beatles and Neil Aspinall while Ringo was away - likely in mid-September ‘69, a month before that in which John would say he wanted "a divorce" from the group - JL remarked, "Alright, let\'s move on. We\'ll do another album. We\'ll all do four songs. How\'s that? That\'s fair."When the others showed no interest, he then said, "Alright, how about a Christmas single? Y\'know, we finish it with a Christmas single. I think it\'s a great idea — I\'m in."That changed after John and Yoko performed in Toronto with Eric and Klaus. But what if the others had approved John\'s initial suggestion and immediately returned to the studio? Between them they already had enough songs for another LP - songs that would end up being utilized for their own solo projects.Here are the tracks selected by your co-hosts…ErikLet It DownLook at MeAnother DayStormy WeatherGimme Some TruthHear Me LordMaybe I’m AmazedOh My LoveArt of DyingChild of NatureAll Things Must PassThe Back Seat of My CarIsn’t It a PitySuicideRichardGimme Some TruthMaybe I’m AmazedArt of DyingChild of NatureAll Things Must PassAnother DayIsn’t It a PityOh My LoveWhen Every Song is SungEvery NightBeautiful GirlLook at MeThe Back Seat of My CarWhat is LifeFeaturing a recording of ‘Maybe I’m Amazed’ by Mark & Rosalie Cunningham, produced for this show. | At the suggestion of press officer Tony Barrow, The Beatles ended their first year of national fame by thanking the members of their UK fan club with a flexi-disc single containing a specially recorded Christmas message. So began an annual tradition that not only endured as long as they were together, but also mirrored and encapsulated their career: from the innocent fun of 1963 and 1964 to the biting cynicism of 1965, offbeat creativity of 1966, psychedelic surrealism of 1967, disparate contributions of 1968 and complete fragmentation of 1969. What starts off joyous ends up sad, with much of life in between – and guest appearances by George Martin, Mal Evans, Victor Spinetti, Yoko Ono and Tiny Tim.Featuring:“Christmas Time (Is Here Again)”1963: “The Beatles’ Christmas Record”1964: “Another Beatles Christmas Record” + outtakes1965: “The Beatles’ Third Christmas Record” + outtakes1966: “The Beatles’ Fourth Christmas Record: Everywhere It’s Christmas” + outtakes1967: “Christmas Time Is Here Again!”1968: “The Beatles’ 1968 Christmas Record”1969: “The Beatles’ Seventh Christmas Record: Happy Christmas 1969”Dora Bryan – “All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle” | This is a new phase STTS episode…Essential to the concept of the ‘International White Album Symposium’ at Monmouth University, New Jersey, was that we recorded the show in front of an audience, revisiting and merging the much-discussed topics of Episodes #2 and #4 with a couple of our mates: celebrated Beatles author Mark Lewisohn and our resident musicologist Allan Kozinn.John Lennon and Paul McCartney each contributed 12 songs to the White Album. These could have been justifiably issued as LPs in their own right. And what stunners they would have been; filled with an eclectic array of incredible compositions and unforgettable performances that captured both men—and their bandmates—at the top of their game.Here we review the Lennon and McCartney White Albums, comparing them with each other as well as with the legendary, recently remixed Beatles opus. In comes the warmth and freshness of a live appearance, captured for you by the STTS team.

Two days later, he attended the group’s first recording session with Ringo Starr on drums. He subsequently assisted on a number of sessions, including those for ‘She Loves You’ and ‘I Want to Hold Your Hand’, before replacing Norman Smith as The Beatles’ chief engineer in early 1966 and diving straight into the deep end with the first track committed to tape for their landmark ‘Revolver’ LP: the revolutionary, now-legendary ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’. The following year, ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ won him his first of four Grammy Awards.In this episode, Richard, Erik, Allan and Craig examine how, together with producer George Martin, Geoff helped realize The Beatles’ most far-flung creative ambitions. And there is also an enlightening interview with multi-award-winning engineer John Kurlander, who assisted Geoff on the group’s final album, ‘Abbey Road’.Featured TracksTomorrow Never Knows (STTS remix)Yer BluesGood Day SunshineGood Morning Good MorningGolden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End (STTS remix)I’m Only SleepingA Day in the Life (STTS remix)', 'chan_desc': "The ultimate Beatles podcast: Deep research, unconventional topics, probing interviews and hard-hitting info that doesn't pull any punches.

On one try.Mind-boggling, right?...now let’s get even weirder…add in the chances of you getting into a band that becomes successful…and not just successful, but a group that becomes world-changing…add another six zeroes to that last number…Now consider this: what if you got into a second successful band that stays together for decades and also becomes one of the biggest things rock has ever seen…that’s good for, what, three more zeroes?...So in this completely unscientific extrapolation of Dr. Binazir’s estimation of the uniqueness of existence, the chances of Dave Grohl being Dave Grohl is approximately one in two quadrillion, 685 trillion…give or take…\xa0This is the third and final part of our ultra-deep look at the guy… | When you reach a certain level of fame, you can expect that everything you do will be recorded somewhere…it’s out of your control…fans will do it…your management team will do it…your social media people will make sure that it gets done…probably someone at your label…and they’ll just keep doing it…Your life becomes one ever-expanding Wikipedia page…not that this is a bad thing…it’s just something certain famous people have to live with…This brings me to Dave Grohl…he is one of the best-documented guys in music…everything he’s ever does and continues to do is written down somewhere…There’s the Foo Fighters, of course…we know a lot about the Dave and the Foos…there was his time in Nirvana before that…a little bit has been written about them…Then there are the side projects, the guest appearances…the documentary work…the soundtracks…. we’ve even been introduced to his mom, who wrote a book about raising rock stars…Seriously…with all this attention, what else is left to tell?...well, you might be surprised…this is part two of a program I call “ultra-deep background on Dave Grohl”… | A couple of years back, i was invited to 606 studios, which is the headquarters of all things Foo…it’s the house of foo…This is where the Foo Fighters rehearse and record…it’s where they have band meetings…and it’s where they store a lot of their stuff…i had all five guys to myself for an interview…and there was no other way to describe them as a bunch of others…Taylor Hawkins took the lead on this…and the whole time Taylor was talking, Dave Grohl was sitting there with a big smile on his face…he knows he’s among the luckiest humans alive…sure, he’s talented and ambitious, but so many things completely beyond his control had to go right for things to turn out the way they have…it’s really amazing…Dave’s career has been extremely well documented—but there might still be a number of things that you don’t know about him—especially from the early, early, early years…let’s dig into that, shall we? | Every once in a while, a form of music comes along that makes it its mission to break with the traditions of rock n roll.Okay...well maybe the instrumentation is largely the same...but it's the way they are used.And it's usually done by people who don't know there are rules when it comes to rock and people just want to get together and play.And this happened in the late 80's when we were first introduced to the idea of Shoegaze. The result was a wall of sound with atmospheres and harmonics. \xa0And It was truly unique.\xa0 | As we looked at in part 1, Vinyl is making a comeback.\xa0But how did this happen? Will it last?

And a few years ago everyone was talking about its death: First thanks to the CD and then the MP3. But a funny thing has happened over the last decade or so.Vinyl is making a comeback.\xa0But what is exactly is Vinyl....how did it come to be? Why did it disappear? And how have things changed for it to be back on the radar?This is the History of Vinyl...Part 1 | Once upon a time, music was incredibly tribal…once you picked a tribe, you had to conform to serious and rigid rules…whatever the prevailing dogma dictated was your reality…snobbery abounded….For example, in the 70s, 80s, and well into the 90s, rock was divided into two camps…on one side were the mainstream rockers, fans of the artists that occupied most of the attention: radio airplay, record sales, concert tickets…they were on top of the Rock’n’Roll zeitgeist…\xa0On the other were the alterative kids…they were the outsiders, the weirdos, the misfits—and they were very happy with their position…alt-rockers were content with their own musical universe…But here’s the thing: during this period, these two tribes were locked in a cold war…it was a war of musical ideology, musical outlook, and musical aspirations…and woe to any tribe member who tried to change tribes…you might as well try to take a stroll across the DMZ between North and South Korea…things could be that rigid…And there was more…if you were a mainstream rock fan, you couldn’t admit to your fellow tribe members that you liked music from the other side…same thing if you were an alt-rocker…to admit that you liked Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, or Van Halen was nothing short of heresy…I recall one time when Billy Corgan admitted that some of the Smashing Pumpkins sound was influenced by Judas Priest…shock and horror!...treason!...if social media had been around back then, he would have been trolled to death—even though if you listened to the pumpkins, you could hear that kind of metal influence coming through…it just didn’t make sense…Today, though, those rigid tribal groups have broken down…we have entered an era when we’re very ecumenical about music…more and more, the prevailing philosophy is “respect all music, listen to what you want”…This is healthy because it opens up new vistas for music—for listening andfor influences when it comes to making new music…Here…let me show you what I mean… | If you were to ask a contemporary group like say The White Stripes or The Hives about which band influenced their sound they would probably list off a bunch of names including The Stooges.If you were to go back to the 90’s and ask the same question to Nirvana or Janes Addiction, one of the bands they would inevitability mention would be The Stooges.Slip back to 80’s and ask Sonic Youth and they would probably say The Stooges…If you travel back to the 70’s and ask The Sex Pistols or The Ramones and they would likely say…The Stooges…Or ask David Bowie…and you’d get The Stooges…Alright then so The Stooges seem to be on everyone’s list but hold on….this is a band that hardly sold any records in their day and were so messed up that their singer ended up in an asylum.So, I guess the question must be asked…what’s the big deal about The Stooges? | The study of word origins and word meanings is called Etymology.\xa0And rock music has it's own branch of Etymology and we can give you lots of examples.

It\'s not an easy job — after all, she had to convince seasoned label heads to take her seriously, compartmentalize her grief as a mother to act as an executive, and choose what things are shared with the world and what stays private.\xa0In the season three finale of The Opus, host Carrie Courogen is joined by Guibert, as well as Rolling Stone critic David Browne, to discuss their roles, together and individually, in doing the delicate and difficult work of keeping Buckley\'s legacy alive.\xa0To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Grace, Jeff Buckley’s proper studio catalogue will be re-released and packaged with rare recordings and bonus international material.

How do we ethically proceed with lingering unfinished material in the aftermath of such a tragedy? And do posthumous releases help us understand an artist more, or do they lend to the mythology?

From the elusive Hendrix chord to deluxe box sets, the singer and guitarist\'s legacy is long out of his hands, part of a much larger lexicon of followers, be it elders of yesteryear or newcomers who weren\'t even around for the \'90s.\xa0In our final episode revolving around Hendrix and Electric Ladyland, host Ernest Wilkins attempts to answer, "Why?"It\'s a tough question, sure, but Ernest isn\'t alone for the trip. He\'s joined by another legend himself in Megadeth\'s Dave Mustaine, who will soon embark on the Experience Hendrix tour, in addition to poet and author Hanif Abdurraqib, whose book of essays,\xa0They Can\'t Kill Us Until They Kill Us, topped year-end lists by Buzzfeed, Esquire, NPR, Oprah Magazine, and The Chicago Tribune.

You may have heard bits of this story but you never heard what David Bowie was really like that evening. He caused a bit of a commotion while finding sanctuary in the DJ booth of Joseph Brooks and on this episode we are hanging out with Joseph. What also made that night stand out was theGuns n Roses performance and what was filmed when the band didn\'t perform. What part do sex toys play in this tale of raunch and roll? Why did Axl accompany Riki to New York? Why give you any more teasers just listen dammit | Riki Rachtman brought his podcast to the Sunset Strip and recorded the show LIVE in front of an audience at the Grafton Hotel on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.

Why not join them?TranscriptWe\'re coming to the end of 1956, and with it the end of the first wave of rockabilly. As we\'ve discussed before, by December 1956, only Elvis was left standing as a white rock and roll star from the first wave -- Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, and Bill Haley had stopped having hits, and Johnny Cash had started to be promoted as a country singer rather than a rock and roller.But just because someone has stopped having hits doesn\'t mean they\'ve stopped making good music, and that was certainly the case for Carl Perkins, who spent the rest of 1956 making records that were every bit as good as his one hit, "Blue Suede Shoes". After "Boppin\' the Blues", the song\'s unsuccessful follow-up, he released "Dixie Fried":[Excerpt: Carl Perkins, "Dixie Fried"]But that was no more successful. Perkins was increasingly dissatisfied with the way Sam Phillips was promoting his work, and like Johnny Cash was strongly considering moving to another label.But on December the fourth, 1956, Perkins was still working for Sun, and so he was in the studio with his brothers, recording another single that was destined to do very little.The A-side, "Your True Love", charted, but not very high -- it went to number thirteen on the country charts and only number sixty-seven on the pop charts. It was a decent country record, but not much more than that. The B-side, though, was more interesting:[Excerpt: Carl Perkins, "Matchbox"]"Matchbox" was a song that came from an idea Carl had been given by his father. His father had been sitting around in the session, watching his sons play, and remembered an old song he used to like with the line "sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes/Ain\'t got no matches, but I\'ve got a long way to go". Carl had never heard the song before, and he wasn\'t particularly impressed by the line his dad sang -- he thought the line made no sense. His dad also couldn\'t remember any of the rest of the song, but Carl took that line and built a new song around it.Given Carl\'s father\'s musical tastes, it\'s likely that the record he was remembering was "Matchbox Blues" by Roy Newman and His Boys[Excerpt: Roy Newman and His Boys, "Match Box Blues"]That\'s a country cover of an old blues song by Blind Lemon Jefferson:[Excerpt: Blind Lemon Jefferson, "Match Box Blues"]That was in turn inspired by this from Ma Rainey:[Excerpt: Ma Rainey, "Lost Wandering Blues"]In a coincidence which once again shows how interconnected the different musicians we\'re looking at are, Jefferson\'s song also contained the line “Brown ’cross town going to be my teddy bear / Put a string on me, I’ll follow you everywhere.” -- a line which may well have inspired this song, with a very different feel, recorded by Perkins\' ex-labelmate Elvis Presley:[Excerpt: Elvis Presley, "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear"]But by Perkins\' own account, he never heard the original "Match Box Blues", and was just going from his dad\'s description. And certainly after the chorus the song diverges totally from Jefferson\'s song. Instead, he uses floating lyrics that one can find in all sorts of other blues songs. For example, the verse starting "I\'m a poor boy and I\'m a long way from home" comes from the old traditional blues song usually called, unsurprisingly, "Poor Boy, Long Way From Home":[Excerpt: Bo Weavil Jackson: "Poor Boy Blues"]"Matchbox" shows all the signs of having been put together in the studio, largely improvised, as most of Perkins\' songs were -- you might remember from the episode on "Blue Suede Shoes" that most of his records were at least semi-improvised. And interviews back this up -- it was a throwaway B-side and Perkins was just making anything up to fill out a couple of minutes of vinyl.But in this case the song, while it\'s credited to Carl Perkins, probably deserves at least one more co-author credit. Because the way Perkins told the story, Perkins didn\'t come up with the music. Somebody else did.That someone else, surprisingly, wasn\'t one of the Perkins Brothers Band. While Jay, Clayton, and Fluke Holland were all there, present and accounted for, there was a fifth musician at the session.Jerry Lee Lewis was a new piano player who had been discovered by Sam Phillips\' assistant, Cowboy Jack Clement, the previous month. He\'d cut his first record for Sun a couple of weeks earlier, and it had been released three days before this session. We\'ll be talking more about how Jerry Lee started with Sun, and his own early recordings, in a few weeks\' time, but right now he wasn\'t there in his capacity as a performer, but he was just working as a session musician, trying to earn enough money to buy his parents some Christmas presents by sitting in on the session.Lewis was, by every account I\'ve ever read, one of the most musically fecund people who ever lived. He was a Louisiana piano player like Fats Domino, but his biggest influence was Moon Mullican -- but he\'d absorbed everything, every piece of music he\'d ever heard, and was desperate to show off and play for people no matter what the song.And so when Carl Perkins started singing the lines from "Match Box Blues", Jerry Lee immediately started playing a boogie piano part. The Perkins brothers fell in with what Lewis was playing, and the result, while Carl\'s singing lead, sounds exactly like a Jerry Lee Lewis record -- at least up until the guitar solo.[Excerpt: Carl Perkins, "Matchbox", first guitar solo]Because Perkins was hugely impressed by Lewis as a musician, but he was less impressed by him as a person, at least at first. He\'d got Perkins\' back up after they\'d finished recording "Your True Love", when he\'d said, bluntly, "that song ain\'t worth a damn". Perkins had also heard him showing off at the piano, singing his new record in a break, and he\'d thought that Lewis had no originality -- he could hear bits of himself, and bits of Elvis, and bits of Hank Williams, but not a lot that was new.What Lewis was playing on this new record was great, but Perkins wasn\'t going to let the new kid show him up, and he decided to up his game as a guitar player, playing a hard-driving riff on the bass strings of his guitar while he was singing, but really letting rip on the guitar solos, which he played on the top three strings on his guitar. As he later said, "I took some of my best guitar breaks on that song. Triple string is what I was doing, playing all three strings at the same time with a pick, which is usually done finger-style. But fooling around and practising I knew it would work, and that was the time to try it, because I was shooting at Jerry Lee\'s head. It was never rehearsed."And the reason Perkins took two solos... is because he could tell that Jerry Lee Lewis really wanted to show him exactly what he could do, and Carl Perkins wasn\'t going to let him. As he said later, "I thought, No, you smart aleck, I\'m going to play both breaks on this guitar. Next time I\'m going to try to burn the neck off of it. I knew he was itching for me to holler, \'Get it, Jerry!\' I kinda wished I had of, I\'d like to have seen what he would\'ve done, \'cause he was hot that day. He was going after it. I let myself get in the way of probably a phenomenal piano break. He would have *shown* me how to play a piano. So the world probably missed the greatest piano break Jerry Lee would have ever taken".But the result was, still, extraordinary -- the absolute ultimate definition of rockabilly, with two huge musical egos pushing each other to greater heights. Who knows what would have happened had it not been buried on the B-side to "Your True Love"?[Excerpt: Carl Perkins, "Matchbox", second guitar solo]Because Jerry Lee was right. I wouldn\'t go so far as to say “Your True Love” is not worth a damn, like he said, but I definitely don\'t think it\'s worth a millionth of "Matchbox", and certainly the fact that "Matchbox" went on to become a rock and roll standard once the Beatles unearthed it and brought it to prominence seems to suggest that it could have been a bigger hit.But either way, everyone was happy with the second take of the song, and they were listening back to it when Elvis Presley walked into the room.Elvis had been driving past with a girlfriend, and had been able to tell that there was a session on that day because, as Marion Keisker later put it, it looked like a Cadillac showroom outside. So he\'d popped in to see who was playing.Carl Perkins was astonished to see Elvis there. While the two of them were friendly, he\'d not seen Elvis in several months, and his appearance had changed considerably. Elvis was now dyeing his hair, which had previously been a light brown, a dark black. His acne had cleared up so much that he was no longer keeping his collars up to avoid showing his neck. He\'d gone from being a spotty, shy, adolescent to being a major sex symbol.Elvis went over and started noodling on the piano.This immediately caused Jerry Lee Lewis to start showing off. He went over to Elvis and said "I didn\'t know you could play".Elvis responded "I can\'t", at which point Jerry Lee said, "Well then, why don\'t you let me sit down?"Elvis just replied "Well, I\'d like to try", and carried on noodling. At this point Elvis had largely dismissed Jerry Lee Lewis -- Elvis was not, himself, an arrogant person, and he detested those who were, and Jerry Lee clearly was one.Sam Phillips invited Elvis into the control room to listen to "Matchbox", and Elvis was duly impressed.And then everything changed, as the session turned in to a jam session. And it was a jam session that *possibly* involved a fourth person.[Excerpt: Million Dollar Quartet, "When God Dips His Love In My Heart/Just A Little Talk With Jesus"]Every single account of what became known as the Million Dollar Quartet session disagrees as to how much, if at all, Johnny Cash participated in the proceedings. Cash always claimed he was the first there and last to leave -- that he\'d turned up at the session before it had even started, because he\'d wanted to watch his friends make their latest record, and he stayed through the whole jam session afterwards.Other accounts have Cash turning up part way through the session in order to pick up a royalty cheque that Sam Phillips had for him, singing a couple of songs with the others before the tape machine started running, but having to go off and do some Christmas shopping before everything really got going. And yet other accounts have Sam Phillips realising that he had a good opportunity for publicity here, calling Cash -- who was at the time by far the biggest act on Sun records -- at the same time he called journalists and photographers, and Cash just turning up for a photo and then immediately leaving again.Whatever the truth, it\'s definitely not easy to hear Cash on the tapes of the jam session, which finally got released in the 1980s. It was recorded on a single microphone – Phillips just started recording after they\'d already started jamming, realising he may never have another chance to record these people together – and Cash always said that he was there, just the furthest from the microphone, and that he was singing in a higher register than normal because he was trying to sing in the keys that were comfortable for the other three.Either way, the legendary "Million Dollar Quartet" recordings are completely dominated by Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, with Carl Perkins a distant third.When they start out, there are other musicians -- Carl Perkins\' backing band play on the early tracks, before giving up -- but the majority of the recording consists of Elvis on acoustic guitar or piano, Jerry Lee on piano when Elvis isn\'t playing it, and them all singing together, with Elvis or Jerry Lee taking most of the lead vocals. Various other people join in at different points, but what this really is is two immense talents, both trying to size each other up, outdo each other, and also at the same time share in their joy at making music together.[Excerpt: Million Dollar Quartet, "I Shall Not Be Moved"]The interesting thing about the music they play is how little of it is actually rock and roll. There\'s some, of course -- they\'re all hugely impressed with Chuck Berry\'s "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" and have several goes at playing it -- and they talk about "Too Much Monkey Business", though Elvis was less impressed by that one than "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man". Elvis also sings a single line of Little Richard\'s "Rip It Up", but otherwise what they\'re playing is either pure country music or what\'s euphemistically called Southern Gospel -- the gospel music performed primarily by white people from the Deep South, rather than the gospel music primarily performed by black people.Both Elvis and Jerry Lee were brought up in the Assembly of God, a Pentecostal "holy roller" church, which we\'ll talk more about when we get to an episode on Jerry Lee himself, but that meant they shared even more of a religious culture than they did with Cash or Perkins, both of whom were deeply religious men but neither of whom were brought up in that particular tradition.Most interesting is their take on "Jesus Walked that Lonesome Valley", which unfortunately includes a verse about John the Baptist that could be interpreted as mildly antisemitic. I\'m not going to include that line in here -- and it is *very* mild antisemitism at worst, not hate speech or anything -- but I thought I\'d flag that for anyone going to listen to the Mixcloud after hearing this, as in the current political climate people might not want to hear that without a warning.However, that aside, the track is interesting, as even though it\'s a call-and-response song and starts with Elvis taking the lead and Jerry Lee doing the responses, by the first verse Jerry Lee has already taken over the lead and left Elvis echoing him, rather than vice versa.[Excerpt: the Million Dollar Quartet: "Jesus Walked that Lonesome Valley"]You can hear there exactly how this friendly rivalry was already working. Remember, at this time, Jerry Lee Lewis was nobody at all, someone who had one single out which had been out a matter of days. But here he is duetting with the "King of Rock and Roll", and seeing himself as the person who should naturally be taking the lead. When we get to Jerry Lee\'s work in a few weeks\' time, you\'ll see just how completely in character this is.It was also completely in character for Elvis, at least at this time, to defer to another musician, even though he was the biggest star around. One of the most fascinating elements of the Million Dollar Quartet session is Elvis talking of his experience in Las Vegas, watching Billy Ward and the Dominoes sing Elvis\' own hit, "Don\'t Be Cruel":[Excerpt: Elvis session chatter and "Don\'t Be Cruel"]The Yankee singer he\'s talking about there, who he\'s so convinced did the song better than he did, was Jackie Wilson, who was at the time the lead singer for the Dominoes, before striking out as a solo singer. You can hear just how influenced Elvis was by Wilson\'s performance -- and that "Yankee" pronunciation "telly-phone" that he makes fun of [retook at end take 2 a couple of times] -- by listening to his performance of the song on the Ed Sullivan show a few weeks later, where he pronounces the word the same way:[Excerpt: Elvis Presley, "Don\'t Be Cruel", Ed Sullivan Show version]It\'s worth seeking out the video of that, if you\'re not someone who has objections to using YouTube, as just seeing the expression on Elvis\' face when he sings that line is priceless.But listening to him talk about Jackie Wilson\'s performance, he keeps talking about how much better Wilson did the song, and the others keep insisting that he couldn\'t have been that much better than Elvis, but Elvis insists.For the first part of the session, Elvis is on the piano, and while he claimed to not be able to play, he actually does a perfectly decent job. But when Jerry Lee Lewis took over the piano, things would kick up a notch, as Lewis was desperate to show off.[Excerpt: the Million Dollar Quartet, "When the Saints Go Marching In"]And when Elvis was called into the control room again, towards the end of the jam session, Jerry Lee took over completely, just playing by himself and showing off what he could do.[Excerpt: Jerry Lee Lewis, "Black Bottom Stomp"]The last few songs in the jam session are essentially Lewis playing by himself, singing "Crazy Arms" and Gene Autry\'s "You\'re the Only Star in My Blue Heaven", and playing the old Jelly Roll Morton piano piece "Black Bottom Stomp". Right at the end we hear Elvis leaving, and him saying goodbye to someone called "Johnny", which suggests that Cash was right when he said that he was there all along.The Million Dollar Quartet session might well have been the making of Jerry Lee Lewis, even though the recordings weren\'t released until decades later. Sam Phillips took the opportunity to publicise his stars far and wide. and that publicity placed the four of them on the same level. Jerry Lee, by virtue of being at the session, was an equal with Elvis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash.The Million Dollar Quartet tape isn\'t great music, except at odd moments -- it\'s an interesting historical document, rather than anything else. But those odd moments when it *does* become great are frankly electrifying, as a group of musicians at the height of their powers just play for each other for the sheer pleasure of playing.To me, the very best moment in the whole session comes near the end, when Elvis plays a solo version of "That\'s When Your Heartaches Begin", the Ink Spots song he had performed three years earlier, when he had first walked into that studio to record himself for his mother:[Excerpt: Elvis Presley, "That\'s When Your Heartaches Begin"]Hearing how much his voice had matured, and how much his performance had improved, in the three years between his first and last recordings in that Memphis studio, sends shivers down my spine.There were a couple of attempts at "Million Dollar Quartet" reunions over the years, as the session became legendary among rockabilly fans. None, however, featured the quartet\'s full line-up, as they happened after Elvis\' death.The first, and the one that was more in the spirit of the original sessions, was a live performance released as "The Survivors", when on April 23 1981 Perkins and Lewis joined Cash on stage in Stuttgart for an impromptu performance. All three of them ran through their biggest hits:[Excerpt: Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, "Matchbox"]But again, a substantial proportion of the show was taken up with the old gospel and country songs they all knew, with them trading off vocals on "I\'ll Fly Away", "I Saw the Light", "Will the Circle Be Unbroken?", and one song they\'d performed at the earlier session, which they dedicated to Elvis, "Peace in the Valley":[Excerpt: Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins, "Peace in the Valley"]20) Four years later they would get together again, for a studio album recorded at Sun Studios, with Roy Orbison filling in for Elvis. Class of \'55 has its moments, but isn\'t a highlight of any of those men\'s discographies:[Excerpt: Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins, "Waymore\'s Blues"]This is the point that Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins leave our story, at least as main players, though no doubt we\'ll be hearing about them again when we talk about Jerry Lee Lewis and other Sun artists over the next few months. They both moved increasingly towards country music, and away from rockabilly. December 4, 1956, is as good a date as any, then, to nominate as the border between periods in rock and roll history -- the last point at which rock and roll, rockabilly, gospel, and country music could all be considered as the same kind of thing, before rock and roll became the dominant genre, with artists like Jerry Lee Lewis who started their career after rock and roll was already established.The world of music had changed irreparably in the year since Elvis had last been in the Sun Studios, and it was going to keep on changing.[Excerpt, Elvis saying “Johnny, I\'ll see you later...”] | This week\'s episode of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs is the second of two bonus episodes answering listener questions at the end of the first year of the podcast.

The one that\'s going on the main podcast is going to consist of those questions that my backers asked that have to do primarily with the podcast and the music, while the one that\'s going only to backers consists mostly of questions that have been asked about me and my life and so forth -- stuff that might be less interesting to the casual listener, but that clearly someone is interested in. Next week I get back to the main story, with an episode about Carl Perkins, but right now we\'re going to jump straight into the questions.\xa0Matthew Elmslie asks:\xa0"It\'s not an issue you\'ve had to confront yet, as you navigate the mid-\'50s, but eventually you\'re going to come up against the clash between the concept of popular music where the basic unit is the song or single, and the one where the basic unit is the album. What are your thoughts on that and how do you plan to deal with it?"This is a question I had to give some consideration to when I was writing my book California Dreaming, which in many ways was sort of a trial run for the podcast, and which like the podcast told its story by looking at individual tracks. I think it can be a problem, but probably not in the way it first appears.\xa0First, the period where the album was dominant was a fairly short one -- it\'s only roughly from 1967 through about 1974 that the bands who were getting the most critical respect were primarily thinking in terms of albums rather than singles. After that, once punk starts, the pendulum swings back again, so it\'s not a long period of time that I have to think of in those terms. But it is something that has to be considered during that period.On the other hand, even during that period, there were many acts who were still primarily singles acts -- the Monkees, Slade, the Move, T-Rex... many of whom, arguably, had more long-term influence than many of the album acts of the time.\xa0I think for the most part, though, even the big album acts were still working mostly in ways that allow themselves to be looked at through the lens of single tracks. Like even on something like Dark Side of the Moon, which is about as concept-albumy as it gets, there\'s still "Money" and "Great Gig in the Sky" which are individual tracks people know even if they don\'t necessarily know the album, and which could be used as the focus of an episode on the album. Even with Led Zeppelin, who never released singles at all, there are tracks that might as well have been singles, like "Whole Lotta Love" or "Stairway to Heaven". So for the most part it\'s fairly easy to find a single track I can focus on.\xa0The real problem only comes in for a handful of albums -- records, mostly from that period in the late sixties and early seventies, which absolutely deserve to be considered as part of the podcast, but which don\'t have standout tracks. It\'s hard to pick one track from, say, Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart or Astral Weeks by Van Morrison -- those two albums really do need considering as albums rather than as individual tracks -- there\'s no reason to choose, say, "Frownland" over "The Dust Blows Forward \'n\' the Dust Blows Back" or vice versa, or "Madame George" over "Slim Slow Slider".\xa0What I\'ll do in those cases will probably vary from case to case. So with Trout Mask Replica I\'d probably just pick one song as the title song for the episode but still talk about the whole album, while with Astral Weeks the most likely thing is for me to focus the episode on "Brown-Eyed Girl", which isn\'t on the album, but talk about the making of Astral Weeks after "Brown-Eyed Girl" was a success. That\'s assuming I cover both those albums at all, but I named them because I\'m more likely to than not.\xa0[Excerpt: Van Morrison, “Brown-Eyed Girl”]\xa0Russell Stallings asks: "Andrew, in [the] 60s it seems rock guitar was dominated by Stratocasters and Les Pauls, what was the guitar of choice in the period we are currently covering (1957) ?"\xa0Well, 1957 is just about the point where this becomes an interesting question. Before this point the guitar hasn\'t played much of a part in the proceedings -- we\'ve seen guitarists, but there\'ve been more piano players -- 1957 is really the point where the guitar becomes the primary rock and roll instrument.\xa0Before I go any further, I just want to say that I\'ve never been a particular gearhead. There are people out there who can tell the difference instantly between different types of guitars based on a note or two. I\'m not one of them -- I can sort of make out the difference between a Fendery sound and a Gibsony one and a Rickenbackery one, but not at a tremendous level of precision. I tend to care more about the technique of the player than the sound of the instrument, so this isn\'t my area of expertise. But I\'ll give this a go.\xa0Now, there wasn\'t a straightforward single most popular guitar at this point. It\'s true that from the late sixties on rock pretty much standardised around the Les Paul and the Stratocaster -- though it was from the late sixties, and you get a lot of people playing different guitars in the early and mid sixties -- but in the fifties people were still figuring things out as individuals. But at the same time, there is, sort of, an answer to this.\xa0The Strat wasn\'t particularly popular in the 50s. The only first-rank 50s rocker who played a Strat was Buddy Holly, who always played one on stage, though he varied his guitars in the studio from what I\'ve read. Buddy Holly is indirectly the reason the Strat later became so popular -- he inspired Hank Marvin of the Shadows to get one, and Marvin inspired pretty much every guitarist in Britain to copy him. But other than in surf music, the Strat wasn\'t really popular until around 1967. You\'d occasionally get a Telecaster player in the 50s -- Buck Owens, who played on quite a few rockabilly sessions for people like Gene Vincent and Wanda Jackson before he became one of the greats of country music, played a Telecaster. And James Burton, who played in the fifties with Ricky Nelson and Dale Hawkins, among others, was another Telecaster player. But in general there weren\'t a lot of Fender players.\xa0[Excerpt: Ricky Nelson, “Hello, Mary Lou”, James Burton guitar solo]\xa0Some people did play Gibsons -- most of the Chicago electric blues people seem to have been Gibson people, and so was Chuck Berry. Scotty Moore also played a Gibson. But rather than go for the Les Paul, they\'d mostly go for hollow-body models like the L5, which could be played as either electric or acoustic. Scotty Moore also used a custom-built Echosonic amp, so he could get a similar guitar sound on stage to the one he\'d got in the studio with Sam Phillips, and he used the L5 and Echosonic combination on all the Elvis hits of the fifties. Carl Perkins did play a Les Paul at first, including on "Blue Suede Shoes", but he switched to a Gibson ES-5 (and got himself an Echosonic from the same person who made Scotty Moore\'s) after that.\xa0[Excerpt: Carl Perkins, “Matchbox”]\xa0For acoustic guitar, people generally either used a Martin, like Elvis Presley or Ray Edenton, who was the session rhythm player who doubled Don Everly\'s guitar in the studio (Phil Everly would double it live, but he didn\'t play on the records), or they\'d play a Gibson acoustic, as Don Everly and Buddy Holly did.But overwhelmingly the most popular guitar on rockabilly sessions -- which means in rock and roll for these purposes, since with the exception of Chuck Berry the R&B side of rock and roll remained dominated by piano and sax -- the most popular rockabilly guitar was a Gretsch. There were various popular models of Gretsch guitar, like the Duo Jet, but the most popular were the 6120, the Country Gentleman, and the Tennessean, all of which were variants on the same basic design, and all of which were endorsed by Chet Atkins, which is why they became the pre-eminent guitars among rockabilly musicians, all of whom idolised Atkins.You can hear how that guitar sounds when Atkins plays it here…\xa0[Excerpt: Chet Atkins, “Mr. Sandman”]\xa0Atkins himself played these guitars on sessions for Elvis (where he just played rhythm) and the Everly Brothers (for whom he played lead in the studio). Duane Eddy, Cliff Gallup of the Blue Caps, Eddie Cochran, and many more played Gretsch guitars in imitation of Atkins. Bo Diddley also played a Gretsch before he started playing his own custom-built guitar.\xa0There was no default guitar choice in the 50s the way there was later, but the Gretsch seemed to be the choice of the guitarists who were most admired at the time, and so it also became the choice for anyone else who wanted that clean, country-style, rockabilly lead guitar sound. That sound went out of fashion in the later sixties, but George Harrison used a Gretsch for most of his early leads, and Michael Nesmith of the Monkees always played a Gretsch -- when they started doing twelve-strings, in 1966, they initially only made three, one for Chet Atkins, one for George Harrison, and one for Nesmith, though they later mass-produced them.\xa0But anyway, yeah. No single answer, but Gretsch Country Gentleman, with a hollow-bodied Gibson in close second, is the closest you\'ll get.\xa0William Maybury asks "About when does the History of Soul divorce from the History of Rock, in your eyes?"That\'s a difficult question, and it\'s something I\'ll be dealing with in a lot more detail when we get to the 1970s, over a whole series of episodes. This is the grotesquely oversimplified version. The short answer is -- when "soul" stopped being the label that was applied to cutting-edge black music that white people could rip off. The history of rock is, at least in part, a history of white musicians incorporating innovations that first appeared in black musicians\' work. It\'s not *just* that, of course, but that\'s a big part of it.\xa0Now, around 1970 or so, "rock" gets redefined specifically as music that is made by white men with guitars, and other people making identical music were something else. Like there\'s literally no difference, stylistically, between "Maggot Brain" by Funkadelic and things like Peter Green era Fleetwood Mac or "Watermelon in Easter Hay" by Frank Zappa, but people talk about P-Funk as a funk group rather than a rock group – I know the question was about soul, rather than funk, but in the early seventies there was a huge overlap between the two.\xa0[Excerpt: Funkadelic, “Maggot Brain”]\xa0But as long as soul music remained at the forefront of musical innovations, those innovations were incorporated by white "rock" acts, and any attempt to tell the story of rock music which ignores George Clinton or Stevie Wonder or Sly Stone or Marvin Gaye would be a fundamentally dishonest one.\xa0But some time around the mid-seventies, "soul" stops being a label that\'s applied to innovative new music, and becomes a label for music that\'s consciously retro or conservative, people like, say, Luther Vandross. Not that there\'s anything wrong with retro music -- and there\'s some great soul music made in the 80s and 90s -- but the music that was at the cutting edge was first disco and then hip-hop, and that\'s the music that was spawning the innovations that the rock musicians would incorporate into their work.\xa0And, indeed, after around 1980 rock itself becomes more consciously retro and less experimental, and so the rate of incorporation of new musical ideas slows down too, though never completely stops.\xa0But there\'s always some fuzziness around genre labels. For example, if you consider Prince to be a soul musician, then obviously he\'s still part of the story. Same goes for Michael Jackson. I don\'t know if I\'d consider either of them to be soul per se, but I could make a case for it, and obviously it\'s impossible to tell the story of rock in the eighties without those two, any more than you could tell it without, say, Bruce Springsteen.\xa0So, really, there\'s a slow separation between the two genres over about a twenty-year period, starting in the mid-sixties and finishing in the mid-eighties. I *imagine* that Prince is probably the last new musician who might be described as soul who will be appearing in the podcast, but it really depends on where you draw the boundaries of what counts as soul. There\'ll be a few disco and hip-hop acts appearing over the last half of the series, and some of them might be considered soul by some people.\xa0That\'s the best I can do at answering the question right now, but it\'s a vastly oversimplified version of the real answer, which is "listen to all the podcasts for the seventies when I get to them".\xa0One from Jeff Stanzler:\xa0"For me, the most surprising inclusion so far was the Janis Martin record. You did speak some about why you felt it warranted inclusion, but I\'d love to hear more of your thinking on this, and maybe also on the larger philosophical question of including records that were more like significant signposts than records that had huge impact at the time."\xa0[Excerpt: Janis Martin, “Drugstore Rock & Roll”]\xa0Some of this goes back to some of the stuff I was talking about last week, about how there are multiple factors at play when it comes to any song I\'m choosing, but the Janis Martin one makes a good example of how those factors play into each other.\xa0First, everything I said in that episode is true -- it *is* an important signpost in the transition of rock and roll into a music specifically aimed at white teenagers, and it is the first record I\'ve come across that deals with the 1950s of Happy Days and American Graffiti rather than the other things that were going on in the culture. Even though "Drugstore Rock and Roll" wasn\'t a massively successful record, I think that makes it worth including.\xa0But there were other factors that warranted its inclusion too. The first of these was simply that I wanted to include at least one song by a woman at that point. If you don\'t count the Platters, who had one female member, it had been three months since the last song by a woman. I knew I was going to be doing Wanda Jackson a few weeks later, but it\'s important to me that I show how women were always part of the story of rock and roll. The podcast is going to be biased towards men, because it\'s telling the story of an industry that was massively biased towards men, but where women did have the opportunity to break through I want to give them credit. This is not including "token women" or anything like that -- rather it\'s saying "women have always been part of the story, their part of the story has been ignored, I want to do what I can to redress the balance a bit, so long as I don\'t move into actively misrepresenting history".\xa0Then there\'s the fact that Janis Martin had what to my mind was a fascinating story, and one that allowed me to talk about a lot of social issues of the time, at least in brief.\xa0And finally there\'s the way that her story ties in with those of other people I\'ve covered. Her admiration of Ruth Brown allowed me to tie the story in with the episode on "Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean", and also gave me a way to neatly bookend the story, while showing the influence of one of the songs I\'d already covered. Her working for RCA and with the same musicians as Elvis meant that I could talk a bit more about those musicians, and her being marketed as "the Female Elvis" meant that I could talk about Elvis\' larger cultural impact on the world in 1956, something that needed to be discussed in the series, but which I hadn\'t found space for in an episode on Elvis himself at that point. (And in talking about the various Elvis-based novelty records I was also able to mention a few figures who will turn up in future episodes, planting seeds for later).\xa0[Excerpt: Eddie Cochran and the Holly Twins, “I Want Elvis For Christmas”]\xa0So that\'s the thinking there. Every episode has to serve a bunch of different purposes if I\'m going to tell this story in only five hundred episodes, and the Janis Martin one, I think, did that better than many.As to the larger question of signposts versus impact at the time -- I am trying, for the most part, to tell the story from the point of view of the time we\'re looking at, and look at what mattered to listeners and other musicians at the time. But you also have to fill in the details of stuff that\'s going to affect things in the future. So for example you can\'t talk about REM without first having covered people like Big Star, so even though Big Star weren\'t huge at the time, they\'ll definitely be covered. On the other hand someone like, say, Nick Drake, who had little influence until he was rediscovered decades later, won\'t be covered, except maybe in passing when talking about other artists Joe Boyd produced, because he didn\'t really have an effect on the wider story.\xa0In general, the prime consideration for any song that I include is -- does it advance the overall story I\'m telling? There\'ll be stuff left out that would be in if the only criterion was how people reacted to it at the time, and there\'ll be stuff included which, on its own merits, just wouldn\'t make the list at all. There\'s one Adam Faith album track, for example, that I\'m going to talk about in roughly nine months, which I think is almost certainly not even the best track that Adam Faith recorded that day, which is about as low a bar as it gets. But it\'ll be in there because it\'s an important link in a larger story, even though it\'s not a song that mattered at all at the time.\xa0And a final question from Daniel Helton on whether I considered doing an episode on "Ain\'t Got No Home" by Clarence "Frogman" Henry.\xa0[Excerpt: Clarence “Frogman” Henry, “Ain\'t Got No Home”]\xa0It\'s a great record, but much of what I\'d have to say about it would be stuff about the New Orleans scene and Cosimo Matassa\'s studio and so forth -- stuff that I\'d probably already covered in the episodes on Fats Domino and Lloyd Price (including the episode on Price that\'s coming up later), so it\'d be covering too much of the same ground for me to devote a full episode to it.\xa0If I was going to cover Frogman in the main podcast, it would *probably* be with "I Don\'t Know Why (But I Do)" because that came out at a time when there were far fewer interesting records being made, and I\'d then cover his history including "Ain\'t Got No Home" as part of that, but I don\'t think that\'s likely.\xa0In fact, yeah, I\'ll pencil in "Ain\'t Got No Home" for next week\'s Patreon episode. Don\'t expect much, because those are only ten-minute ones, but it came out at around the same time as next week\'s proper episode was recorded, and it *is* a great record. I\'ll see what I can do for that one.\xa0Anyway, between this and the Patreon bonus episode, I think that\'s all the questions covered. Thanks to everyone who asked one, and if I haven\'t answered your questions fully, please let me know and I\'ll try and reply in the comments to the Patreon post. We\'ll be doing this again next year, so sign up for the Patreon now if you want that. Next week we\'re back to the regular podcasts, with an episode on "Matchbox" by Carl Perkins.Also, I\'m *hoping* -- though not completely guaranteeing yet -- that I\'ll have the book based on the first fifty episodes done and out by this time next week. These things always take longer than I expect, but here\'s hoping there\'ll be an announcement next week. See you then.\xa0 | This week\'s episode of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs is the first of two bonus episodes answering listener questions at the end of the first year of the podcast..

Why not join them?TranscriptHello, and welcome to the first of our two-part question and answer session.\xa0For those who didn\'t hear the little admin podcast I did last week, this week and next week are not regular episodes of the podcast -- I\'m taking two weeks out to get the book version of the first fifty episodes edited and published, and to get a bit of a backlog in writing future episodes. I\'m planning on doing this every year from now on, and doing it this way will mean that the podcast will take exactly ten years, rather than the nine years and eight months it would otherwise take,\xa0But to fill in the gaps while you wait, I asked for any questions from my Patreon backers, about anything to do with the podcast. This week and next week I\'m going to be answering those questions.\xa0Now, I\'ll be honest, I wasn\'t even sure that anyone would have any questions at all, and I was worried I\'d have to think of something else to do next week, but it turns out there are loads of them. I\'ve actually had so many questions, some of them requiring quite long answers, that I\'ll probably have enough to not only do this week and next week\'s episodes based on questions, but to do a bonus backer-only half-hour podcast of more questions next week.\xa0Anyway, to start with, a question that I\'ve been asked quite a bit, and that both Melissa Williams and Claire Boothby asked -- what\'s the theme music for the podcast, and how does it fit in with the show?\xa0[Excerpt: Boswell Sisters, “Rock and Roll”]\xa0The song is called "Rock and Roll", and it\'s from 1934. It is, I believe, the very first song to use the phrase "rock and roll" in those words -- there was an earlier song called "rocking and rolling", but I think it\'s the first one to use the phrase "rock and roll".\xa0It\'s performed by the Boswell Sisters, a jazz vocal trio from the thirties whose lead singer, Connee Boswell, influenced Ella Fitzgerald among others, and it was written by Richard Whiting and Sidney Clare.\xa0They actually wrote it for Shirley Temple -- they\'re the people who wrote "On the Good Ship Lollipop" -- but it was turned down for use in one of her films so the Boswells did it instead.\xa0The version I\'m using is actually the version the Boswells sang in a film, Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round, rather than the proper studio recording. That\'s just because the film version was easier for me to obtain.\xa0As for why I\'m using it, a few reasons. One is that it\'s of historical note, as I said, because it\'s the first song to use the phrase, and that seemed appropriate for a podcast on the history of rock music. The other main reason is that it\'s in the public domain, and I try wherever possible to keep to copyright laws. I think all the uses of music in the podcast fall under fair use or fair dealing, because they\'re short excerpts used for educational purposes and I link to legal versions of the full thing, but using a recording as the theme music doesn\'t, so I had to choose something that was in the public domain.\xa0Next we have a question from David Gerard: "piece of trivia from waaaaay back: in "Choo Choo Ch\'Boogie", why "*democratic* fellows named Mack"? what\'s that line about?"\xa0[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, “Choo Choo Ch\'Boogie”]\xa0Well, I\'ve never actually seen an interview with the writers of the song, but I can hazard two educated guesses. One of them is boring and probably right, the other one is more interesting and probably wrong.\xa0The boring and probably right one is very simple -- the word "democratic" scans, and there aren\'t that many words that fit that syllable pattern. There are some -- "existential", "sympathetic", "diuretic" -- but not that many, and "democratic" happens to be assonant with the song\'s rhyme scheme, too -- the "cratic" doesn\'t actually rhyme with all those "alack", "track" "jack", and so on, but it sounds good in combination with them. I suspect that the solution is as simple as that.\xa0The more interesting one is probably not the case, and I say this because the songwriters who wrote "Choo Choo Ch\'Boogie" were white. BUT, Milt Gabler, one of the three credited writers, was familiar enough with black culture that this might be the case.\xa0Now, the character in "Choo Choo Ch\'Boogie" is a soldier returning from the second world war -- we know this from the first two lines, "Heading for the station with a pack on my back/I\'m tired of transportation in the back of a hack", plus the date the song was recorded, 1946. So we\'ve got someone who\'s recently been discharged from the army and has no job.\xa0BUT, given it\'s Louis Jordan singing, we can presume this someone is black. And that puts the song in a rather different light. Because 1946 is slap in the middle of what\'s known as the second great migration -- the second big wave of black people moving from the rural deep south to the urban north and (in the case of the second migration, but not really the first) the west. This is something we\'ve touched on a bit in the podcast, because it was the second great migration that was, in large part, responsible for the popularity of the urban jump blues that became R&B -- and separately, it was also the cause of the creation of the electric blues in Chicago.And Chicago is an interesting one here. Because Chicago was one of the biggest destinations -- possibly the single biggest destination -- for black people looking to move around this time.\xa0And so we recontextualise a bit. Our black soldier has returned to the US, but he\'s travelling by train to somewhere where there\'s no job waiting for him, and there\'s no mention of going to see his friends or his wife or anything like that. So maybe, he\'s someone who grew up in the rural deep south, but has decided to use the opportunity of his discharge from the military to go and build himself a new life in one of the big cities, quite probably Chicago. And he\'s looking for work and doesn\'t have many contacts there. We can tell that because in the second verse he\'s looking at the classified ads for jobs in the paper.\xa0[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, “Choo Choo Ch\'Boogie”]\xa0Now, at this time, especially during and immediately after the Second World War, the single biggest employer in the US in the big cities was the government, and in the big cities there was a *lot* of patronage being handed out by the party in charge -- basically, in most of the big cities, the political parties, especially the Democrats at this time, were an arm of organised crime, with the mayor of the city acting much as a Mafia don would. And the only way to get a job, if you didn\'t have any special qualifications, if you weren\'t a "man with a knack" as the song puts it -- especially a sinecure where you didn\'t have to work very hard -- the only way to get such a job was to be owed a favour by the local Democratic Party.\xa0Now, in Chicago -- again, Chicago is not named in the song, but it would seem the most logical place for our protagonist to be travelling, and this was true of other big Northern cities like New York, too -- the Democratic Party was run at this time almost entirely by Irish-Americans. The Mayor of Chicago, at the time was Edward Kelly, and he was the head of a formidable electoral machine, a coalition of several different ethnic groups, but dominated by Irish people.\xa0So, if you wanted one of those jobs that were being handed out, you\'d have to do favours for Kelly\'s Irish Democrats -- you\'d have to pal around with Democratic fellows named Mac.\xa0[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, “Choo Choo Ch\'Boogie”]\xa0Now I come to a few questions that I\'m going to treat as one -- questions from Jeff Stanzler, Steven Hinkle, and Matthew Elmslie. They ask, between them, how I plan out what songs I\'m going to include, and if I have to make difficult choices about what to include and what not to include, and who the most significant performer I don\'t plan to include at all is. Jeremy Wilson also asks if I\'ve got all five hundred songs planned out and how close to the current day I plan to get.\xa0These are all, actually, very different questions, but they all centre around the same thing, and so I\'m going to address them all together here. If any of you don\'t think I\'ve addressed your question sufficiently, please say and I\'ll come back to it next week.\xa0Now, I don\'t have the whole five hundred songs mapped out. To do that would be for me to assume that in the next nine years none of my research will cause me to revise my opinions on what\'s important. So far, in the first fifty, I\'ve not really had to make any difficult choices at all -- the only things I\'ve wished I could include have either been things where there\'s just not enough information out there to put together an interesting episode, or where my own self-imposed restrictions like the starting point cut them off. Like if I\'d decided to start a few years earlier, I *would* have included Jimmie Rodgers, but you have to have a cut-off point, and if I hadn\'t set 1938 and the Goodman Carnegie Hall concerts as a good starting point I could have gone all the way back at least to the mid nineteenth century, and it would have been more the prehistory of rock.\xa0Maybe I\'ll do that as a project when I\'ve finished this one.\xa0But even those people I\'ve excluded, I\'ve ended up being able to cover as bonus episodes, so I\'ve not really had to leave anything out.\xa0But that means so far, since we\'re still really at the very beginning of rock and roll, there have been no difficult choices. That will change as the story goes on -- in the sixties there are so many important records that I\'m going to have to cut out a lot, and by the mid-seventies rock has diversified so much that there will be *tons* of things I\'ll just have to gloss over. But right now I\'ve had to make no tough decisions.\xa0Now, the way I do this -- I have a list of about two hundred or so songs that I\'m pretty sure are going to make the final list. Like I\'m sure nobody will be surprised to find that I\'ll be covering, say, "Peggy Sue", "Satisfaction", "Stairway to Heaven", "God Save the Queen" and "Walk This Way". You can\'t leave those things out of the story and still have it be anything like an actual history of rock music. That\'s my sort of master list, but I don\'t consult that all that often.\xa0What I do, is at any given point I\'m working on the next ten scripts simultaneously -- I do things that way because I use the same research materials for multiple episodes, so for example I was writing the Chess episodes all at the same time, and the rockabilly episodes all at the same time, so I might be reading a biography of Carl Perkins, see an interesting fact about Johnny Cash, and stick the fact in the Johnny Cash episode or whatever. I have another list of about twenty probables, just titles, that I\'m planning to work on soon after. Every time I finish a script, I look through the list of probables, pull out a good one to work on next, and add that to the ten I\'m writing. I\'ll also, when I\'m doing that, add any more titles I\'ve thought of to the list. So I know exactly what I\'m going to be doing in the next two and a half months, have a pretty good idea of what I\'m doing for the next six, and only a basic outline after that.\xa0That means that I can\'t necessarily say for certain who I *won\'t* be including. There will, undoubtedly, be some significant performers who don\'t get included, but I can\'t say who until we get past their part in the story.Steven also asked as part of this if I\'ve determined an end point. Yes I have. That may change over the next nine years, but when I was planning out the podcast -- even before it became a podcast, when I was thinking of it as just a series of books -- I thought of what I think would make the perfect ending for the series -- a song from 1999 -- and I\'m going to use that.\xa0Related to that, William Maybury asked "Why 1999?"\xa0Well, a few reasons -- partly because it\'s a nice cut-off point -- the end of the nineties and so on. Partly because it\'s about the time that I disengaged totally from popular culture -- I like plenty of music from the last couple of decades, but not really much that has made any impact on the wider world. Partly because, when I finish the podcast, 1999 will be thirty years ago, which seems like about the right sort of length of time to have a decent historical perspective on things; partly because one of the inspirations for this was Richard Thompson\'s 1000 Years of Popular Music and that cut off -- well, it cut off in 2001, but close enough; and partly because the final song I\'m going to cover came out then, and it\'s a good ending song.\xa0William also asked "What\'s the bottom standard for notability to be covered? (We heard about "Ooby Dooby" before "Crying," are we going to hear about "Take My Tip" before "Space Oddity"? Bootlegs beyond the Million Dollar Band that you mentioned on Twitter? Archival groundbreakers like Parson Sound?)"\xa0[Excerpt: Roy Orbison, “Ooby Dooby”]\xa0That\'s an interesting question... there\'s no bottom standard for notability *as such*. It\'s more that notability is just one of a number of factors I\'m using to decide on the songs I cover. So the question I ask myself when I\'m choosing one to include isn\'t just "is this song influential or important?" though that\'s a primary one. There\'s also "is there a particularly fascinating story behind the recording of this track?" "Does this illustrate something important about music or about cultural history?", “Is this just a song I really like and want to talk about?” And also, "does this provide a link between otherwise disconnected strands of the story?" There are also things like "have I not covered anything by a woman or a black person or whatever in a while?" because one of the things I want to do is make sure that this isn\'t just the story of white men, however much they dominate the narrative, and I know I will have to consciously correct for my own biases, so I pay attention to that.\xa0And there\'s *also* the question of mixing the stuff everyone knows about with the stuff they\'ll be hearing about for the first time -- you have to cover "Satisfaction" because everyone would notice it\'s missing, but if you just do Beatles-Stones-Led Zep-Pink Floyd-whoever\'s-on-the-cover-of-Mojo-this-month, nobody\'s going to hear anything they can\'t get in a million different places.\xa0So to take the example of "Ooby Dooby", it\'s only a relatively important track in itself, though it is notable for being the start of Roy Orbison\'s career. But it also ties Orbison in to the story of Sam Phillips and Sun Records, and thus into the stories of Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and so on. It allows me to set up something for the future while tying the story together and moving the stories of multiple people forward a bit.\xa0So... as a tiny bit of a spoiler, though this won\'t be too much of a surprise to those who\'ve read my book California Dreaming, I am almost certainly going to cover the GTOs, who are almost a footnote to a footnote. I\'ll cover them because their one album was co-produced by Frank Zappa and Lowell George, later of Little Feat, it featured the Jeff Beck Group, including Rod Stewart, and it had songs co-written by Davy Jones of the Monkees -- and the songs Davy Jones co-wrote were about Captain Beefheart and about Nick St Nicholas of Steppenwolf. That\'s an enormous nexus of otherwise unconnected musicians, and it allows me to move several strands of the story forwards at the same time -- and it also allows me to talk about groupie culture and misogyny in the rock world from the perspective of the women who were involved.\xa0[Excerpt: GTOs, “The Captain\'s Fat Theresa Shoes”]\xa0I\'m not *definitely* going to cover that, but I\'m likely to -- and I\'m likely to cover it rather than covering some more well-known but less interesting track.\xa0Dean Mattson asks what my favourite three books are on the music I\'ve covered so far. That\'s a good question. I\'m actually going to name more than three, though...\xa0The book that has been of most value in terms of sheer information density is Before Elvis, by Larry Birnbaum. This is a book that covers the prehistory of rock and roll to an absurd level of detail, and it\'s absolutely wonderful, but it\'s also absolutely hard going. Birnbaum seems to have heard, without exaggeration, every record released before 1954, and he\'ll do things like trace a musical motif from a Chuck Berry solo to a Louis Jordan record, and from the Louis Jordan record to one by Count Basie, and from that to Blind Blake, to Blind Lemon Jefferson, to Jelly Roll Morton, to a 1918 recording by Wilbur Sweatman\'s Jazz Orchestra. And he does that kind of thing in every single paragraph of a 474-page book. He must reference, at a very conservative estimate, five thousand different recordings.\xa0Now this is information density at the expense of everything else, and Birnbaum\'s book has something of the air of those dense 18th and 19th century omnium gatherum type books like Origin of Species or Capital or The Golden Bough, or The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, where there are a million examples provided to prove a point in the most exhaustive detail possible. I\'ve done entire episodes of the podcast which are just expanding on a single paragraph of Birnbaum and providing enough context and narrative for a lay audience to appreciate it. It\'s not a book you read for fun. It\'s a book you read a paragraph at a time, with a notepad, looking up recordings of all the songs he covers as he gets to them. But if you\'re willing to put that time in, the book will reward you with a truly comprehensive understanding of American popular music of the period up to 1954.\xa0The book that surprised me the most with its quality was Billy Bragg\'s Roots, Radicals and Rockers: How Skiffle Changed the World. I\'ve always quite liked Bragg as a songwriter, but I\'d never expected him to be much good at writing a work of non-fiction. I only actually got hold of a copy because it had just come out when I started the podcast, and it had a certain amount of publicity behind it. I thought if I didn\'t read it I would then get people asking questions like, "But Billy Bragg says X, why do you say Y?"\xa0But in fact, if you want a book on the skiffle movement and early British rock and roll, you could not do better than this one. It\'s exhaustively researched, and it\'s written in a staggeringly readable prose style, by someone who has spent his life as both a folk musician and a political activist, and so understands the culture of the skiffle movement on a bone-deep level. If there was one book I was to urge people to read just to read a really good, entertaining, book, it would be that one.\xa0The book that\'s been the most use to me is Honkers and Shouters by Arnold Shaw -- an account of the 50s R&B scene from someone who was part of it. Shaw worked for a music publisher at the time, and had a lot of contacts in the industry. When he came to write the book in the 70s, he was able to call upon those contacts and interview a huge number of people -- many of whom gave him their last interviews before they died. The podcast wouldn\'t be as good without some of the other books, but it wouldn\'t exist at all without this one, because Shaw added so much to our knowledge of 50s R&B.\xa0But I also want to recommend all of Peter Guralnick\'s books, but especially Last Train to Memphis, the first of his two-volume biography of Elvis Presley. Guralnick\'s written a lot of books on Southern US music, including ones on Sam Phillips and Sam Cooke which have also been important resources. But the thing that sets Guralnick apart as a writer is his ability to make the reader thoroughly understand why people admired extraordinarily flawed individuals, but without minimising their flaws. With all Guralnick\'s biographies, I\'ve come away both thinking less of his subjects as people *and* admiring them more as creators. He doesn\'t flinch from showing the men he writes about as egocentric, often misogynist, manipulators who damaged the people around him, but nor does he turn his books into Albert Goldman style denunciations of his subjects.Indeed, in the case of Elvis, I\'ve got more understanding of who Elvis was from Guralnick than from any of the hundreds of thousands of other words I\'ve read on the subject. Elvis as he turns up in this podcast is the Elvis that Guralnick wrote about, rather than anything else.\xa0Magic at Mungos asked what the best song I\'ve discovered, that I hadn\'t heard before doing the podcast, is.\xa0Well, I\'ve discovered very little doing the podcast, really. The only song I\'ve covered that I didn\'t know before starting work on the podcast was "Ko Ko Mo", and I can\'t say that one was a favourite of mine -- it\'s not a bad record by any means, but it\'s not one that changed my life or anything. But there have been a few things that I\'ve heard that I didn\'t do full episodes about but which made an impression -- the McHouston Baker album I talked about towards the end of the “Love is Strange” episode, for example, is well worth a listen.\xa0[Excerpt: McHouston Baker, “Alabama March”]\xa0What the podcast *has* done, though, is make me reevaluate a few people I already knew about. In particular I\'d been very dismissive of Lonnie Donegan previously -- I just hadn\'t got him -- but having to cover him for the podcast meant listening to all his fifties and early sixties work, and I came out of that hugely impressed.\xa0I had a similar experience with Bo Diddley, who I *did* admire beforehand, and whose music I knew fairly well, but listening to his work as a body of work, rather than as isolated tracks and albums, made me think of him as a far more subtle, interesting, musician and songwriter than I\'d given him the credit for previously.\xa0Another one from William Maybury, who wants to know about my recording setup. I actually don\'t have very good recording equipment -- I just use a thirty-pound USB condenser mic plugged into my laptop on my dining room table. This is partly because I don\'t have a huge budget for the podcast, but also because there\'s only so much that can be done with the sound quality anyway. I live in an acoustically... fairly horrible... house, which has a weird reverb to a lot of the rooms. It\'s a terraced house with relatively thin walls, so you can hear the neighbours, and I live underneath a major flight path and by a main road in a major city, often driven on by people with the kind of in-car sound systems that inflict themselves on everyone nearby.\xa0While I would like better equipment, at a certain point all it would be doing is giving a really clear recording of the neighbours\' arguments or the TV shows they\'re watching, and the sound systems in the cars driving past – like today, I was woken at 3AM by someone driving by, playing “Hold On” by Wilson Phillips in their car so loud it woke me up. Acoustic perfection when recording somewhere like here would just be wasted.\xa0So I make up for this by doing a *LOT* of editing on the podcast. I\'ve not done so much on this episode, because these are specifically designed to be low-stress episodes for me, but I\'ve been known to spend literally twenty hours on editing some individual episodes, cutting out extraneous noises, fixing sound quality issues, and so on.\xa0And finally for this week, Russell Stallings asks, "my son Pete wants to know if you are a musician? And , who is your favorite beatle?"\xa0The answer to whether I\'m a musician is "yes and no", I\'m afraid. I can play a lot of instruments badly. I\'m dyspraxic, so I have natural limits to my dexterity, and so no matter how much I practiced I never became more than a competent rhythm guitarist at best. But I manage to be not very good on a whole variety of instruments -- I\'ve been in bands before, and played guitar, keyboards, bass, mandolin, ukulele, and banjo on recordings -- and I can, more or less, get a tune out of a clarinet or saxophone with a good run-up.\xa0Where I think my own musical skills lie is as a songwriter, arranger, and producer. I\'ve not done much of that in over a decade, as I don\'t really have the personality for collaboration, but I did a lot of it in my twenties and thirties. Here\'s an example, from a band I used to be in called The National Pep.\xa0[Excerpt: The National Pep, "Think Carefully For Victory"]\xa0In the section you just heard, I wrote the music, co-produced, and played all the instruments except the drums. Tilt -- who does a podcast called The Sitcom Club I know some of you listen to -- sang lead, wrote the lyrics, played drums, and co-produced.\xa0So, sort of a musician, sort of not.\xa0As to the question about my favourite Beatle, John Lennon has always been my favourite, though as I grow older I\'m growing more and more to appreciate Paul McCartney. I\'m also, though, someone who thinks the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts in that particular case. All four of them did solo work I like a lot, but also the group was immensely better than any of the solo work. It\'s very, very, rare that every member of a band is utterly irreplaceable -- normally, even when every member of a band is talented, you can imagine them carrying on with one or more members swapped out for other, equally competent, people. But in the case of the Beatles, I don\'t think you can.\xa0Anyway, that\'s all for this week. I\'ll be answering more questions next week, then the podcast will be back to normal on October the sixth with an episode on Carl Perkins.

Why not join them?TranscriptWelcome to the fiftieth episode of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs. We\'re now ten percent of the way through our story, and also most of the way through 1956.I\'m told that when history podcasts hit a big round number, it\'s customary for them to do a jumping-on episode, perhaps a "story so far" which covers everything that\'s been discussed up to that point, but in brief, so that new listeners can get up to speed.That\'s sort of what I\'m about to do here. This week, we\'re going to look at a hit song from 1956, but by someone whose career interacted with almost everyone in the first twenty or so episodes of the podcast.We\'re going to look again at some of that old music, not as isolated records by different artists, but as stages in the career of a single individual. We\'re going to look at someone who was a jobbing musician, who\'d take any job that was on offer, but who by virtue of just being a hard-working competent jobbing player and arranger managed to have an astonishing influence on the development of music.While rock and roll was primarily a vocal music, it wasn\'t a completely clean break with the past, and for most of the decades from the 1920s through to the early 50s, if you wanted music for dancing you would want instrumental groups. The big bands did employ vocalists, of course, but you can tell who the focus was on from looking at the names of the bands -- the Benny Goodman Orchestra, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, the Count Basie orchestra -- all of the leaders of the big bands were instrumentalists. They played clarinet or trombone or piano, they didn\'t sing.It was only with the musicians union strikes of the 1940s, which we\'ve talked about before, that more through necessity than anything else the music industry moved from being dominated by instrumental music to being dominated by singers. But well into the 1960s we\'ll still be seeing rock and roll hits that were purely instrumental. Indeed, we probably wouldn\'t have rock and roll guitar bands at all without instrumental groups like the Ventures in the US or the Shadows in the UK who had hits with pure instrumental records.And one of the greatest of the early rock and roll instrumentals was by someone who didn\'t actually consider himself a rock and roll musician. It\'s a record that influenced everyone from James Brown to the Beach Boys, and it\'s called "Honky Tonk":[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Honky Tonk"]There is surprisingly little information out there about Bill Doggett, for someone who had such an impact on the fields of rock and roll, blues, jazz, and soul. There are no books about his life, and the only website devoted to him is one designed by his nephew, which... has all the flaws one might expect from a website put together about someone\'s uncle.Doggett was born in 1916 in Philadelphia, and he moved to New York in his late teens and formed his own band, for which he was the piano player. But in 1938, Lucky Millinder was looking for a new band -- the way Millinder worked was that he bought out, and took over the leadership, of existing bands, which then became "the Lucky Millinder Orchestra".This incarnation of the Lucky Millinder Orchestra, the one that was put together by Doggett before Millinder took the band over, is the one that got a residency at the Savoy after Chick Webb\'s band stopped playing there, and like Webb\'s band this group was managed by Moe Gale. Doggett stayed on with Millinder as his pianist, and while with the group he appeared with Millinder in the 1938 all-black film Paradise in Harlem, playing on this song:[Excerpt: Lucky Millinder, "I\'ve Got To Put You Down"]Doggett was, from what I can tell, the de facto musical director for Millinder\'s band in this period -- Millinder was a frontman and occasional singer, but he couldn\'t play an instrument and was reliant on the musicians in his band to work the arrangements out for him.Doggett was in the band when Moe Gale suggested that Sister Rosetta Tharpe would work well paired up with Millinder\'s main singer, Trevor Bacon, in the same way that Louis Jordan and Ella Fitzgerald had worked well together in the Chick Webb band. Doggett was the pianist during the whole of Tharpe\'s time with the Millinder band, and he co-composed, with Millinder, the song that later gave its title to a biography of Tharpe, "Shout! Sister, Shout!":[Excerpt: Rosetta Tharpe, "Shout! Sister, Shout!"]If you listen to any of Tharpe\'s big band recordings from her time with Millinder, it\'s Doggett on the piano, and I strongly suspect it was Doggett who came up with the arrangements. Listen for example to his playing on "Lonesome Road", another song that the MIllinder band performed on film:[Excerpt: Rosetta Tharpe, "Lonesome Road"]The Millinder band were pivotal in the move from swing music to R&B, and Doggett was an important part in that move. While he\'d left the band before they took on later singers like Wynonie Harris and Ruth Brown, he had helped set the band up to be the kind of band that those singers would feel comfortable in.Doggett was also in the band when they had their biggest hit, a song called "When the Lights Go on Again (All Over the World)":[Excerpt: Lucky Millinder, "When the Lights Go on Again (All Over the World)"]That\'s most notable now for being one of the first recordings of a young trumpeter who was just starting out, by the name of Dizzy Gillespie. Gillespie was quickly sacked by Millinder, who had a habit of getting rid of musicians before they reached their full potential.I\'ve not been able to find out why Doggett left Millinder -- whether he was one of those musicians who was sacked, or whether he just wanted to move on to other things -- but whatever the reason, it can\'t have been anything that put a stain on his reputation, because Doggett remained with Millinder\'s manager, Moe Gale.We\'ve mentioned Gale before several times, but he was the manager of almost every important black act based in New York in the late thirties and early forties, as well as running the Savoy Club, which we talked about in several of the earliest episodes of the podcast. Gale managed Millinder and Rosetta Tharpe, and also managed the Ink Spots, Ella Fitzgerald, Chick Webb, and Louis Jordan, and so whenever one of his acts needed a musician, he would tend to find them from his existing pool of talent.And so this is how, straight after leaving Lucky Millinder\'s band, Doggett found himself working for another Gale act, the Ink Spots. He joined them as their pianist and arranger, and stayed with them for several years:[Excerpt: The Ink Spots, "I\'ll Get By"]The Ink Spots, if you don\'t remember, were a vocal quartet who became the most popular black act of the forties, and who stuck to a unique formula based around Bill Kenny\'s high tenor and Hoppy Jones\' low spoken bass. They had hit after hit during the forties with songs that all sound remarkably similar, and in the mid forties those songs were arranged by Bill Doggett.He was with the group for two years -- starting with the classic line-up of the group, and staying with them through Charlie Fuqua being drafted and Deek Watson being fired. While he was a sideman rather than a full member of the group, he was important enough to them that he now gets counted in lists of proper members put together by historians of the band. He ended up leaving them less than two weeks before Hoppy Jones died, and during that time he played on fourteen of their hit singles, almost all of them sticking to the same formula they\'d used previously, the "top and bottom":[Excerpt: The Ink Spots, "Ev\'ry Night About This Time"]The different acts managed by Moe Gale all sat in with each other when needed, so for example Trevor Bacon, the male vocalist with Millinder\'s band, temporarily joined the Ink Spots when Deke Watson got sick for a few weeks. And so during the times when the Ink Spots weren\'t touring, Doggett would also perform with Ella Fitzgerald, who was also managed by Gale.[Excerpt: Ella Fitzgerald, "Time Alone Will Tell"]And indeed, during the end of Doggett\'s time with the Ink Spots, Fitzgerald recorded a number of hit singles with the group, which of course featured Doggett on the piano. That included this one, which later went on to be the basis of "Train Kept A-Rollin\'", which we looked at a few episodes back:[Excerpt: Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots, "Cow Cow Boogie"]Doggett moved over full time to become Ella\'s arranger and pianist at some point during the couple of weeks between Deek Watson leaving the Ink Spots and Hoppy Jones dying, in early October 1944, and stayed with her for a couple of years, before moving on to Illinois Jacquet\'s band, taking the same role again, in the band that introduced the honking tenor saxophone into R&B, and thus into rock and roll:[Excerpt: Illinois Jacquet, "Doggin\' With Doggett"]He also played on one of the most important records in forties R&B -- Johnny Otis\' "Harlem Nocturne", the first hit for the man who would go on to produce most of the great R&B artists of the fifties:[Excerpt: Johnny Otis, "Harlem Nocturne"]And he also led his own band for a while, the Bill Doggett Octet. They were the ones who recorded "Be-Baba-Leba" with Helen Humes on vocals -- the song that probably inspired Gene Vincent to write a very similarly named song a few years later:[Excerpt: Helen Humes, "Be-Baba-Leba"]He then moved on to Louis Jordan\'s band full time, and this is where his career really starts.Jordan was another act in Moe Gale\'s stable, and indeed just like the Ink Spots he\'d had hits duetting with Ella Fitzgerald, who he\'d first worked with back in the 1930s in Chick Webb\'s band. He was also, as you may remember from earlier episodes, the leader of the most popular R&B group in the late forties and early fifties -- the one that inspired everyone from Chuck Berry to Bill Haley. And as with his tenure with the Ink Spots, Doggett was in Jordan\'s band during its period of peak commercial success.The timeline for who Doggett played with when, as you can probably tell, is all over the place, because he seemed to be playing with two or three acts at any given time. And so officially, if you look at the timelines, so far as they exist, you see that it\'s generally claimed that Bill Doggett joined Louis Jordan in 1949. But I\'ve seen interviews with members of Jordan\'s organisation that suggest he joined much earlier, but he would alternate with Jordan\'s other piano player, Wild Bill Davis.The way they worked, according to Berle Adams, who was involved in Jordan\'s management, was that Davis would spend a week on the road as Jordan\'s piano player, while Doggett would spend the same week writing arrangements for the group, and then they would swap over, and Doggett would go out on the road while Davis would write arrangements.Either way, after a while, Doggett became the sole pianist for the group, as Davis struck out on his own, and Doggett once again basically became the musical director for one of the biggest bands in the R&B business. Doggett is often credited as the person who rewrote "Saturday Night Fish Fry" into one of Jordan\'s biggest hits from its inauspicious original version, though Jordan is credited on the record:[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, "Saturday Night Fish Fry"]During his time with Jordan, Doggett continued playing on records for Ella Fitzgerald, Bill Kenny of the Ink Spots, and other artists, but he was paying close attention to Wild Bill Davis, who he had replaced in Jordan\'s group. Davis had discovered the possibilities in a new musical instrument, the Hammond organ, and had formed a trio consisting of himself, a guitarist, and a drummer to exploit these possibilities in jazz music:[Excerpt: Wild Bill Davis, "Things Ain\'t What They Used To Be"]Doggett was also fascinated by this instrument, especially when hearing it up close, as when Davis rejoined Jordan\'s band to record "Tamburitza Boogie", which had Doggett on piano and Davis on the Hammond organ:[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, "Tamburitza Boogie"]When Doggett left Jordan\'s band, he decided to form an organ trio just like Davis\'. The only problem was that it was just like Davis\'. His group had the same instrumentation, and Doggett and Davis had very similar playing styles. Still, Henry Glover got him a contract with King Records, and he started recording Hammond organ blues tracks in the Davis style:[Excerpt: Bill Doggett Trio, "Big Dog"]Davis and Doggett between them gave the Hammond organ its prominence in the world of jazz, R&B, and soul music. The Hammond organ has an odd image, as most people associate it with the cheesiest sort of light entertainment -- certainly for anyone in Britain of the generation older than mine, for example, the name it conjures up is Reggie Dixon, possibly the least funky man ever. But in that part of music which is the intersection of jazz and R&B -- the part of music inhabited by Jimmy Smith, Booker T Jones, Ray Charles, Georgie Fame, Billy Preston and others -- the Hammond organ has become an essential instrument, used so differently that one might almost compare it to the violin, where the instrument is referred to as a fiddle when it\'s played on folk or country songs.And that comes from Davis and Doggett and their almost simultaneous invention of a new style of keyboards for the new style of music that was coming up in the late forties and early fifties.But after a year or two of playing in an organ trio, Doggett decided that he didn\'t want to keep making records that sounded so much like the ones Wild Bill Davis was making -- he didn\'t want to be seen as a copy. And so to vary the style, he decided to take on a honking saxophone player to be the group\'s lead instrumentalist, while Doggett would concentrate on providing a rhythmic pad. This lineup of his group would go on to make the record that would make Doggett\'s name."Honky Tonk, Parts 1 and 2" came about almost by accident. As Doggett told the story, his biggest hit started out at a dance in Lima, Ohio on a Sunday night. The group were playing their normal set and people were dancing as normal, but then in between songs Billy Butler, Doggett\'s guitarist, just started noodling an instrumental line on his bass strings:[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Honky Tonk" intro]This hadn\'t been planned -- he was just noodling around, as all guitarists will do when given five seconds silence. But the audience started dancing to it, and if you\'re in a bar band and the audience is dancing, you keep doing what you\'re doing. As Butler was just playing a simple twelve-bar blues pattern, the rest of the group fell in with the riff he was playing, and he started soloing over them:[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Honky Tonk" guitar soloing]After three choruses of this, Butler nodded to Clifford Scott, the group\'s saxophone player, to take over, and Scott started playing a honking saxophone version of what Butler had been playing:[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Honky Tonk", sax]After Scott played through it a few times, he looked over to Doggett to see if Doggett wanted to take a solo too. Doggett shook his head. The song had already been going about five minutes and what Butler and Scott had been playing was enough. The group quickly brought the song to a close using a standard blues outro:[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Honky Tonk", outro]And that would have been the end of that. It\'s the kind of thing that bar bands have jammed a million times, the sort of thing that if you\'re a musician you think nothing of. They laughed at the end of the song, happy that they\'d pulled off something that spontaneous and the audience had been OK with it, and carried on with the rest of their planned set.But then, a couple of songs later, someone in the audience came up and asked them if they could play that hot new song they\'d been playing before again, not realising it had just been a spur-of-the-moment jam. OK, you give the audience what they want, the band members could remember more or less what they\'d been playing, so they played it again. And the crowd went wild.And they played it again. And the crowd went wild again.By the end of the night they\'d played that new song, the one they\'d improvised based on Billy Butler\'s guitar noodling, ten times.Doggett immediately phoned Syd Nathan at King Records, his label, and told him that they had a hit on their hands and needed to get it out straight away. But there was one problem -- the song was over five minutes long, and a shellac 78RPM disc, which was still the most popular format for R&B music, could only hold three minutes per side. It would have to be a double-sided record.Nathan hated putting out records where the song continued onto the other side, because the jukebox operators who were his main customers didn\'t like them. But he eventually agreed, and Doggett and his band got together in the studio and recorded their new instrumental in a single take. It was released as "Honky Tonk Part One" and part two, and they pressed up five thousand copies in the first week. Those sold out straight away, so the next week they pressed up twelve thousand five hundred copies. Those also sold straight away, and so for the next few weeks they started pressing up a hundred thousand copies a week.The song went to number one on the R&B charts, and became the biggest selling R&B song of 1956, spending thirteen weeks in total at number one -- dropping down the charts and then back up again. It also reached number two on the pop charts, an astonishing feat for an R&B instrumental. It became a staple for cover bands, and it was recorded by the obvious instrumental acts like the Ventures and Duane Eddy -- and indeed Duane Eddy\'s whole style seems to have come from "Honky Tonk" -- but by other people you might not expect, like Buddy Holly:[Excerpt: Buddy Holly, "Honky Tonk"]The Beach Boys:[Excerpt: The Beach Boys, "Honky Tonk"]And even James Brown:[Excerpt: James Brown, Honky Tonk"]\xa0Doggett never had another hit quite as big as "Honky Tonk", though his next few records, based on the "Honky Tonk" pattern, also made the top five on the R&B chart:[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Slow Walk"]He had ten more R&B top thirty hits over the course of the 1950s.But Doggett was being promoted as a rock and roll act, and playing bills with other rock and roll stars, and he didn\'t really feel comfortable in the rock and roll world. When "Honky Tonk" came out, he was forty years old -- by far the oldest of the people who had rock and roll hits in the mid fifties -- and he was a jazz organ player, not a Little Richard type. He was also stuck repeating a formula -- over the decade after "Honky Tonk" parts one and two he recorded tracks like "Honky Tonk (vocal version)", "Hippy Dippy", "Blip Blop", "Yocky Dock", and "Honky Tonk Bossa Nova".His career as a charting artist more or less stopped after 1960, when he made the mistake of asking Syd Nathan if he could have a higher royalty rate, given the millions of dollars his recordings had brought in to King Records, and King dropped him. But it didn\'t stop his career as a working musician. In 1962 he teamed up again with Ella Fitzgerald, who wanted to go back to making music with a bit more rhythm than her recent albums of ballads. The resulting album, "Rhythm is my Business", featured Doggett\'s arrangements and Hammond organ very prominently:[Excerpt: Ella Fitzgerald, "Hallelujah I Love Him So"]He also teamed up in 1969 with James Brown, who around that time was trying to pay back his dues to others who\'d been artists on King Records when Brown had started with them in the fifties. As well as recording his album "Thinking About Little Willie John and Other Nice Things", Brown had also been producing records for Hank Ballard, and now it was Bill Doggett\'s turn. For Doggett, Brown produced and wrote "Honky Tonk Popcorn":[Excerpt: Bill Doggett, "Honky Tonk Popcorn"]Doggett spent most of the rest of his life touring the oldies circuit, a respected organist who would play hundreds of shows a year, until his death in 1996 aged eighty. He played "Honky Tonk" at every show, saying "I just wouldn\'t be Bill Doggett if I didn\'t play \'Honky Tonk\'. That\'s what the people pay to hear, so that\'s what they get." | This is just a quick note to tell people about the plans for the next couple of weeks.Later today I\'ll be putting up episode fifty of the podcast, which is in a way a summary of all the episodes that came previously.I will then be doing two episodes that aren\'t like the rest of the series. I\'ve realised that if I take two weeks off every year, I can get the podcast to run to exactly ten years rather than nine years and eight months, and i can use those two weeks to catch up on research for future episodes, and to edit and publish the book based on the first fifty episodes.But I\'m not going to leave you without new episodes for that time, so next week and the week after I plan to do Q&A episodes. I\'m going to invite my Patreon backers to ask me any questions they want about the podcast – whether about why I haven\'t covered someone yet, or my technique for making the podcast, or a detail they didn\'t understand, or anything else. I\'m then going to answer those questions in the episodes on the twenty-second and twenty-ninth of September, before getting back to episode fifty-one proper on the sixth of October.(If I don\'t get enough questions to fill up two episodes... then I\'ll think of something else to do for the twenty-ninth).If you want to ask a question for these Q&A episodes, sign up for the Patreon, which starts at just a dollar a month and can be found at patreon.com/andrewhickey | Welcome to episode forty-eight of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs. This one looks at "Love is Strange" by Mickey and Sylvia, and how a reluctant bluesman who wrote books on jazz guitar, and a failed child star who would later become the mother of hip-hop, made a classic.

Why not join them?TranscriptWe\'ve talked before, of course, about the great Bo Diddley, and his main contributions to rock and roll, but today we\'re going to talk about a song he co-wrote which ended up, in a roundabout way, contributing to many other genres, in ways that we won\'t properly see until we reach the 1970s. A song that, for all that it is a classic that almost everyone knows, is still rarely treated as an important song in music history.Yet this is a song that\'s a nexus of all sorts of music, which connects the birth of hip-hop to the compositions of Iannis Xenakis, by way of Doc Pomus, Bo Diddley, and Ike and Tina Turner.The story of this song starts with Billy Stewart. These days, Billy Stewart is a largely unknown figure -- a minor blues man on Chess who was too close to soul music for the Chess Chicago blues fans to take him to heart.Stewart, like many of the musicians we\'re looking at at the moment, started out in the gospel field, but moved over to vocal group R&B. In his case, he did so by occasionally filling in for a group called the Rainbows, which featured Don Covay, who would later go on to become a very well-known soul singer.There are no recordings of Stewart with the Rainbows, but this recording of the group a few years later should give you some sort of idea what they sounded like:[Excerpt: The Rainbows, "If You See Mary Lee"]Through his work with the group, Stewart got to know Bo Diddley, whose band he joined as a piano player. Stewart also signed with Chess, and his first record, "Billy\'s Blues", featured both Diddley and Diddley\'s guitarist Jody Williams on guitar:[Billy Stewart, "Billy\'s Blues"]Williams came up with that guitar part, and that would lead to a lot of trouble in the future.And that trouble would come because of Mickey Baker.Mickey Baker\'s birth name was McHouston Baker. Baker had a rough, impoverished, upbringing. He didn\'t know the identity of his father, and his mother was in and out of prison. He started out as a serious jazz musician, playing bebop, up until the point he saw the great blues musician Pee Wee Crayton:[Excerpt: Pee Wee Crayton: "Blues After Hours"]Or, more precisely, when he saw Crayton\'s Cadillac. Baker was playing difficult, complex, music that required a great amount of skill and precision. What Crayton was doing was technically far, far, easier than anything Baker was doing, and he was making far more money. So, as Baker put it, "I started bending strings. I was starving to death, and the blues was just a financial thing for me then."Baker became part of an informal group of people around Atlantic Records, centred around Doc Pomus, a blues songwriter who we will hear more about in the future, along with Big Joe Turner and the saxophone player King Curtis. They were playing sophisticated city blues and R&B, and rather looked down on the country bluesmen who are now much better known, as being comparatively unsophisticated musicians. Baker\'s comments about “bending strings” come from this attitude, that real good music involved horns and pianos and rhythmic sophistication, and that what the Delta bluesmen were doing was something anyone can do.Baker became one of the most sought-after studio guitarists in the R&B field, and for example played the staggering lead guitar on "Need Your Love So Bad" by Little Willie John:[Excerpt, Little Willie John, "Need Your Love So Bad"]That\'s some pretty good string-bending. He was also on a lot of other songs we\'ve talked about in previous episodes. That\'s him on guitar on "Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean":[Excerpt: Ruth Brown, "Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean"]And "Shake, Rattle, and Roll":[Excerpt: Big Joe Turner, "Shake, Rattle, and Roll"]and "Money Honey"[Excerpt: Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters, "Money Honey"]And records by Louis Jordan, LaVern Baker, Ray Charles and more.Baker was also a guitar teacher, and one of his students was a young woman named Sylvia Vanterpool. Sylvia was, at the time, a singer who was just starting out in her career. She had recorded several unsuccessful tracks on Savoy and Jubilee records. A typical example is her version of "I Went to Your Wedding":[Excerpt: Little Sylvia, "I Went to Your Wedding"]Sylvia was only thirteen when she started her career, using the name "Little Sylvia" -- inspired by "Little Esther", who like her was making records for Savoy records -- and her early recordings are a strange mix of different styles. For every syrupy ballad like "I Went to Your Wedding" there was a hard R&B number, more in the Little Esther style, like "Drive, Daddy, Drive":[Excerpt: Little Sylvia, "Drive Daddy Drive"]That was the other side of the same single as "I Went to Your Wedding", and you can hear that while she had some vocal talent, she was not keeping to a coherent enough, distinctive enough, sound to make her into a star.By the time she was twenty, Sylvia was holding down a day job as a typist, trying and failing to earn enough money to live on as a singer. But she\'d been taking guitar lessons from Mickey Baker and had got pretty good.But then Sylvia started dating a man named Joe Robinson.Joe Robinson was involved in some way with gangsters -- nobody has written enough detail for me to get an exact sense of what it was he did with the mob, but he had connections. And he decided he was going to become Sylvia\'s manager.While Sylvia\'s career was floundering, Joe thought he could beef it up. All that was needed was a gimmick.Different sources tell different stories about who thought of the idea, but eventually it was decided that Sylvia should join with her guitar teacher and form a duo. Some sources say that the duo was Joe Robinson\'s idea, and that it was inspired by the success of Gene and Eunice, Shirley and Lee, and the other vocal duos around the time.Other sources, on the other hand, talk about how Mickey Baker, who had started out as a jazz guitarist very much in the Les Paul mode, had wanted to form his own version of Les Paul and Mary Ford.Either way, the gimmick was a solid one -- a male/female duo, both of whom could sing and play the guitar, but playing that string-bending music that Mickey was making money from.And the two of them had chemistry -- at least on stage and on recordings. Off stage, they soon began to grate on each other. Mickey was a man who had no interest in stardom or financial success -- he was a rather studious, private, man who just wanted to make music and get better at his instrument, while Sylvia had a razor-sharp business mind, a huge amount of ambition, and a desire for stardom. But they worked well as a musical team, even if they were never going to be the best of friends.Originally, they signed with a label called Rainbow Records, a medium-sized indie label in New York, where they put out their first single, "I\'m So Glad". It\'s not an especially good record, and it does seem to have a bit of Gene and Eunice to it, and almost none of the distinctive guitar that would characterise their later work -- just some stabbing punctuation on the middle eight and a rather perfunctory solo. The B-side, though, "Se De Boom Run Dun", while it\'s also far from a wonderful song, does have the semi-calypso rhythm that would later make them famous:[Excerpt: Mickey and Sylvia, "Se De Boom Run Dun"]Unsurprisingly, it didn\'t sell, and nor did the follow-ups. But the records did get some airplay in New York, if nowhere else, and that brought them to the attention of Bob Rolontz at Groove Records.Groove Records was a subsidiary of RCA, set up in 1953. At that time, the major record labels had a problem, which we\'ve talked about before. For years, none of them had put out R&B records, and the small labels that did put out R&B had been locked out of the distribution networks that the major labels dominated. The result had been that a whole independent network of shops -- usually black-owned businesses selling to black customers -- had sprung up that only sold R&B records.Those shops had no interest in selling the records put out by the major labels -- their customers weren\'t interested in Doris Day or Frank Sinatra, they wanted Wynonie Harris and Johnny Otis, so why would the shop want to stock anything by Columbia or Decca or RCA, when there was Modern and Chess and Federal and King and Sun and RPM out there making the kind of records their customers liked?But, of course, the major labels still wanted to sell to those customers. After all, there was money out there in the pockets of people who weren\'t shareholders in RCA or Columbia, and in the eyes of those shareholders that was the greatest injustice in the world, and one that needed to be rectified forthwith.And so those labels set up their own mini-divisions, to sell to those shops. They had different labels, because the shops wouldn\'t buy from the majors, but they were wholly-owned subsidiaries. Fake indie labels. And Groove was one of them.Groove Records had had a minor hit in 1955 with the piano player Piano Red, and his "Jump Man Jump":[Excerpt: Piano Red, "Jump Man Jump"]They hadn\'t had a huge amount of commercial success since, but Rolontz thought that Mickey and Sylvia could be the ones to bring him that success. Rolontz put them together with the saxophonist and arranger King Curtis, who Mickey already knew from his work with Doc Pomus, and Curtis put together a team of the best R&B musicians in New York, many of them the same people who would play on most of Atlantic\'s sessions.Mickey and Sylvia\'s first single on Groove, "Walking in the Rain", had the potential to be a big hit in the eyes of the record company:[Excerpt: Mickey and Sylvia, "Walking in the Rain"]But unfortunately for them, Johnnie Ray put out this at around the same time:[Excerpt: Johnnie Ray, "Just Walking in the Rain"]That\'s a totally different song, of course -- it\'s a cover version of one of the first records ever released on Sun Records, a few years earlier, originally by a vocal group called the Prisonaires. But customers were understandably confused by the presence of two songs with almost identical titles in the market, and so Mickey and Sylvia\'s song tanked. They still didn\'t have that hit they needed.But at that point, fate intervened in the form of Bo Diddley.In May 1956, Diddley had written and recorded a song called "Love is Strange", and not got round to releasing it. Jody Williams, who was in Diddley\'s band at the time, had played the lead guitar on the session, and he\'d reused the licks he had used for "Billy\'s Blues" on the song:[Excerpt: Bo Diddley, "Love is Strange"]At the time, Diddley was friendly with Mickey Baker, and was using Baker as a session guitarist on outside recordings he was producing for other artists, including recordings with Billy Stewart and with the Marquees, a vocal group which featured a young singer named Marvin Gaye:[Excerpt: The Marquees, "Wyatt Earp"]As a result, Mickey and Sylvia ended up playing a few shows on the same bill as Diddley, and at one of the shows, Williams, who was attracted to Sylvia, decided to play "Love is Strange" for her. Sylvia liked the song, and Mickey and Sylvia decided to record it.[Excerpt: Mickey and Sylvia, "Love is Strange"]Now, Diddley claimed that what he told the song\'s publishers was that Jody Williams wrote the music, while he wrote the lyrics, but he asked that the credit for the lyrics be put in the name of his wife Ethel Smith.While Smith\'s name made the credits, Williams\' didn\'t, and Williams blamed Diddley for the omission, while Diddley just said (with some evidence) that most of the people he signed contracts with were liars and thieves, and that it didn\'t surprise him that they\'d missed Williams\' name off.We\'ll never know for sure what was actually in Diddley\'s contracts because, again according to Diddley, just before he and Smith divorced she burned all his papers so she could claim that he never gave her any money and he couldn\'t prove otherwise.Williams never believed him, and the two didn\'t speak for decades.Meanwhile, two other people were credited as writers on the song -- Mickey and Sylvia themselves. This is presumably for the changes that were made between Diddley\'s demo and the finished song, which mostly amount to Baker\'s lead guitar part and to the famous spoken-word section of the song in the middle:[Excerpt: Mickey and Sylvia, "Love is Strange", spoken word section]According to Diddley, he also later sold his own share in the song to Sylvia, some time in the early sixties. This may well be the case, because Sylvia Vanterpool went on to become a very, very successful businesswoman, who made a lot of very wise business decisions.Either way, "Love is Strange" was a big hit. It went to number eleven in the pop charts and number one on the R&B chart. It\'s one of those records that everyone knows, and it went on to be covered by dozens upon dozens of performers, including The Maddox Brothers and Rose:[Excerpt: The Maddox Brothers and Rose, "Love is Strange". All very short excerpts here]The Everly Brothers:[Excerpt: The Everly Brothers, "Love is Strange"]And Paul McCartney and Wings:[Excerpt: Wings, "Love is Strange"]And Jody Williams never saw a penny from it.But after Groove Records had had this breakthrough big hit, RCA decided to close the label down, and move the acts on the label, and their producer Rolontz, to another subsidiary, Vik. Vik Records had, according to Rolontz, "probably the worst collection of talent in the history of the world", and was severely in debt. All the momentum for their career was gone.Mickey and Sylvia would release many more records, but they would have diminishing returns. Their next record went top ten R&B, but only number forty-seven on the pop charts, and the record after that did even worse, only reaching number eighty-five in the hot one hundred, even though it was another Bo Diddley ballad very much in the same vein as "Love is Strange":[Excerpt: Mickey and Sylvia, "Dearest"]But even though that wasn\'t a big hit record, it was a favourite of Buddy Holly -- a singer who at this time was just starting out in his own career. You can tell how much Holly liked Mickey and Sylvia, though, just by comparing the way he sings the word “baby” on many of his records to the way Sylvia sings it in “Love is Strange”, and he recorded his own home demos of both "Love is Strange" and "Dearest" -- demos which were released on singles after his death:[Excerpt: Buddy Holly, "Dearest"]But "Dearest" was so obscure that when Holly\'s single came out, the song was titled "Umm Oh Yeah", and credited to "unknown" for many years, because no-one at the record label had heard the earlier record.Mickey and Sylvia would have several more records in the hot one hundred, but the highest would only reach number forty-six. But while they had no more hits under their own names, they did have another hit...as Ike Turner.After Mickey and Sylvia were dropped along with the rest of the Vik artists, they split up temporarily, but then got back together to start their own company, Willow Records, to release their material. Ike Turner played on some of their records, and to return the favour they agreed to produce a record for Ike and Tina Turner.The song chosen was called "It\'s Gonna Work Out Fine", and it was co-written by the great R&B songwriter Rose Marie McCoy, who had written for Elvis, Nat "King" Cole, Nappy Brown, and many others. The other credited co-writer is one Sylvia McKinney, who some sources suggest is the same person as Sylvia Vanterpool -- who had by this point married Joe Robinson and changed her name to Sylvia Robinson.Whether she was the other co-writer or not, Mickey and Sylvia had recorded a version of the song for Vik Records, but it hadn\'t been released, and so they suggested to Ike that the song would work as an Ike and Tina Turner record -- and they would produce and arrange it for them.Indeed they did more than that. They *were* Ike Turner on the record -- Sylvia played the lead guitar part, while Mickey did the spoken "Ike" vocals, which Ike would do live. Sylvia also joined the Ikettes on backing vocals, and while Mickey and Sylvia aren\'t the credited producers, the end result is essentially a Mickey and Sylvia record with guest vocals from Tina Turner:[Excerpt: Ike and Tina Turner, "It\'s Gonna Work Out Fine"]That record sold over a million copies, and got a Grammy nomination.However, Mickey and Sylvia\'s recordings under their own name were still having no success, and Mickey was also having problems because his then-wife was white, and with the particularly virulent form of racism the US was suffering through at the time, he didn\'t want to be in the country any more.He was also becoming more and more interested in the academic side of music. He had already, in 1955, written a book, the Complete Course in Jazz Guitar, which is still available today and highly regarded.So he moved to Europe, and went back into jazz, performing with people like Coleman Hawkins:[Excerpt: Mickey Baker and Coleman Hawkins: "South of France Blues"]But he did more than just jazz. He studied composition with Iannis Xennakis and started writing fugues and a concerto for guitar and orchestra, "The Blues Suite". Unfortunately, while some of that music was recorded, it only appears to have been released on now out of print and expensive vinyl which no-one has uploaded to the Internet, so I can\'t excerpt it for you here.What I *can* excerpt is a project he did in the mid-1970s, an album called "Mississippi Delta Dues", released under his birth name McHouston Baker, where he paid tribute to the country bluesmen he\'d looked down on early on by performing their songs, along with some of his own in a similar style. It\'s an odd album, in which sometimes he does a straight soundalike, like this version of Robert Johnson\'s "Terraplane Blues":[Excerpt: McHouston Baker, "Terraplane Blues"]And sometimes he uses strings. Sometimes this is just as a standard pop-style string section, but sometimes he\'s using them in ways he learned from Xenakkis, like on this version of J.B. Lenoir\'s "Alabama Blues", rewritten as "Alabama March", which ends up sounding like nothing as much as Scott Walker:[Excerpt: McHouston Baker, "Alabama March"]Baker carried on performing music of all kinds around Europe until his death in 2011. He died massively respected for his contributions to blues, jazz, R&B, and the technical proficiency of generations of guitarists.Sylvia Robinson made even more of a contribution. After a few years off to have kids after the duo split up, she set up her own record label, All Platinum. For All Platinum she wrote and produced a number of proto-disco hits for other people in the late sixties and early seventies. Those included "Shame Shame Shame" for Shirley and Company:[Excerpt: Shirley and Company, "Shame Shame Shame"]That\'s the song that inspired David Bowie, John Lennon, and Carlos Alomar to rework a song Bowie and Alomar had been working on, called "Footstompin\'", into "Fame".Sylvia also had a hit of her own, with a song called "Pillow Talk" that she\'d written for Al Green, but which he\'d turned down due to its blatant sexuality conflicting with his newfound religion:[Excerpt: Sylvia, "Pillow Talk"]But I\'m afraid we\'re going to have to wait more than two years before we find out more about Sylvia\'s biggest contribution to music, because Sylvia Robinson, who had been Little Sylvia and the woman calling her lover-boy, became to hip-hop what Sam Phillips was to rock and roll, and when we get to 1979 we will be looking at how, with financing from her husband\'s gangster friend Morris Levy, someone from the first wave of rock and roll stars was more responsible than anyone for seeing commercial potential in the music that eventually took rock\'s cultural place. | Welcome to episode forty-eight of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs.

Much of the music is not very good, but I can\'t imagine a better way of getting an understanding of the roots of British rock.Pete Frame\'s The Restless Generation is the best book available looking at British 50s rock and roll from a historical perspective.Billy Bragg\'s Roots, Radicals, and Rockers: How Skiffle Changed the World is one of the best books I\'ve read on music at all, and covers Steele from the skiffle perspective.Fings Ain\'t What They Used T\'Be: The Life of Lionel Bart by David & Caroline Stafford gave me a lot of information on Steel\'s songwriting partner.Steele\'s autobiography, Bermondsey Boy, covers his childhood and early stardom. I am not 100% convinced of its accuracy, but it\'s an entertaining book, and if nothing else probably gives a good idea of the mental atmosphere in the poor parts of South London in the war and immediate post-war years.And George Melly\'s Revolt Into Style was one of the first books to take British pop culture seriously, and puts Steele into a wider context of British pop, both music and art.PatreonThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon.

Its skull was discovered in 1912 in Piltdown, East Sussex, by the eminent archaeologist Charles Dawson, and for years was considered one of the most important pieces of evidence in the story of human evolution.And then, in 1953, it was discovered that the whole thing was a hoax, and not even a particularly good one. Someone had just taken the jaw of an orang-utan and the top part of a human skull, and filed down the orang-utan teeth, and then stained the bones to make them look old. It was almost certainly the work of Dawson himself, who seems to have spent his entire life making fraudulent discoveries. Dawson had died decades earlier, and the full extent of his fraud wasn\'t even confirmed until 2003.Sometimes researching the history of rock and roll can be a lot like that. You can find a story repeated in numerous apparently reliable books, and then find out that it\'s all based on the inaccurate testimony of a single individual. The story never happened. It was just something someone made up.[Excerpt: "Rock With the Caveman", Tommy Steele and the Steelmen]We talked a little while ago about the skiffle movement, and the first British guitar-based pop music. Today, we\'re going to look at the dawn of British rock and roll.Now, there\'s an important thing to note about the first wave of British rock and roll, and that is that it was, essentially, a music that had no roots in the culture. It was an imitation of American music, without any of the ties to social issues that made the American music so interesting.Britain in the 1950s was a very different place to the one it is today, or to America. It was ethnically extremely homogeneous, as the waves of immigration that have so improved the country had only just started. And while few people travelled much outside their own immediate areas, it was culturally more homogeneous as well, as Britain, unlike America, had a national media rather than a local one. In Britain, someone could become known throughout the country before they\'d played their second gig, if they got the right media exposure.And so British rock and roll started out at the point that American rock and roll was only just starting to get to -- a clean-cut version of the music, with little black influence or sexuality left in it, designed from the outset to be a part of mainstream showbusiness aimed at teenagers, not music for an underclass or a racial or sexual minority.Britain\'s first rock and roll star put out his first record in November 1956, and by November 1957 he was appearing on the Royal Variety Show, with Mario Lanza, Bob Monkhouse, and Vera Lynn. That is, fundamentally, what early British rock and roll was. Keep that in mind for the rest of the story, as we look at how a young sailor from a dirt-poor family became Britain\'s first teen idol.To tell that story, we first have to discuss the career of the Vipers Skiffle Group. That was the group\'s full name, and they were just about the most important British group of the mid-fifties, even though they were never as commercially successful as some of the acts we\'ve looked at.The name of the Vipers Skiffle Group was actually the first drug reference in British pop music. They took the name from the autobiography of the American jazz clarinettist Mezz Mezzrow -- a man who was better known in the jazz community as a dope dealer than as a musician; so much so that "Mezz" itself became slang for marijuana, while "viper" became the name for dope smokers, as you can hear in this recording by Stuff Smith, in which he sings that he "dreamed about a reefer five foot long/Mighty Mezz but not too strong".[Excerpt: Stuff Smith, "You\'se a Viper"]So when Wally Whyton, Johnny Booker, and Jean Van Den Bosch formed a guitar trio, they chose that name, even though as it turned out none of them actually smoked dope. They just thought it sounded cool.They started performing at a cafe called the 2is (two as in the numeral, I as in the letter), and started to build up something of a reputation -- to the point that Lonnie Donegan started nicking their material. Whyton had taken an old sea shanty, "Sail Away Ladies", popularised by the country banjo player Uncle Dave Macon, and rewritten it substantially, turning it into "Don\'t You Rock Me Daddy-O". Donegan copyrighted Whyton\'s song as soon as he heard it, and rushed out his version of it, but the Vipers put out their own version too, and the two chased each other up the charts. Donegan\'s charted higher, but the Vipers ended up at a respectable number ten:[Excerpt: The Vipers, "Don\'t You Rock Me, Daddy-O"]That recording was on Parlophone records, and was produced by a young producer who normally did comedy and novelty records, named George Martin. We\'ll be hearing more about him later on.But at the time we\'re talking about, the Vipers had not yet gained a recording contract, and they were still playing the 2is. Occasionally, they would be joined on stage by a young acquaintance named Thomas Hicks. Hicks was a merchant seaman, and was away at sea most of the time, and so was never a full part of the group, but even though he didn\'t care much for skiffle -- he was a country and western fan first and foremost -- he played guitar, and in Britain in 1955 and 56, if you played guitar, you played skiffle.Hicks had come from an absolutely dirt-poor background. Three of his siblings had died at cruelly young ages, and young Thomas himself had had several brushes with ill health, which meant that while he was a voracious reader he had lacked formal education.He had wanted to be a performer from a very early age, and had developed a routine that he used to do around the pubs in his early teens, in which he would mime to a record by Danny Kaye, "Knock on Wood":[Excerpt: Danny Kaye, "Knock on Wood"]But at age fifteen he had joined the Merchant Navy. This isn\'t the same thing as the Royal Navy, but rather is the group of commercial shipping companies that provide non-military shipping, and Hicks worked as wait staff on a cruise ship making regular trips to America. On an early trip, he fell in love with the music of Hank Williams, who would remain a favourite of his for the rest of his life, and he particularly loved the song "Kaw-Liga":[Excerpt: Hank Williams, "Kaw-Liga"]Hicks replaced his old party piece of miming to Danny Kaye with a new one of singing "Kaw-Liga", with accompaniment from anyone he could persuade to play guitar for him. Eventually one of his crewmates taught him how to play the song himself, and he started performing with pick-up groups, singing Hank Williams songs, whenever he was on shore leave in the UK. And when he couldn\'t get a paid gig he\'d head to the 2is and sing with the Vipers.But then came the event that changed his life. Young Tommy Hicks, with his love of country music, was delighted when on shore leave in 1955 to see an advert for a touring show based on the Grand Ole Opry, in Norfolk Virginia, where he happened to be. Of course he went along, and there he saw something that made a huge impression. One of the acts in the middle of the bill was a young man who wore horn-rimmed glasses. Tommy still remembers the details to this day. The young man came out and did a three-song set. The first song was a standard country song, but the second one was something else; something that hit like a bolt of lightning:[Excerpt: Buddy Holly, "Peggy Sue"]That song was young Thomas Hicks\' introduction to the new music called rock and roll, and nothing would ever be the same for him ever again after seeing Buddy Holly sing "Peggy Sue". By February 1956 he had finished working on the cruise ships, and was performing rock and roll in London, the very first British rock and roller.Except...There\'s a reason why we\'re covering Tommy Steele *before* Buddy Holly, the man who he claims as his inspiration.Buddy Holly *did* perform with a Grand Ole Opry tour. But it didn\'t tour until May 1956, three months after Thomas Hicks quit his job on the cruise ships, and about a year after the time Tommy claims to have seen him. That tour only hit Oklahoma, which is landlocked, and didn\'t visit Norfolk Virginia. According to various timelines put together by people like the Buddy Holly Centre in Lubbock Texas, Holly didn\'t perform outside Lubbock until that tour, and that\'s the only time he did perform outside West Texas until 1957.Also, Buddy Holly didn\'t meet Peggy Sue Gerron, the woman who gave the song its name, until 1956, and the song doesn\'t seem to have been written until 1957.So whatever it was that introduced young Tommy Hicks to the wonders of rock and roll, it wasn\'t seeing Buddy Holly sing "Peggy Sue" in Norfolk Virginia in 1955. But that\'s the story that\'s in his autobiography, and that\'s the story that\'s in every other source I\'ve seen on the subject, because they\'re all just repeating what he said, on the assumption that he\'d remember something like that, something which was so important in his life and future career.Remember what I said at the beginning, about rock and roll history being like dealing with Piltdown Man? Yeah.There are a lot of inaccuracies in the life story of Thomas Hicks, who became famous under the name Tommy Steele. Anything I tell you about him is based on information he put out, and that information is not always the truth, so be warned. For example, when he started his career, he claimed he\'d worked his way up on the cruise ships to being a gymnastics instructor -- something that the shipping federation denied to the press. You find a lot of that kind of thing when you dig into Steele\'s stories.In fact, by the time Hicks started performing, there had already been at least one British rock and roll record made. He wasn\'t bringing something new that he\'d discovered in America at all. "Rock Around the Clock", the Bill Haley film, had played in UK cinemas at around the time of Hicks\' supposed epiphany, and it had inspired a modern jazz drummer, Tony Crombie, to form Tony Crombie and the Rockets and record a Bill Haley soundalike called "Teach You To Rock":[Excerpt: Tony Crombie and the Rockets, "Teach You To Rock"]However, Crombie was not teen idol material -- a serious jazz drummer in his thirties, he soon went back to playing bebop, and has largely been written out of British rock history since, in favour of Tommy Steele as the first British rock and roller.Thomas Hicks the merchant seaman became Tommy Steele the pop idol as a result of a chance meeting. Hicks went to a party with a friend, and the host was a man called Lionel Bart, who was celebrating because he\'d just sold his first song, to the bandleader Bill Cotton.No recording of that song seems to exist, but the lyrics to the song -- a lament about the way that old-style cafes were being replaced by upscale coffee bars -- are quoted in a biography of Bart:"Oh for a cup of tea, instead of a cuppuchini/What would it mean to me, just one little cup so teeny!/You ask for some char and they reckon you\'re barmy/Ask for a banger, they\'ll give you salami/Oh for the liquid they served in the Army/Just a cup of tea!"Heartrending stuff, I\'m sure you\'ll agree. But Bart was proud of the twenty-five guineas the song had earned him, and so he was having a party.Bart was at the centre of a Bohemian crowd in Soho, and the party was held at a squat where Bart, a card-carrying member of the Communist Party, spent most of his time. At that squat at various times around this period lived, among others, the playwright John Antrobus, the actor Shirley Eaton, who would later become famous as the woman painted gold in the beginning of Goldfinger, and the great folk guitarist Davey Graham, who would later become famous for his instrumental, “Angi”:[Excerpt: Davey Graham, “Angi”]We\'ll hear more about Graham in future episodes.Another inhabitant of the squat was Mike Pratt, a guitarist and pianist who would later turn to acting and become famous as Jeff Randall in the fantasy detective series Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). Hicks, Bart, and Pratt started collaborating on songs together -- Hicks would bring in a basic idea, and then Bart would write the lyrics and Pratt the music. They also performed as The Cavemen, though Bart soon tired of playing washboard and stuck to writing. The Cavemen became a floating group of musicians, centred around Hicks and Pratt, and with various Vipers and other skifflers pulled in as and when they were available.The various skiffle musicians looked down on Hicks, because of his tendency to want to play "Heartbreak Hotel" or "Blue Suede Shoes" rather than "Bring a Little Water Sylvie" or "Rock Island Line", but a gig was a gig, and they had to admit that Hicks seemed to go down well with the young women in the audience.Two minor music industry people, Bill Varley and Roy Tuvey, agreed to manage Hicks, but they decided that they needed someone involved who would be able to publicise Hicks, so they invited John Kennedy, a PR man from New Zealand, to come to the 2is to see him. Hicks wasn\'t actually playing the 2is the night in question – it was the Vipers, who were just on the verge of getting signed and recording their first single:[Excerpt: The Vipers Skiffle Group, “Ain\'t You Glad?”]While Hicks wasn\'t scheduled to play, at the request of Varley and Tuvey he jumped on stage when the Vipers took a break, and sang a song that he, Bart, and Pratt had written, called "Rock With the Caveman".Kennedy was impressed. He was impressed enough, in fact, that he brought in a friend, Larry Parnes, who would go on to become the most important manager in British rock and roll in the fifties and early sixties. Kennedy, Parnes, and Hicks cut Varley and Tuvey out altogether -- to the extent that neither of them are even mentioned in the version of this story in Tommy Steele\'s autobiography.Hicks was renamed Tommy Steele, in a nod to his paternal grandfather Thomas Stil-Hicks (the Stil in that name is spelled either Stil or Stijl, depending on which source you believe) and Parnes would go on to name a whole host of further rock stars in a similar manner -- Duffy Power, Johnny Gentle, Billy Fury, Marty Wilde. They had everything except a record contract, but that was why Kennedy was there.Kennedy rented a big house, and hired a load of showgirls, models, and sex workers to turn up for a party and bring their boyfriends. They were to dress nicely, talk in fake posh accents, and if anyone asked who they were they were to give fake double-barrelled names. He then called the press and said it was "the first high society rock and roll show" and that the girls were all debutantes. The story made the newspapers, and got Steele national attention.Steele was signed by Decca records, where Hugh Mendl, the producer of "Rock Island Line", was so eager to sign him that he didn\'t check if any studios were free for his audition, and so Britain\'s first homegrown rock idol auditioned for his record contract in the gents\' toilets.A bunch of slumming jazz musicians, including Dave Lee, the pianist with the Dankworth band, and the legendary saxophone player Ronnie Scott, were brought in to record "Rock With the Caveman":[Excerpt: Tommy Steele, "Rock With the Caveman"]The single went to number thirteen. Tommy Steele was now a bona fide rock and roll star, at least in the UK. The next record, "Elevator Rock", didn\'t do so well, however:[Excerpt: Tommy Steele, "Elevator Rock"]That failed to chart, so Steele\'s producers went for the well-worn trick in British record making of simply copying a US hit. Guy Mitchell had just released "Singing the Blues":[Excerpt: Guy Mitchell, "Singing the Blues"]That was actually a cover version of a recording by Marty Robbins from earlier in the year, but Mitchell\'s version was the one that became the big hit. And Steele was brought into the studio to record a soundalike version, and hopefully get it out before Mitchell\'s version hit the charts.Steele\'s version has an identical arrangement and sound to Mitchell\'s, except that Steele sings it in an incredibly mannered Elvis impression:[Excerpt: Tommy Steele, "Singing the Blues"]Now, to twenty-first century ears, Steele\'s version is clearly inferior. But here was the birth of something particularly English -- and indeed something particularly London -- in rock and roll music. The overly mannered, music-hall inspired, Cockneyfied impression of an American singing style. On Steele\'s subsequent tour, a nine-year old kid called David Jones, who would later change his name to Bowie, went to see him and came away inspired to become a rock and roll star. And we can hear in this performance the roots of Bowie\'s own London take on Elvis, as we can also hear a style that would be taken up by Anthony Newley, Ray Davies, and many more masters of Cockney archness.I don\'t think "Singing the Blues" is a particularly good record compared to Mitchell\'s, but it is a prototype for something that would become good, and it deserves recognition for that.Mitchell\'s version got out first, and went to the top of the charts, with Steele\'s following close behind, but then for one week Mitchell\'s record label had a minor distribution problem, and Steele took over the top spot, before Mitchell\'s record returned to number one the next week.Tommy Steele had become the first British rock and roll singer to get to number one in the UK charts. It would be the only time he would do so, but it was enough. He was a bona fide teen idol.He was so big, in fact, that even his brother, Colin Hicks, became a minor rock and roll star himself off the back of his brother\'s success:[Excerpt: Colin Hicks and the Cabin Boys, "Hollering and Screaming"]The drummer on that record, Jimmy Nicol, later had his fifteen minutes of fame when Ringo Starr got tonsilitis just before a tour of Australia, and for a few shows Nicol got to be a substitute Beatle.Very soon, Tommy Steele moved on into light entertainment. First he moved into films -- starting with "The Tommy Steele Story", a film based on his life, for which he, Bart, and Pratt wrote all twelve of the songs in a week to meet the deadline, and then he went into stage musicals. Within a year, he had given up on rock and roll altogether.But rock and roll hadn\'t *quite* given up on him. While Steele was appearing in stage musicals, one was also written about him -- a hurtful parody of his life, which he claimed later he\'d wanted to sue over. In Expresso Bongo, a satire of the British music industry, Steele was parodied as "Bongo Herbert", who rises to fame with no talent whatsoever.That stage musical was then rewritten for a film version, with the satire taken out of it, so it was a straight rags-to-riches story. It was made into a vehicle for another singer who had been a regular at the 2is, and whose backing band was made up of former members of the Vipers Skiffle Group:[Excerpt: Cliff Richard, "Love" (from Expresso Bongo)]We\'ll talk about both Cliff Richard and the Shadows in future episodes though...Tommy Steele would go on to become something of a national treasure, working on stage with Gene Kelly and on screen with Fred Astaire, writing several books, having a minor artistic career as a sculptor, and touring constantly in pantomimes and musicals. At age eighty-two he still tours every year, performing as Scrooge in a stage musical version of A Christmas Carol. His 1950s hits remain popular enough in the UK that a compilation of them went to number twenty-two in the charts in 2009.He may not leave a large body of rock and roll work, but without him, there would be no British rock and roll industry as we know it, and the rest of this history would be very different. | Welcome to episode forty-seven of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs. This one looks at "Goodnight My Love" by Jesse Belvin, and at the many groups he performed with, and his untimely death. .

But as I discuss in this episode this is one of those where I\'ve pulled together information from so many sources, a full list would probably be longer than the episode itself.PatreonThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon. Why not join them?Transcript\xa0Before we begin, a quick content warning. This episode contains material dealing with the immediate aftermath of a death in a car crash. While I am not explicit, this might be upsetting for some.Jesse Belvin is a name that not many people recognise these days -- he\'s a footnote in the biographies of people like Sam Cooke or the Penguins, someone whose contribution to music history is usually summed up in a line or two in a book about someone else.The problem is that Jesse Belvin was simply too good, and too prolific, to have a normal career. He put out a truly astonishing number of records as a songwriter, performer, and group leader, under so many different names that it\'s impossible to figure out the true extent of his career. And people like that don\'t end up having scholarly books written about them.And when you do find something that actually talks about Belvin himself, you find wild inaccuracies. For example, in researching this episode, I found over and over again that people claimed that Barry White played piano on the song we\'re looking at today, "Goodnight My Love". Now, White lived in the same neigbourhood as Belvin, and they attended the same school, so on the face of it that seems plausible. It seems plausible, at least, until you realise that Barry White was eleven when "Goodnight My Love" came out.Even so, on the offchance, I tracked down an interview with White where he confirmed that no, he was not playing piano on doo-wop classics before he hit puberty. But that kind of misinformation is all over everything to do with Jesse Belvin.The end result of this is that Jesse Belvin is someone who exists in the gaps of other people\'s histories, and this episode is an attempt to create a picture out of what you find when looking at the stories of other musicians. As a result, it will almost certainly be less accurate than some other episodes. There\'s so little information about Belvin that if you didn\'t know anything about him, you\'d assume he was some unimportant, minor, figure.But in 1950s R&B -- among musicians, especially those on the West Coast -- there was no bigger name than Jesse Belvin. He had the potential to be bigger than anyone, and he would have been, had he lived. He was Stevie Wonder\'s favourite singer of all time, and Etta James argued to her dying day that it was a travesty that she was in the rock and roll hall of fame while he wasn\'t. Sam Cooke explicitly tried to model his career after Belvin, to the extent that after Cooke\'s death, his widow kept all of Cooke\'s records separate from her other albums -- except Belvin\'s, which she kept with Cooke\'s.Marv Goldberg, who is by far the pre-eminent expert on forties and fifties black vocal group music, refers to Belvin as the genre\'s "most revered stylist". And at the time he died, he was on the verge of finally becoming as well known as he deserved to be. So let\'s talk about the life -- and the tragic death -- of Mr Easy himself:[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin, "Goodnight My Love"]Like so many greats of R&B and jazz, Belvin had attended Jefferson High School and studied music under the great teacher Samuel Browne, who is one of the great unsung heroes of rock and roll music. One of the other people that Browne had taught was the great rhythm and blues saxophone player Big Jay McNeely.McNeely was one of the all-time great saxophone honkers, inspired mostly by Illinois Jacquet, and he had become the lead tenor saxophone player with Johnny Otis\' band at the Barrelhouse Club, and played on records like Otis\' "Barrel House Stomp":[Excerpt: Johnny Otis, "Barrel House Stomp"]As with many of the musicians Otis worked with, McNeely soon went on to a solo career of his own, and he formed a vocal group, "Three Dots and a Dash".Three Dots and a Dash backed McNeely\'s saxophone on a number of records, and McNeely invited Belvin to join them as lead singer. Belvin\'s first recording with the group was on "All That Wine is Gone", an answer record to "Drinking Wine Spo-De-O-Dee".[Excerpt: Big Jay McNeely with Three Dots and a Dash, "All That Wine is Gone"]After recording two singles with McNeely, Belvin went off to make his own records, signing to Specialty Records. His first solo single, "Baby Don\'t Go", was not especially successful, so he teamed up with the songwriter Marvin Phillips in a duo called Jesse and Marvin. The two of them had a hit with the song "Dream Girl":[Excerpt: Jesse and Marvin, "Dream Girl"]"Dream Girl" went to number two on the R&B charts, and it looked like Jesse and Marvin were about to have a massive career. But shortly afterwards, Belvin was drafted.It was while he was in the armed forces that “Earth Angel” became a hit -- a song he co-wrote, and which we discussed in a previous episode, which I\'ll link in the show notes. Like many of the songs Belvin wrote, he ended up not getting credit for that one -- but unlike most of the others, he went to court over it and got some royalties in the end.Marvin decided to continue the duo without Jesse, renaming it "Marvin and Johnny", and moved over to Modern Records, but he didn\'t stick with a single "Johnny". Instead "Johnny" would be whoever was around, sometimes Marvin himself double-tracked. He had several minor hit singles as "Marvin and Johnny", including "Cherry Pie", on which the role of "Johnny" was played by Emory Perry:[Excerpt: Marvin and Johnny, "Cherry Pie"]"Cherry Pie" was a massive hit, but none of Marvin and Johnny\'s other records matched its success. However, on some of the follow-ups, Jesse Belvin returned as one of the Johnnies, notably on a cover version of "Ko Ko Mo", which didn\'t manage to outsell either the original or Perry Como\'s version:[Excerpt: Marvin and Johnny, "Ko Ko Mo"]Meanwhile, his time in the armed forces had set Belvin\'s career back, and when he came out he started recording for every label, and under every band name, he could. Most of the time, he would also be writing the songs, but he didn\'t get label credit on most of them, because he would just sell all his rights to the songs for a hundred dollars. Why not? There was always another song.As well as recording as Marvin and Johnny for Modern Records, he also sang with the Californians on Federal:[Excerpt: The Californians, "My Angel"]The Sheiks, also on Federal :[Excerpt: The Sheiks, "So Fine"]The Gassers, on Cash:[Excerpt: The Gassers, "Hum De Dum"]As well as recording under his own name on both Specialty and on John Dolphin\'s Hollywood Records. But his big project at the time was the Cliques, a duo he formed with Eugene Church, who recorded for Modern. Their track, "The Girl in My Dreams" was the closest thing he\'d had to a big success since the similarly-named "Dream Girl" several years earlier:[Excerpt: The Cliques, "The Girl in my Dreams"]That went to number forty-five on the pop chart -- not a massive hit, but a clear commercial success.And so, of course, at this point Belvin ditched the Cliques name, rather than follow up on the minor hit, and started making records as a solo artist instead. He signed to Modern Records as a solo artist, and went into the studio to record a new song.Now, I am going to be careful how I phrase this, because John Marascalco, who is credited as the co-writer of "Goodnight My Love", is still alive. And I want to stress that Marascalco is, by all accounts, an actual songwriter who has written songs for people like Little Richard and Harry Nilsson.But there have also been accusations that at least some of his songwriting credits were not deserved -- in particular the song "Bertha Lou" by Johnny Faire:[Excerpt: Johnny Faire, "Bertha Lou"]Johnny Faire, whose real name was Donnie Brooks, recorded that with the Burnette brothers, and always said that the song was written, not by Marascalco, but by Johnny Burnette, who sold his rights to the song to Marascalco for fifty dollars -- Burnette\'s son Rocky backs up the claim.Now, in the case of "Goodnight My Love", the credited writers are George Motola and Marascalco, but the story as it\'s normally told goes as follows -- Motola had written the bulk of the song several years earlier, but had never completed it. He brought it into the studio, and Jesse Belvin came up with the bridge -- but he said that rather than take credit, he just wanted Motola to give him four hundred dollars. Motola didn\'t have four hundred dollars on him, but Marascalco, who was also at the session and is the credited producer, said he could get it for Belvin, and took the credit himself.That\'s the story, and it would fit with both the rumour that Marascalco had bought an entire song from Johnny Burnette and with Belvin\'s cavalier attitude towards credit. On the other hand, Marascalco was also apparently particularly good at rewriting and finishing other people\'s half-finished songs, and so it\'s entirely plausible that he could have done the finishing-up job himself.Either way, the finished song became one of the most well-known songs of the fifties:[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin, "Goodnight My Love"]Belvin\'s version of the song went to number seven in the R&B charts, but its impact went beyond its immediate chart success. Alan Freed started to use the song as the outro music for his radio show, making it familiar to an entire generation of American music lovers. The result was that the song became a standard, recorded by everyone from James Brown to Gloria Estefan, the Four Seasons to Harry Connick Jr. If John Marascalco *did* buy Jesse Belvin\'s share of the songwriting, that was about the best four hundred dollars he could possibly have spent.Over the next year, Belvin recorded a host of other singles as a solo artist, none of which matched the level of success he\'d seen with "Goodnight My Love”, but which are the artistic foundation on which his reputation now rests. The stylistic range of these records is quite astonishing, from Latin pop like "Senorita", to doo-wop novelty songs like "My Satellite", a song whose melody owes something to "Hound Dog", credited to Jesse Belvin and the Space Riders, and released to cash in on the space craze that had started with the launch of the Russian satellite Sputnik:[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin and the Space Riders, "My Satellite"]That featured Alex Hodge of the Platters on backing vocals. Hodge\'s brother Gaynel Hodge, who like Belvin would form groups at the drop of a hat, joined Jesse in yet another of the many groups he formed. The Saxons consisted of Belvin, Gaynel Hodge, Eugene Church (who had been in the Cliques with Belvin) and another former Jefferson High student, Belvin\'s friend Johnny "Guitar" Watson.Watson would later become well known for his seventies "gangster of love" persona and funk records, but at this point he was mostly making hard electric blues records like "Three Hours Past Midnight":[Excerpt: "Three Hours Past Midnight", Johnny "Guitar" Watson]But when he worked with Belvin in the Saxons and other groups, he recorded much more straightforward doo-wop and rock and roll, like this example, "Is It True":[Excerpt: The Saxons, "Is It True"]The Saxons also recorded as the Capris (though with Alex Hodge rather than Gaynel in that lineup of the group) and, just to annoy everyone who cares about this stuff and drive us all into nervous breakdowns, there was another group, also called the Saxons, who also recorded as the Capris, on the same label -- at least one single actually came out with one of the groups on one side and the other on the other. Indeed, the side featuring our Saxons had previously been released as a Jesse Belvin solo record.Anyway, I hope in this first half of the story I\'ve given some idea of just how many different groups Jesse Belvin recorded with, and under how many different names, though I haven\'t listed even half of them. This is someone who seemed to form a new group every time he crossed the street, and make records with most of them, and a surprising number of them had become hits -- and "Goodnight My Love" and "Earth Angel" had become the kind of monster perennial standard that most musicians dream of ever writing.And, of course, Belvin had become the kind of musician that most record companies and publishers dream of finding -- the kind who will happily make hit records and sell the rights for a handful of dollars.That was soon to change. Belvin was married; I haven\'t been able to find out exactly when he married, but his wife also became his songwriting partner and his manager, and in 1958 she seemed to finally take control of his career for him.But before she did, there was one last pickup group hit to make.Frankie Ervin had been Charles Brown\'s replacement in Johnny Moore\'s Three Blazers, and had also sung briefly with Johnny Otis and Preston Love. While with Brown\'s group, he\'d developed a reputation for being able to perform novelty cash-in records -- he\'d made "Dragnet Blues", which had resulted in a lawsuit from the makers of the TV show Dragnet, and he\'d also done his Johnny Ace impression on "Johnny Ace\'s Last Letter", a single that had been rush-released by the Blazers after Johnny Ace\'s death:[Excerpt: Johnny Moore\'s Three Blazers, "Johnny Ace\'s Last Letter"]Ervin was looking for a solo career after leaving the Blazers, and he was put in touch with George Motola, who had a suggestion for him. A white group from Texas called The Slades had recorded a track called "You Cheated", which looked like it could possibly be a big hit -- except that the label it was on wasn\'t willing to come to terms with some of the big distributors over how much they were charging per record:[The Slades, "You Cheated"]Motola wanted to record a soundalike version of the song with Jesse Belvin as the lead singer, but Belvin had just signed a record contract with RCA, and didn\'t want to put out lead vocals on another label. Would Ervin like to put out the song as a solo record?Ervin hated the song -- he didn\'t like doo-wop generally, and he thought the song was a particularly bad example of the genre -- but a gig was a gig, and it\'d be a solo record under his own name. Ervin agreed to do it, and Motola got Jesse Belvin to put together a scratch vocal group for the session. Belvin found Johnny "Guitar" Watson and Tommy "Buster" Williams at a local ballroom and got them to come along, and on the way to the session they ran into "Handsome" Mel Williams and pulled him in.They were just going to be the uncredited backing vocalists on a Frankie Ervin record, and didn\'t spend much time thinking about what was clearly a soundalike cash-in. But when it came out it was credited as "The Shields" rather than Frankie Ervin:[Excerpt: The Shields, "You Cheated"]That\'s Belvin singing that wonderful falsetto part.Frankie Ervin was naturally annoyed that he wasn\'t given the label credit for the record. The recording was made as an independent production but leased to Dot Records, and somewhere along the line someone decided that it was better to have a generic group name rather than promote it as by a solo singer who might get ideas about wanting money.In a nice bit of irony, the Shields managed to reverse the normal course of the music industry -- this time a soundalike record by a black group managed to outsell the original by a white group. "You Cheated" ended up making number twelve on the pop charts -- a massive hit for an unknown doo-wop group at the time.Ervin started touring and making TV appearances as the Shields, backed by some random singers the record label had pulled together -- the rest of the vocalists on the record had been people who were under contract to other labels, and so couldn\'t make TV appearances.But the original Shields members reunited for the followup single, "Nature Boy", where they were joined by the members of the Turks, who were yet another group that Belvin was recording with, and who included both Hodge brothers:[Excerpt: "Nature Boy", the Shields]That, according to Ervin, also sold a million copies, but it was nothing like as successful as "You Cheated". The record label were getting sick of Ervin wanting credit and royalties and other things they didn\'t like singers, especially black ones, asking for. So the third Shields record only featured Belvin out of the original lineup, and subsequent recordings didn\'t even feature him.But while Belvin had accidentally put together yet another million-selling group, he had also moved on to bigger things. His wife had now firmly taken control of his career, and they had a plan. Belvin had signed to a major label -- RCA, the same label that Elvis Presley was on -- and he was going to make a play for the big time.He could still keep making doo-wop records with Johnny "Guitar" Watson and Eugene Church and the Hodge brothers and whoever else, if he felt like it, but his solo career was going to be something else. He was going to go for the same market as Nat "King" Cole, and become a smooth ballad singer.He was going to be a huge star, and he actually got to record an album, Just Jesse Belvin. The first single off that album was "Guess Who?", a song written by his wife Jo Anne, based on a love letter she had written to him:[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin, "Guess Who?"]That song made the top forty -- hitting number thirty-three on the pop chart and managed to reach number seven on the R&B charts. More importantly, it gained Grammy nominations for both best R&B performance and best male vocal performance. He lost to Dinah Washington and Frank Sinatra, and it\'s not as if losing to Dinah Washington or Frank Sinatra would have been an embarrassment.But by the time he lost those Grammies, Jesse was already dead, and so was Jo Anne.And here we get into the murkiest part of the story. There are a lot of rumours floating around about Jesse Belvin\'s death, and a lot of misinformation is out there, and frankly I\'ve not been able to get to the bottom of exactly what happened. When someone you love dies young, especially if that someone is a public figure, there\'s a tendency to look for complex explanations, and there\'s also a tendency to exaggerate stories in the telling. That\'s just human nature. And in some cases, that tendency is exploited by people out to make money.And Jesse and Jo Anne Belvin were both black people who died in the deep South, and so no real investigation was ever carried out. That means that by now, with almost everyone who was involved dead, it\'s impossible to tell what really happened.Almost every single sentence of what follows may be false. It\'s my best guess as to the order of events and what happened, based on the limited information out there.On February the sixth, 1960, there was a concert in Little Rock Arkansas, at the Robinson Auditorium. Billed as "the first rock and roll show of 1960", the headliner was Jackie Wilson, a friend of Belvin\'s. Jesse had just recorded his second album, "Mr Easy", which would be coming out soon, and while he was still relatively low on the bill, he was a rising star.That album was the one that was going to consolidate Belvin\'s turn towards pop balladry in the Nat "King" Cole style, but it would end up being a posthumous release:[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin with the Marty Paich Orchestra, "Blues in the Night"]It was an all-black lineup on stage, but according to some reports it was an integrated audience. In fact some reports go so far as to say it was the first integrated audience ever in Little Rock.Little Rock was not a place where the white people were fans of integration -- in fact they were so against it that the National Guard had had to be called in only two years earlier to protect black children when the first school in Little Rock had been integrated. And so apparently there was some racial abuse shouted by members of the audience. But it was nothing that the musicians hadn\'t dealt with before.After the show they all drove on towards Dallas. Jackie Wilson had some car problems on the way, and got to their stop in Dallas later than he was expecting to. The Belvins hadn\'t arrived yet, and so Wilson called Jesse\'s mother in LA, asking if she\'d heard from them.She hadn\'t. Shortly after setting off, the car with Jesse and Jo Anne in had been in a crash. Jesse and the drivers of both cars had been killed instantly. Kirk Davis, Belvin\'s guitarist on that tour, who had apparently been asleep in the back seat, was seriously injured but eventually came out of his coma. And Jesse had apparently reacted fast enough to shield his wife from the worst of the accident. But she was still unconscious, and seriously injured.The survivors were rushed to the hospital, where, according to Etta James, who heard the story from Jackie Wilson, they refused to treat Jo Anne Belvin until they knew that they would get money. She remained untreated until someone got in touch with Wilson, who drove down from Dallas Texas to Hope, Arkansas, where the hospital was, with the cash. But she died of her injuries a few days later.Now, here\'s the thing -- within a fortnight of the accident, there were rumours circulating widely enough to have been picked up by the newspapers that Belvin\'s car had had its tyres slashed. There were also stories, never confirmed, that Belvin had received death threats before the show. And Jackie Wilson had also had car trouble that night -- and according to some sources so had at least one other musician on the bill. So it\'s possible that the car was sabotaged.On the other hand, Belvin\'s driver, Charles Shackleford, had got the job with Belvin after being fired by Ray Charles. He was fired, according to Charles, because he kept staying awake watching the late-night shows, not getting enough sleep, and driving dangerously enough to scare Ray Charles -- who was fearless enough that he used to ride motorbikes despite being totally blind.So when Jesse and Jo Anne Belvin died, they could have been the victims of a racist murder, or they could just have been horribly unlucky. But we\'ll never know for sure, because the institutional racism at the time meant that there was no investigation.When they died, they left behind two children under the age of five, who were brought up by Jesse\'s mother. The oldest, Jesse Belvin Jr, became a singer himself, often performing material written or made famous by his father:[Excerpt: Jesse Belvin Jr, "Goodnight My Love"]Jesse Jr. devoted his life to finding out what actually happened to his parents, but never found any answers. | Episode forty-six of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs looks at "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" by the Chuck Berry Combo, and how Berry tried to square the circle of social commentary and teen appeal.

Today, we\'re going to talk about the single that came after that, both sides of which were recorded at the same session as "Beethoven". Specifically, we\'re going to talk about a single that is as close as Berry got to being outright political.While these days, both sides of his next single -- "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" and "Too Much Monkey Business" -- are considered rock and roll classics, neither hit the pop charts in 1956 when they were released. That\'s because, although they might not seem it at first glance now, both songs are tied in to a very different culture from the white teen one that was now dominating the rock and roll audience.To see why, we have to look at the R&B tradition which Berry grew up in, and in particular we want to look once again at the work of Berry\'s hero Louis Jordan, and the particular type of entertainment he provided.You see, while Louis Jordan was a huge star, and had a certain amount of crossover appeal to the white audience, he was someone whose biggest audience was black people, and in particular black adults.The teenager as a separate audience for music didn\'t really become a thing in a conscious way until the mid-fifties. Before the rise of the doo-wop groups, R&B music, and the jump band music before it, had been aimed at a hard-working, hard-partying, adult audience, and at a defiantly working-class audience at that -- one that had a hard life, and whose reality involved cheating partners, grasping landlords, angry bosses, and a large amount of drinking when they weren\'t dealing with those things.But one mistake that\'s always made when talking about marginalised people is to equate poverty or being a member of a racial minority with being unsophisticated. And there was a whole seam of complex, clever, ironic humour that shows up throughout the work of the jump band and early R&B musicians -- one that is very different from the cornball humour that was standard in both country music and white pop.That style of humour is often referred to as "hip" or "hep" humour, and the early master of it was probably Cab Calloway, who was also the author of a "hepster\'s dictionary" which remained for many years the most important source for understanding black slang of the twenties through forties. Calloway also sang about it:[Excerpt: "Jive: Page One of the Hepster\'s Dictionary", Cab Calloway]This style of humour, specific to the experiences of black people, was also the basis of much of Louis Jordan\'s work – and Jordan was clearly influenced by Calloway. You only have to look at songs like "Open the Door Richard":[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, "Open the Door Richard"]Or "What\'s the Use of Getting Sober (When You\'ll Only Get Drunk Again?)":[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, "What\'s the Use of Getting Sober (When You\'ll Only Get Drunk Again)?"]Obviously the experience of being drunk is one that people of all races have had, but the language used there, the specific word choices, roots Jordan\'s work very firmly in the African-American cultural experience. Jordan did, of course, have a white audience, but he got that audience without compromising the blackness of his language and humour.That humour disappears almost totally from the history of rock music when the white people start showing up, and there are only two exceptions to this. There are the Coasters, whose lyrics by Jerry Leiber manage to perfectly capture that cynical adult humour of the old-style jump bands, even when dealing with teenage frustrations rather than adult ones -- and we\'ll look at how successfully they do that in a few weeks\' time.The other exception is, of course, Chuck Berry, who would repeatedly cite Jordan as his single biggest influence. As we continue through Berry\'s career we will see time and again how things that appear original to him are actually Berry\'s take on something Louis Jordan did.Berry would later manage to couple Jordan\'s style of humour to the adolescent topics of school, dancing, cars, and unrequited love, rather than to the more adult topics of jobs, sex, drinking, and rent.But, crucially, at the time we\'re looking at, he was not yet doing so. At the session in April 1956 which produced "Roll Over Beethoven", "Drifting Heart", "Too Much Monkey Business", and "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man", there were still relatively few signs that Berry was appealing to a white adolescent audience. "Very few signs" does not, of course, mean that there were no signs -- Berry would have been able to see who it was who was turning up to his live performances -- but it seems to have taken him some time to adapt his songwriting to his new audience.Even "Roll Over Beethoven", which was, after all, a song very specifically aimed at mythologising the new music, had referred to "these rhythm and blues" rather than to rock and roll. Berry was almost thirty, and he was still in a mindset of writing songs for people his own age, for the audiences that had come to see him play small clubs in St. Louis.Indeed, the record industry as a whole still saw the teenage audience as almost an irrelevance – other than Bill Haley and Alan Freed, very few people really realised how big that audience was. The combination of disposable income and the changes in technology that had led to the transistor radio and the 45rpm single meant that for the first time teenagers were buying their own records, and listening to them on their own portable radios and record players, rather than having to listen to whatever their parents were buying.1956 was the year that this new factor stopped being ignorable, and Berry would become the poet laureate of teenage America, the person who more than anyone else would create the vocabulary which would be used by everyone who followed to write about the music and the interests of white teenagers.But at this point, Berry\'s music was very much not that, and both "Too Much Monkey Business" and "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" address very, very, adult concerns."Brown-Eyed Handsome Man", in particular, loses a lot of its context when heard today, but is an explicitly racialised song:[Excerpt: Chuck Berry Combo, "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"]Now, it\'s worth looking at that opening verse in some detail -- "arrested on charges of unemployment" is, first of all, a funny line, but it\'s *also* very much the kind of trumped-up charge that black people, especially black men, would be arrested and tried for. And then we have the judge\'s wife getting the man freed because he\'s so attractive. This is a very, very, common motif in black folklore and blues mythology. For example, in "Back Door Man", written by Willie Dixon for Howlin\' Wolf and released on Chess a few years after the time we\'re talking about, we have the following verse:[Excerpt: Howlin\' Wolf, "Back Door Man"]This is a hugely common theme in the blues -- you hear it in various versions of "Stagger Lee", for example. Later this would become, thanks to these blues songs, a staple of rock and pop music too -- you get the same thing in "Maxwell\'s Silver Hammer" by the Beatles, or Frank Zappa\'s "The Illinois Enema Bandit", but stripped of its original context, both those songs have a reputation, at least partly deserved, for tastelessness and misogyny.But when this motif first came to prominence, it had a very pointed message. There is a terrible stereotype of black men as being more animal than man, and of both having insatiable sexual appetites and being irresistible to white women. This is, of course, no more true of black men than it is of any other demographic, but it was used to fuel very real moral panics about black men raping white women, which led to many men being lynched.The trope of the women screaming out for the man to be set free, in this context, is very, very, pointed, and is owning this literally deadly negative stereotype and turning it into something to boast about.And then there\'s this verse:[Excerpt: "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man", Chuck Berry Combo]Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play for a major league baseball team, had only started playing for the Dodgers in 1947, and was still playing when Berry recorded this. Robinson was a massively influential figure in black culture, and right from the start of his career, he was having records made about him, like this one by Count Basie:[Excerpt: Count Basie, "Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?"]It\'s almost impossible to state how important Jackie Robinson was to black culture in the immediate post-war period. He was a huge example of a black man breaking a colour barrier, and not only that but excelling and beating all the white people in the field. Robinson was probably the single most important figurehead for civil rights in the late forties and early fifties, even though he was -- at least in his public statements -- far more interested in his ability to play the game than he was in his ability to affect the course of American politics.While obviously Robinson isn\'t mentioned by name in Berry\'s lyric, the description of the baseball player is clearly meant to evoke Robinson\'s image.None of the men mentioned in the song lyric are specifically stated to be black, just "brown-eyed" -- though there are often claims, which I\'ve never seen properly substantiated, that the original lyric was "brown-skinned handsome man". That does, though, fit with Berry\'s repeated tendency to slightly tone down politically controversial aspects of his lyrics – "Johnny B Goode" originally featured a "coloured boy" rather than a "country boy", and in "Nadine" he was originally "campaign shouting like a Southern Democrat" rather than a "Southern diplomat".But while the men are described in the song in deliberately ambiguous terms, the whole song is very much centred around images from black culture, and images of black men, and especially black men in contexts of white culture, usually high culture, from which they would normally be barred. Much as his idol Jordan had done earlier, Berry is repackaging black culture in a way that is relatable by a white audience, while not compromising that culture in any real way.The flip side of "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" is also interesting. "Too Much Monkey Business" is much more directly inspired by Jordan, but is less obviously rooted in specific black experiences. But at the same time, it is absolutely geared to adult concerns, rather than those of teenagers:[Excerpt: Chuck Berry, "Too Much Monkey Business"]Well, at least six of the seven verses dealt with adult concerns. Over the seven verses, Berry complains about working for the US mail and getting bills, being given the hard sell by a salesman, having a woman want him to settle down with her and get married, having to go to school every day, using a broken payphone, fighting in the war, and working in a petrol station.With the exception of the verse about going to school, these are far more the concerns of Louis Jordan, and of records like the Drifters\' "Money Honey" or the records Johnny Otis was making, than they are of the new white teenage audience.While both "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" and "Too Much Monkey Business" made the top five on the R&B chart, they didn\'t hit the pop top forty -- and "Roll Over Beethoven" had only just scraped into the top thirty. It was plain that if Berry wanted to repeat the success of "Maybellene", he would have to pivot towards a new audience. He couldn\'t make any more records aimed at black adults. He needed to start making records aimed at white children.That wasn\'t the only change he made. The "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man" single was the last one to be released under the name "the Chuck Berry Combo". There are at least two different stories about how Berry stopped working with Ebby Hardy and Johnnie Johnson. Berry always claimed that his two band members were getting drunk all the time and not capable of playing properly. Johnson, on the other hand, always said instead that the two of them got tired of all the travelling and just wanted to stay in St. Louis.Johnson would continue to play piano on many of Berry\'s recordings -- though from this point on he would never be the sole pianist for Berry, as many sources wrongly claim he was. From now on, Chuck Berry was a solo artist.The first fruit of this newfound solo stardom was Berry\'s first film appearance. Rock! Rock! Rock! is one of the more widely-available rock and roll films now, thanks to it having entered into the public domain -- you can actually even watch the film through its Wikipedia page, which I\'ll link in the show notes. It\'s not, though, a film I\'d actually recommend watching at all. The plot, such as it is, consists of Tuesday Weld wanting to buy a new dress for the prom, and her dad not wanting to give her the money, and an "evil" rival for Weld\'s boyfriend\'s attentions (who you can tell is evil because she has dark hair rather than being blonde like Weld) trying to get her in trouble.You get something of an idea of the quality of the film by the fact that its writer was also its producer, who was also the composer of the incidental music and the title song:[Excerpt: "Rock Rock Rock", Jimmy Cavallo and the House Rockers]That was co-written by Milton Subotsky, the film\'s producer, who would go on to much better and more interesting things as the co-founder of Amicus Films, a British film company that made a whole host of cheap but enjoyable horror and science fiction films. Oddly enough, we\'ll be meeting Subotsky again.How important the plot is can be summed up by the fact that there is a fifteen-minute sequence in this seventy-minute film, in which Weld and her friend merely watch the TV. The programme they\'re watching is a fictional TV show, presented by Alan Freed, in which he introduces various rock and roll acts, and this is where Berry appears.The song he\'s singing in the film is his next single, "You Can\'t Catch Me", which had actually been recorded before “Roll Over Beethoven”. But the story of the song\'s release is one that tells you a lot about the music business in the 1950s, and about how little the artists understood about what it was they were getting into.[Excerpt: Chuck Berry: "You Can\'t Catch Me"]As we discussed last week when talking about Fats Domino, it wasn\'t normal for R&B acts to put out albums, and so it was a sign of how much the film was aimed at the white teenage audience that a soundtrack album was considered at all. It seems to have been Alan Freed\'s idea. Freed was the star of the film, and the acts in it -- people like Lavern Baker, the Moonglows, Johnny Burnette, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers -- were for the most part people he regularly featured on his radio show (along with a handful of bland white novelty acts that were included in the misguided belief that the teenage audience wanted to hear a pre-teen kid singing about rock and roll).But of course, Freed being Freed, what that meant was that the acts he included were from record labels that would bribe him, or with which he had some kind of financial relationship, and as they were on multiple different labels, this caused problems when deciding who got to put out a soundtrack album.In particular, both the Chess brothers, whose labels had provided the Flamingos, the Moonglows, and Berry, and Morris Levy, the gangster who controlled the career of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, the single biggest act in the film, wanted the right to put out a soundtrack album and profit from the publicity the film would provide. All of them were "business associates" of Freed -- Freed managed the Moonglows, and had been given writing credit on songs by both the Moonglows and Berry in return for playing them on his radio show, while Levy was himself Freed\'s manager, and had been largely responsible for getting Freed his unchallenged dominance of New York radio.So they came to a compromise. The soundtrack album would only feature the three Chess acts who appeared in the film, and would include four songs by each of them, rather than the one song each they performed in the film. And the album would be out on Chess. But the album would include the previously-released songs that Freed was credited with co-writing, and the new songs would be published, not by the publishing companies that published those artists\' songs, but by one of Levy\'s companies.Chuck Berry was tricked into signing his rights to the song away by a standard Leonard Chess tactic -- he was called into Chess\' office to receive a large royalty cheque, and Chess asked him if while he was there he would mind signing this other document that needed signing, only could he do it in a hurry, because Chess had an urgent appointment? It was six months until Berry realised that he\'d signed away the rights to "You Can\'t Catch Me", and twenty-eight years before he was able to reclaim the copyright for himself.In the meantime, the rights to that one Chuck Berry song made Levy far more money than he could possibly have expected, because of this one line:[Excerpt: Chuck Berry, "You Can\'t Catch Me"]In 1969, John Lennon took that line and used it as the opening line for the Beatles song "Come Together":[Excerpt: The Beatles, "Come Together"]Rather than go through the courts, Levy and Lennon came to an agreement -- Lennon was going to make an album of rock and roll covers, and he would include at least three songs to which Levy owned the copyright, including "You Can\'t Catch Me". As a result, even after Levy finally lost the rights to the song in the early 1980s, he still continued earning money from John Lennon\'s cover versions of two other songs he owned, which would never have been recorded without him having owned “You Can\'t Catch Me”."You Can\'t Catch Me" was a flop, and didn\'t even make the R&B charts, let alone the pop charts. This even though its B-side, "Havana Moon", would in a roundabout way end up being Berry\'s most influential song:[Excerpt: Chuck Berry, "Havana Moon"]We\'ll talk about just how influential that song was in a year or so…Berry knew he had to pivot, and fast. He wrote a new song, "Rock and Roll Music", which he thought could maybe have the same kind of success as "Roll Over Beethoven", but used the more currently-popular term rock and roll rather than talking about "rhythm and blues" as the earlier song did. But while he demoed that, it wasn\'t a song that he could be certain would directly get right into the head of every teenage kid in America.For that, he turned to Johnnie Johnson again. For years, Johnson had had his own theme song at the Cosmopolitan Club. In its original form the song was based on "Honky Tonk Train Blues" by Meade "Lux" Lewis:[Excerpt: Meade "Lux" Lewis, "Honky Tonk Train Blues"]Johnson\'s own take on the song had kept Lewis\' intro, and had been renamed "Johnnie\'s Boogie":[Excerpt: Johnnie Johnson, "Johnnie\'s Boogie"]Johnson suggested to Berry that they take that intro and have Berry play the same thing, but on the guitar. When he did, they found that when he played his guitar, it was like ringing a bell -- a school bell, to be precise. And that gave Berry the idea for the lyric:[Excerpt: Chuck Berry, "School Day"]"School Day" was the pivot point, the song with which Chuck Berry turned wholly towards teenage concerns, and away from those of adults. The description of the drudgery of life in school was not that different from the descriptions of working life in "Too Much Monkey Business", but it was infinitely more relatable to the new young rock and roll audience than anything in the earlier song.And not only that, the slow trudge of school life gets replaced, in the final verses, with an anthem to the new music:[Excerpt: Chuck Berry, "School Day"]"School Day" became the biggest-selling single ever to be released by Chess to that point. It hit number one on the R&B charts, knocking "All Shook Up" by Elvis off the top, and made number five on the Billboard pop charts. It charted in the UK, which given Chess\' lack of distribution over here at that point was a minor miracle, and it stayed on the Billboard pop chart for an astonishing six months."School Day" was successful enough that Berry was given an album release of his own. "After School Session" was a compilation of tracks Berry had released as either the A- or B-sides of singles, including "School Day", "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man", "Too Much Monkey Business", and "Havana Moon", but not including "You Can\'t Catch Me" or the other songs on the "Rock Rock Rock" compilation. It was filled out with a couple of generic blues instrumentals, but was otherwise a perfect representation of where Berry was artistically, right at this turning point. And that shows even in the title of the record.The name "After School Session" obviously refers to "School Day", and to the kids in the song going to listen to rock and roll after school ended, but it was also a tip of the hat to another song, one which may have inspired the lyrics to "School Day" in much the same way that Meade "Lux" Lewis had inspired the music:[Excerpt: Louis Jordan, "After School Swing Session (Swinging With Symphony Sid)"]Even at his most up-to-date, Chuck Berry was still paying homage to Louis Jordan."School Day" was the point where Chuck Berry went from middling rhythm and blues star to major rock and roll star, and his next twelve records would all make the Billboard pop charts. 1957 was going to be Chuck Berry\'s year, and we\'ll hear how in a few weeks time, when we look at another Louis Jordan influenced song, about a kid who played the guitar... | Episode forty-five of A History of Rock Music in Five Hundred Songs looks at "Blueberry Hill" by Fats Domino, and at how the racial tensions of the fifties meant that a smiling, diffident, cheerful man playing happy music ended up starting riots all over the US.Patreon backers also have a ten-minute bonus episode available, on "Birmingham Bounce" by Hardrock Gunter.----more----ResourcesAs always, I\'ve created a Mixcloud streaming playlist with full versions of all the songs in the episode.The best compilation of Fats Domino\'s music is a four-CD box set called They Call Me The Fat Man: The Legendary Imperial Recordings.The biographical information here comes from Rick Coleman\'s Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock \'n\' Roll.\xa0The information about the "Yancey Special" bassline and its history comes from "Before Elvis", by Larry Birnbaum.There have been three previous episodes in which Domino and Bartholomew have featured, including two on Domino songs.

Why not join them?\xa0TranscriptThis is the third episode we\'re going to do on Fats Domino, and the last one, though he will be turning up in other episodes in various ways. He was the one star from the pre-rock days of R&B to last and thrive, and even become bigger, in the rock and roll era, and he was, other than Elvis Presley, by far the most successful of the first wave of rock and roll stars.\xa0And this points to something interesting -- something which we haven\'t really pointed out as much as you might expect.\xa0Because of that first wave of rock and rollers, by late 1956 there were only Elvis and the black R&B stars left as rock and roll stars on the US charts. The wave of white rockabilly acts that had hits throughout 1955 and 56 had all fizzled -- Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, and Bill Haley would between them never have another major hit in the US, though all of them would have success in other countries, and make important music over the next few years. Johnny Cash would have more hits, but he would increasingly be marketed as a country music star.If we\'re talking about actual rock and roll hits rising to decent positions in the charts, by late 1956 you\'re looking at acts like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Fats Domino, with only Elvis left of the rockabillies.\xa0Of course, very shortly afterwards, there would come a second wave of white rock and rollers, who would permanently change the music, and by the time we get to mid-1957 we\'ll be in a period where white man with guitar is the default image for rock and roll star, but in late 1956, that default image was a black man with a piano, and the black man with a piano who was selling the most records, by far, was Fats Domino.\xa0[Excerpt: Fats Domino, "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0When we left Domino, he had just had his breakout rock and roll hit, with "Ain\'t That A Shame". He was so successful that Imperial Records actually put out an album by him, rather than just singles, for the first time in the six years he\'d been recording for them. This was a bigger deal than it sounds -- rhythm and blues artists hardly ever put out albums in the fifties. The sales of their records weren\'t even normally directly to their audiences -- they were to jukebox manufacturers.\xa0So when Imperial put out an album, that was a sign that something had changed with Domino\'s audience -- he was selling to white people with money. The black audience, for the most part, were still buying 78s, not even 45s -- they were generally relatively poor, and not the type of people to upgrade their record players while the old ones still worked.\xa0(This is obviously a huge generalisation, but it\'s true in so far as any generalisations are true.)\xa0Meanwhile, the young white rock and roll audience that had developed all of a sudden between 1954 and 1956 was mostly buying the new 45rpm singles, but at least some of them were also buying LPs -- enough of them that artists like Elvis were selling on the format.\xa0Domino\'s first album, Rock and Rollin\' With Fats Domino, was made up almost entirely of previously released material -- mostly hit singles he\'d had in the few years before the rock and roll boom took off, and including the songs we\'ve looked at before. It was followed only three months later by a follow-up, imaginatively titled Fats Domino Rock and Rollin\'. That one was largely made up of outtakes and unreleased tracks from 1953, but when it came out in April 1956 it sold twenty thousand copies in its first week on release.\xa0That doesn\'t sound a lot now, but for an album aimed at a teenage audience, by a black artist, in 1956, and featuring only one hit single, that was quite an extraordinary achievement.\xa0But Domino\'s commercial success in 1956 was very much overshadowed by other events, which had everything to do with the racial attitudes of the time. Because believe it or not, Fats Domino\'s shows were often disrupted by riots.\xa0We\'ve been talking about 1956 for a while, and dealing with black artists, without having really mentioned just what a crucial time this was in the history of the civil rights struggle. The murder of Emmett Till, supposedly for whistling at a white woman, had been in August 1955. Rosa Parks had refused to get to the back of the bus in December 1955, and in early 1956 a campaign of white supremacist terrorism against black people stepped up, with the firebombing of several churches and of the houses of civil rights leaders including Dr. Martin Luther King.\xa0This, as much as anything musical, is the context you need to understand why rock and roll was seen as so revolutionary in 1956 in particular. White teenagers were listening to music by black musicians, and even imitating that music themselves, right at the point where people were having to start taking sides for or against racial justice and human decency. A large chunk of white America was more concerned about the "inappropriate" behaviour of people like Rosa Parks than about the legitimate concerns of the firebombers.And this attitude was also showing up in the reaction to music. In April 1956 Nat King Cole was injured on stage when a mob of white supremacists attacked him. Cole was one of the least politically vocal black entertainers, and he was appearing before an all-white audience, but he was a black man playing with a white backing band, and that was enough for him to be a target for attempted murder.\xa0And this is the background against which you have to look at the reports of violence at Fats Domino shows. The riots which broke out at his shows throughout that year were blamed in contemporary news reports on his "pulsating jungle rhythms" -- and there\'s not even an attempt made to hide the racism in statements like that -- but there was little shocking about Domino\'s actual music at the time.\xa0In fact, in 1956, Domino seemed to be trying to cross over to the country and older pop audience, by performing old standards from decades earlier. His first attempt at doing so became a top twenty pop hit. "My Blue Heaven" had originally been a hit in 1927 for the crooner Gene Austin:\xa0[Excerpt: Gene Austin, "My Blue Heaven"]\xa0Domino\'s version gave it a mild R&B flavour, and it became a double-sided hit with "I\'m In Love Again" on the other side:\xa0[Excerpt: Fats Domino, "My Blue Heaven"]\xa0And for the rest of the year, Domino would repeat this formula -- one side of each of his singles would be written by Domino or his producer Dave Bartholomew, while the other side would be a song from twenty to forty years earlier. His single releases for the next eighteen months or so would include on them such standards as "I\'m in the Mood for Love", "As Time Goes By", and "When My Dreamboat Comes Home".\xa0And so, this is the music that was supposedly to blame for riots. And riots *did* follow Domino around everywhere he went. In Roanoake, Virginia, for example, in May, Domino was playing to a segregated crowd -- whites in the balcony, black people on the floor. The way segregation worked when it came to rock and roll or R&B concerts was simple -- whichever race the promoter thought would be more likely to come got the floor, the race which would have fewer audience members got the balcony.\xa0But in this case, the promoters underestimated how many white people were now listening to this new music. The balcony filled up, and a lot of white teenagers went down and joined the black people on the ground floor. Towards the end of the show, someone in the balcony, incensed at the idea of black and white people dancing together, threw a whisky bottle at the crowd below. Soon whisky bottles were flying through the air, and the riot in the audience spread to the streets around.\xa0The New York Times blamed the black audience members, even though it had been a white person who\'d thrown the first bottle. The American Legion, which owned the concert venue, decided that the simplest solution was just to ban mixed audiences altogether -- they\'d either have all-white or all-black audiences.\xa0Another riot broke out in San Jose in July, when someone threw a string of lit firecrackers into the audience. In the ensuing riot, a thousand beer bottles were broken, twelve people were arrested, and another twelve needed medical treatment.\xa0In Houston, Domino played another show where white people were in the balcony and black people were on the dancefloor below. Some of the white people decided to join the black dancers, at which point a black policeman -- trying to avoid another riot because of "race mixing" -- said that everyone had to sit down and no-one could dance. But then a white cop overruled him and said that only white people could dance. Domino refused to carry on playing if black people weren\'t allowed to dance, too, and while that show didn\'t turn violent, a dozen people were arrested for threatening the police.\xa0This is the context in which Domino was performing, and this is the context in which he had his biggest hit.The song that was meant to be the hit was "Honey Chile", a new original which Domino got to feature in an exploitation film called "Shake, Rattle, and Rock":\xa0[Excerpt: Fats Domino, "Honey Chile"]\xa0At the same session where he recorded that, he tried to record another old standard, with disappointing results."Blueberry Hill" was originally written in 1940 by Vincent Rose, Larry Stock, and Al Lewis. As with many songs of the time, it was recorded simultaneously by dozens of artists, but it was the Glenn Miller Orchestra who had the biggest hit with it:\xa0[Excerpt: The Glenn Miller Orchestra, "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0After Glenn Miller, Gene Autry had also had a hit with the song. We\'ve talked before about Autry, and how he was the biggest Western music star of the late thirties and early forties, and influenced everyone from Les Paul to Bo Diddley. Given Domino\'s taste for country and western music, it\'s possible that Autry\'s version was the first version of the song he came to love:\xa0[Excerpt: Gene Autry, "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0But Domino was inspired to cover the song by Louis Armstrong\'s recording. Armstrong was, of course, another legend of New Orleans music, and his version, from 1949, had come out after Domino had already started his own career:\xa0[Excerpt: Louis Armstrong: "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0Domino loved Armstrong\'s version, and had wanted to record it for a long time, but when they got into the studio the band couldn\'t get through a whole take of the song. Dave Bartholomew, who hadn\'t been keen on recording the song anyway, said at the end of the session, "We got nuthin\'".\xa0But Bunny Robyn, the engineer at the session, thought it was salvageable. He edited together a version from bits of half-finished takes, and thanks to the absolutely metronomic time sense of Earl Palmer, he managed to do it so well that after more than thirty years of listening to the record, I\'m still not certain exactly where the join is. I *think* it\'s just before he starts the second middle eight -- there\'s a *slight* change of sonic ambience there -- but I wouldn\'t swear to it. Listen for yourself. The part where I think the join comes is just before he sings "the wind in the willow":\xa0[Excerpt: Fats Domino, "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0After Robyn edited that version together, Dave Bartholomew tried to stop it from being released, telling Lew Chudd, the owner of the record label, that releasing it would ruin Domino\'s career forever.\xa0He couldn\'t have been more wrong. The song became Domino\'s biggest hit, rising to number two in the pop charts, and Bartholomew later admitted it had been a huge mistake for him to try to block it, saying that his horn arrangement for the song would be the thing he would be remembered for, and telling Domino\'s biographer Rick Coleman, "When I\'m dead and gone a million times, they\'ll still be playing \'da-da-da-da-dee-dah\'".\xa0Not only was Domino\'s version a hit, but it was big enough that Louis Armstrong\'s version of the song was reissued and became a hit as well, and Elvis recorded a soundalike cover, including the piano intro that Domino had come up with, for his film "Loving You":\xa0[Excerpt: Elvis Presley, "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0The song was so big that it even revived the career of its co-lyricist, Al Lewis, whose career had been in the doldrums since a run of hits for people like Eddie Cantor in the 1930s. Lewis made a comeback as an R&B songwriter, co-writing songs for Domino himself:\xa0[Excerpt: Fats Domino, "I\'m Ready"]\xa0And for Little Anthony and the Imperials:\xa0[Excerpt: Little Anthony and the Imperials, "Tears on My Pillow"]\xa0As always with a Fats Domino record, we\'re going to talk about its points of rhythmic interest. The bass-line here is not one that was used on any of the previous versions, but it was common on New Orleans R&B records -- indeed it\'s very similar to the one Domino used on "Ain\'t That a Shame", which we looked at a few months ago.\xa0This kind of bassline has some of that Jelly Roll Morton Spanish tinge we\'ve talked about before, when we talked about the tresilo rhythms that Dave Bartholomew brought to the arrangements. But when it\'s used as a piano bassline, as it is here, it comes indirectly from the boogie woogie pianist Jimmy Yancey:\xa0[Excerpt: Jimmy Yancey, "How Long Blues"]\xa0Yancey made a speciality of this kind of bassline, but the man who made every New Orleans piano player start playing like that was the great boogie player Meade "Lux" Lewis, with his song "Yancey Special":\xa0[Excerpt: Meade "Lux" Lewis, "Yancey Special"]\xa0Lewis named that song after Yancey, which caused a problem for him when Sonny Thompson, an R&B bandleader from Chicago, recorded an instrumental with a similar bassline, "Long Gone":\xa0[Excerpt: Sonny Thompson, "Long Gone"]\xa0That song went to number one on the R&B charts, and Lewis sued Thompson for copyright infringement, claiming it was too similar to "Yancey Special", because it shared the same bassline. The defendants brought out Jimmy Yancey, who said that he\'d come up with that bassline long before Lewis had. Lewis didn\'t help himself in his testimony -- he claimed, at first, that he hadn\'t named the song after Jimmy Yancey, but later admitted on the stand that the song called "Yancey Special" which featured a bassline in the style of Jimmy Yancey had indeed been named after Jimmy Yancey.\xa0The plagiarism case was thrown out for that reason, but also for two others. One was that the bassline was such a simple idea that it couldn\'t by itself be copyrightable -- which is something I would question, but I have spoken in great detail about the problems with copyright law as it comes to black American musical creation in the past, and I won\'t repeat myself here. The other was that by allowing the record of "Yancey Special" to come out before he\'d registered the copyright, Lewis had dedicated the whole composition to the public domain, and so Thompson could do what he liked with the bassline.\xa0That bassline became a staple of R&B music, and particularly of New Orleans R&B music. You can hear it, for example, on "I Hear You Knockin\'", a 1955 hit for Smiley Lewis, arranged by Dave Bartholomew, featuring Huey "Piano" Smith playing a very Fats Domino style piano part:\xa0[Excerpt: Smiley Lewis, "I Hear You Knockin\'"]\xa0Domino had used the bassline in "Ain\'t That A Shame", as well, and it seems to have been taken up by Bartholomew as a signature motif -- he also used it in "Blue Monday", another song which he\'d written for Smiley Lewis:\xa0[Excerpt: Smiley Lewis, "Blue Monday"]\xa0Domino\'s remake of that song would become his next hit after "Blueberry Hill", and almost as big a success.Worldwide, "Blueberry Hill" was the biggest rock and roll hit of 1956, outdoing even Elvis\' "Hound Dog" and "Heartbreak Hotel" in worldwide chart positions, though none of those songs could beat "Que Sera Sera" by Doris Day -- however much our popular image of the 1950s is based on ponytailed bobbysoxers, the fact remains that a sizeable proportion of the record-buying public were older and less inclined to rock than to gently sway, and for all that Domino\'s shows were inspiring riots wherever he went in 1956, his records were still also appealing to that older crowd.\xa0But segregation applied here too. "Blueberry Hill" made Billboard\'s top thirty records of the year for country sales in its annual roundup, but it never appeared even on the top one hundred country charts during 1956 itself. We\'ve talked before about how the recent "Old Town Road" debacle shows how musical genres are the product of rigid segregation, but nothing shows that more than this. That appearance by Domino in the top thirty sellers for the year was the only appearance by a black artist on any Billboard country charts in the fifties, and it shows that country audiences were buying Domino\'s records, just as his *lack* of appearance on all the other country charts that year shows that this wasn\'t being recognised by any of the musical gatekeepers, despite the evident country sensibility in his performance:\xa0[Excerpt: Fats Domino, "Blueberry Hill"]\xa0Meanwhile, of course, Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins were appearing on the R&B charts as well as the country and pop ones.\xa01956 was the absolute peak of Domino\'s career in chart terms, and "Blueberry Hill" was his biggest hit of that year, but he would carry on having top twenty pop hits until 1962, by which point he had outlasted not only the first wave of rockabilly acts that came up in 1955 and 56, but almost all of the second wave that we\'re going to see coming up in 1957 as well. His is an immense body of work, and we\'ve barely touched upon it in the three episodes this podcast has devoted to him. His top thirty R&B chart hits span from 1949 through to 1964, a career that covers multiple revolutions in music. When he started having hits, the biggest artists in pop music were Perry Como and the Andrews Sisters, and when he stopped, the Beatles were at the top of the charts.Domino was, other than Elvis, the biggest rock and roll star of the fifties by a massive margin. The whole of New Orleans music owes a debt to him, and "Blueberry Hill" in particular has been cited as an influence by everyone from Mick Jagger to Leonard Cohen.\xa0Yet he is curiously unacknowledged in the popular consciousness, while much lesser stars loom larger. I suspect that part of the reason for that is racism, both in ignoring a black man because he was black, and in ignoring him because he didn\'t fit white prejudices about black people and the music they make.\xa0Other than drinking a bit too much, and sleeping around a little in the fifties, Domino led a remarkably non-rock-and-roll life. He was married to the same woman for sixty-one years, he rarely left his home in New Orleans, and other than a little friction between songwriting partners you\'ll struggle to find anyone who had a bad word to say about him. You build a legend as a rock star by shooting your bass player on stage or choking to death on your own vomit, not by not liking to travel because you don\'t like the food anywhere else, or by being shy but polite, and smiling a lot.\xa0That\'s not how you build a reputation for rock and roll excess. But it *is* how you build a body of work that stands up to any artist from the mid-twentieth-century, and how you live a long and happy life. It\'s how you get the Medal of Arts awarded to you by two Presidents -- George W. Bush awarded Domino with a replacement after he lost his first medal, from Bill Clinton, during Hurricane Katrina. And it\'s how you become so universally beloved and admired that when your home is destroyed in a hurricane, everyone from Elton John to Doctor John, from Paul McCartney to Robert Plant, will come together to record a tribute album to help raise funds to rebuild it.\xa0Fats Domino died in 2017, sixty-eight years after the start of his career, at the age of eighty-nine. His collaborator Dave Bartholomew died in June this year, aged one hundred. They both left behind one of the finest legacies in the histories of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and New Orleans music.', 'chan_desc': 'A podcast which goes through the history of rock and roll music, one song at a time, starting in 1938 and ending up in 1999.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/7e/43/38/7e433876-ed96-d679-0bc1-9b66dde5fad4/mza_5805953548800276814.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-09-30'}}

With new revelations from former wives and lovers, family members, fellow band members and celebrities, and music industry figures, this book offers an updated, unfettered look at Reed’s creative process, his mental health problems, his bisexuality, his three marriages, and his addictions to drugs and alcohol.Featuring previously unpublished photographs of some of Reed’s most private moments, this is the definitive account of one of rock ’n’ roll’s most complicated and brilliant prophets.Howard Sounes is known for writing detailed and revelatory biographies of a wide range of extraordinary personalities, including the murderers Fred and Rosemary West (Fred & Rose), Charles Bukowski (Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life), and musicians Bob Dylan (Down the Highway) and Paul McCartney (Fab).

He shares his vast collection of sound effect Instruments with us and plays examples of some of his favorite pieces. He also tells us the full history of trap drummers and describes what it would have been like to be a working drummer in the early 1900\'s. Life was very different back then for musicians but drummers were never short of work thanks to the overwhelming need for theaters to keep the audience entertained by supplementing silent movies with sound effects. We learn all about where they would work, what instruments they would use, how they got around to the gigs, and the manufacturers who created these fascinating instruments.Here is some great information directly from Nicks website:"Few drummers these days recall the life of an early 20th century drummer, and the many circumstances they were faced with that would often require creativity, and an extensive branching out of their instrument collection. Basic additions to the trap kit were ratchets for off-beats, and triangles for soft strains and theatre work. When jobs at motion picture houses were widely in demand, sound effect instruments added realism to the silent screen. These basics of these would often include\xa0 a songbird whistle, cuckoo whistle, clog mallets (for dancing scenes), and a duck call that could produce farm animal sounds. Larger cinemas would separate the drummer from the effects, having a full table of “contraptions” (or "traps") for thunderstorm sounds, vehicle sounds, and animal sounds. Every time the screen showed a locomotive, a rooster, a gunshot, a doorbell, a dog barking, a streetcar, or even a growling bear, the traps drummer would be prepared!When the silent film era ended in 1927, the need for the more bizarre effects diminished. Jazz songs with amusing themes about train travel would have the drummer picking up the train whistle once in a while; and, a “billy goat stomp” would start with humorous bleat, but the need to pack your case with car horns and horse hooves was certainly gone. Sound effect instruments had a brief second calling in radio, but as many of the radio studios would build their own effects, the need for the portable traps that a drummer could buy from his local drum shop slowly faded away."Check out Nicks website here: http://www.vintagepercussionsoundeffects.comFind his awesome page on Instagram at @weeklytrapdrummer- Follow us on Facebook and Instagram for daily drumming videos! @drumhistory_podcast- Please give us a rating and a review if you like the show.

As the 40th anniversary of No Nukes approaches, this episode looks at the reasons for these benefits, the successes and challenges, and some of the iconic performances by legends including Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen. | When Sha Na Na played on the final morning of Woodstock, it was a signal of a Fifties revival that would carry into the 1980s. While American Graffiti, Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and Grease presented a specific image of the Fifties, that image was tinged with nostalgia. Did that image of the Fifties ever really exist? | Rock bands like Boston, Queen, Journey, and Foreigner sold millions of albums and still are part of classic rock\'s regular radio rotation. However, punk rock bands such as The Ramones rebelled against the corporate take over of FM radio in the mid-70s and what they perceived as the death of rock and roll by creating a style of music that was both new and an homage to the past. American punk rock bands influenced the much more political British rock bands, especially The Sex Pistols, who were brash, bold, and often very controversial. | As the Vietnam War dragged into the 1970s, artists from Merle Haggard to Martha Reeves to Marvin Gaye were inspired to write or record songs about the war. This episode takes a close look at what was happening in Vietnam as the 70s began and how that was -- or was not -- reflected in the music that was made. | What is Gay Pride without music? As we approach the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, we must remember that Pride exists (still) out of necessity. For much of our world\'s history, queer people have felt the need to either hide or assert their right to exist. Music is integral to Pride. Some of the iconic songs of the 70s were written with the LGBT community in mind and some were claimed. Still other songs took on new significance in the wake of the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. This episode celebrates Pride and the music associated with it. | Rock and roll was a man\'s world in the 1970s. Would that have been any different if Janis Joplin had not died just as the 70s were beginning? The world will never know but what is known is that women in the music industry faced challenges that men did not, simply because of their gender. This episode reviews the contributions of Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, Ann Wilson, Nancy Wilson, and Chrissie Hynde in an attempt to understand how women found their place in rock while society as a whole still struggled with granting women their full complement of civil rights. | The 70s gave birth to hip hop but hip hop was conceived in the 50s. After World War II, "white flight" left many cities in a state of poverty and neglect. The Bronx was the epitome of the results of this mass migration and young African American artists found little to relate to in the most popular music of the era: disco. By borrowing both technique and music from the disco that they largely rejected, the hip hop pioneers created a new genre of music that has defined pop music of the early 21st century. | Songwriters of the 70s took on Richard Nixon the best way they knew how: with their music. Blaming music for drug use, the Kent State shootings, Watergate, and getting a pardon for "any crimes he may have committed" were all issues that inspired artists such as Jefferson Airplane, CSNY, Gil Scott-Heron, Stevie Wonder, and David Bowie. This episode discusses how music reflected the dissatisfaction and outright anger with President Richard Nixon, even beyond his resignation in August 1974. | Did music help push the sexual revolution in the 1970s or was the music reflecting the changes in how society viewed sexuality? Music has always been used to sell sex but the message was delivered more directly in the 70s. The sexual revolution and music\'s role in it are explored using the music of Loretta Lynn, Led Zeppelin, The Archies (!), Marvin Gaye, Labelle, Donna Summer, and Patti Smith.', 'chan_desc': 'An audio documentary of 70s music.

You\'d think they\'d slow down and smell the roses, but they didn\'t. The Band never followed the same path as everyone else and continued to dive deep into recording. Often times as individuals rather than a group, each member spent serious time in 1969 and 1970 working on their friends projects including work for John Martyn, Todd Rundgren, Jesse Winchester and John Simon. However, with the success came the demands of a fanbase and a label. The Band spent time on the road in 1969 for the first time in an extended capacity. The success opened the door to a new life style, a place where everyone wanted to be your friend and every had a party. With touring also came press in a meaningful way. The Band broke ground being the first American band on TIME magazine. The Band also were re-introduced to the press with a very spicy interview given by Ronnie Hawkins and much, much more. The Band embraced this life style, but it would just be a matter of time before it all began to start breaking down. With a label expecting more albums, The Band would be back in the studio in 1970 creating their third album. Time will tell if it would all pay off for The Band.

This shows is part of Pantheon Podcasts. | While The Band had critical success on their first studio effort 1968\'s "Music From Big Pink" they didn\'t waste anytime before getting back into the studio to make their follow up. The Band was now respected in their own right apart from Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. They had the support of a growing fanbase, critics and most importantly musicians like George Harrison and Eric Clapton. However, while The Band were enjoying the frills of a now more luxurious lifestyle that didn\'t impede on their music making. Their self-titled second album, later referred to as "The Brown Album" pushed them even further in the music cultural zeitgeist. The approach similar to what they had done with their first album. This time holing themselves up into a homemade studio in the Hollywood Hills as opposed to the mountain wilderness of the Catskills in upstate New York. The Brown album went on to produce some of The Band\'s most well known songs like "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", "Rag Mamma Rag", "Whispering Pines" and "King Harvest (Has Surely Come" and further cemented their influence in the creation of the Americana genre of back to basics. Their sophomore album was also their own unique commentary on America from the perspective of the now increasingly forgotten peoples: the farmers, the truck drivers and even the drunkards! Moreover, The Band began to play live again for the first time in years, taking part in some of the most important festivals in music history like: the Toronto Pop Festival, Woodstock and Isle of Wight all in 1969. While also playing historic stints at Bill Graham\'s Winterland in San Fransisco and Fillmore East in New York. The Band was nearing the peak, their reach was growing, their influence looming large and they were able to make the music they had yearned to create for over a decade.

We kick things off with someone who has been singing about gore and Satan for decades. King Diamond not only dons the corpse paint but he writes the songs to put chills down your spine. Between the ghosts of children, murder, the devil, and anything spooky in between, King Diamond and Mercyful Fate have inspired the metal bands that followed their footsteps. We talk about the events and line up changes that made them the long-staying band they are today. And while you\'re listening, why not get yourself in the mood with a Warlock Imperial Pumpkin Stout from Southern Tier Brewing Co?Listen to all the great podcasts over on the Pantheon Network! | This week we conclude the story of the Beastie Boys, one of the hardest working groups in not just rap or rock, but all of music. We dive into the later years of their career, when they really hit their stride and finally got the recognition they deserved. Within a decade they went from being the brains behind the amped-up classic "Sabotage" to creating an all instrumental album with some jazz-infused, post punk goodness. We finish it all up with a discussion on their untimely end that is still felt to this day and their ridiculous influence on the world of music. So upgrade yourself to a Cookie O\'Puss from Captain Lawrence Brewing and prepare yourselves because nobody, can do it, like Rock Candy can, come on!Resources: The Beastie Boys Book by Michael Diamond and Adam HorovitzListen to all the great podcasts over on the Pantheon Network! | They\'re one of the most influential groups in the rap/hip-hop genre, but actually had their humble beginnings in punk and hardcore. The Beastie boys have taken advantage of every opportunity that\'s come their way and infused their own interests in every step along the way. In this week\'s episode, learn how exactly it was that these 3 Jewish punks boys from NYC learned about this up and coming MC lifestyle and hopped on board the train with some of the greats like Run DMC and LL Cool J. And while you\'re kickin\' it, why not enjoy a Cookie Puss Milkshake IPA from Captain Lawrence Brewing to get yourself in the mood?Listen to all the great podcasts over on Pantheon | This week we class it up with this New Age lady. Enya is best known around the world for her few singles to hit the Pure Moods compilations as well as her songs for The Lord of the Rings soundtrack. But we need to give her more credit than that, as she is the best selling solo artist in Ireland and has even given U2 a run for their money. All this despite the fact that she rarely gives interviews and doesn\'t tour, Enya just lets the music speak for itself. This episode we go through the events of her life that lead her to the level of fame she\'s reached today, and even manage to get some Irish history in the mix. We tried our best to keep it mature and classy for this episode, how do you think we faired? Well, the Euphoric Trip Sour NEIPA from Beer Tree Brew Co certainly wasn\'t helping, but the can matched the mood, so pick some up when you give it a listen!Listen to all the great podcasts over on Pantheon | This week we\'re taking some time to spotlight the member of the band that is frequently mocked and believed to be totally replaceable. That\'s right, we\'re talking about our friend, the bassist! We\'re covering just a few who we truly admire, talk about what sets them apart and how they\'ve honed their craft to make their music legendary. You may think they just play a couple notes to backup the lead guitarist, or maybe you understand the skills they need to become truly great. But if you\'re the former, after listening to this, you should never scoff at a bassist again! And if you go get yourself a 6 pack of Funkengruven from Destihl Brewing to wash it down with, you may just never scoff again.Proudly a part of the Pantheon Podcast Network! | You loved it last time, so we\'re bringin\' it back! This time we discuss the 20 year old pop compilation monstrosity, Now That\'s What I Call Music! Vol. 3. From boy bands, to nu metal, to 90\'s smooth jams, we are covering it all. And also taking some liberties for the sake of our own sanity. The perfect way to close up the summer is with total self indulgence. For this episode we have indulged in our beverage choices a well, so feel free to partake in any of the following: Decadent Delight from Evil Twin and Decadent, Maple Stout from 14th Star Brewing Co, and Mexican Cake from Westbrook Brewing Co. Rock Candy is part of Pantheon Podcasts. | This week we cover the story of the hypnotizing and talented Queen of all trades- Grace Jones. Her androgeny helped her modeling career, her voice and writing skills helped her music career, and her charisma helped her film career. She can and has done it all! Learn how her tough love childhood helped to shape her into the formidable woman that she is today. Through ups and downs, this woman has always managed to keep herself at the top of her game! And while you\'re listening, help yourself to a cool bottle of Keegan Ales Hurricane Kitty. | Today we are talking about an icon and a legend, Robyn. She came onto the scene in the 90\'s with a smooth pop hit song and when she was just about to reach the height of her fame, she walked away so she could pursue music the way she wanted. Little did she know when she first came out how much she would shape and mold the world of pop music as we know it. Always a trend setter, many have attempted to copy her musical stylings, only to come up a little short. But she has already given us so much in her discography in such a short amount of time, it makes sense that her story is an impressive one. So grab yourself a BaklaBot from Pipeworks Brewing company and you won\'t be dancing on your own through this episode! | This week we shake things up like the two main artists we talk about. Country music has always had some strict rules, especially when it came to the behavior of women. But we\'ve had the pleasure of seeing some ladies not taking it and defying the standard set out for them. Like Loretta Lynn before them, both Dixie Chicks and Kacey Musgraves sing their truths no matter how many try to muffle their voices. And none of them are strangers to controversy, either, always taking the high road in their opinions on political and social matters. So why not grab a traveling companion in Connecticut Valley Brewing\'s Cross Country for a journey with these bad babes of country music! | One hit wonders are the backbone of the world of music. They are random moments of good fortune for an artist who has been trying to make it into the music biz for what seems like forever. Some are content with their 15 minutes of fame while others bemoan the song that made them famous. This week we give you our top 10 one hit wonders and manage to mention at least double that in what we call "wonderception". Some you may love yourself and others you may have forgotten. So sit tight with a can of Falco from Evil Twin Brewing to bask in these songs that helped shape music as we know it!', 'chan_desc': 'Join Ashleigh and Maggie every week for sweet treats of stories from the world of music.

The Motown family of labels has been celebrated in television specials, stage musicals, and Hollywood movies.\xa0  You may recall that “Rare & Scratchy Rock ‘N Roll” episodes #4 and #5 presented a two-part alternative history of Motown Records – with little known stories about one of the biggest hit-making studios in popular music history. Now, we’ll revisit the five-year period that encompassed its founding in 1959 through 1963 – just before its explosive growth and domination of the rock charts for more than a decade.\xa0  Some early Motown releases featured emerging superstars. Others were performed by acts that subsequently faded into obscurity. The Beatles named one of these budding performers as their favorite female singer.\xa0  Motown charted 64 rock and rhythm & blues singles from 1959 to 1963, and you’ll hear them all right here. | RARE & SCRATCHY ROCK \'N ROLL_094\xa0– "THE LOST TOP 40 HITS OF 1972" –\xa0  This episode spotlights 40 lost hits from the year 1972.

In it she discusses both her career and her personal relationships including her unique 52 year long relationship to fellow French Icon Jacques Dutronc.

She is a beautiful person. His son, Dhani, is a beautiful kid, man. I’ve seen him recently. He is doing very well — very strong and inspired. Olivia had the hardest job in the world, because she loved George more than all of us, and she really took care of him and cleared the path in front of him, behind him, and inherited that crazy life, you know.“ - Tom PettyToday’s episode is all about Olivia Harrison. Olivia Trinidad Arias met George Harrison after beginning a flirtation over the phone while she was working at his company A&M records. For George, the connection was immediate and would go on to last until the end of his life, and beyond. Olivia never meant to marry someone famous, let alone a Beatle, but her grounded nature and shared passion for meditation as well as a similar sense of humour to George made her a perfect match.Tune in to hear all about this inspiring love story born out of a chaotic period in George’s personal life; a romance that turned into a divine union lasting far beyond the confines of this astral plane. Learn about the woman who inspired so many of George’s songs such as, Dark Sweet Lady and This is Love, and who was by his side while he tended to his many gardens and as he left this world.

He has been a pop star with his bands Brinsley Schwarz and Rockpile, a stepson-in-law to Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and is the writer behind hits including "Cruel to Be Kind" and "(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding." In the past decades, however, he has distinguished himself as an artist who is equally acclaimed for the second act of his career as a tender yet sharp-tongued acoustic balladeer.Biographer Will Birch, who in addition to being a music writer was a drummer and songwriter with The Records, has known Lowe for over forty years and melds Lowe\'s gift as a witty raconteur with his own authoritative analysis of Lowe\'s background and the cultural scenes he exemplifies. Lowe\'s parallel fame as one of the best interviews in the business will contribute to this first look into his life and work--and likely the closest thing fans will get to an autobiography by this notoriously charming cult figure.This is not an authorized biography, but Lowe has given it his spiritual blessing and his management and label are fully on board. Cruel to Be Kind will be the colorful yet serious account of one of the world\'s most talented and admired musicians.http://nicklowebiography.com | Shelley and Christian have a great time getting into the memoir from Bruce Dickinson, the larger-than-life, multifaceted lead vocalist of Iron Maiden, one of the most successful, influential and enduring rock bands ever.Pioneers of Britain’s nascent Rock & Metal scene back in the late 1970s, Iron Maiden smashed its way to the top, thanks in no small part to the high-octane performances, operatic singing style, and stage presence of its second, but twice-longest-serving, lead singer, Bruce Dickinson. As Iron Maiden’s front man—first from 1981 to 1993, and then from 1999 to the present—Dickinson has been, and remains, a man of legend.But OTT front man is just one of the many hats Bruce wears. In addition to being one of the world’s most storied and well-respected singers and songwriters, he is an airline captain, aviation entrepreneur, motivational speaker, beer brewer, novelist, radio presenter, and film scriptwriter. He has also competed as a world-class level fencer. Often credited as a genuine polymath Bruce, in his own words (and handwritten script in the first instance!), sets forth many personal observations guaranteed to inspire curious souls and hard-core fans alike.Dickinson turns his unbridled creativity, passion, and anarchic humour to reveal some fascinating stories from his life, including his thirty years with Maiden, his solo career, his childhood within the eccentric British school system, his early bands, fatherhood and family, and his recent battle with cancer.Bold, honest, intelligent and very funny, his memoir is an up-close look inside the life, heart, and mind of one of the most unique and interesting men in the world; a true icon of rock.What Does This Button Do?: An Autobiography by Bruce Dickinson is published by Dey Street Books October 31, 2017) Find it here on Amazon Diggers, you can support the show by wearing cool rock n roll gear from TeePublic: https://www.teepublic.com/stores/rocknrollDisclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco.Call us at 650-822-ROCK or email at: info@rocknrollarchaeology.com | Shelley and Christian dig deep into friend of the show Meredith Ochs\' latest book, Aretha: The Queen of Soul - A Life in Photographs.\xa0 Since the book is filled with photos, along with three essays by Ms. Ochs, we decide to play as many disparate songs by the Diva of divas to showcase just how amazing Aretha really was during her lifetime.Aretha Franklin’s voice was legendary, unforgettable: deeply rooted in gospel, yet versatile enough to brilliantly interpret R&B, rock, soul, pop, and jazz standards, it fueled a six-decade career. Her vocal wallop was a mix of preaching, rebuke, and elation. From the languorous “I Never Loved a Man (the Way That I Love You),” to the funky “Chain of Fools,” to the fiercely feminist “Think,” to the definitive, demanding version of Otis Redding’s “Respect,” Franklin’s songs played out against the tumultuous sociopolitical backdrop of the late ’60s like a soundtrack meant to set things right. Her accolades were many: she received the Kennedy Center honor in 1994, won 18 Grammys, was the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and performed for presidents and the Pope. Illustrated with 85 photos, and with insightful text from noted radio personality and author Meredith Ochs, Aretha explores the diva’s life, from her formative years growing up in Detroit, to her singing and recording career from the 1950s until her untimely death in 2018, to her numerous honors, awards, and causes, including her advocacy for civil rights and the arts.Get the book hereDiggers, you can support the show by wearing cool rock n roll gear from TeePublic: https://www.teepublic.com/stores/rocknrollDisclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco.Call us at 650-822-ROCK or email at: info@rocknrollarchaeology.com | Shelley and Christian dive into Bruce\'s autobiography, \'Born to Run\'.In 2009, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That’s how this extraordinary autobiography began.Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs.He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as “The Big Bang”: seeing Elvis Presley’s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song “Born to Run” reveals more than we previously realized.Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star’s memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll.Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of his songs (“Thunder Road,” “Badlands,” “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “The River,” “Born in the U.S.A,” “The Rising,” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” to name just a few), Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences.\xa0 | On October 7th, 2017 Tom Petty joined the rock n roll orchestra on the other side. He was 67 years young. For rockers around the world, like Prince a few months earlier, it was a shock coupled with immense sadness. Forever on we will not have Tom around with his Heartbreakers disposing easy wisdom in song or slyly telling off adversaries with Southern charm or that kick ass band that hummed like a stock car racer. It was a hard one to take.Join the Rock N Roll Librarian Shelley Sorenson and the Rock N Roll Archaeologist Christian Swain as they discuss Warren Zanes’ 2015 biography of the Gainesville born singer songwriter born in 1950 who found rock n roll as the only answer to his passions.No one other than Warren Zanes, rocker and writer and friend, could author a book about Tom Petty that is as honest and evocative of Petty\'s music and the remarkable rock and roll history he and his band helped to write.Born in Gainesville, Florida, with more than a little hillbilly in his blood, Tom Petty was a Southern shit kicker, a kid without a whole lot of promise. Rock and roll made it otherwise. From meeting Elvis, to seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, to producing Del Shannon, backing Bob Dylan, putting together a band with George Harrison, Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne, making records with Johnny Cash, and sending well more than a dozen of his own celebrated recordings high onto the charts, Tom Petty\'s story has all the drama of a rock and roll epic. Petty, known for his reclusive style, has shared with Warren Zanes his insights and arguments, his regrets and lasting ambitions, and the details of his life on and off the stage.This is a book for those who know and love the songs, from "American Girl" and "Refugee" to "Free Fallin\'" and "Mary Jane\'s Last Dance," and for those who want to see the classic rock and roll era embodied in one man\'s remarkable story. Dark and mysterious, Petty manages to come back, again and again, showing us what the music can do and where it can take us.Petty: The BiographyDisclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco. | For more than fifty years, Paul Simon has spoken to us in songs about alienation, doubt, resilience, and empathy in ways that have established him as one of the most beloved artists in American pop music history. Songs like “The Sound of Silence,” “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” “Still Crazy After All These Years,” and “Graceland” have moved beyond the sales charts and into our cultural consciousness. But Simon is a deeply private person who has resisted speaking to us outside of his music. He has said he will not write an autobiography or memoir, and he has refused to talk to previous biographers.Finally, Simon has opened up—for more than one hundred hours of interviews—to Robert Hilburn, whose biography of Johnny Cash was named by Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times as one of her ten favorite books of 2013. The result is a landmark book that will take its place as the defining biography of one of America’s greatest artistsJoin Shelley and Christian as they dive into this amazing book and make sure you listen to our companion show, \'Deeper Digs in Rock: Robert Hilburn on Paul Simon\' where the former LA Times music critic shares some incredible tales.\'Paul Simon: The Life\' was published by Simon & Schuster on May 8, 2018Disclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco. | This episode the Rock N Roll Librarian Shelley Sorensen and C Swain review ‘Hit So Hard’ by original drummer for the 90’s grunge band, Hole.Patty Schemel\'s story begins with a childhood surrounded by the AA meetings her parents hosted in the family living room. Their divorce triggered her first forays into drinking at age twelve and dovetailed with her passion for punk rock and playing the drums. Patty\'s struggles with her sexuality further drove her notoriously hard playing, and by the late \'80s she had focused that anger, confusion, and drive into regular gigs with well-regarded bands in Tacoma, Seattle, and Olympia, Washington. She met a pre-Nirvana Kurt Cobain at a Melvins show, and less than five years later, was living with him and his wife, Hole front-woman Courtney Love, at the height of his fame and on the cusp of hers. As the platinum-selling band\'s new drummer, Schemel contributed memorable, driving beats to hits like "Beautiful Son," "Violet," "Doll Parts," and "Miss World." But the band was plagued by tragedy and heroin addiction, and by the time Hole went on tour in support of their ironically titled and critically-acclaimed album ‘Live Through This’ in 1994, both Cobain and Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff had died at the age of 27With surprising candor and wit, Schemel intimately documents the events surrounding her dramatic exit from the band in 1998 that led to a dark descent into a life of homelessness and crime on the streets of Los Angeles, and the difficult but rewarding path to lasting sobriety after more than twenty serious attempts to get clean. ‘Hit So Hard’ is a testament not only to the enduring power of the music Schemel helped create but an important document of the drug culture that threatened to destroy it.Our hosts also discuss the companion documentary film of the same name with previously unseen footage of Cobain and Love.

Consider this a companion to our interview with Professor Yaffe on Deeper Digs in Rock.Joni Mitchell may be the most influential female recording artist and composer of the late twentieth century. In Reckless Daughter, the music critic David Yaffe tells the remarkable, heart-wrenching story of how the blond girl with the guitar became a superstar of folk music in the 1960s, a key figure in the Laurel Canyon music scene of the 1970s, and the songwriter who spoke resonantly to, and for, audiences across the country.In this intimate biography, drawing on dozens of unprecedented in-person interviews with Mitchell, her childhood friends, and a cast of famous characters, Yaffe reveals the backstory behind the famous songs—from Mitchell’s youth in Canada, her bout with polio at age nine, and her early marriage and the child she gave up for adoption, through the love affairs that inspired masterpieces, and up to the present—and shows us why Mitchell has so enthralled her listeners, her lovers, and her friends. Reckless Daughter is the story of an artist and an era that have left an indelible mark on American music.Published in 2017 by SaraCrichton Books.Diggers, you can support the show by wearing cool rock n roll gear from TeePublic: https://www.teepublic.com/stores/rocknrollPlease subscribe, rate and review and head over to Patreon to help support our network of rock based podcasts including Reel Rock, Vinyl Snob, Deeper Digs in Rock and The Rock N Roll Archaeology Project.Disclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco.Call us at 650-822-ROCK or email at: info@rocknrollarchaeology.com | This week Shelley and Christian review \'From Cradle to Stage: Stories from the Mothers Who Rocked and Raised Rock Stars\' by Virginia Hanlon Grohl with forward by Dave Grohl. Published by Seal Press, April 2017.Written by Dave Grohl’s mom (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) to answer her own questions about the experiences of other mothers who had raised rock stars, and based on interviews with women who had done just that. She was curious about whether they were as surprised as she was about their children\'s fame; whether they worried about their children\'s well-being in an industry fraught with drugs and other dangers; whether or not they had actively encouraged their children\'s passions despite the odds against success; and whether they were raised in musical households. During her two year journey she interviewed a several moms of musicians covering a range of genres and generations, such as the moms of Dr. Dre; Amy Winehouse and Geddy Lee.With exclusive family photographs and a foreword by Dave Grohl, From Cradle to Stage will appeal to mothers and rock fans everywhere.Disclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco. | One of the four Monkees was actually a futurist.Did you know that he helped birth MTV?Did you know he put together one of the first country rock outfits of the late 1960\'s early \'70\'s?How about the fact he wrote \'Different Drum\' famously covered by Linda Ronstadt.Did you know that Mike Nesmith\'s mother invented Liquid Paper? \xa0Shelly and Christian discuss this extremely interesting autobiography, \'Infinite Tuesdays: An Autobiographical Riff by Mike Nesmith.\'Michael Nesmith’s eclectic, electric life spans his star-making role on The Monkees, his invention of the music video, and his critical contributions to movies, comedy, and the world of virtual reality.\xa0Above all, his is a seeker’s story, a pilgrimage in search of a set of principles to live by. That search took Nesmith from a childhood in Dallas, where his single mother Bette invented Liquid Paper, to the set of The Monkees in Los Angeles; to the heart of swinging London with John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix; and to an unexpected oasis of brilliance in the Santa Fe desert, where his friendships with Douglas Adams and Los Alamos scientists would point him toward the power of the infinite and the endless possibilities of human connection. This funny, thoughtful, self-aware book is a window onto an unexpected life, inflected at every turn by the surprising candor and absurdist humor of an American original.Opening Infinite Tuesday is like stepping into the world of Michael Nesmith, where something curious is always unfolding, and where riffs on everything from bands to dogs to the nature of reality make for an endlessly engaging journey."Beautifully written." —New York Times“Nesmith is an artist, adventurer and thinker whose nimble creativity soared far above the appellation he was given: “The smart Monkee.” In Infinite Tuesday, he details the inner forces, from personal to spiritual, that kept him forging ahead –and that created stumbling blocks as well. Unsparing and revealing, this book is an unusual, unforgettable read.” —Ben Fong-TorresDisclaimer: The views expressed here by Shelley Sorenson are made in her capacity as a private citizen, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Public Library or the City of San Francisco.', 'chan_desc': 'The Rock N Roll Librarian: Our Monthly Rock N Roll Book Club, co-hosted by Shelley Sorenson and Christian Swain.
