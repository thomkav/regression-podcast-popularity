After being diagnosed with a very rare illness, he came close to death on multiple occasions. In the throes of one encounter, he promised himself that if he survived, he would make a difference in the fight against this disease. Through his research, he found a drug that he believes has helped him into remission. In the wake of his bouts, he has chosen to live his life "on overtime," time that he is extremely lucky to have, gifting him a unique perspective on living we can all learn from. Fajgenbaum is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network and leads the Castleman Research Program at Penn Medicine.

And once you find your happiness, work hard to keep it. Keep moving forward, step by step. When you look back, you’ll be amazed at what you accomplished. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about finding yourself and living life to the fullest with Dennis Rodman.

We think that creative people were born with special abilities. And often, we doubt our creative talents. But, is that what we truly believe? If so, why are those creative ideas still in our heads? Ready to come out. Here’s the truth- they were given to you because you were born to create it. Creativity isn’t a birthright or destination, it’s a process. If you follow the I.D.E.A strategy and keep working, good things will happen. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about how everyone has a creative force inside of them and what it takes to develop that creativity with an author, entrepreneur and photographer: Chase Jarvis. Chase Jarvis is an American artist, director, entrepreneur and author who co-founded the on-line educational platform Creative Live. Chase consistently uses his voice to educate and inspire people to achieve their creative potential. As a child, Chase Jarvis loved being creative and started making his own films, but after overhearing his teacher tell his parents “Chase is so much better at sports than arts”, he lost his creative passion and replaced it with a need to achieve athletically. In the following years he became a standout athlete in multiple sports, but his grandfather’s death reignited his creative spirit and since that time he has lived a creative life putting his creative spirit into everything he does. Now, his mission is to help people tap into their creative potential. So, get ready to learn how to unleash your creativity on Episode 853.Some Questions I Ask:Why do we shut down creativity?

It’s not about having a stress-free life- it’s about learning how to deal with it gracefully. Think of the last stressful moment you had. How did you react? Did you get angry and tense up? Or were you able to breathe and move through it? The more we work on our reaction when things go differently than we’d hoped, the happier we will be. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Dan Millman where he shared his definition of stress and the practice that helps him with it. Dan Millman is a former world champion athlete, university coach, martial arts instructor, and college professor. After an intensive, twenty-year spiritual quest, Dan’s teaching found its form as the Peaceful Warrior’s Way. He has now written seventeen books.

Often, we don’t like how people talk to us. Whether it’s at home, at work, or with our friends, there are many times where we don’t get the respect we desire. It feels terrible. But how much ownership do we take of those situations? Here’s the truth- you get what you put up with. Unless you’re willing to set boundaries and tell people what’s not ok, you’ll end up being walked over. If you keep showing up, people will assume that it isn’t that bad. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about what it takes to stand up for the things you believe with an actor-turned-activist: Sophia Bush. Sophia Bush starred as Brooke Davis in The WB/CW drama series One Tree Hill and as Det. Erin Lindsay in the NBC police procedural drama series Chicago P.D. Sophia consistently uses her platform for activism and fundraising and has a new podcast called Work in Progress. Sophia stood up for herself before the Me Too Movement began by quitting a television show where she was being mistreated. She shares her struggle to admit that something was wrong and the tricks her mind played on her in the process.

People understand that there will be challenges and fear when they chase their dreams. But they’re not willing to be embarrassed. Are you willing to look like a fool? To go all-in and fail? It’s a guarantee when you go after the thing you want. You have to keep putting your head out there knowing that it could get chopped off. The more you face your fears, the more self-confidence you’ll have. You will fall. You need to have the grit to use it as fuel to get back up. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about relentlessly pursuing your passion with one of the most successful football players in history: Tony Gonzalez. Tony Gonzalez is a Pro Football Hall of Famer, retired All-Pro NFL Tight end, and father of four. He is currently an analyst on Fox NFL’s pregame show. During his career, he only missed two games and lost only two fumbles on 1,327 touches. Tony is open about his struggles with depression and self-doubt that he might not be good enough. But by working through these emotions, he has come out a more authentic and heart-centered person.

Katherine walks us through how this widespread corruption came to be, including the shocking story of one particularly egregious (and unfortunately not uncommon) example of an Indian drug company, Ranbaxy, whose business model was completely dependent on falsifying data in their drug applications to the FDA. We then discuss the subsequent investigation into Indian and Chinese drug manufacturing plants which revealed that nearly 80% of them are tainted with fraud. We conclude this discussion on a positive note with i) how individuals can investigate their own drugs to protect themselves ii) an innovative pharmacy attempting to disrupt the market and iii) some ideas on how to reform to the regulations around generic drugs, the FDA, and more. \xa0 We discuss:  How Peter found Katherine’s book, and what convinced her to investigate the generic drug industry [5:45]; Branded vs. generic drugs: Why they aren’t the same thing [11:15]; The Food and Drug Administration: Why it was originally created and what it does today [20:45]; How the generic drug industry really got its start in the U.S., and the flaw of the Hatch-Waxman Act [28:20]; PEPFAR: How a well-intentioned plan to help Africa with the AIDS epidemic laid the groundwork for corruption [36:30]; The story of Ranbaxy: An Indian drug company whose business model was fraud and deceit [40:45]; How the FDA approves drugs, the impact of “first to file”, and Peter’s tangent on moral corruption [47:30]; A booming generic drug market and the FDA struggling to keep up [57:15]; Dinesh’s internal investigation finds widespread fraud and falsified data inside Ranbaxy [1:00:15]; Presenting the famous SAR document to Ranbaxy’s board of directors which spells out the company-wide fraud [1:09:15]; Dinesh blows the whistle on Ranbaxy which leads to a raid on their US plant [1:19:45]; Formal investigation of Ranbaxy is launched, but the FDA keeps approving Ranbaxy drug applications [1:33:30]; What role does the culture in India play in the high prevalence of fraud in the drug industry? [1:41:00]; The extreme prevalence of data fraud/manipulation in foreign generic drug factories [1:52:30]; Concluding the Ranbaxy story [2:06:15]; How concerned should you be when buying a generic drug from your local pharmacy?

Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, returns to the podcast to discuss the content of his new book, Lifespan: Why We Age - and Why We Don’t Have To. This conversation focuses on the biological mechanisms involved in what David terms the Information Theory of Aging which provides insights into the “clock” that determines our aging and to what degree it can be manipulated. Our discussion on aging of course leads us into interconnected topics of epigenetics, sirtuins, cellular senescence, as well as what compounds David is personally taking for his own longevity. Additionally, we discuss the most up to date information related to NAD and longevity by looking at the potential benefits (if any) of supplemental agents (NAD precursors, NR, NMR, etc.) that pose a promise of increasing NAD. We discuss:  SIR genes and cellular identity [8:45]; Sirtuins regulate gene expression [14:30]; DNA is methylated at the deepest layer of the epigenome [17:45]; Methylation pattern and determining cellular age [20:15]; Cellular reprogramming [33:45]; Yamanaka factors to push cells "back in time” \xa0[41:00]; Human cellular reprogramming viability [57:00]; Measuring the rate of aging [1:02:45]; Cellular reprogramming for longevity [1:14:45]; Compounds David takes for his own longevity [1:29:15] NAD precursors (NR, NMN) and pterostilbene [1:40:00]; The current field of sirtuin activators [2:03:15]; David’s artistic work [2:05:15] and; More.

In this conversation we focus on hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, blood pressure, obesity, etc. and ways to address them with nutrition, sleep, exercise, stress management, and more. We also take a deep dive into insulin resistant phenotypes, evolutionary theory and geographic determinants of insulin resistance which provides insight into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we discuss the surprisingly interrelated topic of stress, and how we might be inadvertently passing this on to our children, leading to mental and physical sickness down the road.

In this mini-episode of the podcast, Dr. Hyman speaks with longevity expert and bestselling author of, “Blue Zones,” Dan Buettner, about the commonalities amongst several geographic regions around the world where high percentages of centenarians are enjoying remarkably long, full lives. Specifically, Dan shares the pillars of all longevity diets in the world and how Americans can apply this information to their own diets..Dan Buettner is an explorer, National Geographic Fellow, award-winning journalist andproducer, and New York Times bestselling author. He discovered the five places in the world –dubbed Blue Zones – where people live the longest, healthiest lives. Buettner now works in partnership with municipal governments, large employers, and health insurance companies to implement Blue Zones Projects in communities, workplaces, and universities. Blue Zones Projects are well-being initiatives that apply lessons from the BlueZones to entire communities by focusing on changes to the local environment, public policy, and social networks. The program has dramatically improved the health of more than 5 million Americans to date. Buettner also holds three Guinness World Records in distance cycling.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Dan Buettner https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/DanBuettner | Think about how different our medical system would be if all doctors were required to have an extreme health crisis before practicing medicine. It’s through those toughest times with our own health that many of us turn to Functional Medicine, as we realize conventional care isn’t getting us what we need. But sometimes, being so involved in treating others’ diseases makes it difficult for doctors to even see our own symptoms for what they really are. This week’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy, Dr. Cynthia Li, is here to share her personal journey through autoimmunity and realizing her symptoms had deeper meaning.Dr. Li received her medical degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She’s practiced as an internist in many settings, including Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, San Francisco General Hospital, and St. Anthony Medical Clinic serving the homeless. She currently has a private practice in Berkeley, CA and recently published her first book which I highly recommend, Brave New Medicine: A Doctor\'s Unconventional Path to Healing Her Autoimmune Illness.This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by Thrive Market and by SomniFix.\xa0Thrive Market has made it so easy for me to stay healthy, even with my intense travel schedule.

This is because our gut is designed to help us digest food, absorb nutrients, keep invaders out, and even produce helpful compounds like the neurotransmitter serotonin, among so many other powerful functions. This is why the whole body will suffer when the gut is out of balance.In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Stanley Hazen about how the microbiome can influence disease risk and why this is an essential piece to the future of medicine. He also talks to Dr. David Perlmutter about how what we eat influences everything from our mood to our tiniest gut friends—microbes—and how well they function and fight off invaders.\xa0Dr. Stanley Hazen is both the chair of the Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine at the Lerner Research Institute and section head of Preventive Cardiology & Rehabilitation at the Heart and Vascular Institute of the Cleveland Clinic. He’s published more than 400 peer-reviewed articles and has over 50 patents from his pioneering discoveries in atherosclerosis and inflammatory disease. Dr. Hazen made the seminal discovery linking microbial pathways to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.Dr. David Perlmutter is a board-certified neurologist and four-time New York Times best selling author. He serves on the Board of Directors and is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition and as a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. His books include the #1 New York Times bestseller, “Grain Brain,” “The Surprising Truth About Wheat,” “Carbs and Sugar,” with over 1 million copies in print. He is the editor of the upcoming collection, “The Microbiome and the Brain,” that will be authored by top experts in the field and will be published in 2019 by CRC Press. Dr. Perlmutter’s new book, “Brain Wash,” co-written with Austin Perlmutter, MD, will be published in January 2020.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full length conversation with Dr. Hazenhttps://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrStanleyHazenListen to Dr. Hyman’s full length conversation with Dr. Perlmutter:https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrDavidPerlmutter | Soil is the most important answer to climate change, and also one of the most underappreciated. Without soil, we have no food, and I don’t think I need to elaborate on how catastrophic that would be. The positive news is that we can work on our soil integrity right now to preserve it for many future generations to come—you might be surprised that using regeneratively raised cattle is part of that solution. There is still hope for our children and grandchildren to inherit a balanced and beautiful planet with abundant food production.\xa0Because we rely on soil for food production, big companies are starting to pay attention to the work that needs to be done to preserve it. My guest on this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy, Tom Newmark, is helping them understand what they can do and how to get involved in saving our soils. Tom was CEO of the dietary supplement brand New Chapter, which was acquired by Proctor & Gamble about seven years ago. Since that time Tom has focused on environmental activism with specific attention on regenerative agriculture. He is the co-owner of Finca Luna Nueva Lodge, an organic and biodynamic farm and ecolodge in the mountainous rainforest of Costa Rica that teaches regenerative agriculture. Tom is the co-founder and board chair of The Carbon Underground, co-founder of the Soil Carbon Initiative, and a founding member of the Regenerative Agriculture Initiative of California State University – Chico.This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by ButcherBox.

Fast food manufacturers and grocers lure us into convenient, heavily processed meals that take a toll on our health and our wallet. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Marco Canora and Ocean Robbins about reframing our relationship to cooking and how it can save us time and money, improve our health, and even combat food waste.As a chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author, Marco Canora promotes delicious, simple, and healthful food. In 2003, he opened Hearth in Manhattan, which has a positive two-star review from The New York Times and a prestigious “Outstanding Restaurant" nomination from the James Beard Foundation. In 2017 Marco won the James Beard Foundation award for Best Chef NYC. Marco is also the founder of Brodo, a popular to-go window serving coffee cups of hot, nourishing bone broths.\xa0Ocean Robbins is the author of 31-Day Food Revolution: Heal Your Body, Feel Great, & Transform Your World. He serves as CEO and co-founder of the Food Revolution Network—one of the largest communities of healthy eating advocates on the planet, with more than 500,000 members.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Marco Canora: https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/MarcoCanoraListen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Ocean Robbins: https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/OceanRobbins | Trauma comes in many forms, and it’s something we’re all going to face at one point or another. Though it might seem in the moment that we should push away negative feelings and pretend everything is fine, true healing can’t happen unless we open ourselves to our traumatic experiences and work through them. Despite what many of us in search of help have been told, this doesn’t necessarily need to involve years of therapy or countless medications—we already have tools existing within each of us to work through the emotional, mental, and physical effects of trauma and feel happier and healthier. I think you’ll be surprised just how accessible some of these solutions are.\xa0This week on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m joined by Dr. Jim Gordon to take a further look into healing trauma. He is one of the most extraordinary men I\'ve ever met and I’ve been lucky to call him a friend for 20 years. Dr. Gordon is the author of The Transformation: Discovering Wholeness and Healing After Trauma and is a Harvard educated psychiatrist and a world-renowned expert in using mind-body medicine to heal depression, anxiety, and psychological trauma. He has worked with traumatized children and families in Bosnia, Gaza, Haiti, post-9/11 New York, and Parkland, among many other areas across the world facing tragedy and trauma. Dr. Gordon also works with veterans and active-duty military to address PTSD.This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by Thrive Market.

Stem cells can also sense damaged cells and tissues and send signals that promote self-healing. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. William Li about the things that both enhance, and impair, our body’s regenerative abilities, including our diet. Dr. Li shares information on which foods have been scientifically proven to activate our body’s stem cells.William Li, MD, is a world-renowned physician, scientist, speaker, and author of Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself. He is best known for leading the Angiogenesis Foundation. His groundbreaking work has impacted more than 70 diseases including cancer, diabetes, blindness, heart disease, and obesity. His TED Talk, “Can We Eat to Starve Cancer?” has garnered more than 11 million views. An author of over 100 scientific publications in leading journals such as Science, the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, and more, Dr. Li has served on the faculties of Harvard, Tufts, and Dartmouth Medical School.Listen to Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Dr. Li: https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrLi | Age is not the definitive factor it’s made out to be when it comes to our health. We can use our age as a baseline for tracking our health and longevity, but it isn’t stagnant. For example, certain types of testing can help us compare our biological age to our calendar age in order to tinker with our wellness routine and achieve the milestones we’re after. With the right steps, we can slow down and even sometimes reverse the aging process.When it comes to our biological age, or the measure of how well our body is actually functioning for whatever life stage we are in, there are many things that impact it. Diet, lifestyle patterns like exercise and sleep, and stress are all involved in forming our biological age, along with many other factors like blood sugar, inflammation, and genetics. This week on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m joined by Dr. David Sinclair to explore the topic of longevity and anti-aging and how he reduced his own internal age by more than 20 years. Dr. Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School, where he and his colleagues study longevity, aging, and how to slow its effects.\xa0This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by ButcherBox.

Yet, when we recently reflected on a number of conversations from The Doctor’s Farmacy, we couldn’t help but hear a common and hopeful message. In this mini-episode, we revisit four conversations Dr. Hyman has had with guests on this podcast, each with a common refrain: Progress is being made and it’s happening fast!\xa0Michael Pollan is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Cooked, Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, The Botany of Desire, and his latest book How to Change Your Mind, which is all about the new science of psychedelics. A longtime contributor to the New York Times Magazine, he also teaches writing at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley where he is the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism. In 2010, Time magazine named him one of the one hundred most influential people in the world.Dr. Hallberg is a Medical Director at Virta Health and a Fellow of the Aspen Institute’s Health Innovator Fellowship and a member of the Aspen Global Leadership Network. She is also the Medical Director and founder of the Medically Supervised Weight Loss Program at Indiana University Health Arnett and an adjunct Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Dr. Hallberg is serving as Chair of the Board of Directors and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Council for The Nutrition Coalition. Dr. Hallberg is a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine, American Board of Obesity Medicine, and The American Board of Clinical Lipidology and is a Registered Exercise Physiologist by the ACSM. She is also a Fellow of the Obesity Medicine Association and The National Lipid Association.David Wallace-Wells is the deputy editor of New York magazine and the author of the international bestseller The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming, published in February 2019, which the New York Times called both “brilliant” and “the most terrifying book I have ever read.”Dr. Sonia Angell is a former Deputy Commissioner at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), where she oversaw the Division of Prevention and Primary Care.

That’s why in Functional Medicine we always take the gut into account, along with the rest of the body, when trying to understand a brain disease. Unfortunately, conventional medicine likes to look at each part of the body separately, which may be why doctors have a hard time effectively treating neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS. Knowing that the gut affects the brain and understanding the far-reaching role of the microbiome has led this week’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy to approach neurodegenerative conditions with a whole new perspective.\xa0Dr. Jay Lombard is an internationally acclaimed neurologist, author, and keynote speaker specializing in neuroimmunological conditions and medical mysteries. Dr. Lombard integrates biological, psychological, and existential components in his holistic treatment approach. Dr. Lombard’s clinical experience revealed an interesting pattern: one patient with ALS also had small intestine bacterial overgrowth, then another who had ulcerative colitis, another had Crohn’s, and so on. He started seeing the connection between these bacterial imbalances and Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, and the link to neurological symptoms.\xa0This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy\xa0is brought to you by Thrive Market.

SET A BEDTIME ALARM AND STICK TO A CONSISTENT SLEEP ROUTINE. Your body’s internal clock, a.k.a. your circadian rhythm plays a key role in regulating your sleep-wake cycle. This clock tells your body when it’s time to wake up in the morning and when to start unwinding at the end of the day.TIP 2. KEEP YOUR BEDROOM COOL. Lowering your body temperature will help you sleep faster. That's why a bedroom with a temperature of 18°C or \xa064.4°F is ideal.TIP 3. GO OUTSIDE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. Get at least 60 minutes of natural daylight exposure first thing in the morning. Light is the strongest stimulus for regulating a person’s sleep-wake schedule. It doesn’t matter if it’s cloudy or sunshine, the key is to trick the brain into a new morning routine. Don’t put shades on because it will diminish the light reset function in your body clock.TIP 4. DON'T DRINK COFFEE OR CAFFEINE AFTER NOON. Caffeine has a half-life of six hours. Caffeine is also what we call a psychoactive stimulant. For some people, a single cup of coffee in the morning means a sleepless night.TIP 5. BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE. Regular aerobic exercise like walking, running, or swimming provides three important sleep benefits: you'll fall asleep faster, attain a higher percentage of restorative deep sleep, and awaken less often during the night.TIP 6. LIMIT DAYTIME NAPS AFTER 3 PM. Prolonged napping can disrupt your natural sleep cycle and prevent you from feeling tired enough to fall asleep.TIP 7. EAT HEALTHY AND AT REGULAR TIMES. Food is just as powerful a trigger as light is. Avoid large meals and beverages at late night hours. Recent studies have shown that your eating schedule is correlated with how your body clock works.TIP 8. CLEAN YOUR BEDROOM AND TURN OF THE BLUE LIGHT DEVICES. Remove the television, telephone, and any other devices that radiate blue light from the bedroom. Blue light can affect your sleep and potentially cause sleep diseases.As always, sleep well 😴Thank you for listening!💕LOVE LOVE 💕 | LIKE TONIGHT'S SLEEP SOUND?Open our longer «Sleep Playlist» on Spotify.https://www.asmrsleeptriggers.comOnce upon a time, there was a Queen who had a beautiful baby daughter. She asked all the fairies in the kingdom to the christening, but unfortunately forgot to invite one of them, who was a bit of a witch as well. She came anyway, but as she passed the baby’s cradle, she said, “When you are sixteen, you will injure yourself with a spindle and die!”“Oh, no!” screamed the Queen in horror. A good fairy quickly chanted a magic spell to change the curse. When she hurt herself, the girl would fall into a very deep sleep instead of dying.The years went by, the little Princess grew and became the most beautiful girl in the whole kingdom. Her mother was always very careful to keep her away from spindles, but the Princess, on her sixteenth birthday, as she wandered through the castle, came into a room where an old servant was spinning.“What are you doing?” she asked the servant.“I’m spinning. Haven’t you seen a spindle before?”“No. Let me see it!” The servant handed the girl the spindle … and she pricked herself with it and with a sigh, dropped to the floor.The terrified old woman hurried to tell the Queen. Beside herself with anguish, the Queen did her best to awaken her daughter but in vain. The court doctors and wizards were called, but there was nothing they could do. The girl could not be wakened from her deep sleep.----WHAT TYPE OF SOUND MAKE YOU SLEEPY?To get your own sleep sound featured on our podcast - Please describe a sleep sound you love to have featured in our upcoming episodes.

We are back with new sleep recordings to help you fall asleep. Sorry for the delay.Tonight's question - Please describe a sleep sound you would love to have featured in the upcoming episodes. Leave a comment in the review👇Open our long Ocean Sounds Sleep playlist on Spotify.https://www.asmrsleeptriggers.com/ocean-soundsHERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR BETTER SLEEP 😴TIP 1. SET A BEDTIME ALARM AND STICK TO A CONSISTENT SLEEP ROUTINE. Your body’s internal clock, a.k.a. your circadian rhythm plays a key role in regulating your sleep-wake cycle. This clock tells your body when it’s time to wake up in the morning and when to start unwinding at the end of the day.TIP 2. KEEP YOUR BEDROOM COOL. Lowering your body temperature will help you sleep faster. That's why a bedroom with a temperature of 18°C or \xa064.4°F is ideal.TIP 3. GO OUTSIDE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. Get at least 60 minutes of natural daylight exposure first thing in the morning. Light is the strongest stimulus for regulating a person’s sleep-wake schedule. It doesn’t matter if it’s cloudy or sunshine, the key is to trick the brain into a new morning routine. Don’t put shades on because it will diminish the light reset function in your body clock.TIP 4. DON'T DRINK COFFEE OR CAFFEINE AFTER NOON. Caffeine has a half-life of six hours. Caffeine is also what we call a psychoactive stimulant. For some people, a single cup of coffee in the morning means a sleepless night.TIP 5. BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE. Regular aerobic exercise like walking, running, or swimming provides three important sleep benefits: you'll fall asleep faster, attain a higher percentage of restorative deep sleep, and awaken less often during the night.TIP 6. LIMIT DAYTIME NAPS AFTER 3 PM. Prolonged napping can disrupt your natural sleep cycle and prevent you from feeling tired enough to fall asleep.TIP 7.

Books on how people succeed at different levels, and what the definition of success is. He just came out with a new book that I thought was really worth talking about: “Game-Time Decision Making: High-Scoring Business Strategies from the Biggest Names in Sports.”\xa0While we did cover David’s ideas about how to work hard, smart and long (as in a consider-your-future-goals long game), we turned the corner into four of his life priorities: gratitude, forgiveness, accountability, and inspiration.“I am worthy of everything I have,” David says, “and I can manifest anything I want.” He believes that you can think and do the same.David is the CEO of Sports 1 Marketing, considered to be the world’s premier global sports and entertainment marketing firm. He’s a two-time international best-selling author and has been named by\xa0Forbes\xa0and\xa0Entrepreneur\xa0magazines as a Top Keynote Speaker.

You got to know what your values are.”\xa0Listen on to learn how to forgive yourself for your mistakes, let go of guilt that may be attracting shortages, voids, and obstacles in your life, and confront the ego that actually may be holding you back“We can change the world if we figure out—systematically, mathematically, scientifically—happiness,” David says. “Get better, work those muscles to stay at peace, and not live in ego-based consciousness or fear.”\xa0Enjoy the show! | In this episode of Bulletproof Radio,\xa0I interviewed Jeremy Jauncey at The Surf Lodge in\xa0Montauk, New York, where we talked about finding new adventures and staying healthy along the way.Jeremy’s a\xa0serial entrepreneur, investor and advisor with a passion for travel, health and sustainability.

Her journey into the world of health had a unique start and some unusual turns. She began her career as a trial lawyer and then became in-house counsel for a family pharmaceutical company. But what Tina saw there made her change career direction. She turned toward the field of natural health and found her life’s work in creating a unique probiotic supplement.Kiran\xa0Krishnan\xa0is a research microbiologist with particular expertise in the newest frontier in microbiology—gut commensal spore bacteria. He brings his extensive knowledge and practical application of the latest science on the human microbiome. “We know diversity within the microbiome is paramount to health and wellness, and even longevity,” he says.At Just Thrive Health, the focus is on probiotics that can actually survive the Wild West that is your microbiome. “We\'re putting a lot of effort into the science to understand microbial communities, microbial community structures and how they work together,” Kiran says.\xa0“In order to be a probiotic, it needs to arrive alive in the intestines,” Tina says. “It needs to actually confer a benefit onto the host, onto the body. Most of these probiotics were just getting into the gut and dying, dying before they ever got into the intestines. So, we looked at the research.”“You\'ve got this gauntlet that microbes have to get through when they go through the oral cavity in order to be alive and function in the gut,” Kiran continues. “So, our question was, are there microbes that can naturally do that?”The more we’re researching the human microbiome, the more we’re learning about the connection between the gut and all other human body and brain systems. And that means better health for you. Listen on to learn more about what Just Thrive Health has discovered about probiotics. And yes, you’ll find out how bacteria can be armor-plated, live forever and survive in space.\xa0Enjoy the show! | In this episode of Bulletproof Radio,\xa0Siim Land joins me from Estonia, a Baltic country in Eastern Europe on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland.\xa0He’s an author, public speaker, and coach. After a short stint in the military and earning a degree in Anthropology, he decided instead to fully commit to writing, podcasting, entrepreneurship, and coaching in the health and wellness space.He educates people about optimizing health, performance, longevity, and well-being with different biohacking techniques.\xa0In his newest book, “Metabolic Autophagy,” Siim takes a nearly 500-page dive into the most current technology and scientific research available so you can “improve healthspan, get more things done and potentially increase life expectancy.”\xa0“Your whole entire world is almost surrounded by the concept of metabolism,” Siim says. “The reason I added autophagy to that is also that when I was doing that research about autophagy then I realized that it\'s kind of a very central component to everything else that your body goes through on a daily basis.”We talk about autophagy, intermittent fasting, keto-adaption and much more in this episode. Siim’s perspective on biohacking is nuanced and backed by a whole lotta science. He’s done the research legwork so you don’t have to. Listen on as he gives practical tips for where to start and how to get results—all with a common-sense approach.“I think the emphasis shouldn\'t be to kick your ass all the time and do a lot of stressful activities but also actually allow your body to heal and use those things as a form of recovery,” he says.Enjoy the show! | In this episode of Bulletproof Radio,\xa0my guest is comedian, writer and podcaster Kristen Carney.\xa0She performs stand-up comedy at live shows, on television, and, of course, all over the Internet.

She hosts a podcast—Kristen and Ch(ill)—to bring the real challenges of depression and mental health into an honest public forum.“When you\'re depressed, you\'re so weighed down by the smallest little tasks like getting up to take a shower or paying your car bill,” she says. “Those things feel so heavy that the last thing on your list is figuring out how to get a brain scan.”We talk about how she hacks her brain health, what she does on the just-plain-sucks days, the difficulties of dating when depressed, how shame shows up, and why headstands have become her go-to, feel-better move.“I\'m not trying to spin it positive when it\'s not,” Kristen says, “but to actually find the positive in it that\'s genuine.” Listen on for some surprising insights.Enjoy the show! | In this episode of Bulletproof Radio,my\xa0guest is an Australian biologist best known for his research on lifespan extension and the treatment of diseases for aging.“I\'m a scientist,” says David Sinclair, Ph.D., “and I\'m trying to figure this stuff out before time runs out for all of us.”David\xa0is a professor in the department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and also co-director of Harvard’s Paul F.

Paul is a speaker, author, mycologist, medical researcher and entrepreneur. He is considered an intellectual and industry leader in habitat, medicinal use and production of fungi, and he considers himself a “mycological warrior.” Listening to him describe, decode and illuminate the workings of the mushroom world is an enthralling experience, indeed.“Mushrooms can feed you, they can kill you, they can heal you, they can send you on a spiritual journey,” Paul says. He knows all of this from first-hand experience. He’s spent over four decades in the Pacific Northwest studying and researching the world of mushrooms. He lectures extensively and his presentations cover a range of mushroom species and research showing how mushrooms can help the health of people and the planet.\xa0From origins: “Over 500 million years ago, fungi were the first organisms come to land,” Paul says. “Just this past month [May 2019], they found new fossil records that pushes back the entrance of fungi onto land to a billion years ago. This is hundreds of millions of years before plants.”To modern humans: “You and I are actually mycelial beings, and we are descendant of fungi,” he says. “Fungi are our ancestors.”Paul says we’re intertwined with mushrooms at a cellular level. He believes that habitats have immune systems—just like people—and mushrooms are cellular bridges between the two. Our close evolutionary relationship to fungi can be the basis for novel pairings in the microbiome that lead to greater sustainability and immune enhancement.And from neurogenesis to our microbiome to our mitochondria, fungi are linked to us. Part history lesson and all interesting, Paul’s stories are filled with intriguing discoveries.\xa0His research is considered revolutionary and is creating a paradigm shift for helping ecosystems worldwide.As a special bonus in this episode, Paul shares exciting new information about his work with bees. “This\'ll be the first podcast that I\'ll be mentioning something that enables and empowers everybody on this planet to do something,” he says. Hint: it has something to do with bears, bees, butterflies and biodefense.

And that\'s not always easy. But if you just stay focused on what you know and what you believe is right and you just keep taking the next right step, those decisions get a little easier.”In my conversation with Chalene, we tackle lies in the fitness industry, shady marketing tactics and smart consumers, personalized nutrition, Keto for women, phases of fasting, why achieving health can be fraught with privilege, and more.\xa0Enjoy the show!', 'chan_desc': 'Bulletproof Executive Radio was born out of a fifteen-year single-minded crusade to upgrade the human being using every available technology.

Dr. Herskowitz is an international leader and educator in the field of personalized, precision and holistic medicine. He founded Anatara Medicine and the San Francisco Stem Cell Treatment Center with the intention of developing one of the best integrative and regenerative health care centers in the world. He has a fascinating timeline of his medical education and experience:  The term "Convergence Medicine" was coined by Dr. Herskowitz in 2011 to represent a novel strategy, which combines many forms of medical and energy practices into one cohesive strategy to optimize repair and rejuvenation in each individual. Taking the best from Molecular and Functional Medicine, Nutrition and Metabolism, Physical Medicine and Energy Medicine, he layers in the best of ancient forms of medicine that speak to a person’s innate constitution (he calls it Archetypal Medicine), which helps predict how a patient will respond to different types of treatments, including: -Stem cells -Peptides -Anti-aging -Ozone -IV therapy -Advanced cancer care -And much more! During our discussion, you\'ll discover: -Dietary considerations for a "constitutional assessment" [11:15]  Ahvie has a molecular, cardiology background - as well as acupuncturist Ancient wisdom has a role to play; fusion between Eastern and Western medicine A constitutional assessment is a form of archetyping Most accurate form, leads to accurate nutritional recommendations for the individual Chinese astrology and medicine come from the same philosophy Ben is missing two elements, and a third is weak because of where and when he was born (Lewiston, ID in 1981) You learn how to tweak things specifically for the individual Energy of the food when it\'s ingested: warming and cooling Eating the right foods decreases the need to "biohack" one\'s deficiencies Floating (deficient) fire: "hot" foods don\'t achieve their full efficacy Do the diet, and the craving for suboptimal foods will go down  -Exercise considerations for a constitutional assessment [28:15]  Cold energy moves downward, warm energy moves upward - split in the energy Cyclist Ahvie treated:  Did a diet and training regiment based on his constitutional assessment Less actual cycling, more upper body work Eventually became national champion   Ben struggles with cold thermogenesis, yet has trained himself to do it through breathing, meditation, etc. However, heat therapy such as a sauna is no problem. We\'re barraged with foods that do not fit our CA Ahvie has treated tens of thousands of patients with their technology and knowledge  -What are "breaks" in the Chinese astrological cycle, and why they are opportunities rather than problems [36:35]  Stubbornness is a desire for freedom Knee-jerk response is the opposite of freedom Embrace "maybe"  -About the multi-pass ozone machine Ben was hooked up to during the interview [44:10]  Also called hyperbaric oxygen Typical treatment is 10 passes of ozone Global impact on micro-circulation, oxygen transport, Nrf2 pathways The main use is for optimization and longevity 10 passes builds up the reserve for a full year How one feels during and after the treatment will depend on their overall health  -How Ahvie injected laser lights into Ben intravenously [49:30]  Weberneedle Endo Laser Each color has a different characteristic with a different use for a patient\'s unique condition How is it different from UV radiation therapy:  UV activates white and red cells de novo    -Peptides Ahvie wishes more people knew about [54:00]  BPC 157 Thymosin Alpha 1 "As a society, we\'re in a state of immune chronic activation" Lost circadian rhythm, toxic load from the food supply Humira is the #1 drug today; people can be treated in a more natural way Rapamycin is a suppressant, not appropriate in high dosages Peptides modulate rather than suppress Immune system is the means of communication within the body BGF podcast: "Peptides Unveiled" w/ Dr. William Seeds  -Ahvie\'s approach to nootropic stacks [1:04:00]  Look for repairing and detoxifying, in addition to fortifying Very little for Alzheimers nor for TBI/concussions Institute for Rare and Neglected Diseases (which Ahvie chairs) DHA for blood brain barrier and hypothalamus  -About intravenous procaine [1:07:10]  Procaine is a neural anesthetic Disturbs neural pathways enough to reduce pain  -Why Ahvie doesn\'t co-administer exosomes for recovery 1:11:05] -And much more!

These always turn out to be incredibly popular podcast episodes, and this latest one - the fifth in our series - is just as crazy as all my other Mindpump podcasts including:  The Mysterious Kuwait Muscle-Building Phenomenon, The Too-Much-Protein Myth, Anabolic Triggering Sessions & More With The MindPump Podcast Crew. The Mysterious Micro-Workouts, Turning On Your Butt, Overdosing With Melatonin & More With The MindPump Guys Six-Egg Breakfasts, Ketosis For Bodybuilders, Resetting Weed Tolerance, Kratom Experimentation & Much More With The Mindpump Guys! The Official Edgy, Explicit & Epic Podcast With Me & The MindPump Crew: Longevity, Religion, Parenting, Biohacking, The Joe Rogan Debates, Snake Oil, Pseudoscience & Beyond.  The hosts of Mindpump claim to “pull back the curtain on the mythology, snake oil and pseudo-science that pervades the fitness industry and present science-backed solutions that result in increased muscular development and performance while simultaneously emphasizing health.” These guys are, in no particular order of importance:\xa0 Sal DiStefano (follow on Instagram)\xa0was 14 years old when he touched his first weight and from that moment he was hooked. Growing up asthmatic, frequently sick and painfully skinny, Sal saw weightlifting as a way to change his body and his self-image. In the beginning, Sal’s body responded quickly to his training but then his gains slowed and then stopped altogether. Not one to give up easily, he began reading every muscle building publication he could get his hands on to find ways to bust through his plateau. He read Arnold’s Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding, Mentzer’s Heavy Duty, Kubrick’s Dinosaur Training, and every muscle magazine he could find; Weider’s Muscle and Fitness, Flex, Iron Man and even Muscle Media 2000. Each time he read about a new technique or methodology he would test it out in the gym. At age 18 his passion for the art and science of resistance training was so consuming that he decided to make it his profession and become a personal trainer. By 19 he was managing health clubs and by 22 he owned his own gym. After 17 years as a personal trainer he has dedicated himself to bringing science and truth to the fitness industry. \xa0\xa0 Adam Schafer\xa0(follow on Instagram) is a IFBB men’s physique Pro and fitness expert. Adam made his entrance into the fitness world 14 years ago and has continued to send shock waves throughout the community ever since. He is a man of many talents who wears many hats. He is first and foremost a certified fitness expert who has an insatiable desire to help people in need of major lifestyle changes and daily accountable motivation. He is also incredibly driven entrepreneur and business minded individual with a vision that continually challenges his colleagues and peers to think bigger and achieve more. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Justin Andrews\xa0(follow on Instagram)\xa0has an incredible passion to disrupt the personal training industry and create ground breaking programs and tools that fitness professionals and clients alike can benefit from. The fitness industry in general needs a massive face lift to speak more to the generation growing up with a more advanced technology tool kit. Justin’s approach is to create programs that utilize technology as it advances and cut through the millions of options people face everyday when seeking specific information relating to their fitness needs. The great thing about where we are today is how easy it is to access information, the bad part about accessing all this information is how much misinformation is out there to weed through. As a health and fitness professional with a proven track record here in the heart of the Silicon Valley, Justin Andrews will keep working tirelessly to keep people educated and connected to quality personal trainers long into the future. \xa0 \xa0 Doug Egge (follow on Instagram)\xa0received his first gym membership as a gift from his dad when he was 16 years old. Rocky III had just come out and he was determined to build a body like Stallone. It never happened. Despite following the advice of muscle magazines and busting his butt in the gym, Doug saw minimal gains over the next 30 years. Then he was introduced to Sal Di Stefano by his chiropractor who recommended he work with Sal to eliminate muscle imbalances that were causing lower back issues. Sal’s unique approach, often 180 degrees different from what Doug had read in books and magazines, produced more results in a matter of months than he had experienced in the 30 years prior. Doug with an extensive marketing and media production background, recognized Sal’s unique gift and perspective was missing from the fitness world and suggested that they should join forces. Doug and Sal have since produced life-altering programs such as the No BS 6-Pack Formula and MAPS Anabolic. Doug is very pleased to have the opportunity to work with Adam and Justin as Producer of MindPump. \xa0 During our discussion, you\'ll discover: -The woman\'s proper place in the home [5:15] -How to make a killer pesto from plants in your backyard [7:45]  Ben\'s wild pesto recipe (jo jo can you find?)  -Discussion on unschooling [10:15]  Ben\'s kids are immersed in nature Have a 2x/month podcast (video) with sponsors and everything Document everything in case the state audits their education Book: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century We need free-thinking, resilient, adaptive workers A free-thinker can invest in productive activities if and when AI replaces their jobs Story boarding - prep for what the kids were going to learn There are no rules in the Greenfield home - educate about the consequences of their decisions The adults must provide the example Biggest challenge: Doing standardized tests Jiu jitsu, camps, clinics, etc. provide socialization They\'ll go on a rite of passage when they\'re 13  -Discussion on ego dissolution [25:11]  Plant medicine See yourself in a different light Embrace greatness, or something different if you\'re ego is active Eye gazing with ones mate See each other as spirits, not bodies  -Increasing awareness and legality of nootropics [29:00]  Double-edged sword: incredibly powerful and dangerous Of no use without personal discipline and a personal mission Big $$$ to be made in the future Connection between these and open relationships?

Leave your comments below and one of us will reply! | This episode is all about light, but it\'s certainly not light on content! See, the last time I was in Malibu, myself, music producer Rick Rubin and today\'s guest - Matt Maruca of RA Optics - spent plenty of time geeking out on all things light. I\'ve known Matt for two years now, and consider him to be one of the world\'s leading authorities on what is called "photobiomodulation" - or the use of specific wavelengths of light therapy to cause some very beneficial health effects, and also a guy who knows more about blue-light blocking glasses and limiting the harmful effects of artificial light than just about anyone I know. Today\'s episode is a special two-parter. The first section is yours truly filling you in on how sunlight makes you skinny and blue light makes you fat. The second part is a special solosode from Matt, in which he fills you in on the some little-known aspects of how to use light and how to block light in a way that will affect your energy, sleep, mitochondrial health, and much more, including history of the use of sunlight for health, why the sun and skin cancer isn’t black and white, lots of research on how light affects human biology and the benefits of sunlight, how artificial light affects the body and much more. Just to give you a "taste" of what you\'re about to hear: after preparing this episode, I asked Matt: "can you point me to a post or research on "best time of day to cheat if you are going to cheat" based on circadian rhythm/sun exposure? You alluded to it in the audio." He replied: "I think it would be morning/mid-day. One of the factors leading me to say this is Ayurveda which I imagine you\'re familiar with. An Ayurvedic doctor I started working with explained this to me in their terms. Basically, in the middle of the day as the sun is stronger, the metabolism is more active. They call this energy "pitta", or fire. So, we can burn through stuff pretty well. This is why they generally suggest eating "heavier" food in the middle of the day for lunch. And, it\'s a no brainer to me to fast through dinner because then the body can completely burn through everything you\'ve consumed. As for the Western Research, Satchin Panda from the Salk Institute leads the way. I recommend watching his TED talk where he explains their experiments on mice. They basically found that mice eating healthy food when their metabolism is turning off had way more problems than mice eating unhealthy food when their engines are running full force. Because they are nocturnal the times are reversed for them relative to us. So for us the best time would be late morning to mid-day. To me, when eating this way I wouldn\'t even consider it a cheat because the body can move through stuff so well. If you are comparing to someone who is usually eating a "healthy" dinner at 7 or 8 PM, I am 100% convinced that it would be healthier to "cheat" every day in the middle of the day and fast through dinner then to do what that person is doing. Based on the research, there really is no such thing as "healthy food" after 5 PM or within 4 hours of sleep.

Then appeared again in... ..."How I’ve Been Able To Gorge On Delicious Gluten-Filled Foods Without Feeling Like I Swallowed A Pair Of Motor-Powered Scissors Tearing Up My Intestines."... They are Matt Gallant and Wade Lightheart. Matt\xa0Gallant is an entrepreneur, a\xa0poker\xa0champion, an ex-rock guitarist, a serial entrepreneur (who\'s built 13 companies in the last 20 years)\xa0strength and conditioning coach with a degree in kinesiology, the CEO and co-founder of a company called BiOptimizers. Wade T. Lightheart, host of the AWESOME Health Podcast, 3-time All Natural National Bodybuilding Champion, advisor to the American Anti-Cancer Institute and Cofounder of BiOptimizers. He is also the author of several books including the best-selling books, “Staying Alive in a Toxic World” and “The Wealthy Backpacker.” This episode is for you if you you ever experience digestive issues when you eat high fat meals...such as constipation, diarrhea or a meal just sitting in your stomach... ...or if your intense exercise or peak athletic performance has taken a dip since you switched over to lower carbs... ...or if you want to experience a new level of energy, mental clarity and focus without relying on stimulants... Matt and Wade have cracked the code on solving the major metabolic deficiencies that block you from thriving on keto.\xa0 They\'ve actually turned hundreds of people onto keto over the last couple of decades. Unfortunately, most struggled with three core metabolic issues — which Matt and Wade never knew how to fix until recently. They\xa0began doing hundreds of hours of research and testing on the different nutrients that could help solve these challenges. It wasn’t easy... it took them pouring through a TON of studies (which we talk about in today\'s episode)... massive amounts of real-world testing... until they ultimately discovered the perfect combination of nutrients for optimizing fat digestion, energy metabolism, and fat loss enhancement. They\'re thrilled to finally reveal solution that solves all of these problems—in just 7 seconds... and gives you a new level of energy that rivals coffee. Smooth consistent bowel movements and fat loss on a low-carb or keto diet are now possible. These results are made possible by a solution we talk about in today\'s show - a solution that takes just 7 seconds to open the lid of a bottle, pour the capsules in your hand and throw them in your mouth.

Leave your comments below and one of us will reply! |  | I recently read the book Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever! (and my twin boys also watched the accompanying documentary "Earthing"). Although I already knew about the importance of having an intimate connection with the planet we live upon, this book blew my mind when it comes to identifying one of the best solutions for chronic inflammation, better sleep, enhanced deep sleep and much more. Since reading it, I\'ve been traveling everywhere with my grounding mat, wearing my Earth runners every day, and my boys have barely even touched their shoes. In the book, author Clint Ober introduces the planet\'s powerful, amazing, and overlooked natural healing energy and how people anywhere can readily connect to it. This never-before-told story, filled with fascinating research and real-life testimonials chronicles a discovery with the potential to create of global health revolution. So obviously, I had to the get Clint on the show! Clint Ober is the innovator behind the Grounding Movement & CEO of Earth FX Inc., a research and development company located in Palm Springs, California. A series of seemingly unrelated synchronistic events dating back to his early childhood led to a groundbreaking discovery that’s being recognized as the Greatest Health Discovery of all time. Grounding has now become a massive international movement - causing people to shed their shoes and reconnect electrically to the surface of the Earth.  Clint first learned about grounding when installing Cable TV systems in Billings, Montana in the early 1960s. A decade later, he formed Telecrafter Corporation and built it into the largest provider of cable installation services in the United States. This company specialized in proper grounding of cable installations for safety and TV signal stability. In the 1980s, he turned his attention to the developing computer industry and partnered with McGraw-Hill to distribute live digital news services, via cable, to PCs. This led to the development of the first cable modem and an increased awareness of the need for proper system grounding. Following a health challenge in 1995, he retired and embarked on a personal journey looking for a higher purpose in life. During his travels, he noticed people wearing plastic and rubber soled shoes that insulate the body from earth. He wondered if no longer being naturally grounded could affect us. The question led to an experiment that suggested grounding alone reduced chronic pain and improved sleep. Thereafter, he developed a working hypothesis: Grounding the human body to the Earth normalizes the functioning of all of the body’s systems \u200b—\u200b the body utilizes the earth’s electrical potential and free electrons to maintain its internal electrical stability, normalizing all of its self-regulating and self-healing systems. Over the past twenty years, he has supported over 20 research studies* that collectively demonstrate that grounding reduces inflammation and promotes normal functioning of all body systems. During our discussion, you\'ll discover: -How a near-death experience led to Clint\'s interest in earthing -- 6:10  Clint grew up in rural Montana; childhood friends were Native Americans "If the pasture is pristine, the cows will be healthy" Grew up with a prevention mentality: look at the cause, not the syumptoms Spent 30 years in the communications industry Near-death experience involving a infected liver after a root canal  "The next time I die, I wanted my life to be worth more" "Be the opposite charge" "Status quo is the enemy"    -Why a roll of duct tape proved to be the catalyst to Clint\'s most important discovery -- 19:40  While living in Sedona, AZ experienced problems with computer crashing; identified static electricity as the problem Intuitive question: Are modern shoes preventing us from grounding with the earth? Began testing the charge in the earth with a volt meter Grounded himself to the earth via metal tape;  Static reading on his body went to zero Slept the night without moving (was typically in a lot of pain) Friends reported reduced pain, lowered arthritis    -The early days of Clint\'s clinical research on grounding the body with the Earth -- 25:45  There was very little research on how grounding with the earth reduces pain and improves sleep Two doctoral students at UCLA helped him design the study  60 participants: 30 grounded, 30 ungrounded Positive results on the participants who were grounded Similar results among those exposed to EMF and not exposed to EMF   An anesthesiologist in San Diego was willing to help with the research; he was interested in saliva cortisol levels in patients  Cortisol levels went from erratic to synchronized after grounding At 4 am, cortisol spikes until 6 am Everyone\'s cortisol went up beginning at 4 am (with no other environmental cues)    -What is going on in the body when a person is grounded with the Earth -- 34:00  Dr. Stephen Sinatra  "When you\'re reducing pain, you\'re reducing inflammation"   Led to a different understanding of inflammation  Inflammation is caused from neutrophils: encapsulates damaged cell and releases reactive oxygen Reactive: short on electrons   We\'re no longer naturally grounded with the Earth since the advent of plastic-soled shoes in the 1960\'s When you stand barefoot on the ground, the Earth is negative 20-50 millivolts The Earth has negative ions from lightning, the sun  Noon is the high point for the sun exciting the electrons on the earth Imbalance in charge beginning 2 pm (constant lightning) You\'ll feel the effects of lightning from far away locales The air feels amazing after a thunderstorm because of negative charge in the atmosphere   If the body has a negative surface charge, you can\'t have charge in a grounded object Clint and Dr. Sinatra\'s study had the following results (via grounding):  Reduced rouleaux formation in blood cells Increased negative surface charge of red blood cells by factor of 2.7   Face and skin color turns pink after being grounded for 20-30 minutes  -What our ancestors understood about earthing and grounding -- 54:00  One of the healing methods for the kidney in ancient Chinese medicine is grounding with the earth Our ancestors didn\'t need to know about grounding; they were barefoot or wore conductive footwear  -The best surface when it comes to conductivity between the Earth and the body -- 56:15  Concrete, grass and dirt are ideal; asphalt is not Rocks are good conductors Salt water is the optimal way to ground; fresh water speeds up the process but is not itself conductive (unless it contains minerals) Spring water has a natural amount of minerals If you can feel the tree and it feels cool, it\'s grounding; bark inhibits the grounding process Earthrunners grounding sandals Pluggz grounding shoes Earthling grounding strap Diabetes is inflammation-related; you can be grounded and have diabetes  -The length of time required for a person to become properly grounded with the Earth -- 1:04:04 -How to know whether or not your home is grounded with the Earth -- 1:10:45  Homes built before the 1960\'s were not grounded; there was no need for it at the time Remodels of older homes don\'t necessarily have grounding, even though new outlets are installed  -Are all grounding mats created equal? -- 1:12:15  "Ours is an accidental business" Mass production has compromised the quality and efficacy of the mats Clint maintains his products are the best on the market; although he wishes more would get in the business The patches are an athletes best friend  -And much more....

Listener Q&A: Bone Broth vs. Eating Bones Kevin asks: Hi Ben,\xa0I like to eat a lot of tendons, cartilage, bone marrow and what not, as I know you like to. But I wonder if that\'s as effective a way of getting the nutrients as making a bone broth in the pressure cooker for 2-3 hours.  In my response, I recommend:  - Kettle & Fire Bone Broth (code GREENFIELD for 10% off) Spot-reducing belly fat? John asks:\xa0After being introduced to a high fat, low carb and intermittent fasting diet several years ago, I found it was easy to maintain an ideal body weight. Most of my body is pretty lean (160-170 pounds) but when I measure my stomach using a caliper, it seems to come in around 15%. I\'ve always heard that belly fat is one of the last places men lose fat, but I\'d rather not drop to 145 pounds just to see abs. There seems to be a community of people online who think you can spot-reduce fat. Do you think that\'s possible, and if so, what techniques would you recommend?  In my response, I recommend: - Glycogen depletion/exercise combo protocols (e.g. Tour De France riders) - Localized Cryo - Localized Photobiomodulation - Localized EMS How To Recover From A TBI/Concussion Fast Mark asks:\xa0A good friend of mine just got into a really serious car accident. She\'s been told she has some minor brain damage that\'s going to be permanent as well as some spinal injuries. I was thinking about some of the interviews you\'ve had with Rhonda Patrick and other experts, and I knew there was some nutritional advice you gave regarding brain injuries. Can you give a brief summary of what you would advise for a recovery program for my friend?

Her research centers on the mechanisms of healthy aging and the associations between stress, telomere length, addiction, eating, and metabolic health. In this episode, we dive deep into the world of telomeres, the length of which is one of the useful biomarkers scientists have for getting a sense of the differences between how individuals or groups of individuals age. Telomere shortening is both a cause and a symptom of aging and plays key roles in not only how long we live, but in how well. Lifestyle factors such as poor nutrition and smoking can accelerate telomere shortening by generating oxidative stress and inflammation. Click here to get this episode\'s show notes and transcript.

Dr. Longo is the current director of the longevity institute at the University of Southern California and also director of the Oncology and Longevity Program at the Institute of Molecular Oncology Foundation in Milan, Italy. Dr. Longo’s research focuses understanding the biological mechanisms that regulate the aging process, the role of fasting and diet in longevity and healthspan in humans as well as metabolic fasting therapies for the treatment of human diseases. In this episode, we discuss...  What two seminal studies on chronic caloric restriction in primates from the 80s teach us about caloric restriction as a preventer of age-related disease, and how the effects of caloric restriction may actually be stronger when the diet that is being restricted is an unhealthy one – similar, in some ways, to the typical western diet. How certain macronutrients influence the insulin/IGF-1/growth hormone axis interact to modulate aging in many cell types. How mice and humans who have growth hormone receptor deficiencies have low circulating IGF-1 – as little as 10% of normal levels – and have reduced risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, and age-related cognitive decline, hinting at what future research might reveal about the beneficial effects of prolonged fasting and fasting-mimicking diets through the downstream effects of periodic deprival of growth-related factors. How the growth hormone / IGF-1 axis got a big boost early on in scientific interest when it was revealed that mice that have either deficiency in growth hormone itself or the growth hormone receptor live up to 40% longer and how this is accomplished through what is essentially a delaying of the decrepitudes of old age. The origins of what Dr. Longo calls the fasting-mimicking diet – a 5-day diet focused on recapitulating some of the benefits of prolonged fasting, like dramatic changes in metabolic biomarkers, but without some of the drawbacks like reduced compliance and other risks that can come with multiple days of grueling strict water fasting in large, heterogeneous populations. How periodic prolonged fasting or the fasting-mimicking diet may be able to render cancer cells more vulnerable while conferring stress resistance to healthy cells, a quality known as differential stress resistance. This can happen because of the way fasting interferes with what is known as oncogenic signaling. The mixed results associated with the use of the ketogenic diet in treatment of cancer and how some cancers seem to be hurt by the metabolic switch of utilizing ketone bodies, which creates oxidative stress from the use of mitochondria, while other cancers seem to be able to use ketones effectively as an energy source, potentially accelerating their growth. Some of the early but promising pre-trial clinical anecdata suggesting potential complementary roles for the ketogenic diet and the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) used in conjunction with conventional treatments like chemotherapy or radiotherapy for certain cancers like gliomas. In the context of aging, how the fasting mimicking diet has been shown to “reset” metabolism, driving down biomarkers associated with poor metabolic health, inflammation, and cardiovascular health. How fasting, through the shrinking and then re-expansion of whole systems like the liver, kidneys, heart, and immune cells may represent a type of whole-system renewal that originated as a three-billion-year-old self-repair mode that was only activated during periods of famine or inconsistent food availability, but might now be dormant in people living in a modern world of regular food intake. How Dr. Longo’s group has shown that, in animal models of multiple sclerosis and pharmacologically-induced type 1 diabetes, several cycles of the fasting-mimicking diet is able to reverse disease and restore healthful function. This mechanism also may generalize to erasing other diseases of autoimmunity through the destruction of autoimmune immune cells that are essentially reset through fresh differentiation from progenitors untainted by autoimmunity. A very exciting area of continued inquiry! How shorter fasts may fail to approach some of the effects of periodic fasting and the fasting-mimicking diet by failing to achieve adequate glycogen depletion and ketogenesis. Dr. Longo’s “top picks” for assessing biological age – markers a person can ask their doctor to measure to gauge how well they’re aging.

Dr. Raison’s research focuses on inflammation and the development of depression in response to illness and stress. He also examines the physical and behavioral effects of compassion training on the brain, inflammatory processes, and behavior as well as the effect of heat stress as a potentially therapeutic intervention major depressive disorder. In this nearly 2-hour episode, we discuss the extremely dynamic interaction that the immune system has with mood, behavior, and the brain, as well as the potential that whole-body hyperthermia, a research technique mostly indistinguishable from sauna use, may have for the treatment of clinical depression. Additionally, we also talk about….  How depression as a disease may be subdivided based on whether or not there is involvement of chronic inflammation and how this could influence how it should be treated. The changes in functional brain connectivity that are associated with the high inflammation subtype of depression. The physiological similarities a sauna, hot bath, steam shower, and hot yoga have with whole-body hyperthermia from the standpoint of potentially therapeutically boosting body temperature. Preliminary evidence that increased expression of a certain heat shock protein in the brain may influence behavior by protecting against stress-induced depression.  … and so much more.

Verdin, M.D. is the fifth president and chief executive officer of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and is a professor of Medicine at UCSF. Dr. Verdin\'s laboratory focuses on the role of epigenetic regulators in the aging process, the role of metabolism and diet in aging and on the chronic diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s, proteins that play a central role in linking caloric restriction to increased healthspan, and more recently a topic near and dear to many of you, ketogenesis. He\'s held faculty positions at the University of Brussels, the NIH and the Picower Institute for Medical Research.  In this episode, we discuss...  The effects of a low protein, cyclic ketogenic diet beginning in midlife (12 months of age) in male mice. The result? Increased healthspan and improved memory. Dr. Verdin explains how the cyclic ketogenic diet decreased insulin, IGF-1, and mTOR signaling and decreased fatty acid synthesis, and increased PPAR-alpha (which promotes beta-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle). How this diet is somewhat qualitatively similar to fasting. Some of the possible reasons why the cyclic ketogenic diet created such a striking improvement in memory even when compared to younger mice. How beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is the major circulating ketone body during fasting and nutritional ketosis, may, in addition to being an energy source, regulate inflammation and gene expression by acting as a signaling molecule by inhibiting what are known as class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs). How this inhibition of class 1 HDACs leads to the increased expression of notorious longevity gene Foxo3, which may help explain why mice given an exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate ester had lower markers of inflammation and oxidative damage, which are physiological contributors to the aging process. The role of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the aging process and how replacing declining levels (or preventing them from declining in the first place) may prove to be an important anti-aging strategy. Some of the reasons why NAD+ might be declining with age, its role in DNA damage repair via an enzyme known as PARP, and what the literature says about the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside. How a special class of enzymes called sirtuins, also known to be activated by caloric restriction and caloric restriction mimetic resveratrol, is tightly correlated with the level of NAD+ and how this "energetic currency" rises in response to fasting. The role of the sirtuin enzymes in regulating mitochondrial function, neuronal functions, stem cell rejuvenation and why they may be important in delaying the aging process.

At nearly two hours of dialog, this episode touches on a lot of material but has a special focus on practical implementation of time-restricted eating. Put another way, I kept a list of a lot of questions that seem to keep coming up and present them directly to Satchin. We talk about dealing with shift work, black coffee when fasting, and some of the distinctions between Satchin\'s approach to time-restricted eating which is influenced by his deep background in circadian biology and more conventional protocols like 16:8 that many people are familiar with. In addition to these important and very practical how-to tidbits, we dive into lots of interesting new territory as well, including...  How human anecdote and animal evidence suggests time-restricted feeding may be especially useful for gut-related issues, including inflammatory bowel disease and acid reflux. The fascinating way Dr. Panda is using human anecdote from his trial to ask new scientific questions he wouldn\'t think to ask and then going back to animal data to figure it out and how this unique approach forms a sort of closed loop pattern: animal → human feedback → back to animal for mechanism. How labs doing caloric restriction research may have actually been reaping the benefits of time-restricted without realizing it as an incidental to their experimental design. The revelation that 70% of FDA drugs are subject to circadian effects and are either less effective or more effective at certain times of the day. The effect melatonin has on the pancreatic production of insulin and the insight this lends to why we should probably stop eating 3-4 hours before we go to bed. The bizarre way circadian rhythms affects everything from susceptibility to UV damage to recovery from surgery to cancer risk.  Sign-up for Dr. Panda\'s mobile app study on time-restricted eating.

While we have a lot in common as human beings and there are certain nutritional guidelines applicable to all of us, we’re different in important ways too.

That's why what we choose to put on our plate is one of the most critical health interventions er can make.Food not only affects our likelihood of disease, but it can lengthen our lives, change our mood, and even affect the expression of our DNA. By approaching disease with a holistic perspective, of which food is a vital part, we can tackle the root causes of illness and truly live well. We can change our destiny by making better choices today.In this special mini-episode, I speak with Dr. Rupy Aujla, Max Lugavere, Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, and Dr. David Perlmutter about an empowered approach to supporting the brain, starting with food first.Follow today's guests in this mini-episode here:https://www.instagram.com/doctors_kitchen/https://www.instagram.com/maxlugavere/https://www.instagram.com/drchatterjee/https://www.instagram.com/davidperlmutter/Music: For the Night by Chill Study | Nutrition experts have long debated whether there is an optimal diet that humans evolved to eat. Studies show that modern hunter-gatherer groups across the globe generally have phenomenal heart and metabolic health, yet they eat a variety of diets, and tend to avoid the chronic diseases that kill most Americans.\xa0On today’s Broken Brain Podcast, our host, Dhru, talks to Anahad O’Connor, a bestselling author and reporter for The New York Times. He joined the paper in 2003 and writes for Science Times – the paper’s weekly science and health section – and the Well blog. Anahad covers nutrition, medicine and chronic disease. He has published a number of groundbreaking investigative stories for the Times, including a series in 2015 that exposed Coca-Cola’s funding of scientific research that sought to downplay the role of sugar-sweetened beverages in the obesity epidemic. In 2018, he and his colleagues won an award from the Association of HealthCare Journalists for Planet Fat, a series that examined the food industry’s role in the spread of global obesity.\xa0Anahad is a graduate of Yale University and is a frequent guest on national news programs, such as PBS NewsHour, Good Morning America, and NPR’s All Things Considered. He is also the author of four books.In this episode, Dhru and Anahad talk about what life is like in hunter-gatherer societies, what a typical hunter-gatherer diet looks like, the challenges that are faced in these societies, and if there really is an optimal diet for humans. They talk about time-restricted eating and how when you eat could be more important than what you eat, how food variety causes you to eat more, something known as sensory-specific satiety, and why this is one of the reasons people in hunter-gatherer socieites don’t overeat and become obese. They also discuss another article Anahad wrote in the New York Times, How to Get Strong, and how everyone knows that exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health, but most people ignore one crucial component of it: resistance training and how it can reverse the age-related cellular damage that contributes to sarcopenia and functional impairment.\xa0In this episode, we dive into:-Modern hunter-gatherer societies and why they tend to avoid chronic diseases (3:09)-The importance of eating local and seasonal foods (14:56)-Time-restricted eating (17:47)-Why food variety causes your to eat more (24:08)\xa0-Nature’s perfect food (31:04)-Anahad’s groundbreaking investigative report that exposed Coca-Cola’s funding of scientific research that sought to downplay the role of sugar-sweetened beverages in the obesity epidemic (41:23)-The impact of lifestyle and social connections on overall health (53:22)-Longevity and resistance training (1:02:07)\xa0-How to make resistance training practical (1:11:13)-Learn more about Anahad and his work (1:19:06)For more on Anahad O’Connor, be sure to follow him on Twitter @anahadoconnor, and check out his articles for the New York Times, right here. | The hardest part about achieving a dream often isn’t actually achieving it, it’s stepping through your fear of the unknown when you don’t have a clear plan.

So if you’re a leader, ask yourself: \'Have I empowered my team with enough information to do a good job?\'” In this episode, learn the drives behind why people act the way they do. These powerful lessons will help you in negotiations, personal relationships, and in getting a broader understanding of why you act the way you do in your own life. While gaining a better understanding of how people think, consider this: “We all want to be in control of ourselves, our environment, our thoughts, our body, our day, our work, our lives. As soon as you yank that from someone, they get scared or freak out. Control is the footing of all of our psychology. And once you understand this about yourself and others, it’s so much easier to understand why we freak out or feel uncertain. So give yourself and others the feeling of control and everyone will act with much more confidence and conviction.” Get your High Performance Planner (before we sell out!)

You will reach your goals only with the help of others.” – George Shinn\xa0 As a former lone wolf, the idea that I needed others to make an impact was a hard pill to swallow.

Once you have a better grasp on who you are, you can master your reactions and use your talents to be more productive and efficient in your roles.\xa0 In his new book, You Ain’t the Boss of Me, Dr. Eric “ET” Thomas shares how to empower yourself by uncovering your unique superpowers.

The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” We all live with fear—it’s a basic human mechanism hardwired into our systems to protect us from danger.\xa0 In today’s society, we have far less things to be legitimately fearful of than our ancestors did. But on the other hand, we have so many more inputs and decisions today that can easily become paralyzed by non-threatening fears. We might fear judgment, failure, rejection, inadequacy, and a number of other things. While it’s perfectly normal to experience this emotion, it’s important that we don’t let it sabotage our careers, relationships, or from tapping into our potential. In her new book, Let Your Fears Make You Fierce, Koya Webb outlines the four major fears that we all experience, and how to overcome them in order to live out your dreams. Koya is a transformational specialist, an internationally recognized yoga teacher, and a holistic health and wellness coach.

This conversation is a must-listen if you are overwhelmed, don’t know what to prioritize and know you’re not working from a state of bliss.   Question Highlights:  When you started working less, how did you work out what was most important? How do we guard empty space without feeling bad?\xa0 Do we have to have seasons where we’re riding on the rocket ship and being super busy? What is egg wisdom, and how can it help us attract what we want? How can people simplify what they’re doing in order to work less?

But first I want to talk about the side effects of not following your calling. If you’re not taking actions that support your highest self, you get resentful toward yourself, the people that you love of other people and people who are inspiring to you. You feel anger, anxiety, isolation, comparison, and depression. The most important thing you can do is to really take note of how you\'re holding yourself back and learn to move forward. But moving forward isn’t pain-free either. You’ll feel discomfort and massive fear. You’ll make new friends and mentors but they won’t let you hide. You’ll lose people along the way. But at the end of your life you won’t be wishing you’d done things differently. I hope today’s quickie serves as a reminder or way for you to be able to get back to the heart-centered reason of WHY you’re working on your dreams.

I was binge eating and telling myself stories about why I wasn\'t good enough to do this work. I knew I had greatness inside of me, but I didn’t know what shape or form I would share it in. I put a training program on my credit card and showed up at that event so freaked out, but it totally paid off. Now I’ve created a 5-day workshop called EventLuv to teach the next generation of speakers, leaders and teachers how to create transformational experiences. The event is in January 2020 and the Earlybird price ends September 30.

Then one day at the parent teacher conference he overheard his teacher telling his mom that he was so much better at sports than he was at art. Because we gravitate to where we get rewarded, he became an athlete, went to college on a soccer scholarship and made the Olympic Development Program soccer team. Then, a week before Chase graduated college, his grandfather died from a heart attack and left Chase his cameras. Chase started teaching himself how to take pictures and that led to his career as one of the most influential photographers of the past decade, the developer of the first photo app to share images to social networks and the founder of CreativeLive. Now Chase is on a mission to break down myths about what creativity is and who can practice it. He says that when we look at all the decisions we make every day - what you\'re going to have for dinner, what business that you\'re going to build - as creative acts, that’s when we understand that we have the agency to create our lives.   Question Highlights:  How did you come to think of yourself as creative? How do you protect your creative time? How do make space for creativity when you really need to be making money?  \xa0 Guest Bio: Chase Jarvis is an award-winning artist, entrepreneur, and one of the most influential photographers of the past decade.\xa0 He has created campaigns for Apple, Nike, Red Bull and others, was a contributor to the Pulitzer-winning New York Times story Snowfall, and earned an Emmy nomination for his documentary Portrait of a City. He also created Best Camera--the first photo app to share images to social networks, and is the Founder of CreativeLive, where more than 10 million students learn photography, video, design, music and business from the world\'s top creators and entrepreneurs. He\'s a keynote speaker, an advisor to Fortune 100 brands, and has been a guest at the Obama White House, the United Nations, the Library of Congress, 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, and the DIFC in Dubai.  Earn Your Happy is a production of Crate Media | In This Episode You Will Learn About:  Lindsay Schwartz and Lori’s 5-day immersive workshop on how to run profitable events, retreats or masterminds Making decisions and burning the boats Being OK with disappointing people  \xa0 Resources:  eventluv.com   The Bliss Project 2020  \xa0 Show Notes: Today I’m talking about making decisions. To actually make a decision you have to put skin in the game, say no to things and schedule your calendar so that it’s aligned with your dreams. Lately I\'ve been fierce about making sure that I have room in my calendar for all of my new projects. And I am so proud of myself because, looking back at last year, I had a calendar full of things that I didn\'t necessarily want to do. I was more reacting to life than actually taking time to think if it was something that would move the needle forward. I was doing things because I didn\'t want to say no and hurt people\'s feelings. But you have to say no to things in order to create space for your dreams. I hope today’s quickie serves as a reminder or way for you to be able to get back to the heart-centered reason of WHY you’re working on your dreams.

Maxine Ali is a linguist and body image researcher, with a BA (1st Class Hons) in English Language and Linguistics, and a MSc in Medical Humanities from King’s College London. Maxine’s research interest is how the language of health impacts body image, self-concept and identity. Having begun her career as a health journalist at the height of London’s wellness boom, Maxine experienced first-hand the perils of diet culture and its destructive physical and psychological effects. In 2017, she left her job as a wellness editor to obtain an MSc in Medical Humanities, examining the role of disembodying language in female experiences of eating disorders, obesity and disability in her thesis. Drawing on her background in linguistics, she began using her platform to dissect the language of wellness and lift the lid on the toxic hidden messages around food, health and body image.

Plus, Christy answers a listener question about dealing with digestive symptoms.

Plus, Christy answers a listener question about how health and wellness professionals can handle concerns about potential clients getting “scared off” by the anti-diet approach. Rachel Estapa, founder and CEO of More to Love, is passionate about empowering people to love and appreciate their bodies. Her own path to body acceptance began many years ago. After yo-yo dieting throughout her teenage years and into adulthood, Rachel took stock of her life and realized she wasn’t happy.

PLUS, Christy answers a listener question about how intuitive eating can help with feelings of overeating as opposed to restriction. This episode originally aired on October 16, 2017.

Open relationships have never been about hedonism, they are about an ideal. They are about truth and freedom. Which are both synonyms of Love. There is no greater example of this ideal than in the utopian society envisioned in The Fifth Sacred Thing by Starhhawk. In this week’s AMP Books I share the contrast of how most of us currently look at our lover’s other lovers, to what it might be if we had the courage to reframe sex and sexualy history into something we could be grateful for.Check out The Fifth Sacred Thing | https://starhawk.org/writing/books/the-fifth-sacred-thing/Connect with Aubrey:Website | https://www.aubreymarcus.com/Instagram | https://www.instagram.com/aubreymarcus/Twitter | https://twitter.com/aubreymarcusFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/AubreyMarcus/\xa0Get 10% off Onnit products | \xa0https://www.onnit.com/Aubrey/\xa0Subscribe to the Aubrey Marcus Newsletter:\xa0https://www.aubreymarcus.com/pages/email\xa0Subscribe to the Aubrey Marcus Podcast:iTunes | https://apple.co/2lMZRCnSpotify | https://spoti.fi/2EaELZOStitcher | https://bit.ly/2G8ccJtIHeartRadio | https://ihr.fm/2UVVV0MGoogle Play Music | https://bit.ly/2t72QIpAndroid | https://bit.ly/2OQeBQg | This is one of my favorite podcasts this year.\xa0 When I met musician and psychonaut East Forest, it was immediately apparent he was one of those people I would always call friend.

As a family medicine physician with a passion for functional medicine, Gandhi couples her traditional education and training with a nutritional medicine lens, making her a unique, cutting-edge professional in the medical field. Gandhi offers some great tips and advice (you’ll seriously want to listen to this episode of the podcast with a notebook and pen in hand), on a variety of topics we can approach with a “food is medicine” mentality, ranging from balancing hormones, taming inflammation, and fertility. Another topic she covers as she chats with Olessa Pindak, mindbodygreen\'s Chief Content Officer, is how she advises her patients to optimize their gut health. Gut health should be a priority, Gandhi states, because of its ability to affect so many other processes in our bodies. When our gut health becomes compromised, it can lead to chronic issues like IBS, SIBO, and Chron’s disease, and can even have an effect on our brain health. “The gut is so important. You want to diversify it and keep it healthy,” she says. “If you have an imbalance of good bacteria,” Gandhi says. “That\'s going to link to heart disease later on in life, or Alzheimer\'s, or other medical conditions, or autoimmune conditions. So to me, gut health is so important. All medical problems start in the gut.” The good thing is, we can take control of our gut health (and our overall health, for that matter!) by eating a diverse diet and making sure we get our fill of probiotics and prebiotics. Food really is medicine, take it from Gandhi, herself.To contact the mindbodygreen team with comments, questions, or speaker ideas, please email podcast@mindbodygreen.com.

Molly Maloof, M.D., a personalized medicine physician and one of our speakers at this year’s revitalize event, works with the top Silicon Valley investors and executives on how to seek empowerment and prescribe health in all aspects of life—not just for the body, but for the mind and community around us.On this episode of the mindbodygreen podcast, Jason Wachob, founder and co-CEO of mindbodygreen, sat down with Maloof to chat about how we can truly optimize our health, rather than trying to seek quick fixes whenever we’re feeling not-so-great. After discussing whether psychedelics can have a role in medicine, as well as how she sees the future of the industry shifting, it\'s clear that Maloof has an unparalleled view on how we can take control of our wellbeing.One way she mentions we can ensure a healthy body and mind is by biohacking safely and effectively. “Biohacking is an opportunity to go beyond sickness billing and waiting to be broken and learning how to identify the earliest markers of disease,” she says. “It’s bringing tools that have been used in mainstream medicine but applying them to optimize health.” In this episode of the podcast, you\'ll hear all about Maloof\'s stance on which wellness practices we should maintain and add to our lives to maximize health. Rather than tackling problems as they arise, Maloof suggests that safe biohacks are proactive ways to ensure healthy living. Get ready to truly optimize your wellbeing.\xa0 \xa0To contact the mindbodygreen team with comments, questions, or speaker ideas, please email podcast@mindbodygreen.com.

An award-winning psychiatrist, Yusim couples her medical practice with spiritual principles in order to treat this anxiety, which is a combination that truly promotes holistic healing for our minds, bodies, and souls. Olessa Pindak, mindbodygreen\'s CCO, sat down with Yusim on this week’s episode of the podcast to chat with her about the specific tools she utilizes during a psychotherapy session. She affirms that feeling anxious about our human existence is completely normal. Her first step to coping is to recognize that every human being has this same fear at some point in their lives (sometimes at many points in their lives, in fact), and that it’s a completely valid fear to have. Yusim is no stranger to supplements, and she believes that they can be helpful tools to cope with existential anxiety, especially if you’re living with any vitamin deficiencies already. “Sometimes, anxiety comes from low energy. People feel like something\'s off, and they feel so much anxiety because they don\'t feel like themselves,” she says. Even if you wouldn’t normally consider yourself to be especially spiritual, you’ll find that Yusim’s methods to cope with existential anxiety can help stress and uncertainty melt away. Just make sure to remember: Part of being human is pondering our mortality and the reasons why we\'re here.To contact the mindbodygreen team with comments, questions, or speaker ideas, please email podcast@mindbodygreen.com.

Through treating her patients with immunodeficiencies, she\'s noticed how her patient\'s diets and lifestyles affect the health of their immune systems.\xa0mindbodygreen\'s founder and co-CEO, Jason Wachob, sat down with Moday for this week’s episode of the podcast to discuss vitamin deficiencies, what\'s really causing our allergies, and other common ailments she sees most in her functional medicine practice. If you\'ve ever wondered why nuts are so allergenic or if there\'s such thing as good inflammation, you\'ll want to tune into this one.Moday received her medical degree from Tulane Medical School in New Orleans. She completed a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in allergy and immunology. She completed a fellowship in integrative medicine with the Arizona Integrative Medicine program and is board-certified in integrative and holistic medicine. She completed her functional medicine training with the Institute for Functional Medicine and the Kalish Functional Medicine Fellowship. She started the Moday Center for Functional and Integrative Medicine in Philadelphia where she practices both traditional medicine and integrative medicine. | If there’s one thing journalist and teacher, Esther Wojcicki, knows, it’s how to empower children. She has raised some pretty successful daughters—Susan, Anne, and Janet—who have grown up to become the CEO of YouTube, the co-founder and CEO of 23andMe, and the assistant professor at the UCSF with a Ph.D. and master’s in public health, respectively (Janet also spoke at our revitalize event in 2015!). Not only has Wojcicki learned the importance of empowerment in raising her own family, but she makes it a point to empower the children she teaches in school. A firm believer in making mistakes, Wojcicki knows how to create uplifting environments where kids can flourish and take healthy risks. When I sat down with Wojcicki on this week’s episode of the podcast, we chatted about her book, How To Raise Successful People, as well as the advice she would give to parents who want to empower their own children. Her instruction was simple, yet has remained with me since: treat your kids like adults.\xa0This episode is sponsored by Honest Tea.

Growing up, she was underweight, frequently sick, and struggled with blood sugar related issues.These symptoms seemed to be a result of her gluten intolerance, but even when she incorporated gluten-free alternatives into her diet, she still found herself unsatisfied and, oftentimes, ravenous. It was only when she starting incorporating more fat (think raw milk and butter) that she started to see real progress in her digestion. Even further into her journey with different diets, it wasn\'t until she came across Robb Wolf\'s The Paleo Solutionthat she finally found the golden ticket for her eating lifestyle: real foods, less processed carbs.Her one takeaway after her own experience and completing her nutrition degree? Stay away from processed foods and don’t be afraid to up your intake of animal products. While this rule of thumb may sound simple, it can be quite difficult to maintain this lifestyle if you’re frequently on-the-go. Luckily, Rodgers sat down with co-founder and co-CEO Jason Wachob on this week\'s episode of the podcast to talk about the advice she would give people who, like her, are always traveling but have trouble following particular dietary restrictions or eating plans.For now, whether you have back-to-back business trips lined up or you’re just a professional jetsetter, these are the tips you need to know for maintaining a healthy eating plan, no matter the zip code.According to Rodgers, eating simple, organic meals is the best way to ensure a healthy diet while traveling, which is an eating standard we can definitely stand behind. Check out this week’s podcast for more tips and tricks on how to eat the Rodgers way. | According to Alyssa Dweck, M.D., enhancing women’s quality of life as they age makes up a significant portion of her practice. Although she works with women in all stages of life—she lectures various Westchester public schools in her spare time and educates students about important gynecological issues—she places emphasis on the relationship between the aging process and gynecological health at a cellular level.\xa0What most people might not know, is that aging happens at the cellular level due in part to a lack of something called NAD in the body. NAD, at its core, is a substance that every cell in our body uses to turn food into energy, and it decreases as we age. It also decreases due to many other life stressors—being postpartum, excessive alcohol, over-eating, and getting too much sun exposure, to name a few. That said, it’s in every woman\'s best interest (no matter her age) to become well-versed in all things NAD and start taking the necessary steps to maintain levels of this coenzyme.\xa0After chatting with Dweck, we learned that there are actually a variety of ways we can maintain NAD as we age: In addition to taking steps to combat stress, wearing sunscreen, eating well, and leading an overall healthy lifestyle, one of the most efficient ways to boost NAD is to start popping a vitamin B3 supplement on the regular. But, it turns out, not all B3 is created equally. In this bonus episode, we talk about her three favorites.\xa0No surprise, Dweck frequently recommends this supplement to her patients (no need for a prescription, as this vitamin is sold over-the-counter), and those patients report back with glowing reviews, including significantly more energy. But, of course, we have to know: Does she take it herself? “I sure do,” the OB/GYN quips.Consider us really, really intrigued.

Board-certified in both internal medicine and gastroenterology and published in America’s top gastroenterology journals, he’s seen hundreds of cases surrounding our most common gut health complaints. Additionally, he earned a Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) from Northwestern University, as well as a certificate in nutrition from Cornell University. When it comes to the gastroenterology and the microbiome, Bulsiewicz is nothing short of a seasoned professional.Jason Wachob, mindbodygreen founder and co-CEO, was able to chat with Bulsiewicz about whether cutting out whole food groups is really a good idea, as well as what he believes are the most important foods to consume for a healthy microbiome. For now, here are the three reasons why you shouldn’t cut grains out of your diet, straight from Dr. B himself.For more tips on how to create the perfect eating plan for your gut health microbiome, be sure to check out this week’s podcast. Maybe one day we can all be like Dr. B and participate in a rich, plant-based diet that will strengthen our microbiomes (with a cheeky treat here and there, for good measure). | Deepak Chopra, M.D., is one of the most renowned spiritual teachers of our time. The author of more than 80 books, including 25 New York Times bestsellers, Deepak\'s groundbreaking work on metaphysics and the mind-body connection has touched millions of lives.At this year\'s revitalize event, Deepak joined me on the main stage to discuss consciousness and its role in longevity. You could hear a pin drop as the crowd listened attentively to his nuanced take on some of life\'s biggest questions. One topic that kept surfacing was this idea of "waking up," which Deepak writes about extensively in his upcoming book, Metahuman: Unleashing Your Infinite Potential.There are many things keeping us from true awakening, stuck in a state that Deepak describes as "a lucid dream in a vivid now," and the rise of social media is a big one. From his perspective, social platforms actually often encourage us to focus on the self—and in the process only make us feel more separate from one another. They take us away from our shared humanity and cause a lot of suffering, self-loathing, and jealousy in the process.Waking up to our shared experience is the key to freedom, joy, and a life of possibility. Over the course of the 30-minute interview, Deepak also names the one higher purpose we all share, says what\'s wrong with today\'s wellness world, and explains how anxiety is a modified form of consciousness. Tune in for more thought-provoking—and sometimes mind-blowing—insights from the spiritual leader and latest recipient of mindbodygreen\'s annual Lifetime Achievement Award.This podcast episode is a special recording from our sixth annual revitalize event, which was held in Dove Mountain, Arizona, in June.

She helps patients differentiate between the emotions that are to be expected with new momhood—ambivalence, isolation, and frustration—and more serious conditions like postpartum depression.

I want to answer the main reason behind these cravings at night. \xa0What causes salt cravings? I believe if you’re craving salt at night (chips, popcorn, etc.) it’s because you have a sodium deficiency.\xa0 \xa0Why people crave salt—When you’re deficient in a mineral or nutrient, the body will cause you to crave something that resembles that mineral or nutrient. Salt is sodium chloride. Sodium is one of the minerals. Salt cravings may mean you’re deficient in sodium. \xa0Most people aren’t consuming too much salt from the salt shaker. It’s from the hidden salt in foods like refined carbs and deli meats.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

Anytime you’re consuming protein on the keto, consume it as a whole food (with the fat).\xa0 \xa0Examples of lean protein: • Skinless Chicken Breast\xa0 • Turkey BaconThe truth about ultra low-fat protein: \xa0• Whey protein is not a natural product. All of the fat has been removed.\xa0\xa0• It takes certain nutrients to metabolize protein—consuming lean protein could create nutritional deficiencies.\xa0\xa0• Fat triggers bile. So if you’re not consuming enough fat, bile will dry up, and it will increase the risk of gallstones.\xa0 \xa0• Fat is important for the brain, nerves, cell membrane, endocrine system, and immune system.\xa0 \xa0• Fatty fish/meat is the best protein source.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

Omega 6 Linoleic Acid (This one is pretty easy to get)\xa02. Omega 3-Alpha-Linoleic Acid (This is the one to be more concerned about) \xa0Omega 3-Alpha-Linoleic acid doesn’t really do you much good unless it converts into healthy fats called EPA and DHA. These two fats are vitally important if you’re a vegan.\xa0But, it’s difficult to get this conversion—especially if you’re a vegan.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

It's the heart that is no longer in a regular rhythm. One of the big problems with arrhythmias is that there is not a lot of emphasis on the person’s diet. \xa0The whole system depends on things called electrolytes. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that allow the muscles to contract and relax, and the nerve to transmit communication throughout the nervous system. \xa0\xa0The connection of the heart with the vagus nerve is a part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This connection is what controls the rhythm of the heart. \xa0• The ANS needs vitamin B1 (refined carbohydrates deplete B1) \xa0• Stress can affect the ANS \xa0• Various stimulants can affect the ANSDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

I also want to give you a few metabolism tips. \xa0A few things you need to know about fat and metabolism:\xa0 \xa0\xa0• Out of all the types of foods, fat is the lowest on the insulin index. \xa0\xa0• Insulin is the hormone that stores fat, and it prevents the body from tapping into fat. \xa0What causes slow metabolism? What affects the metabolism more than anything is the amount of insulin in your body, which also relates to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance causes the body to slow down the metabolism to the point where you can’t lose weight. To boost your metabolism, you need to keep your insulin low.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

She also helps us answer a few sex questions including: How do I talk to partners about my STD status? And what do I do if prospective partners have a STD? I have a hard time trusting partners when they tell me their STI status. Should I ask every one of them to get tested? I gained a lot of weight on the IUD. What can I do about this? And are there any nonhormonal birth controls that work well aside from the IUD? My orgasms changed with I switched birth controls. Is this common?And what can I do about this? Also addendum from Remy in regards to one of her answers to a sex question:\xa0 "Testosterone revs our sexy engine up. It can be boosted by getting enough sleep, supplementing with vitamin D if our levels are below 50 ng/dL, supplementing with Zinc (oysters, my favorite;-), B complex vitamins as well the Indian herb, ashwaganda.\xa0 Too much testosterone can give us facial hair, a deep voice, and other masculine characteristics as well as lead to something called polycystic ovarian disease or PCOS so we want the right balance. \xa0 Estrogen helps us feel juicy, voluptuous and divinely feminine. An excess of estrogen can occur when we get toxic amounts of estrogen products into our bodies from the environment (plastics—> BPA, phthalates, parabens) \xa0 When our liver is not functioning effectively , it’s not able to process excess estrogen so it often recirculates causing headaches, tender breasts and crabby moods as well a increasing our risk of breast cancer. \xa0One way to rid your body of excess estrogen is to poop it out- every day at least one big healthy one, however you get there. Fiber and magnesium can help.\xa0 \xa0 Progesterone helps us feel calm, safe and relaxed , which definitely helps when you want to get it on. Synthetic progesterone found in contraceptives is a different chemical that can trigger anxiety and depressed mood in some women (not all) the opposite kind of mood you want when you want to really let go into orgasmic bliss.\xa0 \xa0 What’s a girl to do? While we don’t have a ton of options in terms of our contraception, we do have options about what other things we put into and onto our bodies. These can make a difference".\xa0 Other Links: Get 10% off + free shipping with code SHAMELESSSEX on Uberlube AKA our favorite lubricant at\xa0uberlube.com Get $5 off while mastering the art of pleasure at  OMGyes.com/shameless Get 15% off all of your sex toys with code SHAMELESSSEX at purepleasureshop.com | Tawny is a bisexual NYC-based writer, public speaker, and event producer.

This time, he set out to see what the research showed when it comes to combating tumor growth and cancer in patients.\xa0 What he discovered was nothing short of incredible. His research proved that cancer is a metabolic disease -- similar to type 1 or 2 diabetes, not a genetic one. So your genes, or even genetic mutations, don’t cause cancer. And since cancer is a metabolic disruption, there are ways to restore balance and reduce the size of cancer tumors. But those science-backed strategies don’t involve the typical cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation.\xa0\xa0 Instead, Dr. Seyfried’s research showed that ketosis, fasting, and hyperbaric oxygen were more effective at treating tumor growth. You’ll hear more about this and everything else he’s discovered over decades of research when you tune into the episode. And if you haven’t come across Dr. Seyfried’s work yet, he wrote the book, Cancer as a Metabolic Disease, and has over 150 peer-reviewed publications.

This time we tackle all your questions about your thyroid and your adrenals, which are things that are really important to talk about. If you’re someone who cares about the status of your health and your body, it’s really beneficial to know what’s going on with your hormones, your thyroid, and your adrenals. Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Questions Answered in this Episode:  What test should you have done to check for thyroid issues? What are the ways to tell you’re having issues with your thyroid and adrenals? What should you do if your thyroid levels are all good but you have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism? What do high reverse T3 and thyroglobulin antibodies mean? When you have Hashimoto’s and your antibodies went up but your thyroid hormones are improving, what could be going on?\xa0 What are the best ways to treat adrenal fatigue? What are some suggestions to help your adrenals rebound? Is it alright to do intermittent fasting when you have adrenal issues? Does time restricted eating and/or fasting stress the thyroid if you have Hashimoto’s? How can you know if what you’re doing is helping or hurting your adrenals and thyroid?  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  4 reasons why, when you’re under stress, your thyroid takes a hit.   When you have perceived stress in your body, your adrenals are called into play to handle that. And when that happens, your body slows down all other processes that aren’t absolutely needed in order to deal with that stressor, including your thyroid hormone output. As the stress becomes more chronic, it leads to an overall consistent slowing down of your thyroid. Stress causes inflammation, which causes your body to decrease overall thyroid hormone production. When stress is high, you convert more T4 to reverse T3.   Hashimoto’s is an autoimmune disease which causes a low-functioning thyroid. On the other hand, hypothyroidism is having a low-functioning thyroid, but it has nothing to do with the autoimmune system. Adrenal dysfunction causes low cortisol, which then results in under-functioning thyroid. Symptoms of adrenal dysfunction include the following:   Being over your happy, healthy weight, especially around the middle, and weight loss resistance. Difficulty falling asleep or inability to have good sleep. Poor immunity. Chronic exhaustion. Poor emotional, mental or physical resilience. Feeling tired and wired. Episodes of low blood sugar. Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Poor mental function, concentration, or memory problems. Hormonal imbalances.   Symptoms of hypothyroidism include the following:   Fatigue. Increased sensitivity to cold. Constipation. Dry skin. Weight gain. Puffy face. Muscle weakness. Muscle aches, tenderness, and stiffness. Pain and stiffness in your joints. Irregular menstrual cycles. Hair loss. Slowed heart rate. Depressions and mood swings. Impaired memory and brain fog. Possibly, but not always, an enlarged thyroid gland.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Work on your adrenal health and understand more about your thyroid. Look at your immune system as it relates to your thyroid. Do everything you can to let your body know it is safe. Think outside the box of what could potentially be causing you stress and look into lifestyle factors.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS Don’t miss signing up for the live Empower Intensive coaching session on 8th October 2019 where we’re going to talk all about body image.

We do have so much stimulus.” Shawn said: “At a minimum, everyone should be required to take ten deep breaths at some point throughout their day.

Leading functional medicine expert, Dr. Will Cole shares insights from his new book, The Inflammation Spectrum, that teaches you to love your body enough to nourish it with delicious healing foods. Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Topics Discussed in this Episode:  What goes on in our bodies when we have inflammation Why inflammation is becoming more prevalent in today’s society Going for the holistic, functional approach to inflammation What causes inflammation The elimination diet and how to determine what foods work and don’t work for you Bio-individuality as it relates to lifestyle factors\xa0 Taking a look at your inflammatory habits Why you should practice intuitive eating  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  Problems arise when inflammation is out of check and the body’s regulatory system is off. On a clinical level, we live in a time where functional medicine is getting people the care that they need. What is the most effective option that causes you the least amount of side effects? That should be how you assess how you deal with anything in healthcare. The elimination diet is still a gold standard when it comes to finding out what foods work and don’t work for you. Food confusion is no fun, so cutting through food confusion is liberating and revolutionary for people. We like to separate mental health and physical health but mental health is physical health. Your mind and emotions impact your physiology, and your physiology impacts your mental health. It’s important to get to a place of clarity and stillness by lowering inflammation and balancing your body to have true intuition because sometimes hungriness and cravings can disguise as intuition.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Know your options when it comes to healing your body, and choose the one that is most effective that causes you the least amount of side effects. Find out what your body loves and what your body hates to personally modulate inflammation in a healthy, balanced way. Find out where you’re at in the inflammation spectrum and see where you should target your efforts. Practice self-love. Feed yourself what your body wants and don’t feed yourself what your body doesn’t want or doesn’t do well with.

How do you not gain weight when you add in more carbs? Questions like these are some of the biggest questions about quitting keto, and the answer is not an easy thing to digest. Listen in and find out! Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Topics Discussed in this Episode:  My personal experience with keto What transitioning out of keto was like for me The fear of gaining weight versus the excitement of switching to intuitive eating How to find your set point weight How to get over the fear of gaining weight  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  The only person that knows whether you will gain weight or not when you quit keto and start eating more intuitively is YOU.\xa0 Your body is going to do what it needs to do to get back to the place where it feels most comfortable and safe. It might need to gain weight in order to do that, or it might need to lose weight, or it might already be there. If you lost weight through restriction, undereating, overexercising, drastically cutting carbs, dieting, all these things that we do to manipulate our food in order to try to see changes in our body, then you might gain weight. Lasting changes will not happen from a place of hate, fear, judgment, criticism, and negativity. What you want and how you feel have to match.  \xa0 Action Steps: \xa0  Get to your body’s set point weight.  \xa0  Make peace with food and your body. Listen to your body to determine how and what to eat. Fuel your body appropriately. Make the act of taking care of yourself a priority. Eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re satisfied.  \xa0  Get over the fear of weight gain.  \xa0  Trust yourself and your inner guidance. Find your intuition. Take the time to find out and see what it says.\xa0 Respect your body. Understand and come to terms with the damage you have done, and undo the damage. Don’t let your weight and body define you. Practice body neutrality. Remember that your body wants to be well. Stay in the present. Remeber, “Positive vibes only”.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS The last Fat Burning Female Project that I will ever teach live is happening in October. If you know you want to be a part of that, mark your calendars for the enrolment on September 27th. I will also be doing a live Q&A call to answer your questions about the course on September 26th so you know right from the beginning whether it’s right for you or not.

Your body is your vehicle. It’s not your defining feature. It never was and it never will be. You have so many amazing qualities that have nothing to do with your body at all.” \xa0 Sponsor Links:  BetterHelp - Get 10% off your first month using the discount code keto.

And what do you do to keep from falling off the wagon? In this episode of the Keto Hot Seat, we go into round two of listener questions all about the diet mindset. Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Questions Answered in this Episode:  How can you honor your intuition and your body if you’re not accepting your body yet? Is there ever an “Aha” moment where it all makes sense and you’re free of the diet mentality? What do you suggest for binge eating tendencies? Do cravings and non-satiation mean you’re still in a diet mindset? What’s your advice for staying mindful and not turning one piece of cake in a complete carb dessert free-for-all? How do I balance intuitive eating while also dealing with gut healing and needing to avoid certain foods? What do you need to do to stop emotional eating?  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  You don’t necessarily need to accept your body from the start, but acceptance comes quickly once you learn how to respect your body. Body neutrality is detaching the thoughts that you have from having any sort of emotional impact on you. Having a neutral diet mentality, being more free around food, using your intuition -- it’s a practice. Confidence will help you build this very quickly once you realize that you do have this inner voice that’s smart and looking out for you. The more experience you have using your intuition and using that inner guidance system, the better and easier it gets, and the more excited you will be to keep using it. When you’re bingeing, it’s communication from your body. It’s your body telling you that something is up and something is off. The more you have a negative attachment to your binge episodes after they’re done, the more you’re going to do it again.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Take the first step to body acceptance by starting with body neutrality and working on your respect for your body. Be aware of why you’re bingeing when you’re bingeing. Do your best to stay with the experience and be introspective with it, and don’t beat yourself up about it. If you want to stop bingeing, eat a wide variety of foods and find another thing that you can do to occupy your time and get you out of a negative headspace.\xa0 When you’re emotional eating, figure out the emotion behind it. Is it boredom? Fear? Sadness? Loneliness? Happiness? Have a “fire escape plan” for those times when you feel like you’re falling into emotional eating.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS If you missed the first  Empower Intensive coaching session, the recording is now available for your consumption along with everything that comes with it. In that session, we talked about silencing your diet ego so you can listen to your body. It’s about that very first step to learning how to use your intuition and working on your mindset. \xa0 We’re also ramping up for the last Fat Burning Female Project for 2019. If you want to be a part of that, just head  here and get ready to become a fat-burning female for life. \xa0 Take care! \xa0 Kristin said: “With binge eating and emotional eating, it’s almost like the drive is so strong that you almost can’t stop it… so having [a fire escape plan] that’s already pre-made that all I need to know to do is to follow these -- it helps.” Shawn said: “You can’t use your intuition if you hate yourself. If you are going at it from a place of hate, you’re not going to heal your relationship with food, you’re not going to be able to use your intuition, especially as it comes to food and your body.” \xa0 Resources mentioned in the show:  Your Diet Mindset Questions Answered! — #115  \xa0 Sponsor Links:  Lola - Get 40% off your first month’s subscription using the code keto4women when you subscribe.

Deanna Wilcox shares a very important message for you to not only hear but also do something with. So get ready to take action on what you’re about to learn! Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Topics Discussed in this Episode:  Deanna’s health journey and what it was like to battle mold illness Some of the symptoms of mold illness that Deanna experienced How a mindset shift starts Why a mindset shift is so hard Uncovering your limiting beliefs Deanna’s mindset journey  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  You have to get to that almost-bottom basement level to understand how powerful your mindset is. Your limiting beliefs can hold you back from claiming your healing. Gratitude is the quickest way to start noticing some changes and getting rid of the negative emotions. You can live a much more vibrant life than you are currently living if you just learn to change your mindset. The smallest step is going to provide you the biggest leap as far as the change that you will see in your life. Even though you do the mindset work and you develop this strong and powerful mindset and you develop this great awareness, it doesn’t mean that hard stuff doesn’t happen anymore. The difference is in the way that we approach them. Staying aware of your limiting beliefs and negative thought patterns every day is very critical. When we live without hope, we are experiencing the very pain that we’re trying to avoid.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Don’t focus on what you don’t have. Start loving your illness. Uncover negative thought patterns and limiting beliefs through journaling, meditation, and practicing gratitude. Be real with yourself. Be open to working with a practitioner when trying to solve your issues. Don’t be a victim, always remain the student. There’s something we can always learn even when it’s hard. Sit with your emotions. Feel all of them, but don’t get stuck in any of them. Start living with more hope.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS The Empower Intensive Group Coaching Calls have started on September 3, 2019, where we talked about silencing your ego.

Please always consult your medical professional for your specific health concerns. | Have you ever thought about quitting keto and wondering how to do it? A lot of you have requested for this topic, so in this episode, I share some tips and my own experience: I what I did, what I didn’t do, and when I knew it was time to quit keto. Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Topics Discussed in this Episode:  Why food freedom should be your end goal The potential reasons to quit keto When you should potentially consider quitting keto How to quit keto How to not go back to eating crap  Key Takeaways:  Keto is a very important, very helpful healing protocol or tool for many people, but that doesn’t mean that you need to be on that forever. When you know that your healing protocol has ended, now it’s time for you to start more of your intuition and going with the flow. Whether keto or not, your end goal should be in this place of freedom around food; to have a healthy relationship with food; to be able to use your intuition 100% of the time with food and to just not worry about it. You can’t go into keto, or any diet for that matter, wanting weight loss. To be severely restricting or eliminating one food group for no reason isn’t real life. The goal, no matter what, should always be to include as much food into your diet, not continue excluding food from your diet. There are still no long-term studies showing that keto does anything for weight loss. Furthermore, there are no studies of any diet showing long-term weight loss because diets don’t work.  Action Steps:  If you want to quit keto, let your intuition guide you and start eating more carbs. Be guided by your body, your health, and your intuition rather than give in to sugar cravings. Always have the widest variety of foods you possibly can in your diet. Don’t force keto on yourself if you don’t enjoy it. Even if you have a medical condition that you are using keto to work on, go to your health practitioner or nutritionist and tell them you don’t want to do keto anymore. How to quit keto:   Notice what sounds good in all aspects of nourishment, pleasure, and satisfaction. Is it still high fat, moderate protein, and low carbs that sounds really good as far as how you’re going to nourish your body? If not, continue thinking more about what does sound good. Be intentional with your food. Experiment and be fully aware of how you feel when you start to reintroduce foods that you haven’t had since you went keto. Take your time getting out of ketosis. Work on your diet mindset in the process. Have no fear.\xa0   Keep a full stock of real foods you love in your house and find real food alternatives also. Be proud of yourself and what you’ve done using keto, and respect that.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS Join us live in the  Empower Intensive Group Coaching Calls on September 3, 2019, at 5 PM Mountain Standard Time. I’m going to coach you all on how to silence your diet ego. Trust me, it will change your life. And if you can’t join it live, don’t worry! There will still be many opportunities to join in the coming months. Just let me know if you want to be a part of this by getting on the VIP list.\xa0 Take care!   Shawn said: “No matter what, get rid of that diet mindset. Look beyond your weight gain or weight loss and really see what’s going on.” “You are not a failure for not continuing keto. It has nothing to do with you as a person. There is nothing wrong with you. You don’t owe anyone any explanation as to why you’re not following keto anymore.” \xa0 Resource mentioned in the show:   How Long Should You Do Keto? — #075  \xa0 Sponsor Link:  \xa0Empower Intensive Group Coaching Calls  \xa0 More from Shawn Mynar: Shawn's Website Shawn's Instagram  Shawn's Facebook The Fat Burning Female Project The Fat Burning Female Self-Study\xa0  Best Ketone Test Kit Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Meter Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Test Strips \xa0 The advice and opinions in The Keto For Women show are intended for informational purposes only and should not be taken as medical care or advice.

In this installment of the Keto Hot Seat, we answer your diet mindset questions and dive more into the role that this mindset plays in our relationship with food, our bodies, and our health. Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Questions Answered in this Episode:  Why doesn’t it seem to be working no matter how hard I try to lose weight with keto? What if you actually need to lose weight? How do you lose weight without a diet mindset? How can you go about working on a healthier weight without becoming obsessive? How do you know when to move on from what you’re doing because it has stopped working? What is the next move and when do you make it? Why is losing the diet mindset so freeing?  Key Takeaways:  Weight is a symptom, not the problem. It’s simply a signal that your body is giving that something else is awry. Forcing keto to work versus allowing keto to work is a matter of your ego talking versus your intuition talking. Your diet ego is not going to outsmart your body and your intuition. The harder you try, the harder your body will fight back. You can’t do anything else until you understand what’s going on in your head and understand who’s talking -- is it your ego or your intuition? Your intuition should be louder than your ego. There are a lot of things that you can focus on instead of weight that align with your higher purpose and will eventually get you there if that’s what you want. Understand that what you have learned about dieting is coming from a $78 billion industry that’s making tons of money by creating this diet ego in you. “Dieting” actually causes weight gain because it increases your set point to where your body feels comfortable and naturally safe. The end goal is not only for us to understand what’s going on in our heads and what’s been done to us by the diet industry over the years, but to get more people on board to getting rid of the diet mindset.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Get rid of the assumption that your weight is directly correlated with your food. Instead of just aiming to lose weight and thinking that’s what’s going to cause your health changes, aim for the health changes. As you get healthier and as things come into alignment with your health and balance, your body eventually sheds the unnecessary weight. When it comes to your health, do your own research and be your own advocate. When it comes to losing weight, focus on how you’re trying to make things happen. Don’t let your diet ego do the talking. Call a truce with your body and fully accept the weight you’re at right now. Use your bigger WHY as a guiding force to why you’re trying to make some changes, including your weight. Get rid of your limiting beliefs. Practice self-love. Stop looking to food and diet to “work”. Just eat what your body wants and needs. Be intentional with your food and enjoy it. Pay attention to what you’re consuming and how it feels and let your body guide you.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS Be on the lookout for my new monthly coaching call series, Empower Intensive! They’re going to be on very specific topics about your diet, your body, and your health mindset and how all of that is holding you back from what you really want.

Anybody who says they have it for you should be a red flag.” Shawn said: “All we’re teaching you how to do is find your own answers by using your own body. Your body’s signals and guidance and clues -- that is invaluable.

Clinical psychologist Laura Goldner talks about the issues that most women have and how important it is to be aware of what your body feels. She also shares how she draws from a wide variety of modalities to help women move from where they are to where they want to be. Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Topics Discussed in this Episode:  What Laura does in her practice Helping women in transitions\xa0 The issues that women have with food, eating, and body image Why it’s important to be aware of what your body feels Why so many women hate their bodies Connecting with your sexuality What people find “sexy” How regulating your blood sugar can lead you to freedom Locus of control: internal versus external  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  The time of transition that you go through is an opportunity for enormous insight, enormous healing, and shifting the direction of your life. If you’re not paying attention to what your body feels, you’re not aware that you’re stressed until you’re binging on something, you’re not realizing that you’re tense until you’re having a full-blown panic attack, and you’re not connected to hunger and satiety cues. When we’re looking at the complicated issues around food and eating, there is almost always guilt and shame tied up with it. Doing extended breathing can be a very quick way to calm yourself. Your sexuality is a part of your life force. The idea of what is sexy that we have absorbed through media is usually not us, and so we feel embarrassed or ashamed of our bodies.\xa0 You deserve to feel beautiful and confident and to do what you need to do to get there. There is a direct connection to feeling good in your body and feeling sexual.\xa0 Connecting with your sexuality starts with yourself -- feeling and loving yourself.  \xa0 Action Steps:  Be self-aware and pay attention to what your body feels. Stop taking care of everybody else at the cost of yourself. Never be too busy to meditate. Practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique, where you breathe in for 4, hold for 7, and breathe out for eight. Look at your patterns with curiosity and compassion and not with criticism.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS If you want to be a part of the mindset projects that I have coming up very soon, make sure to get on the interest list.

Or ashamed and guilty for eating something you think you should not be consuming? In this episode, I delve into how you can get rid of these negative emotions that we associate with food, sometimes without even knowing.  Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode.  Topics Discussed in this Episode:  What food fear was like for me when I was growing up Finding keto and getting rid of the diet mindset The ego versus the intuition Why we fear food Where these fears come from What this type of negative thinking around food does to you Orthorexia 7 ways to help you get over your negative thoughts around food  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  There are stories you tell yourself that come from a place of fear, that is your ego talking. When it’s your intuition that’s speaking, it’s more of a guidance. There is no such thing as “can and can’t”, no negative thoughts or emotions or negative labels on food. Some of the reasons why we fear food:   Because of the belief that body weight can and should be manipulated with food. Because you’re afraid you might lose control with certain food. Because you fear death or illness, or reoccurrence of a disease that you have had in the past. Because you’re afraid of eating certain foods will make you not do the diet perfectly. Because you’re afraid of falling off track. Because you’re afraid of feeling like crap.   Negative emotions around food cause stress. It also leads you to spiral out of control, which then leads you to become even more detached from that food and your body, and you end up binging and feeling like crap. Some of the signs and symptoms of orthorexia:   Compulsive checking of ingredient lists and nutritional labels An increase in concern about the health of ingredients Cutting out an increasing number of food groups An inability to eat anything but a narrow group of foods that are deemed healthy or “pure” Unusual interest in the health of what others are eating Spending hours per day thinking what food might be served at upcoming events Showing high levels of distress when “safe” or healthy foods aren’t available A sensitive following of food and healthy lifestyle blogs on Twitter and Instagram Body image concerns may or may not be present  \xa0 Action Steps:  Practice eating intuitively. Get rid of your negative thoughts around food.   Remind yourself of your bigger why and how you want to get there. Get rid of the macros that you must hit or the rules you must follow. Know that perfection does not exist and is not required. Remember that food is fuel for your body. Some fuels are better than others but none are bad or are going to immediately damage you. Think about the impact energy plays into this relationship. Trust your internal guidance and body’s signals instead of outside influence. Work on your mindset and your feelings about yourself and your body.  \xa0 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS For those of you who are interested in The Fat Burning Female Project, the last class of 2019 is coming up real soon in October!\xa0 \xa0 Also, be on the lookout for my new mindset coaching series!

In this episode of the Keto Hot Seat, we dish out all the good, the bad, and the ugly about the supplements you’re taking (or not taking) and answer all the super insightful questions you’ve sent our way.\xa0 Visit http://www.shawnmynar.com/ketoforwomen/ for the complete show notes of every podcast episode. \xa0 Questions Answered in this Episode:  How do you know which supplements are good, and how to avoid the “junky” ones? When is a good time to take probiotics? Should you rotate probiotic brands and types? Should you take probiotics forever? What are the supplements to take before and after antibiotics? How effective are supplements when you take them all at the same time? Can you take magnesium and calcium together? How do you check for interactions between supplements when most doctors disregard this? How do you know which supplements your body needs? What are the basic supplements everyone should be taking? What are the necessary supplements versus what would be nice? What test should you take before starting supplementation? If you eat a nutrient-dense diet and you take mineral supplements that are needed, is a multivitamin really necessary?  \xa0 Key Takeaways:  There is nothing a supplement can do that replaces what your diet and lifestyle choices do for you. Whereas pharmaceutical products go through rigorous testing to determine their safety and efficacy, supplements are in the category of “safe until proven guilty”. Supplement products can go on the market and stay on the market until a problem comes up. Supplements are categorized into the following:   Pharmaceutical grade\xa0 Medical grade Cosmetic/nutritional grade   Taking a probiotic during and after antibiotic use prolongs your gut’s ability to recover. The benefits of probiotics mainly happen transiently. They don’t necessarily colonize in the gut. A lot of nutrient deficiencies are caused by stress and lack of sleep.   Action Steps:  Choose nutrient-dense foods. Work on your stress reduction. Get proper sleep. In fact, sleep as much as you possibly can. That is the best thing you can do for your gut. Get enough sun exposure. Work out and build your strength. Commit to being an informed consumer and stay educated. Consult a healthcare professional for supplement recommendations. Do your own research on supplements and become your own investigator. Read the ingredient labels of your supplements just as closely as you read your food labels. Support your gut by eating fermented foods. Get tested for vitamin D levels and work with a practitioner to understand what dosing would be right for you. Spend a little bit of money to know what nutrients you’re deficient in. Don’t just supplement to fix a symptom. Definitely dig in and figure out the root cause.

A grieving family is destroyed over the death of a parent and is in desperate need of emotional stability. A spouse is torn apart by divorce and is starved for normal amounts of positive attention. A friend is destroyed by the betrayal of another and is craving a close relationship for support. Now, enter the narcissist. \xa0Hidden by a veil of perfection, the narcissist immediately endears themselves to the needy person (pets included) and navigates any personality differences with ease. They are charming, caring, generous, kind, and seem to have it all together. They anticipate the needs of others and come willingly to the rescue without complaint.

During their marriage, she was the target for his angry rants, verbal assaults, gaslighting, and guilt-tripping. But now his attacks seemed to center around just one of their two kids. Unfortunately, it was their ten-year-old child who most resembled Sabrina’s personality that was his new target. Their twelve-year-old child seemed to escape his scrutiny despite the recent in-school suspension and two failing grades. But it was the ten-year-old who was quiet, generally compliant, and rarely got into trouble that Sabrina’s ex attacked. Sabrina watched in horror as her child shut down, became unnecessarily anxious, was newly fearful, and depressed. Afraid that her child would become like her, Sabrina knew she had to speak to him. However, the last time she confronted him, he slapped her with a motion to modify parenting agreement accusing her of parental alienation. So, what could she do?

The overindulge attention, special treatment for nothing special, and excessive emotional tolerance that parents gave their kids have not resulted in a more productive generation but rather one that seems apathetic. It’s a toss-up between who is more confused: Millennials because the world does not work the way they envision it should or other generations because they don’t understand how Millennials think. How did this happen? Some research has suggested that the lack of severe economic downturn during the childhood of millennials is to blame. Other hypothesis points the finger at parents who reinforced the idea that their child was so special that they didn’t have to adhere to the standards of society. While others believe society is responsible because every child received an award even when they came in the last place. Whatever the cause, the traits of narcissism seem to apply to this generation (generally speaking). Yet despite the similarities, Millennials are not the typical grandiose or covert narcissists. Rather, the traits of narcissism, not the disorder itself seems to be more characteristic.

It was his way of saying, “Happy Mother’s Day, I see you. I’m watching you. You need to lose weight.” This was not the first package of its kind. Over the 30 years of no contact, he would periodically send Marie a newspaper clipping, an article, or random note all with the same weight loss message. Marie knew it wasn’t about her weight, it was his way of sparking insecurity, disapproval, and paranoia in her. He did this to get her back for the years of distance. The packages almost always followed shortly after her brother, who kept limited contact, would have a visit with him. It took Marie years to unpack the damage his pathology did to her psyche. Sociopaths are gifted at installing bugs into a person’s hardware that can remain hidden for years which slow down the functioning of a person and can even destroy it if left unchecked. But this time, instead of sparking fear in Marie, she used his “gift” as a reminder of the now eradicated lies.  Read more... | Chuck knew he was a jerk. He cheated on his wife several times, put his work before his family, rarely went to his kid’s activities, drank heavily on the rare occasions that he was home, and verbally berated anyone who challenged him. And yet, he was a highly successful businessman, intelligent about a wide range of topics, had numerous friends, and was charming (when he wanted to be). Nonetheless, despite getting his way most of the time, Chuck was miserable. He toyed with counselors in the past, going only when needed to preserve his marriage, but not putting any real effort into changing. Instead, he would strategically turn the counselors against his wife over many sessions, leaving her a bigger mess than when they began. He was proud of his ability to manipulate situations that normally would be to his detriment into his benefit. This precise skill was used in business as well to make him far more successful than his natural abilities. But here he was at the mid-point of his life, wondering what was it all for? He made money to spend it on cars, boats, and houses but these things just needed more money to exist. He was a rags-to-riches story but never seemed to fill the hole in his heart that told him, “You will never amount to anything.” He had sex to feel intimacy and connection but couldn’t feel satisfied. He had a family to secure a sense of belonging but instead found shame.  Read more... | Ida realized her mother was a narcissist in her early 20’s. But what she didn’t expect was the developmental impact on her childhood. Normally, a child is given the freedom to explore and express their individuality so they can develop into a confident and well-balanced adult. This nurturing environment prioritizes the needs of the child over the parent without overindulgence. But this did not happen for Ida. Instead, Ida is hypersensitive to what other people might think about her. Her mother emphasized appearance and demanded perfection. When Ida would gain a few pounds, her mother would berate her and tell her that no one will ever love a fat person. She would say that Ida was an embarrassment and her mom would refuse to buy her new clothes or take her out until she lost the weight. Naturally, Ida developed severe anxiety, depression, and eating disorder. As she entered her late teens, she added drinking and some drugs to the mix. Unable to please her mother, Ida chose to please her friends who were also engaged in an unhealthy lifestyle. Ida was unaware of her dysfunctional narcissistic parent as a child. It wasn’t until rehab that she fully accepted her mother’s false perception of reality. Even though her mother insisted on the rehab, she became angry during parent’s weekend. Ida’s now healthy perspective became threatening to her mother because it exposed the poor narcissistic parenting. As a result, her mother completely withdrew complaining that the rehab ruined her. But for Ida, this is just the start. Without her mother’s voice in her ear, the years of narcissistic parenting revealed far more devastating consequences. Using the symptoms of a narcissist as the starting point, here are the results of dysfunctional parenting and the road to recovery:  Grandiosity breeds criticalness.\xa0Ida’s mom magnifies her accomplishments to the point that Ida believed she was super-human. Ida desperately tried to live up to the image of her mother. However, when she came close, her mother rose the bar again to keep it just out of reach. Ida then became overly critical of her actions, believing she needed to be perfect.  Recovery:\xa0Ida accepted her imperfections and embraced them as a normal part of herself. Instead of trying to please others, she decided to please herself.   Idealism breeds despair.\xa0Ida’s mom created her own fantasy world where she was all-powerful, brilliant, and beautiful. Ida was expected to be physical extensions of her mom. When Ida achieved a reward, it is as if her mother got it instead. Since no success was solely at the hands of Ida, she lost hope that her accomplishments matter. This generated feelings of despair and despondency.  Recovery:\xa0Ida made a list of her accomplishments and unique talents. Whenever she would feel down, she reviewed the list to gain perspective.   Superiority breeds inferiority.\xa0For Ida’s mother, being average was as bad as below average. Since narcissists believe they are superior and can only associate with other superior people, their children by extension must also be exceptional. This pressure was overwhelming to Ida who realized she was not extraordinary in everything she did. As a result, this unrealistic expectation set by her mother generated feelings of inferior. “I can never be good enough,” was a common thought.  Recovery:\xa0Ida started saying, “I am enough” to counteract the negative thinking and empower her.   Attention-seeking breeds anxiety.\xa0Her mom needed a daily feeding of attention, affection, affirmation or admiration. When Ida was small, she learned that the quickest way to get her needs met is to fill these needs of her mom first. This is behavioral conditioning at its finest. However, Ida’s anxiety manifested as she constantly tried to anticipate and meet the needs of her mom to prevent an emotion explosion or backlash.  Recovery:\xa0The more Ida was away from her mother, the more her anxiety diminished and she was able to enjoy relief the pressure of anxiety.   Entitlement breeds shame.\xa0By nature of being a parent, Ida’s mom expected her to go along with whatever she wanted. The wants or desires of Ida was constantly overshadowed or belittled by her mom. This generated feelings of shame in Ida as she began to invalidate her own likes and dislikes in favor of her mom. Consequently, Ida became a shell believing her uniqueness and individuality was shameful.  Recovery:\xa0Ida made a list of what she liked. Taking clues from the musical lyric, “These are a few of my favorite things,” Ida made her own list of favorite items.   Selfishness breeds mistrust.\xa0In the pursuit of self-preservation, Ida’s mother justified taking advantage of others, including Ida. Ida’s childish behaviors were met with swift and severe punishment despite her mother’s consistent modeling of the same behavior. The narcissist abuses their parental role by diverting attention from their selfishness and instead highlights the deficiencies of their child. This propagated mistrust in Ida as she ascertained her mother to be an unsafe and untrustworthy person.  Recovery:\xa0Instead of trusting her mother, Ida focused on other healthy relationships in her life establishing a trust bond. A life-long friend was the perfect replacement.   Indifference breeds over responsibility.\xa0Even when Ida was excitedly talking about a new adventure, her mother would tune Ida out or divert the conversation to make it about her. Worse yet, when Ida was in pain, either emotional or physical, there was no empathy or understanding. Sadly, Ida didn’t see this as her mother’s problem, rather she assumed the responsibility that somehow, she was in the wrong. The result was an internal nagging of needing to take responsibility for the flaws or faults of others.  Recovery:\xa0Ida stopped taking responsibility for other people’s actions and allowed them to make mistakes. She realized that she is only responsible for herself.   Materialism breeds dissatisfaction.\xa0Narcissists use material possessions as a way of elevating themselves over others and controlling behavior. Ida’s mom used gifting as a way of demanding performance from Ida. If Ida did what was expected, she got elaborate and expensive gifts. But if Ida did not live up to expectations, she did not get a gift at all, including for birthdays or holidays. The use of material objects in this manner steels the joy of the item as Ida was in constant fear that the gift will be revoked for lack of performance.  Recovery:\xa0Ida decided that she didn’t want to be so materialistic, so she became minimalistic instead. This allowed her not to feel the pressure of having stuff.   Arrogance breeds inauthenticity.\xa0While Ida’s mom put on a show of snootiness to everyone outside of the home, those inside, especially Ida, saw the deep-rooted insecurity that lied beneath the façade. However, if Ida dared to expose the insecurity, she was swiftly gaslighted and made to look crazy. This taught Ida never to reveal her own uncertainties resulting in a lack of genuineness.  Recovery:\xa0Ida embraces her faults and instead of hiding them, exposed them in a humous manner. This gave her a feeling of control.    Fortunately, these childhood patterns can be reversed through an understanding of narcissism, awareness of false truths, and more accurate perception of reality. Counseling is extremely beneficial in exposing and eradicating the lies of narcissistic parenting.

But he was in denial and didn’t want to confront the painful issues that were left unresolved. What was once overlooked, minimized, explained away, or discounted is now an obvious sign of his deteriorating relationship. At first, she seemed so charming, helpful, generous, innocent, and gentle but then things turned, and an entirely different picture became apparent. Charming converted into controlling, helpful developed into obstructive, generous transformed into manipulative, innocent turned into culpable, and gentle grew into turbulent. He was exhausted and worn out but stayed. Then hopeful turned to hopeless and he was no longer able to continue in the relationship. The signs that the relationship was toxic are now clearer once Jack left. But how can he prevent this from happening in the future? Here are the 11 signs he missed.  Transfers risk.\xa0Amanda asked Jack to assume her risk over a potentially sticky matter. Her job required random drug tests and since she used the prior weekend, she asked Jack to lie about her taking a prescription drug. She was afraid she was going to lose her job and asked him to cover for her. Of course, he could lose his government job for lying about this. But that didn’t matter to Amanda. She demanded that he help using everything from crying, to manipulate, to anger, and finally bribery. Constant victimization.\xa0Amanda told stories of past relationships where she was painted as the victim and her ex’s as the villain. Her constant influx of terrible people was used as a justification for not thriving. At first, Jack believed everything Amanda said. But after a while, Amanda’s ability to cut people out of their lives and continue her victimization wore on him. Inappropriate anger.\xa0Anger is a base emotion and a catch-all for other more intense feelings such as loneliness, fear, guilt, or controlling tendencies. It can come out in inappropriate ways such as aggression (bullying), suppression (silent treatment) or passive-aggressive (biting sarcasm). Amanda’s outbursts were intense, inappropriate, and designed to force Jack into submission. Jack, who hated conflict, would regularly fold just to keep the peace. Abusive tactics. Several abusive methods surfaced such as twisting the truth, gaslighting, verbal assaults, physical aggression, or guilt-tripping. These are all unhealthy indicators. Amanda would escalate given the right time, motivation, and environment. Any indicator of abuse is a bad sign. Jack was unaware of the abuse signals. His instincts told him something was off, but his logical brain dismissed the feeling and looked no further. Gossip talks.\xa0Amanda shared secrets with Jack about other people despite a clear breach of confidentiality. Unfortunately, how Amanda spoke about others was an indicator of how she would speak about Jack. Jack never dreamed that Amanda would spill his long-kept secret about some childhood abuse, but she did. When he confronted her, she justified her actions saying that he was being too sensitive. One-way communication.\xa0Jack did most of the work maintaining the relationship. Amanda did not reach out as often as Jack did. Whereas, conversations seem to be weighted in Amanda’s direction. Amanda wanted help with her issues but then wasn’t present for Jack. This lopsidedness bothered Jack, but he did little to confront it. No responsibility.\xa0When there was a problem, Amanda refused to apologize and instead blamed things on Jack. Even when she was wrong, Amanda found ways to highlight Jack’s faults to avoid her own responsibility. She also had a lack of empathy for causing harm to Jack but expected empathy from him. Controlling tendencies. Amanda told Jack what to do and how to do it. Even when Jack followed her lead, she would still find the slightest fault with what he did. Then, Amanda would become angry when things weren’t done the way she insisted. There was little to no understanding of Jack’s differences in temperament, personality or circumstances. Absolute agreement.\xa0There was no allowance for differing opinions for Amanda. Jack had to agree with her 100% of the time even on sensitive topics such as religion or politics. Any deviation was a personal betrayal and could cause Amanda to escalate. Over time, Jack gave up his opinions in favor of hers just to avoid the tension. Dichotomous expressions.\xa0There were only two choices Amanda would give to Jack and both selections tended to be exaggerated extremes. Her choices were presented in black or white versions. There was a right way (usually Amanda’s) and a wrong way. Even when Jack would propose another alternative, Amanda would knock it down. Addictive behaviors.\xa0In the beginning, Amanda appeared to have it all together. But as the relationship continued, her abuse of substances became more apparent. When Jack would address her with his concerns, she would explode. Eventually, he learned not to speak about it.  If all 11 examples are present in a relationship, it is time to leave. Jack did this and he did not regret his decision. This is potentially an unsafe environment where the longer Jack remained, the worse things would become. However, if there are only a couple of items, be mindful watching for any other additions so an early exit might be possible before things worsen.

This leaves us questioning if Breast Implant Illness is real or not.\xa0   In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, returning guests, Courtney Bursich, shares her personal experience with Breast Implant Illness, the research she has done on why it’s happening, the effects it is having on women\'s health and what your doctor isn’t telling you.\xa0   Courtney is a brilliant Primal Health Coach who is beyond passionate about educating people on how to live healthier lives.

Send me a direct message on Instagram and I will always answer!  |  It’s easy to fall victim to our busy lives. We let our health and fitness routines get pushed aside and begin to feel so far from our best selves. We feel unenergized, unmotivated and all around not good.\xa0   Many of us reach a breaking point where we want to stop feeling this way and find the motivation to begin making positive changes in our lifestyle. We tell ourselves we are going to eat healthier and work out more. We usually stick with it for a week or two, sometimes even a month, before we allow life to get in the way. Before we know it, we find ourselves returning to our unhealthy habits and feeling less than our best again.\xa0\xa0   We tell ourselves we’ll start again tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and we still don’t have the motivation. Now we’ll start on Monday, and the pattern continues to repeat itself. Monday comes and our motivation is still lacking. At this point we vow to start again after a certain holiday, vacation or event. We fall into this vicious cycle of continuing to find excuses for putting off living a healthier lifestyle. Before we know it, a year has passed, and we are still stuck in the same place.\xa0\xa0   Something we all need to realize is that there will always be an excuse. There will never be that perfect time to start. We will always be tired and busy. Life will always be in the way if we allow it to be.\xa0\xa0   So how do we find the motivation to not only start living a healthier lifestyle, but to create a long-term healthy lifestyle and sticks?\xa0   That’s the exact question I answer in this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells. It’s time to be empowered to get and stay motivated once and for all! Time flies and next year will be here before we know it. My goal with this episode is for you to look at yourself one year from now with no regrets and instead be so proud of the person you have become.\xa0 For daily fitness, nutrition and life inspiration,\xa0as well as glimpses into my daily life, follow me on Instagram and Facebook!

With so many different labels found on food packages, from grass-fed, organic and free-range, to low-fat, high-protein and gluten-free, grocery shopping can be so overwhelming.\xa0\xa0   What do these labels mean? Which labels should we be looking for? Which labels matter and which ones don’t? Navigating these labels makes figuring out what to buy at the grocery store so confusing.\xa0\xa0   Food marketers have done an amazing job trying to trick us into believing their products are healthier for you than they actually are by using fancy buzzwords like “low-fat”. Unfortunately, most of us fall for it!\xa0   I\'ll let you in on a few little secrets these food marketers don’t want you to know: Low-fat isn’t a label you should look for, high-protein doesn’t automatically mean it’s healthy, and you don’t have to eat organic to see results.

And, how many times have you allowed your opinion of your reflection in the mirror trigger\xa0negative internal dialogue like, “I’m so fat” or “I can’t believe how ugly I look"?\xa0   Most of us probably cannot even count!\xa0It’s crazy how quickly we go from feeling confident to feeling self-conscious with just one glimpse in the mirror. It’s even more crazy how we much of our self-worth and self-confidence we place\xa0in the reflection we see in the mirror.\xa0   If this sounds like you and you are a victim of the “fat” mirror, this episode is for you!\xa0  In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, I chat with you about the negative relationship so many of us have with the mirror, which greatly effects the relationship we have with our bodies. Plus, I talk to you about how we can change our perspective on the reflection we see\xa0to successfully develop greater self-love and self-confidence.\xa0  | Do you want to feel less stressed? How about have more energy? Or, have better skin? A stronger immune system? Higher quality of sleep? \xa0 Thankfully, functional mushrooms can help! In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, the National Educator for Four Sigmatic, Danielle Ryan Broida, shares how we can use functional mushrooms to improve the quality of our health and life. Danielle, who is also a Registered Herbalist of the American Herbalists Guild, Certified Holistic Nutritionist and Instructor of Mycology, educates us on the different types of functional mushrooms and their benefits, including reishi, shitake, lion’s mane, chaga, cordyceps and more, and how we can begin including them into our daily diet. \xa0 Functional mushrooms are best known for their energy boosting benefits. We all live crazy, busy lives and spread ourselves way too thin. I don’t know about you, but I find myself refilling my coffee cup way too many times throughout the day to help me stay up to speed with my life. But, for some of us, drinking too much coffee makes us feel worse. In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, Danielle shares how we can use functional mushrooms to cut-down on the coffee we consume without compromising that boost of energy we all need. \xa0 If you are ready for the boost of energy right now, you’re going to want to try out  Four Sigmatic’s ground coffee with Lion’s Mane and Chaga. \xa0 For most of you, I think the benefit of functional mushrooms you will be most interested in is their ability to improve our skin quality! Who doesn’t want brighter, clearer and healthier looking skin? Many of us buy countless different skincare products, believing the claims on the containers that it’s going to work miracles to improve our skin quality. Although, so many of these products contain ingredients we should actually be avoiding that are detrimental to our health. So instead of intoxicating ourselves with skincare products filled with a bunch of ingredients, Danielle talks to us about how we can use functional mushrooms to improve the quality of our skin and which ones in particular work best. \xa0 My personal favorite benefit of functional mushrooms is it’s ability to reduce stress. Stress is unavoidable in our lives. No matter how hard we try, it’s going to be nearly impossible to rid ourselves of it completely. But, stress has such a major effect on our metabolism, hormones and overall health. We often think of mental stress, but physical stress from exercise and lack of sleep can cause the same negative effects on our health. There are functional mushrooms that can help sooth our adrenal glands, helping us reduce the impact stress has on our bodies that Danielle educates us on in this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells. \xa0\xa0 Do you always feel like you are running on empty? I do! For most of us, this is because we fail to get a good night’s sleep. Unfortunately, lack of sleep slows our metabolism, increase our appetite and food cravings and prevents us from being mentally sharp. Thankfully, one of the benefits of functional mushrooms is improving our sleep quality. In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, Danielle shares the amazing functional mushroom that will magically improve our sleep and how we can use add it into our diet daily. \xa0 \xa0 From experiencing chronic stress and being deprived of sleep, we weaken our immune system. But, for us to keep up with our busy lives, having a strong immune system is so important. In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, Danielle discusses how functional mushrooms helps strengthen our immune system and which kinds work best for boosting our immunity. \xa0 In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, you’ll also learn:  How to include functional mushrooms into your daily diet How often you should use functional mushrooms for full effectiveness The proper dosage of functional mushrooms The best functional mushroom for a variety of symptoms  \xa0 Up next:  47: Trending Supplements and How to Use Them  77:The Most Nutrient-Dense Superfood in the World with the CEO of EnergyBits \xa0 Find more from Four Sigmatic: Shop: us.foursigmatic.com Learn more: us.foursigmatic.com/blog Instagram: @foursigmatic\xa0 \xa0 Find more from Danielle:\xa0 Instagram:@danielleryanbroida \xa0 For daily fitness, nutrition and life inspiration,\xa0as well as glimpses into my daily life, follow me on Instagram and Facebook!

Do they celebrate your success? Do they build your character and your self-confidence? Do they bring out the best in you? Do they help you\xa0keep your priorities in check? Do they contribute to your happiness? Do they support the path you are on?\xa0   So much of our lives are\xa0influenced by who we spend our time with. Which means, if\xa0we want to\xa0become the best version of ourselves and reach all our goals,\xa0we need to surround ourselves with those\xa0who add value to your lives.\xa0   In this episode of Coffee & Kettlebells, I discuss six aspects of our lives where our friends influence us.

If you hear some crickets chirping in the background, that is because it\'s hot as balls outside, even at 11pm and there was no way I was about to record with the window closed.

This is an awesome Q&A episode where I take three great listener questions and try my best to offer some helpful advice.

I was approached by a company called MycoMeditations that wanted to sponsor the podcast. They actually were very persistent and approached me a few times about it because they were really interested in the opportunity to speak with you all. MycoMeditations is a company that hosts retreats in Jamaica that use the psilocybin mushroom, also known as the magic mushroom. It\'s an often misunderstood substance that research has shown to be an effective way to reduce the impact of treatment resistant mental illness such as depression and anxiety.\xa0 \xa0 Since this is a topic that is somewhat sensitive (psilocybin is not legal in the US), I wanted to do things a little differently. Rather than just running a short ad, I wanted to have the opportunity to dive deep and fully explore the issue. So this is a sponsored episode. MycoMeditations did pay for this interview spot, but I am approaching it just like all of the other interviews that I do on the show so that you can be appropriately informed and make your own decisions.\xa0 \xa0 My guest for this episode is Eric Osborne, who is the founder and head facilitator of MycoMeditations. He has a very interesting background in that he is a wild mushroom expert and mycologist. This enables him to approach things from a very unique angle, which you will hear in the episode. Rather than administering the mushroom in it\'s raw form, he uses a process to make measured capsules of it to have better control of the dosage.\xa0 \xa0 I really hope that you enjoy this episode. It was very interesting for me. Please have a look at the full show notes at duffthepsych.com/episode171\xa0and reach out to Eric if you have any questions after listening! \xa0 Check out MycoMeditations at their website to learn more! | Hello, friends! In this Q&A episode, I take three awesome questions that listeners sent in and try my best to give some helpful advice.

As always you can send me your questions to duffthepsych@gmail.com\xa0and full show notes are available at duffthepsych.com/episode170 | This episode is a super interesting interview with psychiatrist Dr. Anna Yusim. She is a practicing psychiatrist from a family of hyper-rational mathematicians. She was never spiritual or religious. However, about 10 years ago, she started to experience things that she could not explain and began to develop an interest in the intersection between spirituality and psychiatry. If you know me, this is not in line with my view of things, so I thought it would be super interesting to have this interview with someone who sees things from a different perspective.\xa0 Full show notes are available at duffthepsych.com/episode169 and please continue sending your questions and topic suggestions to duffthepsych@gmail.com', 'chan_desc': "This is a podcast dedicated to answering your questions about mental health, anxiety, depression, relationships, sex, and life WITHOUT psychobabble BS.

They were a series of children\'s gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist, and making choices that determine the main character\'s actions and the plot outcome. The stories were formatted so that after a few pages of reading, you\'d have a few different options, which would lead to more options, and ultimately a few different endings.  As I began intentionally designing my own life, I always felt like I was in one of those books. I am well aware that I have endless options, and I am the creator of my story. We all are.

Ruminating over situations where I could have done things differently, obsessing over why I didn\'t do things sooner, wishing I could have said something different. And do you know where that\'s gotten me? Absolutely nowhere. I love the mantra, "Control the controllable" because it reminds me that worrying about the past, or things no longer in our hands, is a waste of time. Every single thing you do today is weaving you into the woman you want to be tomorrow. Every single thought you think is shaping your future self. Every single action you take is setting up the world around you to either support you, or sabotage you. In this episode, we’ll talk about how to shift our energy from focusing on our past to creating our future. Thank you to our sponsor, Tara at Resting Boss Face!

But, as productive as I am, I cannot work all of the time. Today, I want to help you understand how I make time to rejuvenate so that I can keep working hard on my business. Social media shows us self care as girls’ weekends, spa days, or expensive salon days. So often, self care is shown as “getting away” from all of the people and places we work so hard to care for. For me, I focus on the things that fill me up, leave me feeling cared for, and energize me.\xa0 Today, I want to teach you about how I select self-care activities. Most of the self-care ideas I share cost $5 or less. I know how hard it can be to take care of yourself when you are pulled in many directions (especially with children) or don’t have tons of extra money to splurge. Spoiler alert - if you have been following me for even one week, you know I take a bath nearly every evening. The bath helps me to unwind, get away, and decompress. But, I also share several other simple, inexpensive, and relatively easy ways to focus on restoring yourself.\xa0 Self care can be anything that you do for you. Things that make you feel good about yourself and how you present yourself. They are the things that fill you up. Please share your own self care tips and ideas (especially frugal ones) with our community.\xa0 I'd love to hear what YOU do for your self care. Please share with me online.

This week, I want to talk about FINISHING. In our current, crazy lives, we often struggle to accomplish the things we start. Having so many open projects increases the clutter in our homes and our brains. As we head towards the end of the calendar year, I want you to direct your effort into finishing what you have started.\xa0 In order to finish, I want to encourage you to keep working on your current organizing project until it is done. This is not a chance to beat yourself up for failing at perfection, but I do want you to feel like your project or area is finished. I definitely do want you to feel like you have accomplished your task with a sense of excellence.\xa0 I want to give you permission to take the time you need to follow all the way through and complete your project. I want you to keep working and do the things that make your house into a home for you and your family. You do not need to keep up with anyone else’s timeline. Just keep working on YOUR area. Small, consistent steps will add up over time. As long as you keep moving towards your vision, you are making progress, and that is enough to celebrate. If you want to work on your laundry room organization for this, we offer a FREE trial week of the 100 Day Home Organization Program.\xa0 As you have the tools to get organized and actually see your progress, you will get more motivated. This will lead to a desire to spend more time getting your home organized. I recommend that you follow your organization energy and keep working on your selected area to finish your decluttering and organizing. The 100 Day Program is a lifetime membership and will be available as you can work on it. You cannot be behind when you are organizing!\xa0 I also include important information about identifying your own organizing energy and preferred style for approaching organizing. I help you figure out how to make bigger time blocks to spend getting organized if that is something you desire. And, I give you blatant permission to plan to neglect some of the tasks that are currently filling up your schedule. Finally, I help you to see how finishing one project can lead to getting your next thing done faster, and how the final result is growing your productivity for your whole life.

Thank you for all of your support over the 5 years of the podcast. If you are enjoying following me, please share with someone else and go rate and review the podcast on your favorite listening platform. On to the show! For this week’s podcast, I really want to talk about one thing that has made all the difference in being able to be as productive as I am. It’s the way I look at time. I am running a company, renovating my house, homeschooling my daughter, visiting my son at college, sustaining my marriage, and I still have time left over. An organized life gives you time. I want to teach you about how I came to view time in a unique way and share the way I currently understand time. For many people, time is an abstract concept and can be a struggle for many people to understand the passage of time. Understanding time ensures that you know how long different kinds of tasks take to complete. It helps you understand how time passes and how to schedule time for your life. When you understand time, you have time for pre-task preparation, clean up afterwards, and transportation to and from your events.\xa0 When you follow my method for understanding time, you will improve your focus. This will mean that you can finally get your home organized, or move your business into profitability, or have rooms for your other dreams and priorities. Changing your mindset about time will mean that you can schedule your time, improve your organization, and increase your productivity.\xa0 After I learned how to manage my own schedule via time blocking, I also learned how to manage other people to have them take some of my house tasks off of my plate. And then, I used those same skills to grow my team here at Organize 365. Adding on other people allowed me to increase my capacity. I could give directions and oversee them, but I was freed up from physically doing tasks. Here are some prior episodes where I share my own learning about how to delegate tasks to others. I like to say that I get my machines and people working first thing in the morning, and then, I do my tasks for the day. I have also included some episodes that help you batch your tasks into time blocks to make your work more productive.  Episode 65 - How to Outsource Your Household Tasks  Episode 89 - 10 Working Mom Hacks for a More Productive Week Episode 128 - How to Hire Household Help Episode 210 - Changing Your Focus From Money to Time Episode 246 - Maximizing Your Time: Dividing Your Week in Half  Episode 261 - My Personal 7 Year Transformation |  On Wednesdays, I will be sharing the challenges, progress, missteps, and triumph of women just like you who are progressing along their organizing journey.

I want to see you succeed and reach your goals. But, I hear from many of you, and you share that you have some real challenges. It is not a lack of time. It is not a lack of goal setting. It is not a lack of knowledge. Distraction is keeping you from achieving your goals and dreams. Distraction is stealing your ability to focus. The ability to FOCUS is what will actually change your life. Today on the podcast, I want to share with you my own teachers for learning how to concentrate, focus, and improve your productivity. Keys to achieving your goals:  Plan your goals (and shorten your timeline) Go PRO Focus. Eliminate distractions.  I am multi-passionate and I think I can successfully multitask. I am the queen of distraction and procrastination. I have been working on my focusing skills for YEARS. Consistency in your behavior builds your trust in yourself and your capabilities. I want to show you how you can practice focusing over a long time so that you can build up your endurance.

I want to be honest about that up front so that you can be aware of that.\xa0 Even if you haven't experienced trauma or you're not one of the many, many women who have been raped or had abortions, come into this conversation with headphones, first of all, for your little ones to not hear, and with an open heart because there's so much goodness in here. I'm really honored that I get to air this conversation on my podcast. Everything we talk about in this episode can be found HERE: alliecasazza.com/shownotes/121 | I get a lot of questions about how my family—especially my kids—feel about minimalism, my business, and how we live simply. I’ve had a lot of requests for a family-style interview. And I’m so excited for this episode because I’m sitting down with my ten-year-old daughter, Bella, and we’re having a fun girl-talk about our family, our way of living, and what she thinks about it all. Plus, you’ll get to hear a little bit about the business she’s starting as well. This is going to be so fun! Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/120 | I was so excited to share this with you guys that when I recorded this episode I actually streamed it live on social media. I want to talk to you guys about the power in 15 minutes. I started doing these little 15 minute “resets” and they are total game-changers! How many times have you been going about your day and you feel like things are just not going well? You’re bickering with your spouse, your kids are acting crazy, the house feels like a total crap show and you’re really frustrated? You want to hit that reset button, but you also feel like you don’t have the energy to do that because you’re tired, drained and it’s going to get undone anyway.  This 15-minute reset hack is going to pull you out of that negative spiral so you can take action and change the situation. I really think this can be applied to just about anything and everything. So, let’s jump in and talk about it!\xa0  Everything I talk about in this episode you can find HERE: alliecasazza.com/shownotes/119 | Everyone has low days when you just feel tired, weary, lackluster, or defeated. In this episode I’m talking about how to deal with life when you’re in a slump. I want to be really honest with you and share practical things that you can do when you’re feeling that way. I hope that this helps you guys, that you feel like you could come back and listen to this to get some inspiration when you're really feeling uninspired. Let’s jump in!\xa0 Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/118 | I want today’s episode to be a perspective shift for you guys. It's a really, really simple thing you can do to set yourself up to have a better day: Don't check your phone first thing in the morning. When you open your phone in the morning and you’re looking at your text messages, or your Instagram, or opening your email, you’re automatically giving away your power. In this episode I’m going to explain what I mean by that. There are habits that you need to break when it comes to your phones in order to set yourself up to have a better day. Let’s dive in!\xa0 Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: alliecasazza.com/shownotes/117 | This episode is a little different. It is actually the audio from a live class that I led on social media. And it is jam packed with some serious value. I’ve got everything that you would need for the back-to-school season and beyond. This episode is about systems, organization, and a streamlined, simplified approach to handling incoming paperwork, email systems, extracurricular activities, routines & rhythms, meal planning, and how you decide what is worth your time and what isn't. So, whether you have school-aged kids or not, this should be helpful!\xa0 Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/116 | This episode is fun to share. I don't try to simplify everything, but sometimes when something is taking a lot of time or feels a little bit too much, I'll ask myself, “How can I simplify this?”. I thought it'd be fun to see the “bloopers” side of simplifying because there are definitely some things that I've tried that I thought would simplify my life that just didn't. In this episode I’m sharing some of those things and talking about what I learned and how I adjusted. So, let's jump in! Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/115 | This is a sort of follow-up episode of one of the most popular episodes that I've ever done for The Purpose Show called “How My Morning Ritual Is Changing My Life.” I used to be really religious about doing my morning ritual. It was such a life-giving time for me. Then some things changed and my mornings looked different. This new episode is about how some things have shifted for me, what I've learned, and what my morning ritual looks like today. Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/114 | This episode is actually the audio from a live stream that I did a while back about the quote “The grass is greener on the other side because it’s fake.” The response I got on this was so overwhelming. A lot of people found it really raw and impactful. Most people loved it, but it ruffled a few feathers too. This is one of those messages that needs to be shared and spread to the masses because it's so important. It’s so key, so impactful, and such a perspective shift. I’m excited for you to listen! Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/113 | I think social media can be such a waste of time and on those same platforms where so much time is wasted, I love creating spaces that are intentional and inspire you to be better. I have a free Facebook group that’s really big, really fun, really engaged. It's an attachment of this podcast, a place where we discuss episodes. Discuss abundant life, simplicity, and intentional living for mothers and women of all types. It's such a cool place. Once a month in that group, I do what is called an Allie Chat where I pull somebody out from the community there and we go live together. There was an Allie Chat recently with a woman named Christina who is just a gem. She asked such amazing questions about her motherhood. I loved the conversation we had and the audience loved the answers that I gave. It was such a powerful Allie Chat and I knew that I had to use it as an episode for The Purpose Show. Everything I talk about in this episode can be found HERE: http://alliecasazza.com/shownotes/112", 'chan_desc': 'Mom life: we’re surrounded with the message that it’s the tired life, the no-time-for-myself life, the HARD life. And while it is hard and full of lots of servitude, the idea that motherhood means a joy-less life is something I’m passionate about putting a stop to. I’m on a mission to help you stop counting down the minutes till bedtime (at least most days). I want you to stop cleaning up after your kids’ childhood, and start being present for it - start enjoying it. I believe in John 10:10, that we are called to abundant life, and I know mothers are NOT excluded from that promise. Join me in conversations about simplicity, minimalism, and lots of other good stuff that leads to a life of less for the sake of enjoying more in motherhood.

We have the opportunity to reclaim an aspect of our inner compass this month in a very strong and powerful way. We need only take the first step toward this reclamation for the balance to begin to restore.

It is the two month anniversary of the podcast, and we are officially back from break with a new episode lineup, and lots of exciting announcements (Email Challenge, Brand new Tarot course, and more!)The theme of August is Transformation. It is a profoundly powerful cycle, one that has the capacity to totally change our lives. July’s Eclipse portal took us out into the void of the unknown, confronting us with all of the systems, beliefs and constructs of our lives that are no longer working for us. Now we get to come back to the world and shift from an internal knowing to an external reality.We cannot have an external shift before the internal work has been done. It has been a frustrating cycle for many of us, because the external and internal have not matched for so long. August is where that will begin to change. The transformation in August is powerful. It is a lasting change, one that will likely move very quickly. It is wise to be gentle with yourself, prioritize nourishment and pleasure, and trust your knowing.

As usual this episode is about clearing confusion, breaking down the science and giving you practical tips to walk away with that hopefully allow you to lead a healthier, more sustainable & happier lifestyle.Specifically I cover: • Recent headlines about the dangers of \'fake\' or \'mock\' meats • Formula 1 Driver Romaine Grosjean\'s comments about a vegan diet & endurance performance • A recent article in the Environmental Change Journal that was covered in a somewhat misleading fashion by Huff Post • Tips for building a health plant based dietOf course, I could talk about building a plant based diet for hours and hours so what was covered in this episode is a condensed version that really focusses on some of the top principles and myths about a plant based diet that I would like you to be across in order to set yourself up for success.Resources/References: • Article on Salt in Alternative Meatsthat I wrote on plantproof.com • Romaine Grosjean comments • Article on the plant focussed diets and their environmental impact in the Environmental Change Journal • Huff Post article "Why Going Vegetarian Isn\'t Necessarily The Best Diet For The Planet" • The healthy vegan Plant Proof Pyramid • Climate Change Blog • Blood Test Tips For Vegans BlogPlant Proof X Journey RetreatFor more information on the October 4-10th Plant Proof X Journey Retreat please visit here.The retreats are an incredible week - a mix of exercise, connecting with like-minded people, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, delicious plant-based meals and snacks, massages and plenty of downtime to relax by the pool or explore the local area.Hope you enjoy the episode friends.

In this rather fluid exchange Drew and I cover everything from the manipulation of science to produce favourable outcomes to confusing and oversimplified messages from people of influence on social media.Specifically we cover: • How Drew\'s transition to a plant based diet has played out since Episode 62 • Dr Mark Hyman\'s confusing promotion of an extremely conflicted study on the "reversal of diabetes" • Sarah Wilson\'s claims about methane and the impact of animal agriculture on climate change • Why the "If It Fits Your Macros" & "Calorie Deficit" ideologies are an oversimplification and how it is possible to actually look and feel good at the same time (It\'s not one of the other) • Good and bad foods - have we become too soft? • The stigma associated with different types of Diabetes and associated sensitivity with regards to using \'diabetes\' as an umbrella term. • and much moreI hope you found this to be an interesting episode - I certainly did. Literally a conversation Drew and I would have in private. An unscripted exchange with no holding back. As I allude to throughout in conversation I think it\'s important to note that just because I may hold a differing opinion to someone that doesn\'t mean I dislike them or want conflict. I am open to sitting down with any of the people mentioned, or others, to further discuss these ideas and flesh them out with the best available science we have. If we want to expand our minds we need to take these conversations to places where they are a little uncomfortable and I think we got there in this episode - I look forward to doing it in the future and hopefully having some of these proponents of diets like the Ketogenic, If It Fits Your Macros or the Carnivore Diet on the show. I realise some of you may be thinking don\'t give them the platform but in a controlled manner, if they do not have the fundamental science to support their argument, which I certainly havent been able to find, then ultimately all I see happening is an agenda revealing itself.RESOURCES/REFERENCES:For more information on the October 4-10th Plant Proof X Journey Retreat please visit hereThe retreats are an incredible week - a mix of exercise, connecting with like minded people, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, delicious plant based meals and snacks, massages and plenty of down time to relax by the pool or explore the local area.Studies on plant based nutrition and diabetes management or risk:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682911/https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2738784https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560078/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339401https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29948369https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873779https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/2/189Dr Michelle McMacken & Shivam Joshi\'s response to the Hallberg article that Mark Hyman spoke about:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682911/The highly conflicted Sarah Hallberg clinical study that was promoted by Dr Mark Hyman:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520897/Hallberg conflict of interests:"S.J.H. is an employee and shareholder of Virta Health, a for-profit company that provides remote diabetes care using a low-carbohydrate nutrition intervention, and serves as an advisor for Atkins Corp.

Yes, that\'s right, the first episode without a guest. Just you and me.In this episode I cover: • Why I took a short break from the podcast • The first iteration of a new direction for the show • My time in Bali • Sydney\'s newest plant based restaurant Eden Bondi • The recent media headlines about vegans needing to be careful about choline deficiency and headlines about vegetarians and stroke risk. For both of these I walk through what was reported and what the science actually says.This slightly new format which is something I intend to do between every guest episode going forward.Full blog I wrote on Choline with references can be read here: Should vegans be worried about Choline deficiency and brain health?If you are enjoying the show it would be greatly appreciated if you could leave a quick review on the Apple Podcast app.Happy listening friends.Simon • | In Episode 81 I sit down with Dr Will Bulsiewicz for Part 2 of the "Your Gut Health Questions" conversation that Will and I had while in New York. All of the topics that Dr B and I discuss were suggestions from the Plant Proof community - so firstly, thank you for contributing to this conversation by sending through such important questions.For those of you who are regular listeners you will have probably tuned into previous episodes (17, 71 & 80 ) with Dr B and therefore already know how much of a wealth of knowledge he is. Dr B is a Board Certified Gastroenterologist, having done over 16 years of medical training to become an expert in all things gut health. This is why he is perfectly positioned to help us navigate tricky gut health questions and clear up some of the confusion that exists on the internet.In this episode we cover a lot of really interesting gut health topics (below). What\'s great about this episode, and all episodes with Dr B, is that throughout the conversation he refers to the clinical science to provide evidence for his recommendations: • The Ketogenic diet, including a vegan Keto Diet, and it\'s likely affect on the gut • Dairy, probiotics, prebiotics (lactose) & gut health • Consuming whey protein with caution • Interpreting science & understanding points of relativity • IBs and fasting • Prolonged juice or water fasting • Probiotics and gut health • Bloating - what\'s normal and what does it mean? • Breakfast & gut health • How long before going to bed should your last meal be? • Smoothies &/or juices for children • Breastfeeding, infant gut health including the role of human oligosaccharides • Donor milk & infant formula • Antibiotics and gut health - how to minimise their damage? • Should we avoid gluten? • What are dangers of eliminating gluten if you are not intolerant? • Wheat sensitivity vs gluten sensitivity - have we over diagnosed gluten intolerance? • Should we be scared of phytate\'s & anti-nutrients • Benefits of soaking oats • Alcohol and the microbiome • and much moreHope you enjoy the episode friends.

I’ve seen the pain that stories can cause. If you look around you and you think about the people in your life or even the things that happen in the world, you can see that so many things occur because people are deep in their stories, and don\'t realize that they are stories.”I couldn’t agree more and I think you’ll be amazed at Krista’s insights and perspective on what really matters in life.----Please support our partners!We\'re able to keep growing and creating content for\xa0YOU\xa0because of their support.

President Barack Obama placed a phone call to Meb hours after the race.Today, Meb is Runner’s World Magazine’s“Most Influential Person In Running.”What becomes apparent in this conversation is how clear Meb is – both the way he organizes his thoughts and his framework for living.We touch on the importance of gratitude, hard work, clear goals, embracing challenges, and his spiritual framework.\xa0------Please support our partners!We\'re able to keep growing and creating content for\xa0YOU\xa0because of their support.

Cheese’s Pizza Time Theater, Catalyst Technologies, the first Silicon Valley incubator, and Etak, the first in-car navigation system.In the process, he pioneered many of the workplace innovations that have made Silicon Valley a long- standing magnet for creative talent.Bushnell was the first and only person ever to hire Steve Jobs, which he details in his 2013 book, Finding the Next Steve Jobs.His latest startups are ModalVR, which offers wireless, multiplayer VR entertainment systems for turn-key commercial use, and X2 Games, an independent game publisher focused on Blockchain Technology.A true icon of the digital revolution, Bushnell was named one of “50 People Who Changed America” by Newsweek.Currently a biopic about Bushnell, tentatively titled “Atari”, was acquired by Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company and is in pre- production.Nolan is an absolute legend and I can’t wait for you to learn from him.--------------Please support our partners!We\'re able to keep growing and creating content for\xa0YOU\xa0because of their support.

Update on the Alcohol is Sh!t book!\xa0 Pick up your copy on Amazon September 7, 2019!\xa0 On today’s episode Paul talks about how there is always a ‘plan B’.\xa0 Plan A…aka the way we want life to work out, the way we hoped things were going to work, actually work out 0% of the time.\xa0 Everyone has these hiccups.\xa0 The fact that you are listening to this podcast means you are already into plan B.\xa0 Most people that have a goal to move into an alcohol-free life have a plan A, which looks something like this…quit drinking and never look back.\xa0 It doesn’t matter how many plans you have because we now have hundreds of plans to chose from.\xa0 You don’t have to go out looking for your plan, schedule some down time and let the plan come to you.\xa0 SHOW NOTES \xa0 [8:33] Paul introduces Sarah.\xa0 \xa0 Sarah is 44 years old and is from Vancouver, WA.\xa0 She is engaged to be married and has no kids.\xa0 Sarah is a chiropractor.\xa0 For fun Sarah loves anything that has to do with health, she loves to exercise and go on long walks with her fiancé.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 [10:00] Give us a background on your drinking. \xa0 Sarah had her first drink when she was 12 years old.\xa0 She didn’t drink heavily from that point on but her drinking really escalated when she started working in the restaurant business while attending the University of Texas.\xa0\xa0 She was 22 years old at this time.\xa0 At the age of 17 Sarah got a DWUI.\xa0 \xa0 From the age of 22 her drinking got worse.\xa0 When she was 30 years old, she found herself calling in sick to work because she was hungover.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 [12:00] So you decided to have a change of location and profession? \xa0 Sarah says it was one of the best decisions she made, but that looking back it was her thinking that she needed to get out of her current environment.\xa0 She started chiropractic school and took her drinking right along with her.\xa0 \xa0 Her drinking continued to escalate and she ended up missing a really significant clinical entrance exam.\xa0 She drank too much the night before and slept through it.\xa0 She wasn’t allowed to take a makeup exam and had to wait to take the exam.\xa0 This is when she first tried AA.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 [13:15] What were your initial thoughts about AA? \xa0 Initially it was awesome.\xa0 Sarah still has some really great feelings about AA.\xa0 She says she’ll never forget when she walked into her very first meeting and a man telling her she never had to drink again.\xa0 Sarah says that was a lightbulb moment for her.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 [14:00] Bring us up to speed from 32 years old to 44.\xa0 \xa0 Sarah had on and off sobriety attempts during that time, ranging from 6 months to 2 years.\xa0 And she says that, of course, her life always got better.\xa0 She was questioning if she was an alcoholic because she could stop at a couple drinks, sometimes.\xa0\xa0 But she realized that her drinking always had consequences.\xa0 She decided, along with her fiancé, to quit drinking.\xa0 \xa0 [16:40] What do you think you started back up after your 6 mo., 9 mo., 2 years?\xa0 \xa0 Sarah felt like she would hit a wall, that she couldn’t label herself a full-blown alcoholic so she would find herself going back out.\xa0 She would always end up back at the same place, lack of motivation, sick, tired, depressed, and a chaotic life.\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 [18:40] What effect has not drinking had?\xa0 \xa0 By day 3 Sarah noticed she was sleeping better.\xa0 She enjoys her work and being with patients.\xa0 She has her motivation back.\xa0 She isn’t waking up with guilt and shame anymore.\xa0 \xa0 [22:00] What are some of the obstacles that you have overcome in the last 41 days?\xa0 \xa0 Sarah says that around day 13 and a couple weeks ago she was hitting a wall emotionally.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0 [25:17] How has it been to have a fiancé as an accountability partner? \xa0 Sarah says it’s been really amazing.\xa0 She had to tell him a number of times that drinking was a problem for her, and when things got really bad, he finally got it.\xa0 He was willing to go on the journey with her.\xa0 It wasn’t just ‘her’ drinking, it was ‘their’ drinking.\xa0 \xa0 [28:00] What have been the challenges to do this with a significant other?\xa0 \xa0 Sarah says the first challenge was that she wanted to make sure he wasn’t stopping to drink just for her.\xa0 She says she needs the support but that she didn’t want to feel responsible for that decision.\xa0 The challenge was making sure that they both had their own ‘whys’.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 [29:00] What is something you didn’t think you’d have to work on? \xa0 Sarah thought that the problem her and her fiancé had with communicating would go away and she learned that they still needed to work on those skills.\xa0 \xa0 [29:40] Have you explored why you drank? \xa0 Sarah says she drank because she wanted to feel included and connected to other people.\xa0 She says she also drank because it got her attention.\xa0 \xa0 [30:30] What is something memorable that you have been able to do in a life without alcohol? \xa0 She has noticed that she is way more invested in her life and in her chiropractor practice.\xa0 She cares about her patients.\xa0 \xa0 [32:20] What’s your plan moving forward? \xa0 To continue on this journey.\xa0 Sarah also says her love for reading has returned.\xa0 \xa0 [33:30] Rapid Fire Round \xa0  What is a lightbulb moment you’ve had on this journey?  \xa0 All of a sudden, I’m noticing the world around me.\xa0 \xa0  Is there anything you would have done differently when quitting drinking?  \xa0 This time, no.\xa0 It has all gotten me here. \xa0  What is your favorite alcohol-free drink?  \xa0 Lately my fiancé and I have been making virgin Bloody Mary’s.\xa0 \xa0  What is your favorite resource in recovery? \xa0\xa0  \xa0 As of now it is Café RE.\xa0 It really is a safe environment for me to connect with people.\xa0 \xa0  What’s on your bucket list in an alcohol-free life?  \xa0 We want to travel to Germany.\xa0 I have never really wanted to travel and now I do. \xa0  And what parting piece of guidance can you give to listeners?  \xa0 The biggest thing I was afraid of was that I was going to miss out on something, and none of that is true.\xa0 \xa0  You might have a drinking problem if...  \xa0 You wake up somewhere that you never would have been if sober.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Upcoming retreats: Asia Adventure – January 20-31, 2020 You can find more information about this event here \xa0 Resources mentioned in this episode: \xa0 \xa0 Connect with Cafe RE- Use the promo code OPPORTUNITY for your first month free Sobriety Tracker iTunes  Sobriety Tracker Android Sober Selfies! - Send your Sober Selfie and your Success Story to info@recoveryelevator.com \xa0 “Recovery Elevator – It all starts from the inside-out.” | Joy took her last drink on July 12, 2014.\xa0 This is her story. Update on the Alcohol is Sh!t book!\xa0 Launch date, September 7, 2019, is less than a month away!\xa0 On today’s episode Paul talks about the phrase ‘spontaneous sobriety’.\xa0 What is it?\xa0 What does it mean?\xa0 Spontaneous sobriety means quitting drinking without any formal treatment such as rehab, inpatient treatment, or out-patient treatment.\xa0 12-step programs are not formal treatment due to the fact you can go when you want, work with, or without, a sponsor, and there is not a formal way to work the steps.\xa0 The majority of people get sober without formal help.\xa0 According to the NESARC about 50% of all people that recovered from alcohol dependence did so completely on their own.\xa0 So how does one spontaneously ditch the booze?\xa0 The listen to their body, read books, listen to podcasts, attend 12-step meetings, read blogs, talk to their therapist, join online recovery groups (like CaféRE), etc.…\xa0 You talk about it; you burn the ships.\xa0 SHOW NOTES \xa0 [10:40] Paul introduces Joy.\xa0 \xa0 Joy was born and raised in the suburbs of southeast Michigan and she moved to Connecticut about 15 years ago.\xa0 She is 42 years old, has been married for almost 15 years, and has 2 sons.\xa0 For work Joy is a holistic nurse practitioner, sober and grey area drinking coach, and a dance teacher.\xa0 She enjoys dancing, yoga, being outside, and reading.\xa0 \xa0 [17:40] Give us a background on your drinking. \xa0 Joy started drinking pretty regularly in her teenage years.\xa0 There was drinking in her household so it felt like the natural thing to do.\xa0 During high school there were binging and blackout moments.\xa0 Before college she had a rock-climbing accident, where alcohol was involved, which resulted in her having to change her direction in college from dance to healthcare.\xa0 She continued to drink heavily in college and got a DUI when she was 20.\xa0 \xa0 [18:35] Whne you got that DUI was there a concern? \xa0 Joy says it was a terrifying experience.\xa0 She had to spend the night in jail, in a very big correctional facility.\xa0 After the DUI Joy felt like she could still continue to drink, she just needed to be smarter about it, like not drive.\xa0 \xa0 In her 30s it became more apparent that her drinking was a problem.\xa0 There was more morning after conversations with her husband.\xa0 She tried moderating, only drinking on the weekends, but was unsuccessful.\xa0 \xa0 [19:50] You mentioned that your husband commented that your drinking doesn’t make sense, can you explain that? \xa0 She says here she was, done with graduate school to be a nurse practitioner, she was a yoga teacher and really holistically health minded, but at the same time drinking heavily.\xa0 She also would smoke cigarettes when she drank.\xa0 It was like the two Joys didn’t compute.\xa0 There was the highly functioning Joy going to her job at the hospital and teaching yoga classes, and then there was the Joy that was drinking everyday and smoking.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 [22:15] Bring us up to speed, did the other shoe drop? \xa0 Joy says it did.\xa0 She was 30 pounds heavier; her health was not doing well; her depression was not being treated.\xa0 But Joy says it was really when she was home with her two young children and one of them asked her to hand him his toy.\xa0 She asked him what one and he said, “It’s the one behind your wine glass.”.\xa0\xa0 This rocked Joy’s world.\xa0 It was one thing for her to be home drinking wine while taking care of her young children, it was something else that one of them knew it.\xa0 \xa0 [24:35] What did you do after that?\xa0 \xa0 Joy says she did what everyone thinks they have to do; she went to AA.\xa0 She was 37 years old.\xa0 She says she had issue with when you go to AA you have to stand up and introduce yourself and proclaim that you’re an alcoholic.\xa0 At this time Joy wasn’t sure she was an alcoholic, but she knew she had to do something and AA was all she could think of.\xa0 Standing up and admitting that she was an alcoholic in front of a group of strangers was cathartic for Joy.\xa0 It allowed her to take the next step forward which was addressing what she was going to do next.\xa0 \xa0 [27:00] What happened after that?\xa0 \xa0 Joy went to AA for a little while, got a sponsor that was really helped her get through the first few weeks of being AF.\xa0 But Joy wasn’t drawn to AA, she didn’t find the positivity, or forward movement, she was hoping to find.\xa0 \xa0 So, Joy turned to the internet and started looking for other recovery avenues that were geared towards women.\xa0 She found Woman for Sobriety, which is a different self-help program.\xa0 There weren’t any meetings local to Joy so she started participating in online chat meetings.\xa0 After she had a year of sobriety she applied and became a moderator of meetings for them in her town.\xa0 \xa0 [30:30] What was it like going through the first couple social events alcohol free? \xa0 Joy learned that she definitely had some social anxiety, it was stressful, and she felt awkward.\xa0 She says she took a lot of things off of her social calendar.\xa0 She instead filled her time with other things, and instead of focusing on what she was not doing anymore she was focusing on what she was doing.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 [34:20] What are some of the things that have been removed from your life since you quit drinking? \xa0 Joy says that there have been some friendships and there were some activities, such as concerts, that she gave up for a while, but has since returned to enjoying in sobriety.\xa0 She has been careful with what she has allowed back into her life with her main focus now being a parent and her family.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 [38:10] What are some of the themes you have encountered in the last 5 years?\xa0 \xa0 The first year Joy was just dedicated on getting the moments.\xa0 Year two was being OK with things as they were.\xa0 Year 3 and 4 were similar to year 2, but Joy was stepping out more into experiences that may have been a little scarier, being a little more daring and finding great encouragement through those accomplishments.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 [41:20] Talk to us about being a grey area drinking coach. \xa0 Joy says the grey area is the area between rock bottom and not drinking at all.\xa0 \xa0 [46:50] Rapid Fire Round \xa0  Worst memory from drinking?  \xa0 Having my friends stay home with my kids while I drove myself to the hospital because I thought I had given myself pancreatitis because I drank too much.\xa0 \xa0  What is your plan moving forward?

On today’s episode Paul talks about the DUIs he didn’t get.\xa0 For those of you that may not know what a DUI is…it is Driving Under the Influence, with a BAC that is higher than .08.\xa0 Those missed DUIs, going all the way back to one in 2006, in which he was following behind a friend that was drunk behind the wheel, rolled his vehicle and passed away with a BAC of .33…were a contributing factor in Paul telling himself he didn’t have a drinking problem.\xa0 He told himself he didn’t have a drinking problem because he didn’t have any DUIs.\xa0 Paul has said, ‘the only line you can cross, but cannot come back from, is death’.\xa0 He hopes that Adrian’s story can help save the life of someone listening to this podcast.\xa0 \xa0SHOW NOTES \xa0 [16:05] Paul introduces Tiffany.\xa0 \xa0 Tiffany is originally from Connecticut but has been in Maryland for the last 10 years.\xa0 She is a property manager and a licensed captain.\xa0 She is 35 years old, single and has no kids.\xa0 She enjoys hiking and recently has discovered she likes to macramé, and has been doing a lot of that.\xa0 DIY crafts and projects around her house bring her joy.\xa0 \xa0 [18:15] Give us a background on your drinking. \xa0 Tiffany started dinking when she was in 7th grade.\xa0 Drinking was the not the norm for her family or in her household growing up.\xa0 It wasn’t until she was in junior high and spending more time at friends’ houses that she was exposed to drinking being the norm.\xa0 Jr. high and high school was a lot of binge drinking on weekends.\xa0 Towards the end of high school Tiffany was more interested in being at work, she was working at a horse farm, and partying with her friends than being at school.\xa0 Work and partying became her priority and school was at the bottom of the totem pole.\xa0 She says she was a big pothead and felt that she could take, or leave, alcohol.\xa0 \xa0 [20:50] When did you reach the moment when you couldn’t take it, or leave it?\xa0 \xa0 In 2006, when Tiffany was 21, she left everything behind and moved to New Zealand to work on a schooner.\xa0 \xa0She says that is when the switch happened.\xa0 Wine was everywhere.\xa0 She started to think of drinking as a reward for having a hard day, rather than just something she would binge on.\xa0 \xa0 [22:45] Talk to us about the years between 21 and 34. \xa0 While on the schooner they went through a bad hurricane during a voyage.\xa0 Tiffany says it was terrifying, and it was at that time her drinking shifted from drinking as a reward for a hard day, to drinking to get out of her head.\xa0 She says she came home from that experience different, and that it is still something she is working through.\xa0 \xa0 It was at this time she was drinking to not feel her feelings, and she started to isolate rather than drink socially.\xa0 In 2007 she moved to Baltimore and moved in to a neighborhood that was filled with bars, making it easy for her to drink and not be questioned.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 [26:00] Get us up to speed closer to your sobriety date. \xa0 Between 2009-2012 not a lot really happened.\xa0 Tiffany says her drinking stayed about the same, she was still isolating amongst her group of drinking friends.\xa0 In 2014 she got into a relationship, that didn’t work out, but it was the first time she had ever heard someone refer to her as an alcoholic.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 [26:45] What was it like hearing that? \xa0 Up until that time she says she had had a lot of nights that she regretted but that this was the first time she felt embarrassed.\xa0 This prompted Tiffany to lean into her isolation and she let all the self-negative talk that she had for herself beat her down.\xa0 \xa0 In 2017 she was so depressed and isolating that she was afraid to leave her house unless it was for work.\xa0 Because she couldn’t control her drinking, she felt like she was failing in everything other than work.\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 [28:44] You said you knew you didn’t want to drink, but that all you knew was a life with drinking…talk to us about how that felt.\xa0 \xa0 It was insanity.\xa0 A snapshot of what felt like a normal day for Tiffany involved her waking up with a hangover, feeling like hell, getting herself together for work and then crying the whole way to work because she did not want to go home, because she did not want to drink again that night.\xa0 Her anxiety was crippling and things just didn’t get any better.\xa0 She lived like that for 3 years.\xa0 \xa0 [30:20] What tipped the scales? \xa0 November 2017 Tiffany says she was at her bottom and she came across the Recovery Elevator podcast.\xa0 She hit play and binge listened to the episodes for a solid 2 weeks.\xa0 \xa0 [33:55] What happened between November 2017 and July 2018? \xa0 Tiffany signed up for the RE Facebook group in June 2018 and made it 30 days AF.\xa0 On day 31 she walked into a store, thinking, “I got this”, and bought 5 bottles of wine and drank for 5 days.\xa0 She then decided she was done, drank all the alcohol in her house, and on July 14th 2018 had her last drink.\xa0 \xa0 [44:00] So you got sober outside of AA? \xa0 Tiffany says that 12 step meetings are not for her, at least not right now.\xa0 She finds her peace and healing when she is outside of the rooms.\xa0 Knowing that she does need to talk to people and dive into some things she did start talk therapy.\xa0 \xa0 [45:56] What’s on your bucket list?\xa0 \xa0 The Asia trip is definitely being added.\xa0 Tiffany says she just wants to be happy.\xa0 \xa0 [47:47] Rapid Fire Round \xa0  Worst memory from drinking?  \xa0 My 18th birthday.\xa0 I got so drunk I fell down the side of a mountain and my friends had to drive me home.\xa0 \xa0  When was the moment you knew you needed to quit drinking?  \xa0 That is a toss up between when I heard my ex say I was an alcoholic and when I started listening to this podcast. \xa0  What is your plan moving forward?  \xa0 Keeping connection and staying social. \xa0I’m making the point to keep networking.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0  What is your favorite resource in recovery?  \xa0 Definitely Recovery Elevator podcast and the Café’RE group.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0  In regards to sobriety what’s the best advice you’ve ever received?  \xa0 That it’s ok not to have perfect day.\xa0 \xa0  What parting piece of advice can you give to listeners?  \xa0 If you think you have a problem you probably do.\xa0 \xa0  You might have a drinking problem if...  \xa0 At the age of 15 you realize that if you only take shots, you don’t feel full, so you can drink more.\xa0 \xa0 Upcoming retreats: Bozeman Retreat – August 14-18, 2019 Asia Adventure – January 20-31, 2020 You can find more information about these events here \xa0 Resources mentioned in this episode: Honey This episode is brought to you by the smart shopping assistant Honey.

[13:31] Give us a background on your drinking. When Daz was 13 he had his first drink, and first drunk.\xa0 At the age of 15 he was introduced to smoking pot which very quickly became a daily thing.\xa0 An honor roll student until his senior year of high school, when other drugs were introduced, and things really started to nosedive.\xa0 Daz didn’t start drinking regularly until he was 19.\xa0 It then quickly became a daily thing, helping him come out of his shell and be more social.\xa0 It became a staple that stuck with him through his 20s.\xa0 Daz hit his rock bottom on April 20, 2005.\xa0 He had gone through a really dysfunctional relationship and his life had completely veered off the path that he had expected.\xa0 He was ready to throw in the towel on life.\xa0 Daz called his parents at 2AM and told them he didn’t know what to do, that he thought he wanted to just go and finish it off.\xa0 His parents got him to come home and that was his first attempt to get sober. It lasted a couple weeks, through the Christmas holidays, and he attended his first AA meetings while there.\xa0 When he got back to Vancouver things went back to the way they had been for about another year.\xa0 He was struggling to get by, working in bars and drinking on the job.\xa0 Found himself in legal trouble and soon couldn’t pay his rent.\xa0 Daz says he was one step away from living on the street. [19:00] That was early 2007, bridge the gap for us.\xa0 Daz entered a 2-month treatment center and says that was the beginning of him starting to stand up and dust himself off.\xa0 It gave him time to think about what he was going to do with his life.\xa0 He worked in the fitness industry for a couple years. He started to slide back into drinking but had enough of a foundation at this time, and had left some of the other drugs behind, that things were starting to get on the right path.\xa0 He moved from the fitness industry into the software business and started performing music in the evenings.\xa0 This gave him something to be excited about and even though he was still drinking he now felt he had a purpose. Daz met his wife 7 years ago, 1.5 years later they had their first baby, and 2-3 years ago he went to the doctor and was told he had a fatty liver.\xa0 [21:55] What happened next? He now has his 2nd baby and a fatty liver.\xa0 His doctor told him if he didn’t stop drinking, he would be dead in 10 years.\xa0 That was the motivation Daz needed.\xa0 He had gone through the 12 steps of AA while in the treatment center but just never felt like that was for him.\xa0 What he found was something called, Neuro Recover, which is an IV treatment where the person is hooked up to an IV for 8 hours a day, for 10 days.\xa0 He says he soon realized that being sober is not just about not drinking, it’s about rebuilding your body.\xa0 After a few months Daz went back ‘out’.\xa0 When he was ready to try again, he came with more of a plan and was going to include community.\xa0 He did the IV treatment for 3 days.\xa0 On day 5 he was having back and leg pain, anxiety, and feeling frustrated.\xa0 Daz says he was almost ready to go get alcohol.\xa0 Instead of going to the store for alcohol he recalled reading that L-glutamine can help with alcohol cravings.\xa0 Having some in his cupboard he drank some and says that instantly the craving was gone.\xa0 Daz started attending SMART Recovery soon after.\xa0 [32:32] What are your qualms about AA? Daz says his biggest qualm is the powerless aspect.\xa0 He feels to overcome addiction you need to be empowered.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 [39:16] What would you say to someone looking to get sober, that has tried AA, and is looking for something else? Daz would suggest the SMART Recovery community, RE Café’ Facebook groups, L-glutamine.\xa0 He would tell them to stay connected with people, and that diet is important.\xa0 [44:14] What are your thoughts on relapse? Daz says he doesn’t think relapse is a bad thing, that it is just part of the process.\xa0 He says people shouldn’t be too negative about it as long as you are continuing on and learning to understand yourself, the body, and how it works.\xa0 [47:41] Where does spirituality come into play on this journey? Daz is not a religious person, per-se, but he thinks it’s really important for people to stop and look inward, and turn other things off.\xa0 [48:50] Rapid Fire Round  Worst memory from drinking?  Driving down the road and not being able to keep his hands on the steering wheel because he was shaking so badly.  What is your plan moving forward?  My plan moving forward is to finish my website that I have been working on, like I said, it’s EmpoweredNotPowerless.com.\xa0 Continue going to SMART meetings and I have some people that I am close to and to just continue to help each other. To continue to lead by example.\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0  What is your favorite resource?  Get yourself some glutamine, don’t leave out the supplementation part of recovery.\xa0 You’ve been killing yourself for years and your body needs to heal itself.\xa0 I would also shout out Omar Pinto and the SHAIR podcast.\xa0 Another book I would recommend is Addicted to the Monkey Mind.\xa0  What parting piece of advice can you give to listeners?  When it feels like it’s impossible, it’s not.  You might have a drinking problem if...  You need to pull over on the side of the road because you can’t control your shaking.\xa0 \xa0 Upcoming retreats: Bozeman Retreat – August 14-18, 2019 Asia Adventure – January 20-31, 2020 You can find more information about these events here Resources mentioned in this episode: \xa0 Connect with Cafe RE- Use the promo code OPPORTUNITY for your first month free Sobriety Tracker iTunes  Sobriety Tracker Android Sober Selfies! - Send your Sober Selfie and your Success Story to info@recoveryelevator.com \xa0 “Recovery Elevator – It all starts from the inside-out.”", 'chan_desc': 'Here’s an idea.

The risk of cancer, heart disease, and other ailments is very real and this episode has the science to prove it. Dr. Neal Barnard and Mark Kennedy, Esq. join "The Weight Loss Champion" Chuck Carroll to discuss this controversial research that defies the conclusions of scores of research and the World Health Organization which declared red and processed meats to be carcinogenic to humans. The group gets to the truth about red meat, including years of research showing the harmful effects of eating as little as one slice of bacon every day!

Dr. Vanita Rahman joins “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll to talk about how she overcame her own battle with obesity and why she’s sharing that experience and what she’s learned. Her journey to health began years earlier when her family immigrated to the United States from India. It wasn’t long before she began gaining weight on the standard American diet. \xa0As Chuck and Dr. Rahman discuss, weight gain is difficult for any teenager let alone one who is trying to make friends in a new country. It wasn’t until years later when her own health began to deteriorate that she turned to a vegan diet for help and it wasn’t long before she began to see results and started feeling better. She became so inspired by her transformation that she’s paying it forward with a new weight loss program at The Barnard Medical Center. Chuck is also joined by Nolan Rodman and Dr. Hana Kahleova to find out how Nolan’s transition to a plant-based diet is progressing.

That is the epiphany of a hulking gentleman who squats the equivalent of five kegs of beer or two and half full-grown panda bears. Baboumian is truly one of the strongest men in the world and he is fueled exclusively a vegan diet. On this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll goes one-on-one with Dr. Jim Loomis who is featured in The Game Changers documentary. For years he was tasked with keeping million dollar athletes healthy as a team physician for both the St. Louis Cardinals baseball franchise as well as the Rams NFL franchise. Loomis reveals the mind-boggling list of foods the average player will eat on game day and why switching their diet could improve their performance on the field. More importantly, he also details how he overcame a series of health issues after switching to a plant-based diet himself. The change was so dramatic that he was able to complete an iron man triathlon shortly after his 60th birthday! We also hear from a young man who is trying a plant-based diet for the first time. He is fairly athletic, loves to play sports recreationally, and looking for a little bit of an edge. So what will he discover?

They are on a mission to teach as many people as possible about the health benefits of a plant-based diet. And for them, it’s very personal. Bruce has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and continues to carefully monitor his health while still teaching as many people as possible. The couple speak openly and candidly about the challenges they are facing and why it’s important that they tackle them head-on with a positive attitude and unrelenting optimism.

This podcast is a place for deeper conversations about central issues of our time that affect us all. Researching my last book, Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?, it became clear to me that we need to unpack the shifts and intersections of medicine, nutrition, food systems, health and food policy, and much more. The food system is at the root of our chronic disease epidemic, climate change, poverty, social injustice, environmental degradation, economic crises, and even challenges in education and national security.The old foundations of medicine are breaking down and a new model, a systems view or Functional Medicine, is emerging at the paradigm that has the potential to reverse the chronic disease epidemic. Food and the way we produce and consume it is the nexus of most of our world’s health, environmental, climate, economic, and even political crises. We can’t stay silent about these issues any longer. That’s why I created my new podcast, The Doctor’s Farmacy. Find it anywhere you listen to podcasts (or visit drhyman.com/podcast). Thanks for tuning in! | Eating healthy is more confusing than ever. I’ve been studying nutrition for 35 years and found that even experts are confused by the science. If the people we look to for nutritional guidance keep changing their views, no wonder the rest of us are so overwhelmed!You know what I’m talking about. One day eggs are unhealthy, then the next day they are a miracle food. One year the government tells us to eat bread, pasta, and other carbohydrates as the foundation of our diet, and the next it tells us to cut carbs. The US Dietary Guidelines told us 35 years ago that all our health problems were derived from eating fat and recommended we eat fat “only sparingly.” Over three decades later, they suddenly learned fat wasn’t so bad for us.Then you’ve got the dogmatists who believe you must adhere 100 percent  to a particular plan to be lean and healthy, whether that plan be vegan, Paleo, vegetarian, Mediterranean, raw food, ketogenic, high-fat, low-fat, or omnivore.Lots of factors contribute to this nutrition confusion and contention, including misinformation, personal biases, and conflicting science. Chief among the reasons why so many people are so confused is our $1 trillion food industry that provides us with all sorts of “healthy” options— low-fat, high-fiber, whole-grain, gluten-free—that are mostly not healthy.All this confusion is enough to make you give up and just eat whatever you want, whenever you want, and in whatever quantities you want.That’s why I wrote my new book Food. What the Heck Should I Eat?. I want to help you undo all the beliefs about food that are making you fat and sick and replace them with a new understanding that will lead to health and longevity.I can’t wait to share all the information I’ve learned, so you can cut through the confusion and design a plan that helps you cultivate vibrant, abundant health. Food. comes out on February 27, 2018. You can learn more about the book, and pre-order it at foodthebook.com | Arthritis has become a 21st century epidemic, affecting 1 out of every 4 people. Even more shocking is that 30% of adults age 45-64 have doctor diagnosed arthritis.Something has changed in our environment, making all types of arthritis more and more prevalent.Inflammation is the most basic problem in all arthritis, whether it is what we traditionally call “inflammatory arthritis,” like autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis, or the arthritis most associated with wear and tear on joints over time, osteoarthritis.The traditional medical approach to these two kinds of joint inflammation is to use medications to block the inflammation process. Although these can be successful in decreasing symptoms and can in some cases prevent further joint destruction, the medications don’t get at the root cause of why you developed the inflammation in the first place.Functional medicine takes a deeper look at the causes of inflammation and gives you options for reversing the process where it starts: in the gut, in the mouth, from your food, and from the stress response.Traditionally, doctors almost never evaluate these areas when addressing joint pain, but fortunately functional medicine has the tools to do just that.In this interview, Dr. Susan Blum presents a new way to treat arthritis. In her new book, Healing Arthritis, you will learn the best food plan for arthritis, the precise supplements and dosage we recommend to reduce pain and inflammation, how to build resiliency so that life’s stressors won’t affect your health, and what your gut has to do with your arthritis symptoms. In essence, Dr. Blum gives you all the tools you need to fix your gut and heal your arthritis. I am so excited to share this interview with you. I hope you enjoy it.Wishing you health and happiness,Mark Hyman, MD | Modern industrial medicine treats disease with medication or surgery. That’s what it is designed to do, and when it comes to emergency interventions it is still the best medicine in the world. When someone comes into the emergency room with a severed leg, conventional medicine treats the problem with incredible efficacy.But when it comes to chronic illness, this approach simply doesn’t work.Here’s why conventional medicine tends to break down in the face of chronic illnesses like diabesity …Most medicine today is based on clear-cut, on-or-off, yes-or-no diagnoses that often miss the underlying causes and more subtle manifestations of illness. Most conventional doctors are taught that you have a disease or you don’t; you have diabetes or you don’t. There are no gray areas.Instead, I suggest taking a radically new and unconventional approach to treating chronic illness. Some might call this approach Functional Medicine.Functional Medicine is the future of conventional medicine–but available now. It seeks to identify and address the root causes of disease, and views the body as one integrated system, not a collection of independent organs divided up by medical specialties. It treats the whole system, not just the symptoms.In his new book, Unconventional Medicine, my friend Chris Kresser, M.S., L.Ac, discusses the challenges with conventional medicine, and why the future of medicine is unconventional. In this interview, Chris and I talk about what it takes to get to the root cause of dis-ease.I hope you enjoy it.Wishing you health and happiness,Mark Hyman, MD | Last year I experienced some serious health challenges. Recently I sat down with Mind Body Green to talk about this difficult time in my life. | My patients and readers tell me that one of the biggest obstacles they face on their path towards better health is lack of support.I always say that getting healthy is a team sport, and unfortunately, many of us are lacking the positive encouragement and supportive relationships we need in order to move toward our best selves.Psychological researcher, George Slavich, of the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies human social genomics, says that our genes can actually be turned on or off depending on our social environments. Studies show that compared to people who are socially connected, those living in isolation are more likely to suffer from viral infections and inflammation.This means that feeling socially isolated can actually make you sick!Community has been an integral part of my own journey toward better health. I have seen the power of community transform the lives of my patients and readers, and this is why, for the first time ever, my team and I are hosting the Feel Good Summit.In the summer of 2018, we’ll gather in beautiful Southern California for three days and dive deep into community, food and nutrition, stress management, movement, and much much more. My goal for the Feel Good Summit is for you to walk away with a plan to achieve your best health AND at least a few new best friends—people who can inspire you and who you can inspire too.We created the Feel Good Summit to foster community and connection all while learning how to take your health to the next level using expert guidance to create a wellness plan for you, by you.To learn more about the Feel Good Summit, visit feelgoodsummit.coWishing you health and happiness,Mark Hyman, MD | I recently got the chance to interview my friend James J. DiNicolantonio, PharmD, author of The Salt Fix, and I’m really excited to share this interview with you. I also asked James to write a few words about why low salt diets might be harmful for some, and here’s what he had to say…We are constantly being warned about the harmful effects of salt. All health agencies, government bodies, and dietary guidelines tell us to cut our salt intake to no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day (about 1 teaspoon of salt). We are told that cutting back on salt saves lives and that the amount of salt consumed by the average American (one and a half teaspoons of salt) puts you at risk. This is based on the assumption that lowering salt intake will lead to a reduction in blood pressure, and that reducing blood pressure will reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Unfortunately, we are only being told one side of the story. The other side of the story is starting to make itself heard—the New York Times, for instance, just covered a study of Russian cosmonauts that hints that there’s more to the story than we’ve been told—but that’s just the tip of the iceberg.We need to shift our fear away from salt, and focus greater attention on the more consequential white crystal (sugar). Rather than following salt restriction, we may be better off eating real food and salting to taste. – James J. DiNicolantonio, PharmD and Author of The Salt Fix. Follow on Twitter @drjamesdinic. | People always want to know what I eat and do every day to stay energized and focused with everything on my plate. I talk a lot about cutting sugar and processed carbs and eating real, whole, fresh foods, exercising, and meditating—but everyone wants to know if I walk the walk! The truth is that I have to. I have about ten jobs, two kids, a dog, a team, weeks of travel at a time… the list goes on and on. In order to keep up with this lifestyle, maintaining optimal health and an optimal brain becomes a top priority. When your brain is functioning well, you receive more opportunities and life just gets better.Unfortunately, many of us get too little good food, nutrients, light, air, water, rest, sleep, rhythm, exercise, community, love, meaning, and purpose. We’re exposed to far too much poor-quality food, stress, toxins, and allergens. The good news is that there are a few things we can do every day to keep our brain happy.To hear more tips on achieving a better brain from over 50 experts, check out the Broken Brain Docuseries. And if you liked this video, share it with your friends and family on Facebook and twitter.Wishing you health and happiness,Mark Hyman, MD | I was a thriving, young doctor with a promising career ahead of me. Then, within a short amount of time (it felt like it was almost overnight), my entire life changed. Suddenly, depression and anxiety were constant companions and I had such extreme fatigue I couldn’t even get out of bed some mornings.What was I supposed to do? Everything I did required optimal brain function. Without a healthy brain, I couldn’t see patients, do research, workout, or connect with loved ones.. I was at a loss. Discovering Functional Medicine and the power of our body to heal saved me from lifelong depression, anxiety, and fatigue.And this is just my story. Thousands of other patients and many other practitioners have their own story about how Functional Medicine empowered them to take control of their health and treat their mysterious or not so mysterious illnesses.This is why I made a docuseries about brain health. With the help of my friends, patients, and colleagues, I wanted to show you how you can take a different approach to treating brain disorders. Conventional medicine has its place in treatment, but what does it take to truly fix our brains? How can we get to the root cause of dis-ease?My docuseries will completely change the way you think about brain health, and I want to invite you to watch it.Sign up for this FREE docuseries which starts THIS WEDNESDAY.Also, chances are you know someone with a broken brain. Help to spread the message about this docuseries by sharing it with your friends and family.Let’s take back our health, together.Mark Hyman, MD | I know this might seem like a silly question, but it’s one that I had to ask myself a long time ago when I suddenly became depressed, anxious, and fatigued.The answer was quite obvious to me. Something was definitely wrong with my brain and my body. But sometimes, a broken brain is not obvious and does not show up in the form of dementia, ADD, or depression. Sometimes, a less than optimally functioning brain can show up in small ways.So many of my patients come in after months or even years of experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, anxiety, and depression thinking that these are symptoms that will just pass or that there isn’t anything that can be done about them.. Many patients don’t connect how they feel with how they eat, how much they rest and sleep, how much they exercise, how much time they make for friends and community, as well as the media and news to which they expose themselves. Once you understand these connections, you can change your approach to these important factors and to the other dozens of daily decisions you make.This is exactly what I aim to address in my new docuseries, Broken Brain. For this docuseries, I brought together over 50 health and brain experts to talk about what it takes to heal from a broken brain.In the Broken Brain Docuseries, we’ll go through a step-by-step plan to take control of your health, including how to optimize your diet for a better brain. So be sure to sign up for the docuseries and spread the word so that we can all take back our brain health together.If you have any questions about the brain, tweet me using the hashtag #housecallwithdrhyman, and maybe next week, I’ll make a house call to you.Wishing you health and happiness,Mark Hyman, MD", 'chan_desc': "Welcome to Dr. Hyman's weekly house call.

Chances are you’ve already used one of them, like 23andMe or Ancestry.com. There’s even more you can do with these services, though. Poke around online and you’ll find quite a few self-styled experts who are eager to review your raw DNA data and provide you with very specific lifestyle recommendations that will purportedly maximize your health, performance, and well-being, including specific foods to eat and avoid, exercise programs to follow, supplements to take, and more. On the other hand, you’ll also find plenty of credentialed guys and gals saying that such DNA-based plans are little more than pseudoscientific scams that won’t have any meaningful impact on your life beyond your wallet. As is often the case, the truth is somewhere in the middle, and that’s what Dr. Anthony Jay and I discuss in today’s episode. And to make it more interesting, I sent Dr. Jay my raw data from Ancestry before the episode so he could not only explain the ins and outs of genetic testing and how our DNA can affect our sleep, mood, body composition, risk of disease and dysfunction, and more, but also demonstrate what a solid, science-based DNA consultation looks like. In case you’re not familiar with Dr. Jay, he’s a scientist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota who earned his Ph.D in Biochemistry from Boston University School of Medicine and provides genetic consulting to everyone from professional athletes to special forces soldiers and everyday gymgoers and everybody in between. Dr. Jay’s also the author of the book Estrogeneration, which is all about a class of estrogen-like chemicals that are prevalent in our society and contributing to many different widespread health problems, including weight-gain, depression, infertility and many others. (And if you want to learn more about that, check out the previous interview I did with Dr. Jay on it!)

I’ve covered how to squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, break through plateaus, utilize different rep ranges, deload, and on and on. Something I haven’t talked about before, though, is kettlebell training. This isn’t because I think it’s without merit, though—it’s simply an unintentional oversight—and that’s why I invited Pat Flynn back on the show to break down kettlebell training for beginners. Why Pat? Well, he was once the youngest person to ever pass the Russian Kettlebell Certification, and he’s coached many people over the years on how to properly use kettlebells to lose fat, build muscle, and get stronger. In this episode, he delivers a fantastic kettlebells 101, including his favorite exercises for gaining muscle and improving conditioning, how to do the exercises properly, how to program kettlebell training, and more. 4:51 - What are kettlebells good for? 7:57 - What do kettlebells have to offer? 15:35 - How do you use kettlebells effectively? 19:25 - How do you program in kettlebells? 29:19 - What’s the difference between a single and double arm swing? 30:18 - What other variations are there for the swing? 47:57 - What type of technical advice do you have for kettlebell exercises? 53:36 - Where can people find you and your work?

For example, if you’re a guy, would you rather be big and “fluffy,” or smaller but ripped? And if you’re a gal, would you rather be skin and bones or lean and toned? Well, if you chose the second option, then you’re in the right place, because in this podcast, I’m going to teach you the simple science of not just gaining muscle, but gaining muscle definition. We’re going to cut through the myths and lies, too. “Clean eating” isn’t the key, and neither is exercise choice, rep ranges, or supplementation. Genetics aren’t the answer, either (fortunately!). You may not have the genetics to look exactly like your favorite Instagram model, but you don’t need singular genes to be a shining example of muscle definition. You have the same types of physiological hardware as the rest of us, and your body (and muscles) will respond fantastically if given the proper stimuli. So, if you’re ready to learn what muscle definition is, and what doesn't increase muscle definition and what does, then listen in. 3:51 - What is muscle definition? 10:22 - Do you have to eat clean to gain muscle definition? 14:42 - Do you have to do a lot of high rep training to gain muscle definition? 19:32 - Do you have to use cables and machines to gain muscle definition? 20:47 - Do you have to eat a low carb diet to gain muscle definition? 24:39 - Do you have to do a lot of cardio to gain muscle definition? 28:01 - How do you increase muscle definition? 32:48 - Do I need to take supplements to gain muscle definition?

As you can imagine, some questions pop up more often than others, and I thought it might be helpful to take a little time every month to choose a few and record and share my answers. So, in this round, I answer the following four questions:  Are bro splits optimal for muscle growth? Should you use a weightlifting belt? How long should you remain in a calorie deficit? Is intermittent fasting better for retaining muscle than traditional dieting when cutting?

Since the publication of his 2017 health and wellness book, The TB12 Method, “Touchdown Tom’s” eating habits have gone mainstream in a major way. Every major media outlet has weighed in multiple times and you can even find “I tried Tom Brady’s diet and here’s what happened” videos online. And unlike many fly-by-night celebrity diets, Brady’s has earned staying power. The main reason for this is obviously the halo effect. He’s indisputably one of the greatest and most accomplished athletes of all time, so anything he says and does is likely to be judged favorably. Moreover, Brady isn’t just a Hollywood hunk who got jacked for a superhero movie. Brady’s a world-class athlete who appears to be invincible by normal NFL standards, which many players joke stands for “Not for Long.” Due largely to the brutal nature of the game, the average NFL player lasts just 3.3 years, and many careers are cut short by torn ligaments, broken bones, severe concussions, and the like. Not Brady, though. He’s wrapping up his 19th year in the league with his 9th Super Bowl, and aside from a knee injury that sidelined him in 2008, he hasn’t suffered a major injury in his career. How has he managed to stay so healthy? Well, Brady says his unique diet has contributed to his robust health in a major way and enabled his body to endure and recover from levels of stress and punishment that would break the average person. Hence its popularity. So, what does the Tom Brady diet look like? Well, it mostly consists of plenty of fresh vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and a moderate amount of lean meats like salmon, turkey, and chicken. In other words, it sounds like your average “healthy diet” that many obesity and nutrition scientists have been advocating for the last several decades. It doesn’t stop with “eat a bunch of nutritious things,” however, which is where the controversy begins. Brady’s version of “clean eating” requires more or less only eating nutritious things and prescribes a menagerie of restrictions, including . . . - No gluten, bread, pasta, or white flour of any kind - No coffee or caffeine - No cooking oil - No potatoes, peppers, or mushrooms - No drinking water during or around meals - No eating within 3 hours of bedtime - No eating fruits with other foods In fact, once you’ve wound through all the twists and turns of Brady’s diet, as we’ll do in this podcast, you can’t help but wonder if there was any real method to the apparent madness. I mean, if you were to tear random pages out of the bestselling diet books of the last 20 years and follow whatever you found, you’d likely end up with something similar. Not only that, but thanks to the aggressive commercializing of the TB12 brand, the regimen also includes a number of Brady’s proprietary supplements and other products. All that doesn’t necessarily mean the Tom Brady diet deserves the scrapheap instead of the spotlight, though. As you’ll learn, Brady’s fastidious eating gets more right than wrong and is far superior to the average Western diet, but it’s not without major flaws and fallacies. 6:25 - What is the Tom Brady diet? 12:00 - Should I eat mostly anti-inflammatory foods? 19:16 - Should I eat mostly alkaline foods? 26:07 - Is it bad to combine food groups in one meal? 30:10 - Should I drink half of my body weight in ounces of water per day? 33:48 - Should I eat as little saturated fat and cooking oil as possible? 43:29 - Who is Alex Gurrero? 49:05 - How can I use food to optimize my body composition, well-being, and longevity? \xa0 Mentioned on The Show: Books by Mike Matthews:\xa0https://legionathletics.com/products/books/ Want to get my best advice on how to gain muscle and strength and lose fat faster?

Click here: https://www.legionathletics.com/signup/ | In this episode, I interview Tom, who found me on Youtube and used my teachings to completely change his body and life. When he first started working out, he didn’t know what he was doing with his training or diet and after a spurt of newbie gains, fell into a rut. He was also dealing with debilitating sciatica that sometimes had him crawling to the bathroom in the middle of the night and asking his girlfriend to help him put on underwear. Everything changed when Tom discovered the world of evidence-based fitness, however, and started implementing my advice.\xa0 In the span of 1.5 years, he bulked up from 160 pounds to 205 and then cut back down to a much leaner, more muscular 160 pounds. And even better, his back pain was more or less gone. He couldn’t believe it. In fact, Tom was so astounded that he decided to pay it forward by starting to share his journey and learnings on the popular website Twitch.\xa0 Now, his channel is now the most popular fitness-related hangout on the website, and every day, Tom uses it to stream workouts, answer people's questions, and share his favorite tips that have helped him build his best body ever. In this interview, Tom and I chat about his story and the many important lessons he's learned along the way, including exactly how he beat his back pain, how he optimizes meal prepping for maximum enjoyment, efficiency, and economy, and more. 9:23 - Where was your physique when you started the program? 19:29 - How many calories do you eat per day at the end of a bulk? 20:43 - How does alcohol affect muscle gain and fat loss? 25:02 - What kind of back issues did you have? 42:04 - What led you to be on Twitch? 48:26 - Do you have any tips on meal planning? 1:10:49 - Where can people find you and your work?

Whenever they feel a niggling ache or pain, they pop a pill and feel right as rain. Elbow pain from benching? No problem. Knee pain from squatting? Nothing a few pills can’t fix. Shoulder pain from overhead press? Not today. Have a bad case of DOMS? NBD, man. Take a few pills, and you’ll be able to push through workouts that might otherwise keep you sidelined. And others even take these over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers on a regular basis, just in case something starts to hurt. If you’ve read anything about these drugs, though, then you may have heard that they can also interfere with muscle growth. Some even go so far as to say that you should avoid them at all costs. It’s better to stay home and wait for your body to heal itself than to take a pill that kills your gains. Who’s right, and what should you do? That’s what you’re going to learn in this podcast. By the end, you’ll know how painkillers affect muscle growth, whether or not taking them will interfere with strength and muscle gain, and how to balance the pros and cons to get the best of both worlds.

Click here: https://www.legionathletics.com/signup/ | If you’re new to proper weightlifting, you have much to look forward to.\xa0 You’re taking your first steps in a journey that can transform not only your body but your entire life.\xa0 With every bit of muscle and strength you gain, you’re going to look a little better, feel a little better, and thrill a little more at the prospect of what else you might be able to achieve.\xa0 You have a special advantage, too—one that even the most accomplished weightlifters envy.\xa0 Whereas they have to fight tooth and nail for every ounce of improvement on the scale and bar, thanks to a quirk of physiology, you’re going to progress with relative ease. For instance, for someone like me, no matter how hard I work in the gym, the best I could possibly do over the next 12 months is maybe 30 to 35 pounds added to my key lifts and 1 to 3 pounds of muscle gain. You? Well, in just your first year of proper training, you should have no trouble increasing your whole-body strength by several hundred pounds and gaining 15 to 25 pounds of muscle (and about half that if you’re a woman). Such is the power of “newbie gains.” Notice I’ve said “proper” a couple times now, too. This is important because even if you’ve been into lifting for a while, if you’ve made little progress since starting, you too can benefit from newbie gains. In short, if you’ve yet to gain your first 15 to 25 pounds of muscle (again, for women, about half that amount), you can get there a lot faster than you might think. If you’re skeptical, I understand.  Maybe you think you’re a “hardgainer” who’s destined to stay small and weak.\xa0 Maybe you think you’ve already more or less maxed out what your physique has to offer and your only hope of getting bigger and stronger is using steroids. Maybe you just don’t know what to do in the gym to gain more muscle and strength.  Well, I have good news:  Although some people gain muscle and strength easier than others, nobody has to remain forever frail. Although we all have hard genetic ceilings for muscle and strength gain, you’re probably well short of yours. Although the art and science of training can appear hopelessly complex, all you likely need to achieve your goals is intelligent and rigorous application of the fundamentals.  I have proof, too. Through my books, articles, podcasts, and videos, I’ve helped thousands of everyday men and women build their best bodies ever, and I can do the same for you.\xa0 And I can start right here, right now, by providing you with an in-depth review of the science of newbie gains—a rather controversial phenomenon.\xa0 Some people say newbie gains aren’t really a thing because there’s nothing special occurring at the physiological level. Others say newbie gains are hit-and-miss and mostly come down to genetics. Either you have it or you don’t.\xa0 Others still say most people can benefit from newbie gains but only as complete beginners and to any sort of training. Who’s right?\xa0 The truth is if you’re new to proper weightlifting and dieting (and we’ll talk about what these look like), you’ll gain more muscle and strength in your first year than ever again.

Sign up for my free newsletter! Click here: https://www.legionathletics.com/signup/ | As fun as it can be to geek out on obscure and advanced muscle-building strategies, most people looking for advice on how to gain more muscle and strength just need to double down on the fundamentals instead. You know, compound exercises, heavy weights, progressive overload, and the like. There comes a point, though, where a basic understanding of the basics is no longer enough to keep the needle moving. Then, you should add some more advanced tools to the shed, including programming techniques like periodization, set schemes like drop and rest-pause sets, and exercise variations to address weak points. That last point—exercise variations—is what Chris Barakat and I talk about today, and specifically, how to use different types of exercises and ways of performing those exercises to maximize muscle gain in every major muscle group you train. As you’ll learn, relatively small changes to the exercises you do and how you do them can make quite a big difference in the bottom-line results. If you’re not familiar with Chris, he’s not only a member of Legion’s Scientific Review Board, he’s also a published scientist, educator, coach, and natural bodybuilder, so he’s intimately familiar with the respective needs of beginning, intermediate, and advanced weightlifters and bodybuilders. Let’s get to it! 6:51 - What is the architecture of a muscle? 9:30 - What is an alternate exercise to leg extensions that will help develop the distal part of the quads? 10:16 - Which exercises best target the upper part of the pecs? 12:55 - What are your thoughts on how different exercises impact the development of the biceps and triceps differently? 14:05 - Which exercises best target the biceps and triceps and how would you program it? 15:55 - Which exercises best target the shoulders and how would you program it? 28:06 - Which exercises best target the back and how would you program it? 39:09 - How does an alternate grip on pulls affect the back? 41:54 - Which exercises best target the hamstrings and how would you program it? 45:15 - Which exercises best target the calves and how would you program it? 49:46 - What are your thoughts on improving abs and core? 58:43 - How important is controlling the concentric and eccentric phases? 1:00:42 - Which exercises best target the glutes and how would you program it? 1:02:17 - How can people find you and your work?

As we embark on the last quarter of the year one thing that comes to mind is the approaching holiday season. For many of us, that means work parties, family gatherings, charity events and all of the things that involve interacting with a crowd. If you are in school that means the end of the semester presentations and group projects. Did you hold your breath or feel your pulse quicken or maybe even a tightening in your stomach at the thought of any of those activities? Do you dread doing any of those activities for fear of judgment or ridicule? Then you may have social anxiety. Tune in to this week’s episode to learn how to differentiate between being shy, introverted, having a common response to a social situation, and social anxiety disorder.

Are you ready to relearn what you thought you knew? This week Terri and Dom are joined by dynamic sister duo Breezy and Bobbi (the founders of Free the Cheeks) and they take us to Twerk Church. This discussion dives into what’s really up with what women are taught about sex and sensuality. A lot of us were taught about respectability politics and socialized into participating in the patriarchy based on the traumas of our ancestors. Today the ladies name the ways that we can subvert the patriarchy. We will hold space and celebrate our wombs. Breezy and Bobbi share with us how they teach women about discovering the freedoms of their body and where they learned to respect and appreciate feminine bodies. Feel the joy. Feel the community.

How many times have you felt like you were falling apart on the inside but you refused to let others see it so you would not be perceived as weak? Take a moment and think about where you learned that pattern. Chances are you are living out a narrative that is not your own. You may be operating in a space conditioned to protect your wounds...shield you from your trauma. Trauma that was caused by someone behaving in reaction to their own wounds.\xa0 In today’s episode, Terri and Dom are joined by Dr. Thema Bryant-Davis, a licensed psychologist, ordained minister, and sacred artist. She encourages us to think about our pain in ways that many of us have never considered but will definitely bring us closer to healing.

When you hear the word introvert how much does this describe you? Before you make that decision listen in as Dom dispels the myth of equating an introvert with shyness and answers whether social anxiety and introversion are equals. When, where and how you derive your energy clues you in to your introversion status. Not sure how that really applies to you? Terri and Dom will explain what the introversion/extroversion spectrum looks like and provide examples from their lives of where they fall on the continuum. Lady, you think you know Terri and Dom, but you might be surprised by how they rate their level of introversion.

In today's meditation, we attune ourselves to our deepest thoughts, needs, and desires to find our true purpose. By giving our full attention to this moment -- our breath, and our thoughts -- we open ourselves to the Universe to give us direction through our inner voice.                                The Meditation Podcast is made possible with great thanks to our subscribers on Patreon. Join our community at Patreon.com/theMeditationPodcast | We all have the capacity to experience love, through both giving and receiving. But over time past hurts and mistrusts can close our hearts to fully experiencing love. We may carry a fear of being hurt again. In turn, we become selective in how much love we give, and how much love we allow ourselves to receive from others. Restricting our hearts in this way stifles our spiritual growth — and it can even affect the body, including the heart itself.                                In this meditation, we learn to open our hearts by removing any walls we may have built. This increases our capacity to give love openly, and receive love without conditions.                The Meditation Podcast is made possible with great thanks to our subscribers on Patreon. Join our community at Patreon.com/theMeditationPodcast | As we journey through our lives, our bodies experience many forms of stress -- including danger, grief, trauma, anger, and physical injury. When we don't process or release stress it remains inside our bodies, causing tension and restricted breath. Restricted breath in turn deprives the body and blood of oxygen, which can lead to hypertension, weight fluctuation, and all sorts of dis-ease.                                In today's meditation, we use our own breathing to cleanse our physical and emotional bodies. Using simple extension of the breath and release of the body through breath, we can significantly lower stress for a healthier life and a healthier state of mind.                                The Meditation Podcast is made possible with great thanks to our subscribers on Patreon. Join our community at Patreon.com/theMeditationPodcast | We take on stress in many ways. Stress normally originates in a traumatic event or life-death situation. However, simple day-to-day events can also create stress, by triggering memories of trauma and fear.                                In today's meditation, we build our capacity to process and release stress. This meditation uses breath work and stillness, to increase awareness of our stress, its sources, and how to let it go.                                The Meditation Podcast is made possible with great thanks to our subscribers on Patreon. Join our community at Patreon.com/theMeditationPodcast | We are spiritual beings, going through a human experience on this earth. Through this experience, we develop habits that may be detrimental to our spiritual, mental and physical well-being. Eventually, destructive habits become a normal part of our everyday, and we can lose sight of their long term effects.                                Examples of destructive habits include alcohol or drug abuse, compulsive eating, nail-biting, self mutilation, belligerence, or rage. We are not interested in judging 'good' or 'bad', but rather examining our own habits and whether they empower us or hold us back from our highest good.                                In today's meditation, we learn to release destructive habits, refreshing and renewing ourselves through the powerful energy of Infinite Love and Light.

If your child was harmed by a vaccine and your doctor didn’t acknowledge it, document it, report it, and warn you about further doses and further injury, then your doctor is guilty of negligence. Today we discuss an online guide on how to submit a well-researched, well-documented complaint. tinyurl.com/VaxConv | Doctors have always assumed that febrile seizures were harmless, so febrile seizures triggered by vaccines “should be” harmless as well. Today we unpack brand new data from two research studies that question this long-held belief. If having febrile seizures during childhood increases the risk of suffering from life-long epilepsy, serious mood disorders, and other neurological problems, isn’t it time doctors start acknowledging this risk and start educating and protecting their patients? tinyurl.com/VaxConv | We continue our conversation with one of today’s most daring activists and get a behind-the-scenes look at his most recent vaccine injury awareness rallies.

We delve into why Joshua is sometimes viewed as a controversial character, and where his critics continue to get it wrong about him. Finally, we discuss working on the Vaxxed tour, and how filming over 800 vaccine injury stories changed him forever. tinyurl.com/VaxConv | Today we discuss an exclusive interview and the article written about Dr. Bob by a publication that historically hasn't been favorable to the opposition of medical mandates. In a rare opportunity, Dr. Bob agreed to a 4-hour interview and shared his thoughts on his medical board probation, the importance of believing and supporting his patients, and the need for more thorough research by The Medical Establishment in order to better protect at-risk children. tinyurl.com/VaxConv | In the second half of our interview with Del Bigtree we cover the work he’s done and continues to do to help inform the public about vaccine safety issues and revealing conflicts of interest — discussing both his web TV show “The Highwire” and his non-profit organization Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN). tinyurl.com/VaxConv | From working behind the camera to being in front of it, Del Bigtree has made a name for himself motivating and inspiring parents across the nation with his powerful speeches. This first part of our two-part interview explores Del the individual—where he came from, what led him into this informed consent movement, and why he is so passionate about medical freedom and transparency. tinyurl.com/VaxConv | Our first episode of Season 2 is an extremely important one. We take an in-depth look at the federal vaccine court case of a boy severely injured by the DPT vaccine and discuss how numerous court delays ultimately led to a tragic ending six years into the case. This painful and heartbreaking story represents exactly why parents across the nation and the world continue to fight fearlessly against laws mandating products with inherent risk. tinyurl.com/VaxConv | There is still so much to discuss regarding the larger vaccine debate. Today we share what some of our favorite ideas are for Season 2 and what we most look forward to bringing to the podcast. Don’t worry, we won’t be gone for long. There is work to be done, there are conversations to be had, and a public perception that desperately needs changing.

Because past guest (and next week’s guest) Matt Maruca invited me to Rick Rubin’s world-famous Shangri-La studios, a recording studio used by the likes of Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Pete Townshend, Joe Cocker, Billy Preston, Ronnie Wood, Weezer, Metallica, and Kings of Leon. It was an honor to record at these same mics, a brief but welcome return to my rockin’ roots. Matt invited me here to ask me some questions about my past, my trauma, my healing, and my future. I’ve talked about a lot of this before, but I’ve been looking at my life, and the experience of life in general, differently over the past few months; I have more awareness and presence than I had even just a year ago, and I’m still learning new things about myself and the world every day. So, today, I invite you into my life, into my mind, to learn what makes The Lifestylist tick. Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Tetragrammaton: a four-letter sacred symbol; a way of saying God without saying God, as used in the Old Testament Becoming a child drug addict and then teenage rockstar during a dark period of Hollywood How drugs quite possibly saved my life — and how the process of overcoming drug addiction lead to The Lifestylist Going from simulating life to experiencing life Why I feel more high now, sober, than at any other point in my life There are no mistakes on the road to self-mastery — only lessons and teachers Escaping the physical symptoms of poor health and wellness Your trauma is valid Why I’ve been celibate for more than a year Who’s the one watching your thoughts? Why we may not need to eat vegetables No one wants to look like shit The art and energy behind fashion Podcasting as a personal growth vehicle  \xa0  More about this episode. \xa0 Connect with Luke on social media to learn how to take your lifestyle to the next level, plus catch exclusive live interviews & events: INSTAGRAM - @lukestorey // https://www.instagram.com/lukestorey/ FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/MrLukeStorey/ TWITTER - @MrLukeStorey // https://twitter.com/MRLUKESTOREY YOUTUBE - https://www.youtube.com/c/LukeStorey \xa0 THIS SHOW IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY: JOOVV.

So I was stoked to find Candor, who make this delicious Coconut Matcha Nootropic Latte. It still has a little bit of caffeine, but combined with ingredients like green tea l-theanine, which is clinically proven to boost attention and mood when paired with caffeine.

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | Dr. Mark Atkinson wants you to acknowledge that life has gifted you with a body and mind for the duration of your time here on this rock hurtling through space. And how do you honor and show gratitude for a gift that you appreciate? You take care of it! A lot of the growing biohacking and self-development communities tend to focus on taking care of the physical body, but that’s just our vehicle through the human experience\xa0— it’s critically important that we also take care of our mental, emotional, and spiritual health. That’s why Dr. Atkinson, founder of the Human Potential Institute, travels around the world teaching the world’s top performers how to manage and optimize their mind, wellbeing, and effectiveness through psychological fitness training. Today, Dr. Atkinson will teach you how to start a psychological fitness practice, working with your body and mind in a way that allows you to serve life and for life to creatively move through your cells. It all starts by tuning up your body-mind vehicle, but real progress and development only comes when you delve into the psychological, the spiritual, or what Dr. Atkinson simply calls life. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Psychological fitness is a way of being in the world in which you’re present, open, aware, engaging in reality, and doing what matters Why CEOs, executives, and elite athletes turn to Dr. Atkinson to learn what he knows about psychological fitness training and personal development Curiosity may not be great for cats, but it’s a transformative perspective for human beings to use when approaching life A plant medicine experience that changed the course of Dr. Atkinson’s life Spirituality likes to vilify the ego, but Dr. Atkinson teaches us why we actually need to work with it to achieve greater awareness and presence You have thoughts — but that’s not who you are How you can get everything you need to overcome life’s challenges, no hacks required The critical difference between spiritual transcendence and spiritual bypassing Learning to change the channel of your awareness Evolving from Victim Consciousness to Victor Consciousness Is there a way to prevent the deep suffering caused by childhood trauma?

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | Today’s episode probably never would have happened if it weren’t for a car accident that occurred during my trip to Rythmia in Costa Rica — a moment of serendipity and synchronicity that I am, looking back, grateful for. Because that shared experience started my conversation with Alix Goldsmith Marcaccini, who runs Cuixmala, which is both one of the most beautiful and ecologically sustainable vacation destinations on the planet. Cuixmala — which means “the soul’s resting place” — is an oasis in the center of the 30,000 acre Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve. Here, the line between luxury and nature dissolves. The estate was originally built by Alix’s father, Sir James Goldsmith, an influential British businessman who became disillusioned with corporate life and dedicated himself to ecology. And environmentalism is still at the heart of Cuixmala today. A sprawling biodynamic farm provides 90% of everything served on the estate, while wild animals are protected and roam freely. And integrated into all of this is otherworldly architecture that only serves to highlight the diverse surroundings: postcard-perfect beaches, rocky bluffs jutting out into the Pacific, lush jungle, sweeping savannah, or coconut palm groves. Cuixmala is a little slice of paradise in the middle of a chaotic world. It’s an effort to do a little good for the planet as our species slowly destroys it. It’s a unique opportunity to enjoy the height of luxury while also getting in touch with the spiritual side of yourself that can only reveal itself in nature. It’s something you really have to see for yourself. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Why Alix’s father, Sir James Goldsmith, built Cuixmala Sir James Goldsmith’s astounding ecological efforts & confrontational relationship with the press Transitioning from organic to biodynamic farming No piece of nature is unimportant—even a single baby turtle—which is why we made sure every baby sea turtle made it to the ocean safely while I was visiting The craziest thing that Alix has ever seen on the property Alix’s three natural childbirths (two on the Cuixmala property) Why is conventional food “organic” but artificially-created food is just “food”? The difference between being organic and bio-dynamic A psychological and spiritual perspective on farming and the cycle of life Alix’s journey with plant medicine The most outlandish requests that Alix has had from her guests Why Alix is motivated to contribute and create a positive impact on the planet, even though she doesn’t really have to  \xa0  More about this episode.

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | Mood changes, irritability, depression, anxiety, fatigue: these are not simply symptoms of illnesses that we should all medicate and suppress — these are symptoms of the human experience. And our souls get the most out of our experience here on this rock hurtling through space when it is forced to confront and work through mental, emotional, and physical pain. This is how we grow. This is how we find who we are. So, today, we’re talking to holistic psychiatrist and returning guest Dr. Kelly Brogan, who is willing to stand up to the Pharma Mafia and Big Tech censorship in an effort to change the way we understand and approach mental health and ourselves. And Kelly has a ton of incredible insight in her brand-new book, Own Your Self: The Surprising Path beyond Depression, Anxiety, and Fatigue to Reclaiming Your Authenticity, Vitality, and Freedom. In the book and this episode, Kelly invites us to come on a journey of finally coming home to ourselves and shows us how we can alchemize crisis into growth — and I am so excited to take this journey with her. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  When we do and don’t have sovereignty over our own bodies Alchemizing crisis into growth We’re not that different — but we have different defenses The link between brain damage and vaccines Kelly’s pharmaceutical “red pill” Getting past the victimhood model The dangers of deplatforming Alex Jones Pharmaceuticals aren’t the wrong answer for everyone — but they’re definitely not the right answer for everyone, either Choosing side effects over effort The obscurity of Google search algorithms Perpetuating the idea that there’s a bad other Beginning the process of walking towards ourselves The balance between commitment and choice The realm of belief Vs. the realm of science The connection between psych meds and mass shootings Your invitation to join a pharma-free life Psychoneuroimmunology  \xa0  More about this episode.

In this episode, we’ll be taking a dive into the lecture portion of The High Love Experience, a transformative workshop designed to help you break free of the judgemental mind and find your soul’s true power. By using present moment awareness, scientific prayer, and the power of your breath, you will learn how to access your true identity hidden behind the false self and how to live a life motivated by the power of unconditional love. We learn to numb this high love experience throughout the process of growing up, through the trauma-filled process that is being human – but, today, I want to help you unlearn some of that programming and break through the internal barriers that were erected between you and your higher self. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Have you ever felt like there’s no purpose to life? Being a human being is inherently traumatic Breaking free of the slavery to our own minds The good and bad parts of the ego Where the highest experience of love comes from Our choices in Earth School Pain and suffering as a driver of experience Self-awareness & surrender We still have to stand up for ourselves Utilizing your higher self’s will Scientific prayer  \xa0  More about this episode. \xa0 Connect with Luke on social media to learn how to take your lifestyle to the next level, plus catch exclusive live interviews & events: INSTAGRAM - @lukestorey // https://www.instagram.com/lukestorey/ FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/MrLukeStorey/ TWITTER - @MrLukeStorey // https://twitter.com/MRLUKESTOREY YOUTUBE - https://www.youtube.com/c/LukeStorey \xa0 THIS SHOW IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY: ORGANIFI.

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | If you regularly feel stressed out, overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, or tired – that isn’t just a symptom of modern society, although there is an epidemic of lethargy and our collective mental health is on the decline. You can change the way you experience the world, without quitting your job and moving into the middle of nowhere (as nice as that might sound some days). To solve modern problems, though, I often think the best solutions involve going back to ancient wisdom; there’s no reason to reinvent the wheel when our ancestors have already figured out tools and techniques we can use to overcome overwhelm. So I think there’s a lot of value in looking at how we can apply ancient wisdom to our modern times. One of these ancient techniques is called Yoga Nidra, an Ayurvedic meditation practice that’s sometimes referred to as “yogic sleep.” And if you watch someone practicing Yoga Nidra, it does look like they’re asleep, but it’s a bit more than that – it’s a meditation designed to lure your body into a state of consciousness that’s between being awake and being asleep, and it has transformative potential in our busy world. To learn more about the benefits of Yoga Nidra and how it works, I sat down with Rich Lister, a trained nurse and the founder of Medicine For Modern Times. He also created a program called RadicalRest, which is an application of Yoga Nidra combined with other complementary medical and spiritual practices. I met Rich at the Ra Ma Festival and I respect the way he’s helping people improve their lives by integrating both the spiritual and the medical into their mind-body experience, and I think Yoga Nidra is a tool that a lot of us will be able to incorporate into our daily lives so that we can re-focus on that mind-body experience and thrive in our modern world. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Rich’s 15 years of experience in the ER & how it broke him How Rich started developing his yoga practice How ancient yoga and meditation practice first made their way to the West – and then started finding popularity, again, in the mid 90s Why your unconscious mind is the root is all healthy living The ins and outs of RadicalRest: a deep meditation practice that helps you release negative emotions and thought patterns, calm your nervous system, and develop the aptitude necessary to meet all of life’s challenges Can someone practice Yoga Nidra or RadicalRest alone? Bringing science to the esoteric The relationship between the vagus nerve and the female orgasm What we should know about HRV and the unconscious mind The subjectivity of trauma We are doing the best we can with the tools we have  \xa0  More about this episode.

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | After 22 years of intense biohacking and experimentation to optimize my physical health, I’ve tried just about everything – or so I thought. Because Dr. Ted Achacoso surprised me with the knowledge, insight, and hacks he had up his sleeve that I hadn’t even heard of before this conversation. \xa0 Dr. Ted was trained as an interventional neuroradiologist and pharmacologist, but he became disillusioned with this form of care as he realized it, well, didn’t involve a lot of care. It was reactive and interventional. He realized that the way health providers look at patients and approach treatment could benefit from an entirely different approach – one that optimizes health rather than treating disease. \xa0 So, after years of studying the intricacies of things like metabolomic, gut, and hormone optimization, Dr. Ted pioneered the concept of Health Optimization Medicine (HOMe). \xa0 This is real-time preventive health management. While our traditional Western medicine diagnoses and treats disease, HOMe simply detects and corrects imbalances, with the understanding that “normal” isn’t the same for every single person. \xa0 But one of the reasons that I love Dr. Ted and this comprehensive approach to health most is that he makes sure everything he offers his patients actually works by testing new supplements, hormone formulations, and modalities on himself first. He’s a doctor by trade but a biohacker at heart, and I think his patients are almost certainly better for it.  If you’re interested in trying the unique nootropic that Dr. Ted mentions in the episode, Blue Cannatine – a legit limitless pill – you can get on the waitlist for the new Canatine Blue nootropic at troscriptions.com/Luke). | A few weeks ago, hundreds of people descended on the island of Mallorca, Spain – an urban vortex of mysticism, ancient imprints, and creative consciousness – to learn about health, wellbeing, and ascension at Ra Ma Festival. I hosted an intensive lifestyle design session called Elemental Alchemy – and, today, I want to share it with all of you! You’ll learn how to biohack your water, air, earth, and light to create and maintain an abundantly healthy and vibrant urban lifestyle; how to apply the most powerful principles of nature, combined with modern technology, to help you not only survive modern city life but thrive in it. I’m not just talking about your physical health, either. I’m talking about nurturing your soul. Because I believe that our physical vessels here on Earth only exist to facilitate our spiritual experiences. And you don’t have to choose or compromise – you can make the most out of your soul experience, even while living in the big city, if you just commit to a few profound (yet simple) adjustments to your lifestyle and mindset. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  The fundamental metaphysical and physical laws that dictate our experience Why it’s so important to share simple, grounded principles for improving our experience of the physical world The most common and sometimes hidden toxins in your household and energetic environment What makes up our physical vessel An interesting fact about water, your body, and water scarcity Evaluating our relationship with water Ice, ice baby An inconvenient but powerful truth about light The most powerful anti-cancer substance in the human body Those sweet, sweet sun rays  \xa0  More about this episode. \xa0 Connect with Luke on social media to learn how to take your lifestyle to the next level, plus catch exclusive live interviews & events: INSTAGRAM - @lukestorey // https://www.instagram.com/lukestorey/ FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/MrLukeStorey/ TWITTER - @MrLukeStorey // https://twitter.com/MRLUKESTOREY YOUTUBE - https://www.youtube.com/c/LukeStorey \xa0 THIS SHOW IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY: BLUBLOX.

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | Michael Trainer, founder of the social action platform Peak Mind and host of the Peak Mind podcast, is one of the biohacking all-stars that I had the opportunity to talk to during Bulletproof Upgrade Labs’ annual conference.\xa0 We talked about nature as a spiritual practice, the problem with unindividuated masculinity, and “the shaman problem” during our lightning round, but it just left me craving more of Michael’s insights into spirituality, plant medicine, and the world. So I sat down with him again to learn about the critical importance of building life-changing relationships, as it relates to our health and happiness, and how the reintroduction of spiritual practices and plant medicines into our society is playing a role in a new global awakening – as well as how the perversion and misuse of these spiritual tools is leading to a lot of faux-wakenings. This episode gets pretty heavy, and it’s highly critical of some sects of the spiritual community that likely have good intentions, but it’s probably one of the most important conversations we’ve had on the show so far. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Michael’s new book about how to build life-changing relationships in the 21st century Making giving (not taking) the norm The most significant corollary to your long term health and happiness The profound loneliness created by our digital world Living your life as a gift Overcoming imposter syndrome and insecurities Hosting His Holiness the Dalai Lama on his birthday What is happiness? The eulogy exercise The difference between proper and improper plant medicine use Being ushered into a new global awakening The physical, mental, and spiritual preparations you need to make to use plant medicines productively Michael’s vision for the future of Peak Minds + his plans to host the largest online meditation ever Connecting meditation to reforestation Gamifying the evolution of consciousness  \xa0  More about this episode.

Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and all your social pals | Tina Anderson used to work as in-house counsel for a pharmaceutical company\xa0– but,\xa0 frustrated by the many abuses in the pharmaceutical industry, Tina decided to make a dramatic change to her life and career. She channeled her energy into learning all she could about disease prevention and good health maintenance, which led her to the often overlooked key to health (or disease): our gut. She also discovered that the majority of probiotics on the market simply don’t work. So, Tina teamed up with her husband and world-renowned probiotic expert Dr. Simon Cutting to create a unique supplement that uses superior probiotic strains identified by Dr. Cutting. The bacillus strains found in Just Thrive supplements are abundant environmental organisms that have evolved to be consumed by humans on a daily basis. They thrive in our digestive systems, performing critical functions such as developing the immune system, reducing inflammation, facilitating digestion, and producing important functional compounds like antioxidants. Our guts do a lot for us, and there’s only so much that a healthy diet and lifestyle can do if we’re not taking care of our guts – so, today, Tina is going to teach us how we can make our gut’s job a little bit easier. \xa0 Topics Discussed In This Episode:  Your gut is ground zero for your health What’s the deal with leaky gut? 80% of the adult population has a leaky gut and doesn’t know it The confusing world of probiotics How gut health is related to alzheimer’s The difference between traditional probiotics and Just Thrive’s A first-of-its-kind leaky gut study The disaster that is RoundUp What’s better: more strains of bacteria or fewer strains of bacteria in a probiotic?

Check out https://drruscio.com/resources | In a study of 291 patients in Greece, researchers found that around 60% were incorrectly diagnosed as hypothyroid. While true hypothyroidism does exist, it’s a diagnosis that clinicians need to take a closer look at. Many clinicians are prescribing thyroid hormone when it’s not necessary, or when a patient’s symptoms could be resolved by healing the gut. The effects can be harmful, both to patient health and to their wallets. Patients themselves may exacerbate the problem by requesting it based on something they’ve read. Hear case studies from two functional medicine doctors who are modeling an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to curb some of these issues commonly seen in treating the thyroid. https://drruscio.com/?p=34033 The Future of Functional Medicine Review, Clinical Newsletter is available at drruscio.com/review Looking for more?

Where can you show up with extra kindness this week? Are you showing kindness to yourself, especially? Let’s anchor into this intention and allow kindness to be the shining light that leads the way. | Hugging is a profound, spiritual, heart-opening practice, and scientifically proven to make you feel a million times better! Today, find someone you feel safe with and practice heart-to-heart hugging. Make it a real, 30-second, full belly hug. Take a big breath and soften into the embrace. Allow it to surround you. Feel your heart soften. Hugs really are the best medicine! | For Thankful Thursday this week, our gratitude practice is directed toward the planet that we live on. So often we lose our sense of connection to the earth even though everything we are and everything we have is because of it! The air we breathe, the water we drink; we cannot separate ourselves from Mother Earth. Today, take some form of action to help the planet. Take your shoes off and feel the connection to the ground below you. Appreciate the abundance it offers us all. | Find an undisturbed place to sit down for our meditation practice. Today, we are going to connect deeply to our heart space. Make a physical connection with your heart and ask yourself - how is my heart doing? What is it carrying? Know that in this moment, everything is okay. We do not need to arrive at anything in particular. But as we sit in stillness, feel the softening that comes with each and every breath. Feel the love that lies within. | Frustration is a normal and natural emotion. It’s often linked to anger and inaction; we haven’t been able to fully let our emotions out or we feel helpless and like we need to make a change. For Tune-In Tuesday, reflect on what has been frustrating you lately. Most importantly, try to dive deep into what lies beneath the situation. Is there something you can do to take action? Only you know the answer, and you can find it through self-reflection. | So often we play small; we talk ourselves down, we deflect compliments, we don’t toot our own horns. But letting yourself be who you are is a wild act of rebellion, especially living in a society that likes us to stay in a small box. This week, we are going to do just that! Set the intention to take up more space. Celebrate everything you offer. Give yourself permission to be really big and most importantly - don’t shrink back. | To head into the weekend feeling good, let’s be of service! We all have causes we are passionate about. We want to help those in need and make the world a better place. But sometimes we get so caught up in our lives, we forget to look around and notice those in need of support. So today, we are going to donate money to an organization and a cause we believe in. It doesn’t matter how much you give. Give one dollar, or 20! Maybe you skip your usual latte or make a small change in your day so you can afford to give to a greater cause. We all have the ability to make an impact, so let’s head into the weekend doing some good. | At any given moment in your life, you can find so many things to be grateful for. Today for Thankful Thursday, grab some paper and a pen – we are making a gratitude list! Start with the first thing that pops into your head. You will be surprised how easy the rest will follow. One thing always leads to another and another! Your life is filled with blessings. 100 things that you are grateful for… GO! | As you’re meditating today for Wellbeing Wednesday, find a space for the body to settle so your sit bones are rooted into the ground while the crown of your head is lengthening to the sky. This makes space for our prana, our life force, to easily move through the body. As you focus on your breath, notice the space between the inhales and the exhales. See if you can extend that pause a little more. That quiet moment of nothingness, of stillness, of in between – that’s where the universe resides. | Today we continue our self-inquiry practice by getting really clear on a goal we have in our life. Picture yourself one year from now. What are you looking to add or create? Being able to define that is important! It doesn’t all need to be figured out today; each actionable step will get clearer as you continue on your path. So today, find someone to share with or write about your goal in your journal.

But with every new milestone, Saquon’s goal has remained the same: to be the best. For Saquon, having a positive, open, and focused mindset is what has gotten him so far in both his football career and his life outside of sport. In this episode, Saquon tells us about how he continues to cultivate that mindset through goal setting, how his early exposure to sport has shaped his approach to training, and how he has handled physical and emotional transitions from college football star to professional athlete. | No matter if you played Little League, ran high school track, or were a kickball star on the playground, chances are you had a coach who was with you every step of the way. But too often, we overlook how coaches and trainers can shape our life both on and off the field. In this episode, we're sitting down with Megan Bartlett, Founder of We Coach, an organization that trains coaches and equips them with the tools and knowledge they need to help kids reach their full potential. Megan tells us about the connection between sports and stress management, the benefits of rhythmic and repetitive activities, and how to set positive and realistic expectations for young athletes. | Training is all about figuring out what works for you. It’s about finding your own philosophy, your approach, your guidelines. On this episode, we’re turning to some of our other Nike Master Trainers – Kirsty Godso, Betina Gozo and Joe Holder – for a round table discussion on how anyone, no matter their level, can improve their approach to all five facets of fitness. Throughout our conversation, Kirsty, Betina and Joe will tell us about how they’ve developed their own training philosophies, how they've learned to tailor their workouts to different needs, and how training – both professionally and personally – has changed their lives. | Golf is all about the long game. And no one knows this better than pro golfer, Rory McIlroy. We caught up with Rory after the 2019 PGA Championship. From barely making the cut on Friday to a top 10 finish on Sunday, he attributes his comeback to what he calls his “resilient mindset.” Over the course of his career, Rory has learned that the more resilient you are and the more you understand that winning is a byproduct of setting small, tangible goals -- the better you will perform. Throughout the episode, Rory tells us about learning proper biomechanics as a kid playing rugby, soccer and tennis, his dedication to positive self-talk, and being an advocate for holistic fitness. | When it comes to recovery, the onslaught of new trends and research can make it difficult to separate the noise from the science. In this episode, we’re digging deep into recovery and giving practical tips on how to incorporate it into your overall training routine. We’re sitting down with Dr. Shona Halson, Associate Professor in the School of Behavioral and Health Sciences at the Australian Catholic University, a former Senior Recovery Physiologist at the Australian Institute of Sport, and Director of the Australian Olympic Committee Recovery Center. Dr. Halson breaks down the ways we can all maximize our recovery time -- everything from understanding what type of compression or hydrotherapy works for you, to the science behind mental recovery and sleep, and how to structure your active recovery days. | When Kevin Love, power forward of the Cleveland Cavaliers, was drafted into the NBA in 2008, he needed to find a way to handle the physical and mental demands of playing at the pro level. Today, Kevin isn’t just a five-time NBA all-star or a 2016 NBA champion -- he’s also an avid yoga practitioner and an advocate for mental health. By incorporating yoga into his daily training routine, Kevin has come to understand the “mind-body connection” -- that taking time to breathe, to meditate, to set an intention, no matter how small, can have huge impacts on all facets of fitness. On this episode of TRAINED, Kevin tells us about how his early sports experiences have helped him stay competitive, how his approach to nutrition, recovery, and sleep has changed over the course of his career, and how he plans to keep playing basketball for as long as he can. | To kick off Season Three of TRAINED, we’re sitting down with U.S. Soccer Team midfielder Julie Ertz as she and the U.S. Women’s National Team prepare for this year’s competition in France. In 2015, Julie and her team won the competition, but once you’ve made it to the top, where do you go from there? How do you motivate yourself to keep training, to never stop striving to be your best, to perform at your highest level? For Julie, it’s about creating a training community. With the help of her teammates and her husband, Philadelphia Eagles tight-end, Zach Ertz, Julie continues to push herself in the gym and on the pitch. She tells us about her training routine, her take on nutrition, and why she has learned to embrace adversity. | Welcome back to TRAINED. Presented by Nike. Our third season launches on June 6 with a conversation with pro soccer player Julie Ertz. Through years of research and working with the world’s best athletes, Nike has learned that greatness isn’t born, it’s trained. This podcast explores the cutting-edge of holistic fitness to help make you a better trainer and athlete. Listen to conversations with athletes and industry experts to discover the latest innovations, insights, and trends making the biggest impact on the training world. | Food is complicated. The “rules” change all the time, and every body is different. So how do you decide what’s right for you? For Melissa Hartwig-Urban, Co-creator of Whole30 and four-time New York Times bestselling author, it was a process. She started blogging about her “elimination diet” as a way to improve her training and recovery and share her results with her training community. Ten years later, her approach has become one of today’s most-popular eating programs: The Whole30. In this episode, Melissa explains why The Whole30 isn’t meant to be a long-term diet but, rather, an experiment to figure out which foods work best for you. She also provides us with tips on how we can learn to identify, cook, and eat “real food,” how to make meditation a consistent part of training, and how we can all cultivate a healthier relationship with food in order to bolster our performance, recovery and mindset. | Allyson Felix is a World-Champion sprinter and an Olympic gold medalist. Over the course of her career, Allyson has won nine Olympic medals and 16 IAAF World Outdoor Championships, making her the most-decorated athlete in track and field history.  Despite injuries, a harrowing pregnancy, and a rough road towards her first gold medal, Allyson has always stayed resilient in the face of challenges -- but getting to that mindset wasn’t easy. Allyson remains one of the greatest athletes of all time because of her ability to plan for the unexpected and her willingness to be patient with her body.", 'chan_desc': "Through years of research and working with the world's best athletes - Nike has learned greatness isn't born, it's trained.

I’m looking forward to sharing with you some of our community’s questions that have come in over the past few weeks… Let’s get started!\xa0\xa0\xa0 Dar: Hi sorry you may need the entire podcast for these questions lol.\xa01. Thoughts on Arnold Ehret you must have read his books 2. Had bells palsy awhile back about 5 months ago once in awhile when I\'m tired I have a weird eye twitch that I only had since then but all my other symptoms subsided after 2 weeks, crooked smile ect. What do you recommend? I take b12, magnesium, thyroid support, omega, and zinc. Fruits and veggies powder. 3. I feel pretty good but want optimal energy what do you suggest for that? I workout regularly. Just want to feel optimal. Once in awhile I feel tired and once in awhile optimal energy but want that to be consistent. Cindy:\xa0 Dr. Cabral, I have had and still have many questions, but I don\'t usually stop to write them down. Last week in speaking with my husband I said, "Dr. Cabral has been my greatest mentor." He knows me well as he said, "Maybe you should tell him." So truly Dr. Cabral, I started listening to you in early 2017, I have read your book, and on my health passion endeavor, you have been my greatest mentor. Thank you.In 2018, I completed the food sensitivity test and the DNA testing. During the consultation, you briefly questioned why I did these tests first. I already knew it would not have been your path of tests to complete, but I feel very passionate to help my family. I know you can only help those who want to live a healthy life style. Meaning, if my DNA has indicators that could help my Dad and sisters, I wanted that information (and got it). I could not ask all the questions during our consultation, because as we went through it, my heart broke for my Mom, who passed away from Fatty Liver Disease in 2009 at the age of 67. I felt as though everything on the DNA test could have been my Mom\'s test. I know it was not, but I definitely had some emotions to work through. So, I think you should consider giving the report to the client a day or so before the consultation. That would have benefited me, for sure. OK... I am APOE2/E3 …. does this give any indication on one\'s Ayurvedic body type?\xa0 I am some combination of Pita / Vatta, but I am curious if there is any correlation between the two. Thank you for all you do. Cindy: Dr. Cabral, Again, I have read your book, shared many of your shared wisdoms with my 4th grade students, and listen to your podcast daily. Thank you for taking your hardship and building a beautiful story that blesses others. I do have a request... on the House Calls, even if you have covered the information, could you please, please, please …. give a summarized answer (and give the episode one could go back to)?\xa0Question: How long do you think it would take for an average person\'s labs, lets say the big 5, to come back normal, all within range, if the person did your CBO protocol, Heavy Metal Detox, Mold Protocol, 4 Detox Protocols a year, Level 2 or 3 Daily Protocol, and lived a healthy lifestyle? Cindy: Dr. Cabral, I am still in search of my Root Cause. As a "health detective," I think it was gluten pushing my rain barrel throughout childhood. As a child I would always get tonsillitis once or twice a year. They were removed at 18, and a few years later I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. I started medication (levothyroxine) and had virtually no symptoms for 20 years.\xa0 At that point, everything went wrong, but I was pushing my body (working on my educational dissertation) too hard, with little sleep.\xa0For four years during this time, I also lived in and worked in a Mold house (now my daughter also has issues, but not my husband or son). Within a 2 year period, I started taking 5 different medications.\xa0 Upon finishing my educational goals in mid 2016, I knew I needed to focus on my sleep patterns and health.\xa0 In 2017 I stopped all medications besides the thyroid medication and a daily allergy pill (which I have tried eliminating those as well).\xa0Two days without the allergy pill, I am a sneezing mess (yes, histamine issues).\xa0There was a cost in stopped the medications: I crashed. But, I got up! Slowly. I did NOT want to cover symptoms; I now want to feel, so I know. Exercise is important, but it could sure take my energy for a day or two. I am feeling much better, but I still don\'t know my root cause. I don\'t want the energy crash to happen. If I eat gluten, a small one still happens, but not like before. What I know: My body does not digest Gluten (DNA). Food Sensitives: wheat, gliadin, dairy (slow metabolizer of caffeine... so it can make me feel anxious with too much) Thyroid antibodies: Present, but both in the 30s (only tested after removed gluten and dairy, mostly) Big Helps for me:\xa02016 Sleep focus of at least 7 hours (but I don\'t get much Deep Sleep, according to my Oura ring)\xa02017 Removal of Gluten and Dairy 2017 Adding about 6 mg of Iodine Daily (now I can go longer without it, but then I would crash with 1 day of skipping it) 2018 Added liothyronine (T3 drug …. due to High Reverse T3 = 29…) 2018 Daily Coffee Enemas for 12 weeks: I felt completely renewed after 10 weeks. Now, I use weekly.\xa02018 I could run without crashing, if I would ground (literally, putting my body on the grass for several minutes) after a short sprint. 2019 Red Light Therapy with Platinum LED Bio 900 mixed bulbs and a full body I-Vibration Pro Plate. I know your Magnesium, Zinc, mentholated Vit B, and Vit C - continue to help me (and I will always supplement these); but the items above, I know, I felt the push towards health. My question: How do I get to my root cause? How do I know, so I don\'t repeat the same mistake? I don\'t know if I will ever get off the thyroid medications, and if my thyroid is damaged (working to get an ultra sound), I am ok with taking medications. But the truth is, I think my thyroid is coming back to life! My medication dosing is crazy now. After taking 175 mcg of levothyroxine for a decade, I know take 88 mcg; but, it keeps changing.\xa0I am doing a lot, working towards, no... living healthy. I want others having this similar struggle to have that list of "big helps for me" - maybe it can help them too.\xa0Again, My question: How do I get to my root cause? How do I know, so I don\'t repeat the same mistake?\xa0 Thank you. Aloha & Blessing to you. Cindy: Dr. Cabral, What would cause pain in the bottom of the feet and behind the knees, specifically behind the knees when in bed? When I first started taking the Citricidal drops, the knee pain started. It doesn\'t happen often any more. However, the bottom of my feet hurt when I start walking. The tops will sometimes get terrible cramps (I use Essential oils on it), but it can be painful. I have had the pain in the bottom of my feet for years. But, when I see each of my sisters (5 girls) get up from a seated position and start walking, I notice the struggle in each of us! I\'ve read about Bartonella, both causing pain in the bottom of the feet and hurting one\'s thyroid. What do you think?\xa0Thank you again for all you do. Aloha & Blessings to you. :) Sonny: Have you or your team ever come across someone suffering from Type I - Diabetes, Celiac Disease, Testicular Cancer, and finally Multiple Sclerosis, 2 Auto- Immune Disease? \xa0 Thank you for tuning into this weekend’s Cabral HouseCalls and be sure to check back tomorrow for our Mindset & Motivation Monday show to get your week started off right! - - - Show Notes & Resources: \xa0http://StephenCabral.com/1339 - - - Dr. Cabral\'s New Book, The Rain Barrel Effect https://amzn.to/2H0W7Ge - - - Join the Community & Get Your Questions Answered: http://CabralSupportGroup.com - - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular Supplements: > “The Dr. Cabral Daily Protocol” (This is what Dr. Cabral does every day!) - - - >\xa0Dr. Cabral Detox\xa0 (The fastest way to get well, lose weight, and feel great!) - - - >\xa0Daily Nutritional Support Shake\xa0 (#1 “All-in-One recommendation in my practice) - - - >\xa0Daily Fruit & Vegetables Blend\xa0 (22 organic fruit & vegetables “greens powder”) - - - >\xa0CBD Oil\xa0 (Full-spectrum, 3rd part-tested & organically grown) - - - >\xa0Candida/Bacterial Overgrowth, Leaky Gut, Parasite & Speciality Supplement Packages - - - > See All Supplements: https://equilibriumnutrition.com/collections/supplements \xa0- - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular At-Home Lab Tests: >\xa0Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (Test for mineral imbalances & heavy metal toxicity) - - - >\xa0Organic Acids Test (Test for 75 biomarkers including yeast & bacterial gut overgrowth, as well as vitamin levels) - - - >\xa0Thyroid + Adrenal + Hormone Test\xa0 (Discover your complete thyroid, adrenal, hormone, vitamin D & insulin levels) - - - >\xa0Adrenal + Hormone Test (Run your adrenal & hormone levels) - - - >\xa0Food Sensitivity Test (Find out your hidden food sensitivities) - - - >\xa0Omega-3 Test (Discover your levels of inflammation related to your omega-6 to omega-3 levels) - - - >\xa0Stool Test (Use this test to uncover any bacterial, h.

This is where we answer our community\'s wellness, weight loss, and anti-aging questions to help people get back on track! Check out today\'s questions:\xa0 Virupa: Hi, Im a 26 year old female from the UK. I recently discovered Dr Cabral’s podcasts and the rainbarrel effect through Melissa Ambrosini and I’m so grateful for all your wonderful work! I’ve just completed my first year of foundation training as a doctor and I’m fascinated by functional medicine, Holistic medicine and alternative medicine as they really are the answer to many chronic illnesses.\xa0 I was diagnosed with IBS a few years ago. I’ve been suffering from terrible bloating/gas/belching and chronic constipation for a few years. I also suffer from chronic anxiety and insomnia, and PCOS. I keep my stress levels under control by exercising regularly, doing plenty of yoga and meditation. Diet wise I eat plenty of vegetables, healthy carbohydrates and eggs. I’ve recently eliminated diary and gluten. Given my GI symptoms above could I have Candida/bacterial overgrowth? I haven’t really used antibiotics, birth control, Advil or consume alcohol in excess however I feel it could be a possibility given my symptoms? I was wondering how sensitive and specific the organic acids tests is for diagnosing SIBO? I was also wondering what else the organic acids test could tell me about my health given the symptoms/conditions I have listed above?\xa0Kind regards, Dr Virupa Tanisha: Hey Dr. Cabral. Are there any real serious drawbacks from someone doing cosmetic procedures whether it be minor aesthetic stuff like Botox & face lifts or plastic surgery where fat is removed and body is contoured. I know I am wrong & selfish here but I\'ve worked hard & ate right for my body for years while some of my friends were being sloppy even when I encouraged them to train. A couple got procedures and it admittedly looks great, now the others are exploring that option and I can\'t honestly tell them to chose the exercise/diet option instead because procedures are more appealing. Forgive me, but is there any info you have that I can give them or is this the way of the future and we should accept it? Even one told me her husband did penis enhancement procedure. It\'s crazy in my opinion. Sigh. Anyway, love your show, I\'m trying to put friends on it. Sigrid: Hi there, i was diagnosed with H-Pylori. I would like to clear it out using a more natural method instead of going the antibiotic route (as i have tried it before and didn\'t last more then a 1.5 days). Can you please tell me which products i need to purchase to start on Dr. Cabrals program for H-pylori. Jody: Hello! I’m working with Dr X doing the X Program (I believe he has taken your courses and has turned me on to your podcast). I’m entering the 5th week of program which is 1st week of detox. (2 week X detox)Do you feel using enemas are safe? I have trouble moving bowels and frequently use enemas. I’m especially concerned during detox phase and don’t want to miss a day of elimination.\xa0 Big fan- thanks for what you do! Jody Richie: Hi, I have been diagnosed with Hashis in March. TSH 40. My dr thinks I was hypo for some time. I\'m on 150 mg syntroid per day. Is there any benefit to prolonged water fasting to cleanse my system. I\'m currently 60 pounds overweight. Would a 10, 20, 30 day water fast, followed by AIP diet help? Could it possible cure my symptons? I continue to suffer from Brain Fog, mood fluctuations, letargy. Recently my scalp has become irritated. Thank you. Richie Kerry: Hi Dr,\xa0 Would you ever use adrenal “Adrenal Soothe” support for a 5 year old child who has ASD and high anxiety?\xa0 If not what would you suggest to support with high stress. We are already looking at underlying issues and doing your parasite protocol and will follow up with CBO after. The main goal I have is to reduce stimming as it is impacting my child’s schooling.\xa0Thanks Kerry Darrel: Hey Dr. Cabral. Quick question. In your early podcast days and your Guide to muscle and Strength book you would\'ve recommended whey protein. Has that stance changed since then or is it still safe to use? Even though it\'s cow based does it go through a different process (like ghee) to not be considered harmful like dairy? If that\'s the case, what types you suggest? Keep up good work \xa0 Thank you for tuning into today\'s Cabral HouseCall and be sure to check back tomorrow where we answer more of our community’s questions!  \xa0- - -  Show Notes & Resources: http://StephenCabral.com/1338 - - - Get Your Question Answered: http://StephenCabral.com/askcabral \xa0 - - - Dr. Cabral\'s New Book, The Rain Barrel Effect https://amzn.to/2H0W7Ge - - - Join the Community & Get Your Questions Answered: http://CabralSupportGroup.com - - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular Supplements: > “The Dr. Cabral Daily Protocol” (This is what Dr. Cabral does every day!) - - - >\xa0Dr. Cabral Detox\xa0 (The fastest way to get well, lose weight, and feel great!) - - - >\xa0Daily Nutritional Support Shake\xa0 (#1 “All-in-One recommendation in my practice) - - - >\xa0Daily Fruit & Vegetables Blend\xa0 (22 organic fruit & vegetables “greens powder”) - - - >\xa0CBD Oil\xa0 (Full-spectrum, 3rd part-tested & organically grown) - - - >\xa0Candida/Bacterial Overgrowth, Leaky Gut, Parasite & Speciality Supplement Packages - - - > See All Supplements: https://equilibriumnutrition.com/collections/supplements \xa0- - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular At-Home Lab Tests: >\xa0Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (Test for mineral imbalances & heavy metal toxicity) - - - >\xa0Organic Acids Test (Test for 75 biomarkers including yeast & bacterial gut overgrowth, as well as vitamin levels) - - - >\xa0Thyroid + Adrenal + Hormone Test\xa0 (Discover your complete thyroid, adrenal, hormone, vitamin D & insulin levels) - - - >\xa0Adrenal + Hormone Test (Run your adrenal & hormone levels) - - - >\xa0Food Sensitivity Test (Find out your hidden food sensitivities) - - - >\xa0Omega-3 Test (Discover your levels of inflammation related to your omega-6 to omega-3 levels) - - - >\xa0Stool Test (Use this test to uncover any bacterial, h.

Meaning, they will selectively cherry-pick the few studies that back up their point, or exclaim how much it has made a difference in their personal life... While this is interesting to listen to, it\'s not necessarily advice you may want to follow... The reason is that it most likely does not pass the "common health sense or longevity test."

I’m looking forward to sharing with you some of our community’s questions that have come in over the past few weeks… Let’s get started!\xa0\xa0\xa0 Valerie: Hi dr.cabral i know you\'ve done podcasts on this before but im having trouble finding the one im thinking of. I know you disagree with the intake of dairy due to its inflammation properties but where do u stand on lactose free milk/yogurt or goat diary? Is it less or as safe as nut alternative? John: I have white dots all over my arms, I have gotten more and more with age. They look like loss of pigmentations, I also have a lot of freckles too. Is there some sort of deficiency that causes this or is this just ageing Sarah: Hi Dr. Stephen,\xa0First off, thank you very much for sharing so much of your knowledge through your podcast. I by no means claim to be a health guru, but your podcast has helped me make some significant changes in my diet and lifestyle and they have proven to work. So, thank you!\xa0 I wanted to reach out and ask about your daily nutritional shake. I started using your products about six months ago and I make a daily, breakfast smoothie with the daily nutritional support shake in either flavor, along with your collagen and magnesium as well. However, I have a family who is very into supplements and are representatives of the Isagenix brand. I used these products for about six years before stumbling upon your podcast (and others) and realized that I can do better and be cleaner in my diet. My family hasn’t been able to accept the fact that I’m no longer using the Isagenix products and nearly every time we meet with them they preach to me how “this new shake your taking does not give you the minerals and vitamins that you need.” Can you speak to this at all? I do feel Supplementing is important, but it would be helpful to get some professional insight on how I am in fact getting what I need through your Equilibrium products. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!! Sue: Hi Dr Cabral,\xa0 I am at a loss! I feel like I have zero will power and fell that I must be the stupidest person on the planet. I have loads of knowledge of health and wellness and have had massive health gains over the past few years. My family and community see me as their health and wellness go to but I fear that I’m just a fraud.\xa0 I have lost about 30 kg through completing food elimination diets, I have even completed 2 x 21 day detoxes. I gain weight very quickly after I complete a protocol. I usually gain at least 3kg (7 pounds) in the first week that I return to regular eating after this I feel deflated and I start over eating.\xa0I do so well when I’m on protocol but a few weeks after I’m done start binge eating and over eating. Once I start over eating it is like I have an insatiable hunger - I could literally eat all day and never feel satisfied.\xa0 I think it’s a mental thing because a few times I’ve even eat gluten during a binge and caused great pain to myself because I have celiac disease.\xa0 The past year I have lost and gained the same 10kg 4 times. I don’t know what is wrong with me, why I’m so weak, why I gain so quickly and what I can do.\xa0Do you have any suggestions for why I can’t break this vicious cycle? Lisa: Looking for you opinion on Lithium orotate. How and when to use it? Brand and dosage to take. Thank you! Darren: Hey Dr Cabral. You regularly recommend Blueberries in smoothie for breakfast. I\'m from Caribbean so we import them frozen. I was wondering if maqui berries are also as effective, better or worse to use as a substitute given the powdered version is available to us. As always keep up great work. \xa0 Thank you for tuning into this weekend’s Cabral HouseCalls and be sure to check back tomorrow for our Mindset & Motivation Monday show to get your week started off right! - - - Show Notes & Resources: \xa0http://StephenCabral.com/1332 - - - Dr. Cabral\'s New Book, The Rain Barrel Effect https://amzn.to/2H0W7Ge - - - Join the Community & Get Your Questions Answered: http://CabralSupportGroup.com - - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular Supplements: > “The Dr. Cabral Daily Protocol” (This is what Dr. Cabral does every day!) - - - >\xa0Dr. Cabral Detox\xa0 (The fastest way to get well, lose weight, and feel great!) - - - >\xa0Daily Nutritional Support Shake\xa0 (#1 “All-in-One recommendation in my practice) - - - >\xa0Daily Fruit & Vegetables Blend\xa0 (22 organic fruit & vegetables “greens powder”) - - - >\xa0CBD Oil\xa0 (Full-spectrum, 3rd part-tested & organically grown) - - - >\xa0Candida/Bacterial Overgrowth, Leaky Gut, Parasite & Speciality Supplement Packages - - - > See All Supplements: https://equilibriumnutrition.com/collections/supplements \xa0- - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular At-Home Lab Tests: >\xa0Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (Test for mineral imbalances & heavy metal toxicity) - - - >\xa0Organic Acids Test (Test for 75 biomarkers including yeast & bacterial gut overgrowth, as well as vitamin levels) - - - >\xa0Thyroid + Adrenal + Hormone Test\xa0 (Discover your complete thyroid, adrenal, hormone, vitamin D & insulin levels) - - - >\xa0Adrenal + Hormone Test (Run your adrenal & hormone levels) - - - >\xa0Food Sensitivity Test (Find out your hidden food sensitivities) - - - >\xa0Omega-3 Test (Discover your levels of inflammation related to your omega-6 to omega-3 levels) - - - >\xa0Stool Test (Use this test to uncover any bacterial, h.

This is where we answer our community\'s wellness, weight loss, and anti-aging questions to help people get back on track! Check out today\'s questions:\xa0 James: Hi everyooneee (Dr Cabral voice) :D but actually Hi doc, because this question today is for you. I wanted to hear your thoughts on food sensitivities, my understanding is that they are usually caused by undigested food particles breaching the tight junctions in the gut lining then the body having an immune response to that specific food because it’s now in the blood stream – then when we eat that food again the body still has that same immune response and starts attacking itself, causing food intolerance symptoms? Firstly can you confirm if I am correct with that, and if so do you think it’s possible to cure food intolerances then by sealing up the tight junctions and taking care of any fungus/bacteria overgrowth - or will your body still have an immune response to these specific foods? If you could dive deep(ish) into how food intolerances are created, how symptoms arise and the mechanism behind curing them I would be super interested to learn! If you have time Thanks again - James Richie: Dr Cabral, I listen to your podcast all the time. I have recently become interested in extended water fasting and the benefits of autophagy. 5 , 10, 30 day fasts.I was diagnosed with Hashimitos in March. I\'m taking 125 mg synthetic T4. I\'m 50 pounds overweight and suffering brain fog and mood swings. Do you think a prolonged water fast of 30 days could reset my metabolism and cleanse my gut? Or do you think it could be dangerous and damage my already stressed adrenal system?\xa0I\'d appreciate if you could consider this topic for your podcast.Cheers, Richie\xa0 Alpha: Hey Dr. Cabral. I really enjoy your show and try to put as many people as possible on to it. I\'m a firefighter and sometimes despite out best efforts we get exposed to smoke, fumes, dust etc. All the years the recommendation after a major call where that happens is to drink some milk. The seniors claim it helps trap and remove contaminants. Is there any possible truth to this or is it an old wives tale not rooted in science? Also what recommendations you have for firefighters, victims or those in similar circumstances who may have been exposed to smoke/contaminants etc? Would an active lifestyle help combat risks? As always keep up great work. Madison: Hi Dr. Cabral! Big fan of your podcast & all that you stand for. I am 22 years old and have a question regarding the correlation between cortisol and intermittent fasting. I am very active workout out 5-6x/week and prefer to fast 7pm-9am. However, I find that, for example, if I wake up at 5:30am to workout, when I return home to get ready, around 7-7:30am, my stomach is grumbling/expressing hunger, but I don\'t physically feel hungry. With stress in my job/commute to the city, could these stomach/intestinal noises be a sign of high cortisol? Thanks!! Ruth: I started doing Amanda’s program and your detox. I drank 30 oz upon waking and then the 20oz shake. I was feeling nauseous and had to stop. So my point: what should i do from here. I didn’t think feeling nauseous was normal, which is why i discontinued the detox shake/pills. Is this something that indicates something else is going on? Should i try again in a week? I have three boys: 9, 6 and 4 that i homeschool and my 4 year old has severe medical issues that i am sole caregiver for. My youngest son has had a lot of medical issues since hes been born to say the least which is why i started my health journey becUse i need to be around to take care of him. But i am in shape and been working out since last oct, and have been eating healthy, whole foods according to the faster way june: no gluten or dairy. I just wanted to give all details so you could advise best on how i should proceed. I will be honest that im scared to try again but maybe it was just the perfect storm of a day with mensuration, but i have a lot on my shoulders in life to be responsible for and being unavailable to my kids, especially my youngest, is not an option. Thanks for your time, Ruth\xa0 \xa0 Thank you for tuning into today\'s Cabral HouseCall and be sure to check back tomorrow where we answer more of our community’s questions!  \xa0- - -  Show Notes & Resources: http://StephenCabral.com/1331 - - - Get Your Question Answered: http://StephenCabral.com/askcabral \xa0 - - - Dr. Cabral\'s New Book, The Rain Barrel Effect https://amzn.to/2H0W7Ge - - - Join the Community & Get Your Questions Answered: http://CabralSupportGroup.com - - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular Supplements: > “The Dr. Cabral Daily Protocol” (This is what Dr. Cabral does every day!) - - - >\xa0Dr. Cabral Detox\xa0 (The fastest way to get well, lose weight, and feel great!) - - - >\xa0Daily Nutritional Support Shake\xa0 (#1 “All-in-One recommendation in my practice) - - - >\xa0Daily Fruit & Vegetables Blend\xa0 (22 organic fruit & vegetables “greens powder”) - - - >\xa0CBD Oil\xa0 (Full-spectrum, 3rd part-tested & organically grown) - - - >\xa0Candida/Bacterial Overgrowth, Leaky Gut, Parasite & Speciality Supplement Packages - - - > See All Supplements: https://equilibriumnutrition.com/collections/supplements \xa0- - - \xa0 Dr. Cabral’s Most Popular At-Home Lab Tests: >\xa0Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (Test for mineral imbalances & heavy metal toxicity) - - - >\xa0Organic Acids Test (Test for 75 biomarkers including yeast & bacterial gut overgrowth, as well as vitamin levels) - - - >\xa0Thyroid + Adrenal + Hormone Test\xa0 (Discover your complete thyroid, adrenal, hormone, vitamin D & insulin levels) - - - >\xa0Adrenal + Hormone Test (Run your adrenal & hormone levels) - - - >\xa0Food Sensitivity Test (Find out your hidden food sensitivities) - - - >\xa0Omega-3 Test (Discover your levels of inflammation related to your omega-6 to omega-3 levels) - - - >\xa0Stool Test (Use this test to uncover any bacterial, h.

Dr Sadeghi clears up all the confusion around this disease, and explains why meat/fish/eggs do NOT help SIBO, and they only make Gut Microbiome health worse. \xa0 We cover why you should NOT do the FODMAP diet. \xa0 How animal products create TMAO, and more... \xa0 About Dr Angie Sadeghi \xa0 Dr. Angies Biography: When it comes to the human wellness experience, Dr. Angie says, “My passion is to provide healing through an integrative approach to keep patients healthy and youthful. Most people spend the latter years of life dealing with chronic disease. My mission is to bring healing and improve the quality of life for those individuals looking to stay fit and healthy, through use of nutrition, fitness, and bio-identical hormone therapy.” Dr. Angie’s own personal journey fueled her desire to help patients. Five years ago she switched to a plant-based lifestyle and adopted regular fitness into her life. She had previously suffered from health problems such as severe eczema, elevated cholesterol, fatigue, and was overweight. She started eating a whole food, plant-based diet, and transformed her health and body amazingly. This allowed her to completely restore her health and even compete and place in a fitness competition. “It was crazy to look at myself in the mirror and look like a fitness model, rather than a typical overweight physician. For this reason, I decided to share my success method with my patients.” Dr. Angie understands that no single approach is right for every individual, so she offers a complete range of services to help individuals with gut problems, obesity, anti-aging, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and overall disease prevention. Combining evidence based medicine, her expertise in the digestive system, and her passion for physical fitness and plant-based nutrition, Dr. Angie has developed a comprehensive approach to helping patients recover from illness and live a healthy life. Additionally, she is part of a new movement called “The Plantrician Project,” empowering individuals with the knowledge and benefits of a whole food plant-based nutrition. Dr. Angie Sadeghi is a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine and a diplomate of the American Board of Gastroenterology. She has extensive training from the prestigious University of Southern California (USC), and demonstrates exceptional commitment to excellence in treating diseases of digestive tract. Dr. Angie is featured in three documentaries as a leader in the field of plant-based fitness for health and weight loss. Other upcoming projects include a book, Trifecta of Rejuvenation and Health. She was recently published on the cover of Vegan Health and Fitness Magazine, where she shared a health related article on making nutrition and fitness fun! In closing Dr. Angie would say, “I want to leave a legacy of a doctor who prevented disease in her patients using the mastery of combing integrative medicine, western and eastern medicine, rather than simply using pharmaceuticals.” \xa0 | Hosted by: Dr. Danielle Belardo Instagram:\xa0@theveggiemd Twitter:\xa0@theveggiemd Facebook:\xa0The Veggie MD Produced by:\xa0Dr. Kasey Johnson Instagram:\xa0@drkaseyjohnson \xa0 Nutrition Rounds is BACK!

Es posible que no se ha realizado, pero la forma en que se nos enseña a limpiar y la razón por la que hacemos la limpieza tiene implicaciones para la salud mental que pasan inadvertidamente porque se realizan de forma automática y / o diaria. Para muchas personas en nuestra comunidad, la limpieza es uno de los elementos que nos da estatus, o quizás una de las cosas sobre las que realmente tenemos control. Discutimos la vergüenza que ha tenido la limpieza, las inseguridades de pedir ayuda para la limpieza, o incluso contratar ayuda para la limpieza, de dónde proviene el resentimiento cuando hay una falta de ayuda, limpieza cuando se trata de niños y cómo reconciliar los estilos de limpieza con otros con quien vivimos con. Nuestra invitada: Lorena Salazar es una latina de primera generación criada en Inglewood California. Se especializa en hijos, adultos y parejas casadas que están cuidando a un adulto mayor y / o alguien con una enfermedad degenerativa como el Alzheimers, y práctica en Torrence, California. Ella creció en un hogar mexicano donde la salud mental nunca se hablo de o incluso se reconoció, sino que se vio como un "defecto personal" o característica personal. La madre de Lorena era una limpiadora de casa y se dio cuenta de que en realidad era un mecanismo de afrontamiento para los adultos en su hogar. Hasta hace poco no sé habido discusiones abiertamente de la salud mental en su familia.

It may not be realized but the manner in which we are taught to clean and why we clean has mental health implications that go unnoticed because it’s done on an automatic and/or daily basis. For a lot of people in our community, cleaning is one of the elements that gives us status, or perhaps one of the things that we truly have control over. We discuss the shame that cleaning has had, the insecurities of asking for cleaning help, or even hiring cleaning help, where resentment comes from when there is a lack of help, cleaning when it comes to children & how to reconcile cleaning styles with others you live with. Our Guest: Lorena Salazar is a first-generation Latina raised in Inglewood California. She specializes in adult children and spouses who are caring for an elder adult and/or someone with a degenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s, and has a practice in Torrence, CA. She grew up in a Mexican household where mental health was never addressed or even acknowledged, instead it was seen as a “personal flaw” or personal characteristic. Lorena’s mom was a housecleaner, and realized that it was actually coping mechanism for the adults in her home. It wasn’t until recently that mental health has been discussed openly in her family.

Did you all know that Less than 2% of teen moms earn a college degree by age 30? Roughly 229,715 teens between 15 and 19 became pregnant in 2015. Latinas have the highest teen-pregnancy rate of any group. The birth rate (per 1,000 girls) for white teens in California is nine, compared to a rate of 29 for Latina teens. As I mentioned though, the rates for teen pregnancies in our community is drastically decreasing and I think a large part of this is due to the openness and education that we are sharing as generations go by. In this episode, I go into what it was like to confront my ex\'s family, being in college with a son, what my schedule looked like, my dreams and wishes as a 20-year old, how I was stigmatized as a teen mom, and I give advice to parents who have teen mom daughters. There is often control because of their age, but I talk about the disservice and identity formation that is occurring.

Since 2007, the teen birth rate has declined by 58% for Latinx, compared with declines of 53% for African Americans and 47% for Caucasians. In this solo episode, I share my personal experience with getting pregnant at age 19 and becoming a single mother during my undergraduate schooling in Santa Barbara, CA. I discuss general and personal mental health effects, cultural beliefs and common mentalities that Latinx teens and their parents experience.\xa0 I also explore the barriers to sex education, such as family beliefs, shame, and Catholicism. I provide advice to young girls, parents and therapists. Next time I will continue with my story and talk about the collectivistic views with family postpartum\xa0 adjustment and the high status that is achieved with childbearing in the Latinx culture.\xa0 Resources: Teen Line https://teenlineonline.org/\xa0: 310-855-4673, or text TEEN to 839863 Birth Control Methods:\xa0https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/structured-content/#/Health_Topic_Birth_Control_Choosing_a_Method.xml Tool- Find the Right Method That Works for You:\xa0https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/birthcontrol/#/\xa0 Find Various Program for Parents & Teens:  https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/preventing/promoting/parenting/pregnant-teens/\xa0 WIC in CA for Free formula, diapers, healthy food, lactating classes & more:\xa0https://wicforfamilies.org/\xa0 Statistics were referenced from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_01.pdf Kost K, et al.

Prior to cholesterol adventures Dave was a senior software scientist and an engineer. He brings this “out of the box” thinking to the world of medicine and we are all better off for it.\xa0 He began a low-carb, high-fat diet in April 2015 and has since learned everything he could about it with special emphasis on cholesterol. He saw his own lipid numbers spike substantially after going on the diet and spotted a pattern in the lipid system that’s very similar to distributed objects in networks. He’s since learned quite a bit on the subject both through research and experimentation which has revealed some very powerful data.

He has a major interest in the preventative medicine and encourages his patients to lose weight before undergoing surgery. Although his speciality is surgery, Gary believes it is much better to help people avoid surgery by taking preventative measures, which often involves primarily altering the diet. He is an advocate of a Low Carbohydrate Healthy Fat (LCHF) lifestyle for the health benefits. He was “a fat kid” and has experienced ‘too many’ other health issues until changing his diet and lifestyle. He has concerns that as we get older the health systems will be under significant stress from financial and health burden aspects. It is simply unsustainable – a train crash in evolution. In recent years Gary has focussed on the role of diet in the development of diabetes, obesity and cancer. He has been speaking out internationally on the combined role of sugar, fructose, refined carbohydrates and polyunsaturated oils linking together to be behind inflammation and modern disease. Gary remains committed to understanding the central role of nutrition in everything ranging from our health issues to its role in influencing education, the environmental impact, economics, politics and belief systems. He has incurred the wrath of regulatory bodies for his stand on public health, but he and his wife, Belinda, remain active defending the benefits of low carb healthy fat living.

But did you know that the pill also has a huge impact on your brain chemistry, behavior and ultimately how you experience the world? Dr. Sarah Hill is a leading researcher in evolutionary psychology who has become fascinated with the effects of birth control on our psychology and health.\xa0 After experiencing post-birth control syndrome first hand, Dr. Sarah realized that the pill had altered how her brain functioned and her experience as a human being. Since then Dr. Sarah has worked to understand the way the pill changes the brain and provide women context into what is going on with birth control so that they can make informed decisions about their health. On this episode we are digging into exactly how the birth control pill impacts your brain functioning, hormones, mood and outlook on life, examining why it has become commonplace for practitioners to prescribe birth control as a one-size-fits-all medical bandaid, and the potential harm that the birth control pill is having on women without them knowing it.\xa0 Hormonal birth control can influence everything from your zest and vibrancy for life, to who you are attracted to and your likelihood of depression or suicide. It is important for you to equip yourself with the knowledge you need to make a decision that is right for you and your health. Your brain, decisions, stress, and behavior are all impacted by the messages you are sending them, and birth control is a key message that you do not want to overlook.\xa0 Have you experienced a shift in your personality, motivation or overall outlook on life pre or post-birth control? Share your experience with the pill with us in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “It just all of a sudden hit me like a lightning bolt. The pill changes everything because it changes what the brain does.” (12:43) “Something like the birth control pill doesn't seem like a big deal because we only think about hormones in terms of how they influence things like endometrial lining proliferation or something like that. Without thinking about this as something that plays a key role in what my brain is doing in creating the experience of being me.” (15:45) “We need to be given the full picture of what the pill does to our bodies from head to toe, and especially our brain if we are going to be making informed decisions about our health.” (24:42) “I wish doctors and medical research would understand how important fertility regulation is to us because we do these things even though it's not good for us because of the fear.” (37:02) “If we are going to be making informed decisions about our health, we need to know what it is that our body is going to be doing, and who we are going to be. Because it changes what our brain is doing, and it changes who we are.” (43:46) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Dr. Sarah Hill Website This Is Your Brain on Birth Control by Dr. Sarah Hill Follow Dr. Sarah on Facebook | Instagram | Twitter EY 60: Dr. Jolene Brighten EY 93: Dr. Lisa Hendrickson-Jack Register for the EO Hormone Summit Here \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  Examining the conversation around the taxation and profitability of menstrual products Tips to get more involved in advocacy and how to commit to policy change Ways that you can get your legislators talking about the economics of menstruation How to embrace the political aspect of periods and remove the stigma Exploring the lack of access to menstruation products in America and on a global scale  \xa0 Episode Summary Did you know that there are women in the US right now who cannot afford or gain access to menstrual supplies? The passion to bring awareness to menstrual product accessibility for women and girls all over the world is one I share with today's guest, Jennifer Weiss-Wolf. A gender, politics and menstruation advocate, attorney and the architect of the US campaign to squash the tampon tax, Jennifer is taking her dedication and expertise to the policies and laws that we live our lives by.\xa0 Over a dozen states have taken action towards menstrual accessibility in the past four years since Jennifer started working on this issue, and 32 have taken steps to eliminate the tampon tax. Jennifer is moving the needle in policy and actually moving lawmakers to action through vocabulary, framework, tools, and most importantly, support from women like you.\xa0 Jennifer works to open up the conversation around the lack of access to menstrual products in the United States, and wants to ensure that menstruating does not pose an obstacle in people's lives regardless of their age, race, or social status. By putting the issues around menstruation in front of legislators in a way they can understand, Jennifer expresses her civic duty to get everyone fully engaged in the conversation.\xa0 It is time to change how menstruation exists in our public spheres and change the policy our government creates in order to accomplish global and locally appropriate solutions. Our current policies and laws do not reflect our wellbeing or our reality, and it is only through becoming involved in advocacy that you can be more represented in your legal structures and in turn push the issues you believe in into the limelight.\xa0 How do you work to normalize the discussion around menstruation and impact systemic change? Share how you feel about removing the stigma around periods in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “I really sort of turned my attention to where my interest lied and where my skills could be most useful, and that was really in thinking about how we change the policies and laws by which we live to better reflect and represent all of us.” (12:33) “It's not just a few unfortunates who can't afford these products, its that our entire systems are actually built and structured to not ensure equality and to not ensure equal opportunity for those who need it the most.” (16:16) “If anything about menstruation, access to products, access to safe products or otherwise, inhibited or kept people from doing so, well then it was our obligation to right that wrong.” (22:40) “Its been sort of extraordinarily high energy and really really exciting to be previewing and going public with these arguments that we have been toiling over for the past several years.” (33:06) “For the 5 years that I have been doing this, I have to say my mind has just kind of been on fire since all of this. It's just completely opened my eyes to an entire way of thinking and advocating and communicating and existing that is so much better than the 47 that lead up to it.” (40:48) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Periods Gone Public by Jennifer Weiss-Wolf Follow Jennifer on Twitter Tax Free.

And that really is the frontier right now.” (21:18) “It's not about how busy my practice is, it's not about how good of a surgeon I am or what the result is, but sometimes all it really takes is holding somebody's hand and telling her it is going to be okay. And that sometimes is the true essence of medicine.” (30:44) “There is so much that you can do, but it really does start with all the advice you give about diet, about cleaning up your environment, cause that's really what starts the whole process to true health and true beauty because it is all holistic in the end.” (38:04) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Dr. Tony Youn Website The Holistic Plastic Surgery Show Playing God: The Evolution of a Modern Surgeon by Dr. Anthony Youn The Age Fix with Dr. Anthony Youn Follow Dr. Youn on Facebook | Instagram Michael Todd Beauty Sonicsmooth \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  The secrets to building a high energy body naturally\xa0 Practical strategies to gain a handle on your chronic fatigue\xa0 Understanding what adrenal fatigue is and how it is misrepresented Exploring the role conventional medicine plays in the treatment of fatigue Getting to the root cause of your fatigue through mitochondrial support and efficiency  \xa0 Episode Summary After over a year of researching adrenal fatigue and the science of how our body makes energy, Ari Whitten has come to a few revolutionary conclusions. First, while adrenal fatigue may not be real, your symptoms are. And it is important to get to the root cause of what is impacting your cortisol levels, even if it is not what you thought it was.\xa0 The creator of The Energy Blueprint, Ari has dedicated his life to studying the production of energy and helping educate others to optimize their mitochondrial function. An expert in chronic fatigue, mitochondrial function, detoxification and metabolism, Ari is here to paint a cohesive picture of what is going on inside the cells that are causing you to feel fatigued, and what you can do to stop and even reverse it.\xa0 If you are accustomed to burnout and think you just need to deal with it, Ari provides tips to tell you how you can overcome your fatigue and increase your energy levels naturally and sustainably. Energy is everything, and what is driving your energy is driving your cellular function, so it is crucial that you know what is going on.\xa0 When you connect the dots between adrenal fatigue, cortisol levels, misrepresentation, and unique symptoms, you can start to piece together a picture of your unique optimal functioning. Symptoms, cortisol levels, and hormonal imbalances can be tough to navigate, but with Ari’s simple Energy Blueprint you can enable your mitochondria to become more resilient and set yourself up for success. How does your level of energy change throughout the day? Have you considered looking at the root of your symptoms instead of just covering it up with the bandaid of adrenal fatigue? Share your experience with us in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “Fundamentally, conventional medicine is looking at sickness and sort of trying to study sickness as a path to health. And you don't get healthy by trying to undo sickness.” (12:57) “I basically just decided, you know what, I am going to do the most comprehensive review of the scientific literature on this topic that has ever been done, and then I am just going to communicate the objective facts of those findings.” (22:23) “There is absolutely, in this whole body of evidence, there is no real indication of any burnout of the adrenal glands or any actual inability to produce cortisol.” (26:06) “Fatigue is actually an intelligent symptom, it's adaptive, it’s part of our body's healing response. It becomes pathological when it's chronic, but it's important to understand fatigue as your body being stuck in a mode where it feels not safe enough to be in peacetime metabolism and energy production mode.” (35:38) “Most people know melatonin as a sleep hormone, but here is what they don't know. Melatonin is the most potent protector of your mitochondria in existence, it is the most powerful mitochondrial antioxidant known to man.” (44:51) \xa0 Resources Mentioned The Energy Blueprint The Energy Blueprint Podcast The Energy Blueprint Free Masterclass \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  The role personal responsibility plays in the self-care you do every day Tips to build daily healthy exercise and diet habits at home in 30 days How to use ‘flawsome’ and give yourself the grace to be less than perfect Ways to tune into your body and use resistance as your greatest teacher Doing a little something instead of all or nothing to find greater success  \xa0 Episode Summary The all or nothing mentality that so many of us have towards life and fitness is not healthy.

You think well ‘I see the way these models look and I’m going to do what they’re doing because they look happy, they look beautiful, they're getting the validation’. And I was sold on a system that doesn't really exist. It's fake.” (9:33) “When you start to think about your body as your friends, and all of these amazing cells in your body, all of them are dedicated to the purpose of you every single day. You start to just recognize your own responsibility in loving and caring for this amazing body that you have.” (14:55) “I really think that the things that make us ‘ugly’, whatever our greatest wounds are, they are also our greatest gifts, they are the things that make us unique, and they are also the things that make you special.” (21:04) “We take the knowledge that we have and filter it through our own personal filter and thinking system, and we want to deliver it in a way that really meets someone where they are at at this moment, and create space for them to expand within it.” (31:54) “No matter where we are, we are shaped by the things that have come before us. And some of those things are negative, and some of those things are positive, but using the sort of method that I just described, you can take the best things from all of which you have been given, all of which you have experienced, and you are the creator of your own life.” (39:12) \xa0 Resources Mentioned Free 30-Day Make Fat Cry Challenge The Betty Rocker Website The Betty Rocker Blog Follow The Betty Rocker on Instagram EY 100: Dr. Mariza \xa0 Other Resources: The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Check out the full show notes page Keep up with everything Dr. Mariza Follow Dr. Mariza on\xa0Facebook\xa0|\xa0Instagram\xa0|\xa0Twitter\xa0|\xa0Youtube | What we're talking about in this episode  Going on the journey to rediscover your true calling How stress and trauma can have a huge effect on people’s health The body’s ability to balance its natural lifeforce when it needs to heal The difference between situational trauma and developmental traumas and why the distinction matters How to listen to and trust the various parts of your inner-self What it takes to clear the trauma in your system so that the body can heal itself  \xa0 Episode Summary Each and every one of us is dealing with trauma. When trauma, no matter how severe, is left unattended it can spiral into all kinds of illness. Dr. Lissa Rankin has studied this connection from many different perspectives and understands how to address it to regain control over your health. Dr. Lissa Rankin is a New York Times best-selling author, a speaker, physician, mystic, creator of The Daily Flame, and founder of the Whole Health Medicine Institute. Passionate about what makes people optimally healthy and what predisposes them to illness, she discovered that connecting with your “Inner Pilot Light” is essential to optimal health, making your body ripe for miracles. Lissa takes us on her incredible journey into integrative medicine which combines her passions for science and spirituality. She has made it her mission to study and explore how trauma-induced stress makes us sick and how to heal from it. To that end, Lissa describes how our bodies’ natural ability to heal takes place when we address the underlying trauma that we’ve experienced and listen to all various inner-parts of ourselves that need to be heard in order to thrive. Have you taken steps to clear the trauma in your system? Let’s talk about it in the comments on the episode page. \xa0 Quotes “Twelve years of learning to follow my inner pilot light has completely reorganized my entire life and my entire world-view.” [10:00] “More than ninety percent of doctor visits are related to stress and yet we’re not talking about where the stress comes from and most of it comes from trauma.” [12:58] “As long as the lifeforce is moving in the body, then the body’s wisdom or natural intelligence will know how to distribute that lifeforce to heal whatever might be getting out of whack.” [17:42] “I think we’re in the process of turning medicine upside down.” [44:51] \xa0 Resources Mentioned Find Dr. Lissa Rankin online at Inner Pilot Whole Health Medicine Institute The Anatomy of a Calling by Dr. Lissa Rankin MindBodyGreen Summit 2019 IFS Annual Conference Center for Self Leadership, IFS Advanced Integrative Therapy Institute, AIT Radical Remission by Kelly A.

That’s what I was diagnosed with a decade ago. Our adrenals are hormones produced in a set of glands near our kidneys. But here’s the deal, chronic fatigue doesn’t actually start there - it begins up in our limbic, or survival, brain. For those of you who’ve struggled with this type of chronic fatigue, today’s episode might just change your life. I’m taking a deep dive into the myths surrounding adrenal fatigue. I explain what it really is and what’s going on that makes you feel so tired all the time, and how you can heal from all the burnout.\xa0 Today I’m speaking from both personal and professional experience to explain what is known, not known, and incorrectly assumed about adrenal systems and adrenal fatigue. I discuss what triggers many of the common problems of cortisol imbalance and what you can do about it. You’re going to walk away from this episode with the knowledge to be more empowered about taking control of your energy. Do you have any systems to help cope with the stress and fatigue in your life? Let’s talk about it in the comments on the episode page! \xa0 Quotes “Without knowing what’s really going on we can’t actually focus on the appropriate area of concern in the body. If your adrenals are incorrectly getting blamed, then they are unfortunately getting misdiagnosed and could potentially be treated in some cases which could lead to bigger issues.” [5:07] “What we know now is that adrenal function isn’t actually impaired at all. It’s that our body and brain are regulating the cortisol response system based on how much stress we’re dealing with.” [15:16] “On any given day we can be triggered by perceived stress fifty plus times. Yikes! That’s a lot of stressors hitting our body on a constant daily basis.” [19:43] “Perceived stress is the one thing that we can really get control over and it’s also the one thing that when we don’t have control over can lead to a lot of gasoline on the inflammatory fire.” [24:53] \xa0 Resources Mentioned Top 10 Energy-Boosting Remedies The Essential Oils Hormone Solution by Dr. Mariza Snyder Episode 120 with Dr. Carrie Jones Precision Analytical DUTCH Hormone Test The Role of Stress and the HPA Axis in Chronic Disease Management by Thomas G.

In April, Emily made her marathon debut at the London Marathon, where she ran a 2:23, finishing in sixth place and becoming the seventh-fastest U.S. woman ever at the marathon distance. It was also the second-fastest marathon debut by an American woman. This summer, Emily competed in the 10,000 meters at USA Track & Field Nationals, and landed a spot on the U.S. world team. She\'ll head to Doha later this month to represent the United States. On this episode, Emily reflects on her breakout year and talks about what\'s next, including where her head is at leading up to the 2020 Olympic Marathon Trials in February.

Yet when there\'s a definite mood cycle -- when one energy level of mood becomes apparent, either a too up or too down, and then another eventually takes it place -- this can earn the diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder if certain criteria are met. I\'ll talk about what Bipolar II is exactly and relay the stories of two people with Bipolar Disorder, Julie Kraft and Jennifer Marshall, both well-known advocates for talking openly about mental illness. And I\'ll focus on what are termed "triggers" and how to manage them, so that you learn how to take care of yourself during those times.

Unconditional love\xa0\xa0often gets the thumbs up as the best or most selfless kind of love to have. Parents certainly want to welcome their children into the world with unconditional love. But there can be a problem when, as an adult, you don\'t set boundaries at all, and "loving unconditionally" can be manipulated fairly easily. Then there\'s conditional love, when love will be withdrawn if certain expectations aren’t followed. The boundaries or expectations themselves are manipulative, but often don\'t feel like they are. Why? Because they\'re couched in terms of "closeness" or "loyalty." I\'ll give several examples of conditional love and you can see if you recognize it in your own life. So your selfwork today is to look at the boundaries in your own relationships. Are the boundaries clear and respected, or perhaps not so much? The listener email for today is from someone who defines herself as a "people pleaser" and asks how she can change that particular pattern.

And today, let\'s look into seven distorted beliefs that are going to justify or support you staying isolated, and even convince you that you\'re better off being alone. But loneliness and isolation are part and parcel of depression\'s hold on you. I know how real these voices can seem. I know how hard they are to fight off, especially when your mind isn’t helping you. But I\'m going to use my version of common-sense psychology to see where challenging those beliefs might lead you. What are these beliefs?  I can’t be around other people; they just make me mad. No one would understand. I’m burdening others if I talk about my pain. People have disappointed me, and I just can’t be hurt anymore. People don’t want to hear that I’m depressed again. I don’t care anymore. If I have to ask for it, it’s not the same  Do you hear yourself or someone you love? Then I hope today\'s episode will shake those beliefs up.

A young woman used the SpeakPipe feature of the podcast (see below..) and \xa0asks about how to move from what she terms “self-hatred” to “self-love." And the last is from a man who’s tried therapist after therapist, but now realizes that he tried to be the perfect patient and never revealed parts of himself that might show him in a vulnerable light.

It\'s an event, fact or feeling-- past or present -- that can\'t, for some mysterious or not so mysterious reason, be acknowledged. It seems impossible or too risky or too painful to talk about. So you walk around it. Avoid it. Throw a sheet over it. We all have what are called "defense mechanisms" to deal with what stresses us too much. It can be as simple as distraction (which can get a bad rap by some in psychology) which can entertain you, get your mind off something difficult. Or you can flat out deny it, meaning that you don\'t allow yourself to see or admit the reality of that stressful elephant. Then there are more complex defenses, such as projection or compartmentalization. So today, we\'re talking about how you defend yourself from stress -- not a bad thing at all in moderation. It\'s only problematic when it\'s your only option to handle stress -- or tame the elephant. Our listener email is from a teenager whose mom has two completely different ways of being and is trying to understand how to approach her.

I\'ll talk today about how motivation -- understanding why you\'re working toward certain goals and the importance of not depending on shame to move toward those goals, as it will only sabotage your attempts in the end. The listener email is from someone who sought therapy in the past but hasn\'t as of yet had a successful experience.

Important Links: Book by Mark Mason\xa0The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F__k– Important link: Mark Manson on Self-Discipline \xa0 | Welcome. If you\'ve listened to the previous episode, you know that explaining depression as a "chemical imbalance" is far too simple for such a complex process. Today I\'m once again using a  very well-written article by a team at Harvard as a guide. Today we\'ll focus on the\xa0 non-neurological factors that have a tremendous influence on whether or not you could become depressed -- specifically stress, trauma, medical illnesses and medications themselves. And I throw in some of my own observations and thoughts. And as always, there\'s a focus on treatment -- or what you can do about it. The listener email format is different today! On my website (and within the show notes) there’s now an icon from SpeakPipe which invites you to leave me a message for use on the podcast. This listener\'s question is a poignant one. She and her husband have been booted out of her daughter\'s life, who seems to have a history of significant emotional problems and is in therapy. So the question is how this mother could approach this very painful estrangement from her daughter as she wonders if the therapy itself is encouraging this behavior.

It was toxic. We eventually parted ways and I got sober. Two years later while I was working for VICE, I got a call that Kevin needed help.

Recently Jordan had surgery to help with crazy jaw pain caused by bacteria from Lyme disease. That kind of surgery is really painful, and Jordan was taking a pain medication called Tramadol. 24 hours after the surgery Jordan also took a lot of chlorella and a THC/CBD pill, and this caused a reaction where she felt like all her organs were shutting down. Jordan didn’t know this but Tramadol and THC should never be taken together. This can cause a heart attack, stroke and even death. For the rest of the week Jordan was exhausted, in a lot of pain and terrified by the experience. She journaled, meditated and came to the conclusion that she wanted to put more energy into healing for her wedding in November and for her life in general. Jordan plans to be back with the podcast early next year. In the meantime, she’s re-releasing eight of her favorite episodes from this year. Her course, Waking Back Up To Your Own Soul, will be launching again sometime in September. Jordan will also be trying bee venom therapy and working on another book.\xa0 \xa0 We’d like to thank HUM Nutrition!

Nothing worked until a chiropractor suggested she drink apple cider vinegar, and then the glands returned to their normal size in a week. These and other experiences led to Kelly’s keen interest in holistic healing modalities and the making of her documentary, Heal, which is now on Netflix.

That’s a huge problem for the military, and for the country. Many drugs that are taken in the US are taken by children and adolescents. A percentage of those drugs are disqualifying for military service. Some of the drugs cause side effects that cause weight gain and lethargy which are also, ultimately, disqualifying for military selection. If we don’t get ourselves healthy as a Country from the youth on up, we face some serious problems. If the adults don’t lead from the front, the children will fall from behind.\xa0 Obesity, drug use, mental health disorders, and so many more issues plague our youth, and yet, in many ways, our military special forces represent an equal, opposite. The reverence that our Special Operators in the military are held in can make these extraordinary men and women seem virtually unattainably virtuous.\xa0 In this interview with Dr. Sean, Lt. Colonel Heath Kern breaks down what it takes to go from every day American to American Hero, and you might be surprised what he says.\xa0  US Air Force Special Ops  Minute Breakdown: 0-10 - What’s at stake? 11-20 - The joy of living a life to your calling. 21-30 - Do different branches of the military get along? 31-40 - How do you reconcile wanting to serve and not wanting to need war to do it? 41-49 - What are we going to do about health issues facing the country?

I get thousands of people who apply every year to shadow me or intern at my gym "CHALK" here in Orange County. I always say no. However, I finally had someone walk in and introduce themselves that I happen to like and I said yes for once. To give him the best experience possible and in efforts to answer any questions he may have, I had him interview me and ask whatever he wants. I said "nothing is off limits" and he absolutely killed it. Lots of great business stuff, personal stuff, and a bunch of hilarious banter. This show needed to happen for a while.

You will appreciate the parallels between cheap dark chocolate and cheap wine or cheap beer.

At 22-years-old he used his gift of writing to start writing books based on the wisdom he’d gained from life. At 25-years-old he went on the Oprah Winfrey Show, Tyra Banks Show, and the 700 Club telling different portions of his life story. He exposed his mistakes and turned them into lessons. Everything from being toxic in relationships to living the street life with his cousins. Tony allowed his pain to birth his purpose. Then at 26 he was called on by the NBA, NFL, and NCAA to speak to athletes about life, love, and responsibility as young adults.\xa0 As a result of of Tony’s message going viral online, he’s amassed 3 million supporters who enjoy his very real and raw delivery of life’s wisdom.

Similarly, blood sugar handling can be a stubborn challenge which may even resist diligent attempts to manage through diet alone. \xa0 What if there was an ingredient of your daily routine that our ancestors (and therefore our evolving physiology) partook in as part of their lifestyle which is missing from your modern existence that could help solve these challenges?\xa0 Something so simple, that takes no extra time in your day, but helps to ease the aches and pains of daily life and optimizes blood glucose issues - all while resting?\xa0 Sounds good, right?! \xa0 The concept of Archetypal Rest Postures was first described by the Osteopath & Acupuncturist, Phillip Beach, back in the 1990’s, and full descriptions of them are available in Phill’s book “Muscles & Meridians – the manipulation of shape” and in Matt Wallden’s Rehabilitation chapter in the textbook “Naturopathic Physical Medicine”. \xa0 In these papers, published in the most recent edition of Elsevier’s prestigious Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies, we describe how the disconnect between how we rested for millions of years, and how we rest in a modern environment may be a key factor in contributing to persistent tension in various muscles we use for sports and activities of daily living; and also how this may impair healing mechanisms, especially in tendon injury. \xa0 Similarly, applying an evolutionary lens to this natural way of resting may provide insight into why it really makes little sense that our ancestors would have needed a full stretching warm-up before allowing the Sabre-tooth to chase them (as any athlete seems to need today before competing)!!\xa0 Could it be that these archetypal rest postures were nature’s way of keeping the body “tuned up” and balanced ready for activity at the drop of a hat… or the snap of a twig?! \xa0 This would all seem to make good sense; but what may be less expected is the fact that several research papers have now shown that stretching (and in particular passive stretching) across a period of weeks has a balancing effect on blood sugar control. Who would have thought that essentially “doing nothing” other than sitting using archetypal rest postures could be enough to help balance blood sugar?\xa0 Exercising – yes, that seems to make good sense, but resting?! \xa0 The key, though, is that resting using archetypal rest postures is a natural way of stretching a variety of muscle groups and connective tissues, but none of the rest postures is inherently comfortable.\xa0 The end result?\xa0 You move!\xa0 You squat down and, after a few minutes, it gets uncomfortable, so you may put one knee down on the ground (half squat, half kneel), but give that a couple of minutes and you want to move; so you may switch to full kneeling.\xa0 After a few minutes kneeling, this becomes uncomfortable, so you switch to sitting cross-legged and so on.\xa0 Each posture stretches a different set of muscles and fascia and each provides both a healing stimulus and an opportunity for blood to flow into different muscle groups and to increase glucose uptake within the muscle.\xa0 The upshot of this is better blood sugar control. \xa0 So, finding ways to build these postures into your daily routine is the key to realising the benefits of them.\xa0 Finding or building a workstation to allow you to tap out emails from a floor-based position is one simple solution.\xa0 Coffee tables tend to work well for this kind of scenario, some height-adjustable desks may go low enough for this, but also there are an array of display stands that can be adjusted to the perfect height for your working conditions such as\xa0here.\xa0 Similarly, those playing computer games, watching endless hours of YouTube, social media or who enjoy TV; these archetypal rest postures can be adopted for the (on average) 5 hours per day this is happening.\xa0 Imagine that, a no-time impact, no effort means of helping balance the body’s biomechanics and its blood sugar management! \xa0 If you like the sound of that, then you can dive deeper into the details of the discussion on connective tissue, blood sugar and archetypal rest postures in the two papers. \xa0 SELECTED LINKS: \xa0 • Modern Disintegration - Primal Connectivity, Editorial Paper:\xa0https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Z3KO4rR6wMn9r • Biomechanical Attractors - A Paleolithic Prescription for Tendinopathy & Glycemic Control, Practical Paper:\xa0https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Z3KO4rR6wMnA1 \xa0 \xa0 The first podcast (released June 29th) is on Matt Wallden’s FC2O (from chaos to order) podcast available\xa0here.\xa0\xa0 |  Host\xa0Brad\xa0Kearns welcomes Dude Spellings back to the show.

For example, let’s say you have an in-law who treats you like a punching bag, or your partner is hurting your feelings on a daily basis, or you have a volatile sibling who speaks to you terribly. It can be really disorienting, especially if you’ve been taking this for a really long time. Plus, with intimate relationships there’s often a trade-off that makes this even more complicated: if this relationship also provides you with rent, or your spouse doesn’t share your hurt perspective – you might feel guilty about having the feelings that you have. Caveat: this topic has some overlap with domestic violence but I am not addressing people who are victims of domestic violence. Why? Because in your situation, your physical safety is of primary concern and some of the tools I am offering might threaten that safety. For you I recommend you head to: thehotline.org or google your local domestic violence resource. And know that if you are in a relationship that you have been unable to leave – then know that it’s HARD but it’s not impossible. I’ve read that it takes an average of 7 to 8 times to leave – so whatever you do, don’t give up. As with all my episdes, there are three parts – the what, why and how the tools. To make a donation and for more of my work, head to YayWithMe.com xo! | This was inspired by a friend of mine saying, “I’m not too many steps from a crazy person.” That really resonated with me – because it’s true. When life unravels, it’s really easy – and rapid – to get to a point of being completely leveled. Where we have no tools, where we are grasping, begging, underfoot, feeling desperate and worthless. Or crazy. Or like a mess, like life is a mess – like we fucked everything up. No one loves us, etc. So this is a preventative episode about “building your mental house right” – and you’ll hear more about that in the episode. I hope you enjoy!

Apologies for the lag in postings…I have had some super intense hours as of late. But it will lighten up very soon. This is an episode all about the deeper and perhaps more logical causes of depression and anxiety. It’s inspired by a book I just read – which is BRILLIANT. Link at the bottom of the notes.Here’s the gist: Depression and anxiety are both forms of disconnection. We are cut off from things we need as humans – they are basic needs that we don’t realize we have. Because we live in the bubble of culture! You don’t realize how much that culture affects your world view and your habits; the thoughts and feelings you about yourself. If you want to do an experiment to see how conditioned you are by the various facets of culture, I invite you to watch a movie from 10 years ago. We don’t realize the messages we are receiving all the time and the power of those messages.A lot of our cultural depression is a literal mourning of consistent life experiences that we are meant to have– things that are vital to our baseline as humans. These needs aren’t being properly recognized, addressed, and or processed. I think – because a lot of people don’t know how REAL and NECESSARY they are! Back in the day, life was kind of set up around these basic needs – we had smaller villages where everyone had a role, and you were close to your family. Community networks kind of sustained everyone in these really core human needs. The isolation that we now experience – paired with the focus on external possessions really keeps us all in a state of chasing. So if you are struggling with a sense of chronic emptiness and you cannot see a logical cause, this episode is for you. And more importantly – this book is for you – it’s called “Lost Connections.” https://amzn.to/2SxK4WMFor more of my work, to send comments, or make a donation, head to YayWithMe.com – and as with all my episodes – take what helps and leave the rest!!

It’s basically how to widen your capacity for resiliency via grounding yourself in moments you are getting out of whack. This one is based on a lengthy training I had and it’s meant to be done in person - one-on-one, so hopefully it translates somewhat!

When this person is there, they feel drained and irritated – so these are some tools for a similar situation. This is a very difficult (and sadly, common) experience – the gist is how to manage the experience of being around a triggering person if you’re still working on your shit in therapy.

You might just think you have a high bar and believe in excellence. A lot of perfectionists think that there’s nothing wrong about their high standards. And I would agree with them – unless you are robbing yourself of health, wellness, and happiness. By that I mean – are you unknowingly running yourself into the ground? OR are you possibly robbing yourself of enjoyment and balance in life? Perfectionism is like a helmet you wear through life because it alters your experience of everything: it alters how you feel, how you behave, and what you can appreciate.

A lot of the reason we start to freak out is we get stuck in a state of anticipation: we start to foreshadow negative consequences, imagining how bad something will be – we actively live suffering in our minds.

The best part of this episode is def the tools! So if you're curious and also impatient, skip to part 3 - the tools. This is a request from a listener– it’s somewhat related to the self-sabotage podcast. The listener pointed out that when you are self-sabotaging you are attempting to control what will be – because the anxiety is too great. Once you know this is happening for you, how do you let go of the future and stop trying to control it? It’s a toughy, but I’m going to do my best!The audiobook I mention in this episode can be found here:https://amzn.to/2VGMySYFor comments, to make a donation or to read more of my work, head to YayWithMe.com xo! | This is for anyone out there who is dating and they are struggling with letting go of the people who don’t text you back.

So – it’s for the mind-boggling stage of dating where nothing makes sense and there seems to be no structure or logic and you feel like a crazy person with no power. And every decision is decided by the focus group that is your friend group. This one is for Ty (‘s friend). Hope this helps!

The immortal bard Dalton from Roadhouse might have been onto something. This episode the hosts are joined by three experts in the field of performance, rehab and pain science. Nick Licameli of 3DMJ (PT, DPT), Quinn Henoch of Clinical Athlete (DPT) and Jordan Feigenbaum of Barbell Medicine (MD, MS) discuss the current status of pain science, injury reduction, and managing setbacks.

He is joined by fellow Sacramento natives Alan Thrall, Silent Mike, and Jim McDonald. A seemingly small city tucked away in Northern California, the soon to be infamous SacTown Boys explore the reasons why Sacramento has made such a strong impact inside the lifting community. From weightlifting legend Tommy Kono to Body Tribe in the present, Sacramento is home to a vibrant, diverse lifting community. The conversation also explores starting your own business, traversing the fitness industry and why Iron Culture is the world's friendliest Cult. | Over the last three decades, Randall Strossen was there for it all. World records in weightlifting at the Olympics and world championships, incredible performances at the Highland games world championships and the worlds strongest man; if he wasn’t behind the lens as a photographer, he might have been the commentator, or written about the performances in Milo magazine or in his sport psychology column in Ironman magazine which ran for 12 years. Randall has a Ph.D. in psychology, founded IronMind in 1988, and Milo magazine in 1993. Thousands of lifters have seen what level of IronMind Captains of Crush grippers they could close, most serious strength athletes from prior decades owned a copy of his book Super Squats, and he took every iconic picture that adorns the covers of Milo magazine, which ran for 25 years from until 2018. Sit back and marvel at the rich iron game experiences and personal insights that Dr. Strossen had to share with Omar and Eric on this episode of Iron Culture. | Is Iron Culture big enough for two pro natural bodybuilders with PhDs named Eric (or was it Derek)? The banter heats up as metabolisms cool down this week as the cult leaders are joined by Dr Eric Trexler to discuss metabolic adaptation. Why is weight loss difficult to sustain? What is adaptive thermogenesis, the phenomenon we call metabolic adaptation colloquially? Is it the cause of our fat loss woes, or are it’s effects overhyped? If it is overhyped, what really are the barriers to successful fat loss and fat loss maintenance? Join us on this episode as we discuss all of the above. | Doping: the topic every 19 year old in the YouTube comments section seems to be an expert on. Maybe it’s more complicated and nuanced than the local internet culture would have you believe? In this episode, we have Ph.D. candidate Alex Kolliari-Turner on Iron Culture. He is a true expert in this field, doing his Ph.D. research on the long term effects of anabolic steroids on muscle. His research examining the impacts of steroids on anabolic signaling pathways and potential permanent retention of myonuclei may have wide-reaching impacts on how we view doping, doping detection and the concept of being “drug-free”. In addition to the hard science, Eric and Omar discuss with Alex advancements in anti-doping, how retrospective testing is changing the face of elite sport, and how different sport cultures, societies, and governmental structures impact how commonplace doping is, the reason and pressures behind the decision to dope, the source of doping, and its sophistication.\xa0 \xa0 Email: A.Kolliari-Turner@brighton.ac.uk Advertisement on Instagram: alex_k_t Advertisement on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217450912977043&set=a.1014102405124&type=3&theater The papers he used in the discussion of the Podcast:\xa0 Hoffman et al 2009 Position stand on androgen and human growth hormone use Kanayama & Pope 2018 History and epidemiology of anabolic androgens in athletes and non-athletes | In this episode, Eric & Omar are joined by firebrand Chip Conrad.

Combining aspects of different disciplines from strongman to yoga, Chip is a rare thinker and teacher. Listen to how he redefines what strength means, what the point of lifting is and the merit of early Van Halen.  PS www.chipconrad.com (it'll be a real thing soon, we promise) | In this episode, Eric and Omar are joined by one of the most celebrated, revered and respected pro natural bodybuilders, Brian Whitacre. Brian is a legendary figure, historically being the first to win both the WNBF Worlds and Yorton Cup Overalls the same year in 2015. The hosts discuss natural bodybuilding, economics and what it takes to be a champion. Listen up, you might be surprised. | Brian Minor, MS, pro natural bodybuilder and national level USAPL raw powerlifter, is not only an impressive dual-sport strength and physique athlete, but he’s also top of the bodybuilding and Powerlifting coaching game. As a thought leader in the evidence-based strength and physique community, he does an excellent job putting context and application to theory to help move practice forward. Join us in this episode as we get into the nitty-gritty of what progressive overload really means with Brian, and how it’s often misunderstood. | At the edges of scientific understanding, pseudoscience is bred and born. When a topic is studied, but not yet understood, marketers plant the seeds of hype to suck you in. “This one weird trick”, “doctors hate him”, “the herb the FDA doesn’t want you to have”. The emerging field of gut health is an arena rife with such quackery. Fortunately, we have Dr. Gabrielle Fundaro as a guiding light. She has a Ph.D. in human nutrition, is a competitive strength and physique athlete, and was a professor at Georgia Gwinnett College before joining Renaissance Periodization as a coach and science communicator. As a gut health researcher and professional, she joins Omar and Eric to uncover the myths and truths, and to discuss how pseudoscience forms.", 'chan_desc': 'Iron Culture was started by Eric Helms and Omar Isuf as a means of exploring the world of physical culture and attempting to distill a unified philosophy of lifting and to help listeners find greater meaning from the iron. The lifting community has become fractured over the last ~70 years and this Podcast will attempt to explore the fundamental threads that unite these different tribes.  The Podcast focuses on dispensing practical, useful information to the listener, bouncing from history, to philosophy, to contemporary lifting culture issues, to science. This can range from teaching the audience about lifting, programming, nutrition, supplements/PEDs and the history of lifting culture. The format includes casual conversations between the two hosts on a variety of topics, discussions with a panel of experts and interviews with authoritative figures in the lifting community.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/72/c7/a6/72c7a667-29d6-cb28-e7b0-5533d3c57bf5/mza_8341552842147837172.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-02-08'}}

Are Low Calories OK In Keto? [2:41] Lee Anne says: Hi Robb, A question maybe for a podcast. We have all heard the stories of people eating very low fat and low calorie diets to lose weight (think Biggest Loser). They later gain the weight back and can no longer eat as much as they used to and maintain as their metabolism is messed up. I am wondering if there is any science behind a low calorie (800-1000) per day hurting your metabolism? My thinking is if you are getting enough nutrients between food and supplements within the 800 calories - plus you body is "eating" your fat stores - would there not be any negative effects? Would love to hear you thoughts! I was not able to find anything relating to this on the web. I have always tried to stick to a small calorie deficit (eating around 1600-1800 per day). And while successful, lower calories would probably speed up weight loss. I have lost about 60lbs following your plan and still have another 100 to go. Thanks and love everything you do! Thanks for changing my life! Lee Anne Hesbacher Keto Masterclass student \xa0 \xa0 2. Weighted Blankets? [11:28] Steven says: Hey Robb, I\'ve been hearing a lot about weighted blankets lately in relation to calming anxiety and improving quality of sleep. Do you have any experience with these? Any idea if they would be a good sleep hygiene hack for someone who just wants to optimize sleep? Love the podcast! -Steven \xa0  Click here to check out the Chilipads I mention in this answer. GAME CHANGER for sleep.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 3. Keto and Bowel Movements? [13:26] Amanda says: Hi! My question today is on keto and bowel movements. I\'ve been keto for over five months (thanks to the Keto Masterclass) and paleo for almost 7 years. I love the philosophy of how do you look, feel and perform and have seen improvements in all those categories since first becoming paleo and then keto. My question is on bowel movements while on keto; what is normal and what is a red flag? As you have stressed, supplementation with electrolytes is key and I was taking magnesium a little too much; 1 LMNT during the day and Natural Calm before bed. Bowel movements were overly loose and that’s never fun. I\'ve been taking Natural Calm for years and it was a part of my night time routine before starting keto. The over supplementation of magnesium was an unintended consequence. After watching the magnesium I\'ve become more solid but feel bowel movements are less frequent overall. Digestion is slow moving and I feel pressure in my lower abdomen. Not pain, not bloating or anything like that; just some pressure. The pressure will be there till I eat and things are pushed through. Is this normal? Am I eating too large of meals? Are there electrolytes I could be missing? I typically have a large breakfast, a medium lunch and a small dinner. I sometimes fast dinner; it\'s just depends on my schedule. Between the satiating nature of keto and the breakfast/lunch, I rarely feel I need anything in the evenings. Thank-you for all you do. I hope all are settling into your new home and I look forward to future podcasts! \xa0 \xa0 4. City vs Suburbs vs Small Town vs Country? [18:12] Jason says: Hi Nicki & Robb, Since you\'re in the middle of moving, I\'ve got a question about where I should live. In my last gig, I needed to live in city for work. A suburban house, but with good access to transit and an easy bike ride to work. I\'ve recently switched to working remotely, so I\'ve got a lot more flexibility and wondering if I might benefit from a different way of life. What are your thoughts on living situations & surrounding built environments and their impacts on health and happiness? For reference, we\'re a mid-30s married couple with no kids (but trying) and a dog. Mostly homebodies, but we have friends, family, and a great crossfit box in the city. Lots of options for living in small towns, acreages, hobby farms, near the lake, all within an hour drive of the city. I\'ve been a follower for many years and your work has helped me in so many different ways, so thank you! Jason \xa0 \xa0 5. Your Move to Texas? [26:13] Kirk says: Robb & Nicky, Welcome to Texas. I moved here 35 years ago and haven’t regretted it. The New Braunfels area is fantastic being in between Austin and San Antonio. So many great attractions whether it’s outdoor recreation, live music, or educational opportunities for your children.\xa0 No income tax is great as well, however property taxes might be higher than what you are accustomed to.\xa0 I know it isn’t a health or nutrition question, but could you talk about your decision to move to Texas and what you hope to accomplish here? Best regards, Kirk \xa0 Robb’s poop update during Question 5 [35:24 - 38:34] \xa0 Where you can find us:     \xa0   Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | It\'s Episode 440, Q&A #33 time!

Chocolate-Coated Peanut Diet? [2:18] Troels says: I normally base my diet on paleo principles, but for the past month, I have been eating roughly 400 grams of sugar- and chocolate-coated peanuts a day. This should be unhealthy, but my digestion has improved after having been out of whack for months because of SSRIs, and I have consistent morning wood which, mainly due to SSRIs has been rare. Despite eating more than 2000 kcals just in candy each day - half of which is sugar - I still look lean (almost too lean), and, if anything, I\'m adding muscle. I notice a small sugar high and subsequent low, but that\'s pretty much the negative effects. Also, by doing this, I\'m ingesting good amounts of Mg and Zn (~400 mg and ~10 mg). I\'m male and 32 years old. Two questions: \xa0- Am I doing too much latent damage for this to be a good thing, or could it be that this could work for some people, at least for some period? \xa0- How do I make sense of obesity epidemics, the grocery shoppings of fat people, and energy balance when I can consume much more than 2700 kcals a day and stay lean? (I don\'t think I work out much, and many days, I also eat an energy rich evening meal.) \xa0 2. DHEA and Pregnenolone Supplementation? [12:08] Jason says: Rob - 45 year old male. Job is sometimes stressful but for the most part I get 8 hours sleep and follow a lower carb paleo diet 6 days out of 7. Been doing this for close to a decade. I’ve been experimenting for a year or more with Pregnenolone and DHEA in varying amounts. When I take preg in doses of 200-400 mg before bed I feel great and everything works really well.\xa0 Focus, mind and man things. Same if I take 100mg or so of DHEA. I’ll use these on weekends mainly and not so much during the week. I notice during the week without them I tend to be bitchy and emotional with low sex drive. If I take Preg or DHEA these issues go away. I’m afraid I’m taking too much or somehow dependent on these supplements now. What should I be looking out for or the downsides to these substances?\xa0 I feel like I’m playing with fire. \xa0 3. How To Know If Keto is Right For Me? [16:28] Radu says: Hi Robb, I would like your opinion regarding how would somebody decide if the ketogenic diet is beneficial or not, or if you have recommendations for tailoring a ketogenic diet to people with increased cholesterol reaction to this diet. Are there relevant tests that can help in deciding in this regard? In my family health history there are lots of cancers, some heart disease, and some neuro-degenerative (Alzheimer) disease. I am 48 years old, caucasian, in very good health and decent physical shape. My diet is a loose paleo type (occasional milk and grains) and I have no allergies. I would like to have some periods of ketosis, as I feel some benefits from it, but I do not know how concerned I should be. ****** Thank you for taking the time to read the question. I totally understand if you do not have time to answer this question directly, but I find this subject is not cover with enough clarity. Maybe you can touch on this in your regular podcasts when discussing related topics. To understand the background of my question: I experimented with Ketogenic diet a couple of times, and I felt great. My main reason is general health and well being, with an accent on mental clarity. This aspect was improved by the Ketogenic diet. Unfortunately my cholesterol had some unexpected behaviour: My 1st Keto experiment: I was in ketosis from Feb 15 to April 15, 2015, below are the blood tests before the diet and 9 month later. Date\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Total_Ch LDL \xa0 HDL Non_HDL_Ch \xa0 \xa0 Triglycerides 12/15/2014\xa0 194 125\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 58 137 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 254 12/22/2015 178 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 101 58 121 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 44 So far so good! Encouraged by these results, I repeated the diet 1 year later, but this time I tested myself while in ketosis. After 1 ½ month of ketosis, I did my 1st blood test (3/1/2016). I repeated the test (still in ketosis about a month later (4/7/2016). This time I also measured the ApoA1 and ApoB, and the numbers only confirmed the cheap test. I stop the diet, and 8 month later (12/29/2016), the values are back to normal-ish.

[28:57] Sara says: I know genetics have a large part in how our bodies form and react to foods, the environment, etc. But how much do we have control of when it comes to body composition? I am in my mid-thirties and have always been athletic and a focus on healthy eating, now Paleo focused. However my weight - while I am still in a healthy range - doesn\'t budge easily despite my efforts. And it\'s been like this ever since my teens. I don\'t want to compare myself to others - but it is frustrating when I eat so clean, am active with weights and cardio and the person next to me has a slimmer waistline and eats fast food and rarely exercises. I know can become slimmer with extreme effort - but those extreme efforts are not good to my body and I dont want to add additional stress. Should I just "give up" and not fight my body and just focus on my healthy living or do you think I can loose some extra fat without extreme measures? About Me female 37 5\'7 147-155 lbs Body Fat % ~18 (16-20 depending on the test) Athletic build, muscular legs and upper body, chubby midsection that rarely firms up I have SIBO/Gut Issues Paleo/Low-Fodmap (I cycle IF 16:8 or 18:6 and sometimes Keto) Heavy Weight Lift 2xweek, HIIT/OTF 2x/week, Steady state cardio (walk/jog) 2x/week If I breathe on peanut butter or eat too much Paleo granola I gain instantly and have to go back on strict IF/keto but my midsection is never "firm" \xa0 5. Ketosis and Carbohydrate Timing? [35:50] Ryan says: Hi Robb. I don\'t know if this will reach you, but while listening to your podcast and reading your first book, a hundred questions pop into my head. This is one of them. I thought about asking my doctor, but I knew a blank stare and a sweaty forehead would be his answer. So here goes: Does frequency of carb intake play a role in disrupting ketosis? For example, if I am going to eat 150 grams in total of carbohydrates today, will eating all 150 grams of carbs at the same meal knock me out of ketosis for an EQUAL amount of time as eating 15 grams every hour for 10 hours?* My theory is eating 15 grams of carbs an hour for 10 hours will be just enough to keep a person out of ketosis for a longer period of time than eating all 150 grams in one meal while carb-fasting for the rest of the day. I could be wrong, but that\'s why I\'m asking the master. Thank you in advance for any time you can dedicate to this question. Have a great day. \xa0 \xa0 Where you can find us:     \xa0   Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | We\'re back with more answers to your questions.

Collagen Timing/Sauna? [9:44] Jesse says: Hello you two. I\'ve read or heard that when collagen is consumed prior to training the absorption rate is increased considerably. It was also stated that this timing also changes where/how the collagen is used; specifically it goes towards cartilage, tendons, ligaments as opposed to hair, skin, nails. If I\'m not off base and you have heard of this phenomenon, then I am curious what happens when collagen is consumed before sauna? Since you\'re body is being stressed in similar ways to exercise does the process work the same? Thank you both for taking the time to put out quality information, most of which is easy to discern and put into practice for the layman i.e. me. \xa0 2. Fecal Transplant? [12:35] John says: Hey Robb, I have a question for you about fecal transplants.\xa0 I have Asperger\'s Syndrome, along with a persistent itching all over my body, and particularly on my anus, that I believe is from stuff I\'m eating expressing through my skin.\xa0 Cutting gluten and dairy has helped some, but not eliminated. I haven\'t been tested for gut bacteria yet, but going to do that next month. If, as I suspect, I turn out to be missing a lot of the usual gut flora, do you think a fecal transplant is a good option?\xa0 And if so, what\'s the best way to go about getting one? \xa0 3. Partial Knee Replacement Work Out? [17:19] Liz says: Hey Guys! I\'m sure you guys have probably answered this by now, I\'m almost caught up on the podcasts, but I haven\'t heard this question asked so I figured I\'d give it a go. My boyfriend had part of his knee replaced due to an injury he sustained on his last deployment. He used to be extremely active (crossfit, triathlons, running) But, now, not so much. Basically the doctor told him he needed to avoid any high impact exercises, no running. No squats, clean and jerks, etc. Basically if he was going to be lifting any weight to make sure it doesn\'t impact his leg. When I go search online for things he could do... it\'s mostly old people stuff (he is in his mid 20s). So, my question- was his doctor wrong? Greg, do you have athletes with similar issues? Would you allow someone to come into your gym start a training program? Whenever we start to do some sort of a training program he get disheartened by what he can\'t do, and I just want to give him some hope that he can do some of the things he used to love... what would you suggest? Any resources you can suggest that can get us going? Thanks for all you guys do... which I know you guys don\'t do much. I love the rants and the side comments. The podcasts get me through my days at work sitting behind a computer screen and encourage me to get my ass up and do stuff. The video we mention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k0NTB2DTGs \xa0 4. Native Americans and Epigenetics? [23:38] Dan from Nashville says: Hey, I have heard on your podcast, as well as other Ancestral podcasts, the subject of racial epigenetics being brought up, but I never hear it mentioned in a broad aspect, and I was wondering if there was any evidence or even philosophy behind it that you have noticed. I am mostly Native American, with some white mutt thrown in too. I notice that on most reservations, Natives are almost always obese, and I have begun to wonder if being carb sensitive is genetic. You don\'t have to tell me that alcohol and substance abuse is rampant on reservations, but I sometimes wonder how much is environmental, and how much is based on the fact that most sugars and grains were brought over with white culture. I know that Inuits are always an example of ketogenic diets and health, but I am Creek from the Georgia area of the US, and would assume that eating VLC may not have been part of a people group living in a more fertile area. So I would love your opinion on this, as well as if you touched on other races based on region as well, even if its a mostly philosophical perspective. I also know the stereotype of Kenyans being great distance runners, or Jamaicans being better sprinters, but are there other athletic genetic tendencies for other people groups? Lastly, is the reason we never heard of this because we are too racially sensitive, and everyone fears that they will be equated to Hitler talking Eugenics? Or is there just not enough evidence? \xa0 5. Bent Arm vs Straight Arm Strength? [31:16] Harvey says: You\'ve mentioned that an exercise program without straight arm strength results in inferior development of the connective tissue, in comparison to the muscular system. If someone only did straight arm exercises, would their muscular system\'s development be inferior to their connective tissue\'s? \xa0 Where you can find us:     \xa0   Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | It\'s time for Episode 438, Q&A #31!

Is Carbonated Water Okay? [1:41] Brice says: Just listened to Wired To Eat and loved it. I\'m not too far off from this diet, am pretty "fit", but too frequently make exceptions which I think are totally sabotaging my efforts. I\'m still curious about your thoughts on carbonated water without added colors and flavors - like Topo Chico, Croix, Perrier, etc. I have one of these every couple days.. more as a treat than anything. \xa0 2. Have You Seen This Gluten Enzyme Study? [3:40] Austin says:  http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-gluten-solution-aspergillus-niger.html This is an enzyme that apparently neutralizes (or has the potential to) the inflammatory effects of gluten. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on this. If you\'ve talked about it in a podcast already could you point me in the direction of finding it. If you haven\'t talked about it, could you include it in an upcoming podcast? Thanks, Austin \xa0 3. Ancestral Consumption of Psychoactives? [7:42] Charles says: Hey there Robb! I\'m a "never smoker" as my doctor calls it and intend to stay that way, but this week I\'m experimenting with very low dose nicotine patch.\xa0 Got 21mg clear patches and cut into 8 to 12 pieces, one per day during daylight hours. Intentionally avoiding the nicotine rush I\'ve found with gums and lozenges.\xa0 Jury is still out overall, but so far it seems to help improve ADHD, intermittent fasting, and persistent low mood. But that got me to thinking:\xa0 For ancient hunter-gatherers, what would the usual modes of consumption be for such "medicinal" plants?\xa0 Aside from smoking ("hey let\'s light this stuff on fire and breathe deep! great idea! cough cough gag") which is indeed attested in the historical contact record...\xa0 My guess is tobacco, coca, and khat in their weaker pre-agricultural breeds would be chewed and spit. Maybe Mary Jane (again, the weaker natural version) would be an herb to go with fatty meats.\xa0 Yerba mate and ordinary tea we know have been drunk in a hot water infusion. Then there\'s coffee and chocolate which are more recent... Maybe part of our modern problem with drug abuse isn\'t the drug itself, but rather how it\'s been bred and prepared incorrectly.\xa0 Much as it is with food. This is all speculation though. Have you given the matter any serious thought? \xa0 4. Vegan Vitamin D3? [23:36] Leonardo says: Hi Robb, I just wanted to ask how do they make VEGAN vitamin D3 supplements? Vitamin D3 as cholecalciferol is an animal product and it is created from cholesterol, isn\'t it? How do lichens or other sources produce it? Is it the same form? Is it bioavailable in the same way? Thanks for everything you do, I appreciate your work, Leo \xa0 5. Gut Dysbiosis Concerns on Keto? [25:06] Keenan says: Dear Robb, I appreciate very much your non-dogmatic approach when it comes to tackling information regarding VLC and keto dietary approaches (ie who are you, what are your performance needs, are you sick and busted up, a hard charging athlete, etc). That\'s why I feel you\'re the best person to ask about this, as you aren\'t inherently biased. I have a family history of cancer, depression, mental illnesses, addiction, and adult ADHD.\xa0 I haven\'t been diagnosed with any of these issues, though I definitely deal with unevenness in mood and focus.\xa0 Besides my interest in preventing any future health issues for which I might be at risk, I\'ve found that a very low carb, high fat diet just seems to suit my brain the best.\xa0 I\'m less irritable and anxious, my sex drive is fine, and most importantly for me, my focus and attention is just totally on-point. I\'ve tried a multitude of eating styles but VLC is the only one that finds me springing out of bed in the morning with the birds chirping and excitement to get to work each day. I call it "natures adderall" except I don\'t have any crazy stim-mania. The only thing holding me back from maintaining this approach is a nagging worry about the hypothetical implications of long term VLC, as it pertains to GI microbiome diversity, potential dysbiosis risks, mucin production, thyroid problems, etc.\xa0 I\'ve read as much as I can find from the experts I tend to trust in this field (Attia, D\'agostino) but I\'ve yet to find anything that definitevly quells my worry of causing some sort of damage, from which it might be difficult to come back.\xa0 Do you think the long terms risks might be overblown? I do take prescript-assist and raw potato starch as potential mitigators, but I don\'t know if VLC is taking a step or two back for my gut bugs, and I\'m very concerned about treating them well.\xa0 I always suspected gut problems being at the root of my late father\'s alcoholism and his myriad of inflammatory problems. Some of these worries have prevented me from staying in keto for longer than about a month at a time. Every time I start phasing a larger amount of carbs back in, however, there\'s a mild and annoying accompanying brain fog and up/down cycle, seemingly irrelevant of the dietary source. I understand that these questions get vetted and you\'re busy, so no worries if this doesn\'t make the cut.\xa0 I sincerely appreciate everything you and your team have done for the health of my family and myself, as well as the awareness you\'re raising regarding even larger political issues we\'re facing.

Fitbit Sleep Tracking [1:35] Jay says: G\'Day Robb, love your work. I took a break from your podcast to learn computer programming and am now back because I\'m stressed and my desk bound body is broken. Glad to be back and see you\'ve figured out your keto problems when bonking during class. I\'ve signed up to your keto master class so fingers crossed. I have a somewhat basic question about sleep. My Fitbit says I slept 7 hours with 1 hour awake. I don\'t remember waking and there are up to 30 a night of these tiny \'awake\' periods. I do sometimes toss and turn to get into comfortable positions. My partner says I\'m asleep within minutes of hitting the pillow. So I think I\'m sleeping ok. Should I think about this as 8 hours sleep or 7? I tend to wake up energised when my Fitbit says 6hrs 30 mins + 1 hour awake.... So thinking this is equivalent to standard 7-8 hours per night. When I push for Fitbit to say 8 hours then I\'m very lethargic when I wake. But it\'s probably then like 9 hours which could be \'over sleeping\' for me. Anyway, love the work you two are doing. I miss the Q&As with Greg but love the new format. Anyway, fangirling from Australia. My question can probably be answered by Google but I\'m sure you\'ll be able to cut through the interjunks. All the best - Jay \xa0 2. Palate Fatigue & Food Burnout [8:11] Maria says: Hi, Robb and Nikki, I was wondering if you can address palate fatigue. For some reason, I tend to be the kind of person that needs to have a lot of something and then don’t want it anymore and have to switch. Before, I was into avocados and sardines, all the time, and now it is eggs and bacon. It is almost as if my body is asking for these foods at certain times. Thank you! \xa0 3. Protein Toxicity and the Carnivore Diet [12:22] Jesse says: Hey Robb, In WTE you briefly mention (p. 27) that humans cannot consume more than 35% of their calories from protein before suffering from protein toxicity. The carnivore diet has recently gotten some publicity and seems to have some anecdotal success for folks with stubborn autoimmunity issues. Do you think following a carnivorous diet carries a high risk of suffering from protein toxicity? And would we be able to look for evidence of protein toxicity in kidney function testing? Best, Jesse \xa0 4. Waking Up From Hunger While In Ketosis [17:55] Justin says: Dear Robb, I\'m a huge fan of the pod and your work.\xa0 For the past two months, I\'ve been following a keto eating plan (I weigh all food and track macros - I\'m usually hitting 40g net carbs, 90-100g protein, and somewhere between 235g-270g fat, for a total of roughly 3,000-3,500 calories per day).\xa0 I\'m a 30 y/o male, 5\'9. I usually eat 3-4 meals/day with no snacks. I currently weigh 156lb and am about 16% body fat (I did a BodPod when I was a few pounds lighter and was at 14.5%). In terms of exercise, I usually go to the gym 3x/week and do some combination of squats, deadlifts, press, and bench press.\xa0 As an example of where I\'m currently at with strength, I do 4 sets of 5 repetitions (2 min rest periods) 205 pounds on squats.\xa0 My question is this: when I try to cut calories down by 300-500 (I\'d like to get to 12% body fat), I wake up in the middle of the night hungry.\xa0 I feel like I keep hearing on various podcasts and books that I read that in a state of keto, hunger should be significantly blunted and this shouldn\'t really be an issue.\xa0 But I feel like if I don\'t go to sleep pretty full, I wake up in the middle of the night. I know sleep is critically important, so this seems like a problem. If I eat enough to sleep through the night, I can maintain the same weight but really struggle to lose weight.\xa0 I\'ve done self-experiments to make sure I\'m not waking up due to stress, noise, etc., and have isolated that my sleep is almost completely correlated with my hunger levels. I wanted to ask for your guidance because I imagine other people might struggle with a similar issue - I know many people who do well with hunger during the day, but not so well at night.\xa0 Some things I\'ve wondered about is if I\'m overtraining or if there\'s some sort of other physiological issue I need to attend to. Maybe I\'m not understanding keto properly, but I feel like with my macro breakdown I should be able to comfortably go 12-16 hours without eating? Or, is the ability to go prolonged periods without food less about eating and more about individual differences? Thanks for all of the amazing work that you do.\xa0 Justin \xa0 5. Fasting For Skinny Dudes [23:50] Brett says: Hi. Robb and Nicki... Fasting for overweight or normal weight people has been well covered. Is there any benefit to underweight guys fasting in an effort to add mass? I’m 6’3” and 165lbs, 37 years old. I can eat whatever I want in whatever quantities I want and my weight never changes. I would like to be heavier. I’ve tried weight programs and I tone up ok but it’s rare to add more than 5lbs. The minute I stop the program I’m instantly back to 165. Everything else you always talk about like diet, sleep, stress is already dialed in \xa0 \xa0 Where you can find us:     \xa0   Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | We\'re here with Episode 436, Q&A #29!

Endurance Fueling For A Keto Athlete [2:00] \xa0 Cassandra says: Dear Robb + Nicki, First off...thanks for the great job you two do in making complicated nutrition and fitness information easy to access and understand (even for uneducated gym rats like myself).\xa0 I\'ve been listening to the podcast for years, reading the blog and the books (just got Wired to Eat) and I still find myself learning something new almost weekly. Bottom line up front - how do you guys recommend tackling post-workout nutrition for endurance / high-intensity sports while on the keto train? I\'m 35, 5\'8\'\', 155 lbs with a fairly muscular build.\xa0 I\'ve been doing the Crossfit + weightlifting thing for 5-6 years now (4-6 times a week).\xa0 I\'ve got 10 strict pull ups, a 250 lb 1 RM back squat, a 285 1RM DL and can hold an L-sit for a minute....so I think I\'m pretty strong(?) - in some aspects anyway ...\xa0 Strict bedtimes at 8:30 every night with 8 hours of sleep, no injuries, no severe reactions to any type of food (except tequila) - BUT I perform and look a lot better when I\'m strict about paleo.\xa0 I\'ve been eating that way and it has been keeping me fueled really well in the aforementioned training situations.\xa0 Due to the nature of my job - active duty Marine, I am required to run a 5k every year for time...so I do incorporate running into my weekly routine - usually no more than 15-20 miles a week...long-ish runs mixed with hill sprints or pushing sleds so I don\'t die of cardio boredom. Within the past year - - due to losing a bet or being shamed into them (I can\'t quite remember), I\'ve also been running a few half marathons and one marathon.\xa0 I plan do to one more full later this year, the Rock n Roll in Las Vegas - mostly because its an excuse to travel to Vegas with some girlfriends of mine. The low-carb/paleo diet has been awesome for my health\xa0 on the weightlifting/crossfit/sprinting side of things... but I\'m struggling with the endurace side of my fitness. For my runs more than 90 minutes, I\'ve been fueling with some organic stinger chewies/gels near the end of my run and then other, whole-food-type carbs at the end....bananas, berries, coconut water...sometimes gatorade, (an occasional beer :)), etc.\xa0 My recovery has been OK...not awesome though (and when I take out the mid-run or end carbs, my energy tanks and my joints hurt for days)..... it takes me about me 1-2 days to get through my soreness for half marathons and almost 5 days for a run more than 22 miles WITH the intra and post-carbs. I\'ve recently jumped on the keto train in January...did your masterclass, read Mark Sisson\'s book, started listening to a lot of low-carb / keto based podcasts (Shawn Baker, Fat Burning Man, etc) and just started Wired to Eat.\xa0 I\'ve been trying to do my own homework and listen to my body...so far this keto thing has been great! I\'ve dropped about 10 lbs since the beginning of the year, have been sleeping a lot better and have seen gains in my strength.\xa0 But the race season starts up in May (the LV Marathon is in November but I have smaller races and training runs scheduled throughout the summer) and I want to be prepared.\xa0 I *think* I\'m generally fat-adapted...but I panic after 8 or 9 miles sometimes (the old advice of "carb loading" always creeps back in) and will suck down a terrible gel or gatorade because I\'ve made the mistake of running these distances underfueled before and it was a painful, painful lesson.\xa0 I have heeded your electrolyte advice. I constantly track my sodium, magnesium and potassium levels and take the recommended supplements almost every day (normally on days with a taxing WOD or a workout lasting more than 90 mins).\xa0 So what can I eat/drink to keep on the keto train that will help me recover and keep me going on some of these endurance events?\xa0 Nut butters? Whey protein and water? I want to be armed when I take on Vegas this year and not completely derail my eating habits. And I\'d like to start experimenting with these foods now, while I still have time to adjust. Sorry for writing the novel!\xa0 If I can find this info in a podcast or in one of the chapters of your books, please feel free to point me in that direction!\xa0 I appreciate any insight you guys have. Thanks in advance, Cassandra \xa0 2. Should I Add Fat To My Whey Protein Shake? [10:40] Ben says: Hi! Love the podcast (I am one of the six listeners)! Here is my question: I am wondering if the insulin-spike from a post-workout whey shake can stall my weight loss. Should I add fat like heavy cream or coconut milk to the shake to blunt the insulin response (if yes how much) or am I unable to burn that fat because of the spiked insulin storing it as body fat instead. Thank you so much and best wishes from Munich, Germany Ben   3. Portal Circulation and Leaky Gut [14:36] James says: Hi Robb, Thanks for your detailed answer to my question about sun exposure in Q&A #7. You provided a clear and concise answer which is hard to come by these days! Following your book recommendations in Q&A #6 I hungrily delved into the Lecture notes on Human Metabolism (Thanks Nikki!) and within the first chapter encountered some information that gave me reason to pause. The portal circulation, I\'m certain that you can provide a more accurate and concise explanation of this system to your listeners than I can in this question, so I\'ll leave that to you if that\'s okay! My question is: given that all blood (and therefore solutes) from the intestines are drained through the portal vein and through the liver - filtering out excess substrates and removing toxins such as ammonia from the blood before it enters \'general circulation\', how can leaky gut have such a damaging effect on the body? It seems to me that the liver is a vital backstop in this process which is never mentioned when functional medicine practitioners talk about leaky gut - they give the impression that blood drains from the intestines straight into cardiovascular circulation and these fuel substrates are clanking around in our arteries causing inflammation which seems not to be the case! Also how does this impact the gut hypothesis of heart disease (highly simplified here) where endotoxin is said to pass through the mucosal membrane into circulation, binding with LDL cholesterol, being attacked and immobilized by immune cells and ultimately ending up being sequestered into an arterial plaque because the immune system cannot destroy cholesterol or unbind the endotoxin from it. Would the portal circulation not remove this endotoxin from the blood before it enters cardiovascular circulation and meets LDL particles? Is this disease process driven not only by a compromised intestinal lining but also by inefficient liver function? Thank you for your time again guys, really appreciate your input Kind Regards James \xa0 4. Do I Have To Sprout My Nuts & Seeds? [20:10] Joseph says: Is phytic acid harmful or of benefit?\xa0 Is it really necessary to jump thru the hoops of soaking & sprouting before consuming nuts & seeds?\xa0 thank you \xa0 5. Caloric Estimate for Young Children? [25:10] Rory says: Is there an estimate for calories/pound when it comes to feeding my almost 3 year old (or any child for that matter, say 2-12? The teen years of course marking the onset of self-consciousness and peer pressure, thus thwarting any biological hard-wiring toward survival.) Or is she still young enough to be biologically incapable of starving herself, at which point I should just trust that she has normally functioning satiety signals? I ask specifically about my daughter because, as is par for the course in \'Murica, she received antibiotics immediately after being born, so it\'s not a stretch for me to imagine that she could have some kind of gut imbalance that could cause hormone dysregulation with her leptin/ghrelin. \xa0 \xa0 Where you can find us:     \xa0   Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | We\'re back with more of the Q&A you crave!\xa0 Episode 435, Q&A #28 Submit your own questions for the podcast at: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ If you want to see the video for this podcast, be sure to check out our YouTube channel. \xa0 Show Notes: 1. Overeating On Keto [2:08] Steve says: Hi Rob, I don\'t want to take too much of your time. But going Keto for me has found me doing exactly what I feared I could do. I have been Paleo for five or six years and so has my wife. We have no kids at home so grains and junky carbs are not and issue or even a temptation. I am in the middle of doing the  keto masterclass, which I am savouring because I have been making some mistakes. I am 50 years old and work out regularly doing either mixed kettlebell workouts or if I do weight and resistance training at the moment I like to do whole body workouts 3 X a week and can mix in some cardio in between. I have kept fit most of my life, my goal is as I age to stay lean and keep mobile. Pretty simple goal. We live in Perth in Western Australia so we have great weather and lots of sun. I work as a gardener in a private school, a job I love doing as I\'m outside and moving all day, not as hard as say some sort of construction worker but that can happen on a given day just not every day. Coming from eating paleo the transition for me has been pretty easy. As I went low carb and increased the fat I was eating my wife liked the sound of it so she hopped on board. She is doing great and in fact better than me. We aren\'t really that worried about measuring ketones at this stage, it has been more about getting the diet right. My issue is, I love the food. For some reason it has made me hungrier. Stocking our fridge and cupboards I made sure that we had all we needed and I wanted to see what I liked to eat also. So I have blown it on all sorts of things. I have had days where I ate too much thickened cream, one tub has 800 calories and it is so easy to eat. I have blown it on nut butter and blown it on cheese. I can\'t believe it. At first it was wrapping my head around the fat content. I think I get it now. But I have put on body fat, which is so annoying. It\'s not a train wreck but I feel like I am in a rut now and it\'s hard to get out. I don\'t want to quit because I can see and have felt the benefits. It\'s just with the fat content and my physiology there seems to be no room for error. I listen to your podcast and since listening I have gone to the ketogains website and worked out my macros. I was still tracking somewhat but some days I may have blown it by 5 or 6 hundred calories. I have come so close to quitting as for me it seems to have been an easy way to get fat rather the leaner. I\'m not sure that you can help and not sure what else that I could tell you. Diet wise I have intermittent fasted for 3 or more years with differing protocols. Doing 16 - 20 hours is pretty comfortable. I workout in the mornings and often don\'t eat until lunch time or when I get home from work. My diet hasn\'t changed too much except I have eaten cream, which I am now over. Adding more fat to my meals. Cooking in butter eating nuts and doing other keto style things. Apart from that my diet is still pretty primal. I love veggies. I have for years done a version of Mark Sisson\'s big ass salad. Which would be my daily staple. Evening veggies could be broccoli with brussel sprouts maybe some Kale and mushrooms. Also we do milk Kefir but I try to keep that to a minimum. If you have any suggestions that would be great. Are there others that have had this sort of issue, going keto has made them fatter? Really enjoy your podcast and thanks for all of the really useful info that you have put out. I have also read your books. Best regards Steve \xa0 2. What\'s Up With Fiber & Kids? [8:58] Rory says: As part of restoring my own gut health, I\'ve used prebiotic fibers in various doses based somewhat on Grace Liu\'s advice, and I\'m curious if and when supplemental fiber would be beneficial for my daughter? Again assuming that she started off at a disadvantage because of the antibiotics, it seems to follow logically that prebiotic fiber would help her gut bacteria develop, and increase her overall health and resilience. Is that actually logical? And are there any cautions? Is there a certain dose that\'s age-appropriate, or do I just slowly increase until she has digestive upset? Should I mix fibers in order to feed a variety of bacteria, or are there certain fibers that are optimal for a young gut (i.e. what would a cavebaby be most likely to eat chew on for fun?). \xa0 3. Tips For Increasing Testosterone [13:07] Mads says: Hey Robb, In a previous Q&A, you talked about how muscle gain/hypertrophy is caused by calorie surplus and progressive overload. You also mentioned that gaining muscle is, without a doubt, easier if you have High testosterone. Calorie surplus and PO is easy, but how do I increase my testosterone? You mentioned that there are a number of different tactics that you can use? My testosterone is not low, but definitely not high either. I\'m 27 and my testosterone is 640 ng/dL and my free testosterone is 16.36 \xa0 4. SHBG Elevated On Keto/Carnivore [19:47] Eoin says: Since switching to keto I\'ve noticed an increase in SHBG levels which brings down my free test. Total test has stayed high normal but was wondering how functional it is with the free portion bound up. DHEA is a bit low too. I feel great all in all but was just wondering what your thoughts are on that \xa0 5. Are Chicharrones (pork rinds) a Healthy Snack? [22:47] Isaac says: Hi Rob, Chicarones (pork rinds): are they a healthy snack? I\'ve heard you indirectly mention them on the podcast some time ago, but I wasn\'t able to infer whether your opinion is favorable or cautionary. I\'m an ultra-runner, and during peak training season will spend about 20 hours per week running.\xa0 In the bad old days I would top off my calories with a gigantic bowl of cold cereal in the evening, or an enormous serving of lentils and rice.\xa0 But then I got woke, started monitoring my blood sugar, and started looking for low-carb options to fuel. I\'m already having two salads each day, huge amounts of veggies, and as much meat as I can stomach.\xa0 So I\'m just looking for some calories to fuel the movement. So are pork rinds okay?\xa0 I avoid the flavored variety - the bags I buy just say "fried pork skin" on the ingredients list, and I dip them in sour cream. The best part is how easy it is to get an extra 1000 calories. And the flavor. Am I headed towards clogged arteries? Are pork rinds actually healthy in the way that bacon is healthy...? Thanks!! Love the show. -Isaac After submitting my question about whether pork rinds are an acceptable snack, I realized that Robb\'s answer might be \'we\'d need to see your lab work\'... So, in case it is relevant (and in case my question is selected for the show), here are some details.\xa0 (I\'d be glad to share the rest of the lab results, if they\'re relevant.) Thanks! ***** Cholesterol, Total: 249 mg/dL HDL: 71 mg/dL Triglycerides: 71 mg/dL LDL-Cholesterol: 161 mg/dL (calc) Apolipoprotein A1: 186 mg/dL Omega 3 (EPA+DHA) Index: 7.1 % Omega 6 / Omega 3 ratio: 3.7 EPA/Arachidonic Acid Ratio: 0.4 EPA: 3.0 % DHA: 4.1 % Lipoprotein (a): 99 nmol/L Apolipoprotein B: 107 mg/dL Nonesterified Fatty Acids (Free Fatty Acids): 0.12 mmol/L LDL Particle Number: 1149 nmol/L LDL Small: 116 nmol/L LDL Medium: 229 nmol/L HDL Large: 5144 nmol/L LDL Pattern: A LDL Peak Size: 225.5 Angstrom HS CRP: <0.2 mg/L \xa0 Where you can find us:     \xa0   Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | It\'s time for another podcast!\xa0 Episode 434, Q&A #27 Submit your own questions for the podcast at: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ If you want to see the video for this podcast, be sure to check out our YouTube channel. \xa0 Show Notes: \xa0 1. Thoughts on Baby Led Weaning? [1:38] Rory says: We follow Chris Kresser\'s Healthy Baby Code when introducing foods to our children, starting with purees, and graduating to solid foods overtime. She\'s recently learned of "baby-led weaning" (completely unscientific aside: anything that starts with "baby-led" CAN\'T be a good idea. Like "baby-led" bedtime, or "baby-led" TV-watching). The theory, as I understand it, is that you present your kid with chunks of various foods, and let them choose what to eat based on their tastes, rather than forcing a puree of some kind that they may not prefer if they weren\'t being fed by you. Your thoughts? I know your kids are obviously Paleo, and we\'re curious how you navigated the introduction of foods and respect for their preferences as their tastes developed. \xa0 2. Post-Lunch Coma On Keto [10:15] Laura says: Hi Robb and Nicki, I have a question regarding an incessant post lunch coma regardless of diet. I have experienced a mean bout of fatigue and extreme cold every day following lunch for much of my adult life. I’ve been on the paleo bandwagon for almost 10 years with marginal improvement in that area, and recently doing keto I’ve experienced only a little bit of relief. I still get almost debilitatingly fatigued and cold after eating lunch. If I have a sweet potato or a piece of fruit with lunch it’s definitely a lot worse, but even with my typical lunch of leftover protein and veggies or a version of Mark Sisson’s “big ass salad,” I experience a couple hours of wanting to get in bed after lunch. I follow the ketogains recommendations on electrolyte tracking and consumption of electrolytes. For breakfast I usually have some variation of 3-4 eggs. I’m a 33 year old female, healthy weight, CrossFit 2-3 times/week. My recent lab work was excellent, low inflammatory markers, lipids and blood sugar markers all good. T3 was on the low end of normal, but all other thyroid measures WNL. I am mindful of circadian rhythms and do all I can to optimize sleep, however it isn’t ideal as I have a toddler and baby. I don’t think they can totally be blamed for the issue, though, as I have experienced this for many years. Thanks for your time and for the profound impact you’ve had on my life and the lives of many others. \xa0 3. Help! Balding! [16:33] Mehdi says: Hello I have messaged before. What is your advice for a 28 year old male having male pattern baldness? Is it really Genetic destiny or is there any way of living eating exercising sleeping etc that can keep my hair. Please help... I don’t know where to turn. Do you guys recommend my good sources for male pattern baldness info? I read the Mark Sisson article and I don’t think I suffer from any of the conditions he mentions. Regards Mehdi \xa0 4. Portion Sizes like Eddie the Strongman [19:09] Kevin says: Hi! Can you give a little help in the way of portion sizes. I have been eating Paleo/low carb (grain/dairy/legume free) for about a year and I feel like I have just recently stopped craving sugar (feels liberating). I am extremely active due to my work 5’9”, 145 lean male. In order to feel full my meals (3 or 4 a day) are absolutely giant. Usually I have focused on about 8-10oz of protein per meal and fill the rest with giant vegetable portions. Recently due to all that veg bloating the heck out of my belly I have switched to more like 16-20oz of protein and a bit less veg to cut down on the bloating. This feels better but It seems like a ton and I was wondering how this compares to others. Basically for every meal recently I throw 16-20oz’s of protein in a 10.5 inch or 12inch cast iron skillet, cook the protein with a fat and fill the pan to the top with veg. I thoroughly enjoy this but when I explain to some folks I put Down 16ish oz’s of beef/pork/fish/chicken they look at me like I will have colon cancer within the calendar year. I admit I am too darn active but I have no choice due to work then play. (light details but I work in the mountains above 8000ft and am self powered everywhere I go with a large pack). Sleep is descent, as I work emergency services and sometimes will be up all night working, but not the norm, tons of sun, weight is good I think,\xa0 blood work appears good. Any suggestions on these portion sizes? I feel like I am going to eat myself into bankruptcy but need to feed the beast to keep my energy up. I tinker on/off with safe starches but I feel like these make me more hungry and I am more satisfied with higher protein. I have also played with carb night like refeeds per John kiefer when I am running a touch light weight/low energy which gives me a bit of a recharge (still avoiding grains/dairy/legumes during the re feed). I generally use fat for flavor per your suggestion as if I go big on fat it makes me kind of nauseous and get less than ideal bowel movements. Although it has been a year on paleo (coming off of 15years of vegetarianism) I feel like I have yet to find the optimal balance and am constantly tinkering. My body comp has changed drastically, as I have noticed I now have muscles and carry about 3-5 extra lbs I believe is muscle. Help me please, I Very much enjoy your work, you are a good person. \xa0 5. Creatine & Cold Sores?! [25:58] Chris says: Hey, Robb and Nicki! I\'m a long time listener and a fan of both formats, but super glad that you guys decided to bring back the Q&A\'s!\xa0 Each week, I look forward to listening to your Jedi-like paleo wisdom. But enough about you, let\'s talk about me. The vein of my existence since my late teens has been the occasional cold sore.\xa0 I\'ve been paleo/ckd for about 4 years now, which has decreased the occurrence from about 4-5 times a year to only once or twice a year. Still, I absolutely dread the day that one of those little suckers shows up, and I do everything in my power to prevent that from happening.\xa0 Since arginine seems to be an antagonist to the virus, I do my best to avoid it all costs, and supplement with L-lysine as well. This brings me to my question, which pertains to creatine. I have been thinking about starting to supplement with creatine, but when doing research I realized that it is actually made up of the three specific amino acids: methionine, glycine, and -- yep, ariginine.\xa0 Now I am worried that supplementing with creatine will cause a dreaded outbreak. Is this accurate or am overanalyzing? Would supplementing with lysine at the same time help prevent arginine dominance in the cells or is that nonsense? Any other tips on prevention? I\'ve scoured the interwebs for an answer to no avail and would truly appreciate your input, Paleo-Wan-Kenobi. Thank you for what you do and keep up the good work! \xa0 \xa0 Where you can find us:       Submit questions for the podcast: https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/ \xa0 Transcript:  Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF) | We\'re back on a roll with Episode 433, Q&A #26!

Enzymes and IBS? [3:32] Ken says: Talk to us about enzymes Robb. I\'ve played with alot of different things over the years to help with IBS issues. For a long time I was devoted to probiotics but I never found any real consistent results with them. I took a stool test a year or so ago and discovered that literally none of the strains of probiotics I had so diligently taken (and paid for) were significantly present. Along the way anti fungals and anti parasitic medication (Dr Rx\'d) helped calm the fire down below but it was enzymes that seem to seem to have made the final difference for me. Not only is the fire largely out I\'ve really not had to keep up with taking enzymes like I did with probiotics. To be fair to probiotics they seem to help in the moment but I get the sense you have to take them daily which does not seem to be the case with enzymes. I should mention I know several people that have had the same experience with probiotics and enzymes. My question then is what is the mechanism at work? I get that enzymes help break down foods but why would that help with IBS symptoms and furthermore why would those symptoms be largely gone after only 6 months or so of using them but not taking them daily even? \xa0 2. Squat Pooping and Toilet Training [10:42] Terrence says: Hey Robb and Nicki! Loving the new Q&A format! You have done such a great job educating the public on what to put in one end of their bodies that I want to take a moment to talk about how to get the most out of what comes out the other end! I am a first-time dad of a now 16-month-old, so that means we\'re starting to approach potty training. As we all know, the "natural, paleo way" of pooping is getting into that deep squat and letting fly. It\'s so obvious to me that this is the way we\'re meant to poop. I see it every morning: my little girl suddenly stops playing with her toys and drops into that ass-to-grass squat that my jiujitsu hips will never do again. By the time that thousand-yard stare creeps into her eyes, I\'ve already got one hand on my SLS-free baby wipes. Every parent has seen that, and yet every parent in this hemisphere insists on trying to get their kid going from this squat position to sitting on a porcelain platform with his/her feet dangling. The toddler naturally resists with a, "what the hell do you expect me to do from here?" look. Frustration ensues, but poop doesn\'t. It seems like transitioning our toddlers from diapers to seated toilets is yet another mismatch of nature in our modern civilization. For adults, it\'s easy to make a homemade platform or buy a Squatty Potty / similar product. But what\'s the plan for tots? I\'ve considered setting up a kitty litter box in the bathroom. The mother-in-law is almost certainly going to lose her shit (heh heh) but maybe that\'s the price of being the world\'s #2 Dad! Would love to hear your Paleo Poop Solution for how we are Wired to Shit. -Terrence \xa0 3. Travel Eating Tips? [14:30] Luiza says: Got your masterclass and it was paramount for the achievement of the keto sunset. 8 weeks in, 15 lbs down and I feel amazing! However I am quite a foodie and will be heading to Paris for 10 days in June to vacation with my brother and dad. I will be staying at a hotel and definitely don’t wanna miss out on real French croissants or pastries... I also am from Brazil and while I can tell the benefits of keto long term, I would not be able to go visit and skip out of eating fruits, which is most of my diet while I’m down there. so question: Should I still try my best to keep up with calories/macro count while traveling and/or supplement with exogenous ketones (do they even work?) or should I not worry about it until I get back home? Am I gonna feel absolutely awful while getting back on carbs? On that note, maybe I should re-introduce carbs before I even go? Appreciate your guidance on the issue. \xa0 4. BJJ + Recurring Staph Infections [18:39] Sam says: Dear Robb + Nicki, Over the last 12 year period, I\'ve made numerous attempts to train BJJ–each attempt ending in a staph infection. My first time was about 12 years ago, where I got a good year of training in. This was punctuated by a pretty bad staph infection that flared back up a few more times shortly after. 8 years later, I went for it again...this time getting a staph infection after one week of training. Most recently, I got 6 months in before getting another. As you can imagine, every doctor I\'ve ever talked to thinks I just need more antibiotics, or that I have some secret colony of staph living in my nose. This approach has obviously not been successful for me. It also fails to address why I only get them while training, and never in the periods in between. While hygiene may have been to blame the first time, I was pretty careful the last two times, even if it wasn\'t 100% perfect. I had a funky sleep schedule before my most recent occurrence, which I think may have contributed. Some more details for you...I\'m 33, in good shape, otherwise healthy, eat well, and sleep well. I\'ve always lifted weights outside of BJJ but nothing crazy in terms of volume. My question for you is: If this was happening to you, where would you start? What would you be looking at? I have considered seeing a functional medicine practitioner as I\'ve wondered if there are some bigger picture immune issues at play. I appreciate any thoughts you have on this– I don\'t want my BJJ career to be over so soon. Thanks! Notes: https://www.defensesoap.com/ \xa0 5. Adult Autism - Should I Go Keto? [23:51] Alex says: Hi Nicki and Robb, I\'m 29 and was diagnosed as on the autism spectrum just two years ago. This would have been considered as asperger\'s in the past. I\'ve been primarily paleo (ice cream is really good) for the better part of six years, but after running my DNA through Found My Fitness, I\'m wanting to address my dietary choices from a more personalized approach, including finding the most optimal choices to address some of the occasional stressors I feel associated with being on the spectrum - anxiety, depression, and general cognitive/mood disregulation. The most researched dietary intervention seems to be a gluten free, dairy free diet, with a few studies looking into keto. However, each study I\'ve seen is only looking at kids as the subjects and typically with more severe symptoms than what I experience. Keto seems to be a promising approach, but is there any reason why this would be different for an adult? I tried keto for about a month a year ago but immediately found my cognitive performance drop. While I know my macro amounts were appropriate (used ketogains calculator), I know now that I didn\'t incorporate the electrolyte component. Could this account for my initial struggles with it? Is there anything else someone on the spectrum should consider when attempting keto? Supplements, macro ratios, etc.? I\'ll include more details about me below, but thank you for your time in reading question and all of your work.

ATP Supplements? [1:35] Gordon says: Do you deal with or see anybody taking the new ATP supplements ( Peak ATP)? \xa0\xa0I have seen them as a pre workout supplement and also for use with chronic fatigue patients ( they also use NADH as ATP precursor ) \xa0Thanks \xa0 2. Multivitamin: Powder Or Pill? [4:16] Michael says: If a person chooses to have a multivitamin, is it better in pill form, or powder (drink with water)? I ask because fat Soluble vitamins are absorbed in the presence of fat. It would seem drinking a powder in, for example, a litre of water over several hours might mean that the vitamins may not be absorbed as well (no fatty meals in between to help absorb said vitamins) Where a pill could be taken with a meal or with a little fat? Thoughts? \xa0 3. Individualizing Your Diet [10:09] Nathan says: I have watched the change in dietary recommendations over the years and have tried Paleo, Keto and higher carb diets. I have seen really good results on low carb diets but they seem hard to sustain due to high activity at work. I have also heard Robb say he has had good results eating beans/legumes. I am considering trying to eat a diet that focuses on whole foods rather than macros. My question related to this is, "Have you found that the quality of food is more important than the macronutrients for overall health?" Not that macros aren\'t important but you can manipulate the macros to a Keto style diet with low quality food but it seems that would be counterproductive. Thanks, Nathan \xa0 4. Thoughts On Collagen Protein PowdersSupplements? [17:57] Andrew says: Hey Robb, I have a question on a point you made in the  Keto Masterclass, Module 4. You said that collagen (specifically collagen protein powders) are great supplements and can have many benefits, but that the protein content should not count towards your daily protein intake. I have been making and eating a collagen concoction (Great Lakes Collagen Hydrolysate) for years as a meal (2nd) in between lunch (1st) and dinner (3rd) that I have been counting as a third of my protein intake. I understand that collagen protein is not the same as animal protein, but can you expand on this a bit. I remember reading something along the lines of it lacking completeness, not having optimal ratios of amino acids and having some that are unessential, but have I really been short-changing myself on protein and should I replace this with animal protein? \xa0 5. Body Refuses Ketosis in High Stress Job [23:16] Jenika says: Hello Robb, I have a question regarding the body naturally kicking itself out of ketosis in high stress work environments. I have been a fat burner now for over a year and have been immensely successful. I have lost 15 pounds, gained muscle, rid myself of candida, my vision has improved, my alopecia hair loss has gone away. I feel like i am functioning the way I should. I also run faster, jump higher, and train better than I ever have in my life. I am 29 years old. I work as a Stewardess on private luxury yachts. So I live and work onboard. With no guests onboard I maintain a healthy balanced routine. When we have guests onboard I am working 14-16 hour days on my feet running around and up and down stairs constantly. This can go from 1 week up to 5 weeks with no days off. I certainly don\'t exercise during this time apart from light stretching and Nidra yoga. It is a high stress environment both mentally and physically. It seems that my body just refuses to stay in ketosis despite my dietary efforts. I crave fruit, gain weight, gain water weight, and don\'t feel satiated ever. \xa0I am assuming this is because my body goes into fight or flight mode. My question is if there is anything I can do to trick the system into staying into ketosis? Or should I just give into the body\'s desire for glucose and introduce fruit and perhaps sweet potato into the diet and lower my fat intake. I guess I don\'t want to be pumping myself full of fat if my body doesn\'t want to use it for fuel. This is a constant occurrence in my job (given I haven\'t worked full time in the last 8 months). I am potentially going into a busy mediterranean season and would like to maintain my physique and be gentle to my body considering the circumstances. Any insight you might have would be hugely appreciated. Thank you so much.
