It\'s just missing a few things, such as the rear windshield, the gas cap, chunks of the floor...and we haven\'t even gotten to all the problems under hood. Fortunately, Michelle is talking to a guy who can appreciate junk, and Tommy is as excited as her husband about this dream turned nightmare. Elsewhere, Mary discovered how big a rock it would take to kill her lawn mower; Matt is looking for music recommendation to drown out his Civic\'s brake noise; and can Tom and Ray convince Andrea the noise she thinks is coming from the dashboard is actually originating 3 feet away; and our on-call Physicist Wolfgang helps ease Ray\'s gastrointestinal distress. All this and lot more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, Anne\'s mechanic can\'t identify the gunk blowing out of her car\'s ventilation system, but he does know that whatever it is, fixing it will cost $1000...if that\'s what it is. Sounds like a new mechanic\'s mantra to us! Elsewhere, Linda is still trying to figure out how a gas attendant put her radiator cap on backwards; Alan is baffled by the diamond patterns he sees on rear windshields, especially when he\'s wearing polarized sunglasses; and is Andy safer keeping his doors locked while driving on the highway? And, has our pal Daniel Pinkwater found his true calling, as a scientific measurement? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, Lee\'s mild-mannered wife\'s temper and vocabulary both take a dive, but only when she listens to our show. Are Tom and Ray carriers of a new form of ABS—Aberrant Behavior Syndrome? Meanwhile, tempers are also flaring out in California, where Jim\'s truck is polluting his entire town; and down in Hendersonville, Kentucky, where Brian\'s merging strategy is incredibly efficient, and also incredibly rude. Also, on Stump the Chumps we find out if Sarah\'s kids really held a peeing contest in her car while she was away; and, can Bill in Alaska get his forklift running in time to get us our halibut? All this, plus the return of the Puzzler, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, the best prank ever in Magliozzi history, as Ray\'s family vacation is interrupted by the unfortunate news that his beloved Ford LTD has "burned to a crisp." Elsewhere, grad student Erica hopes her Celica\'s rattle is serious enough to get Mom and Dad to buy her a new car; Jodi\'s oil burning may put her Cavalier well ahead Erica\'s car on the path to heapdom; Unitarian Minister Carol is being tempted by a shiny Jetta; and can Vince put the leftover gas from his weedwacker in his car without destroying it? Also, if you keep taking a car apart and putting it back together, will you eventually wind up with two? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, two preteen kids present "Car Talk: The Video Game," and prove they\'re a lot more creative and have better marketing skills than anyone in our office. But, they probably can\'t beat Tom and Ray on car questions, right? We won\'t test that, but, the brothers will try to figure out why Martha\'s van stops moving and acts like it\'s run out of gas; what made Karl\'s horn start blaring early Sunday morning; and which heap Cass and her newly reunited husband should keep. Also, should Lee listen to a retired mechanic\'s advice and run his car for 15 seconds with a pint of kerosene and no oil? And, our listeners weigh in on whether or not to name a car. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, Matt needs a car that can handle his annual 100,000 mile commute, and no, we didn\'t add too many zeros there. Matt is looking for reliability and good gas mileage, but Tom and Ray think he should be a bit more self-centered, particularly on the body part that will be chained to the seat for all those miles. Elsewhere, Marc is wondering if add-ons like the "Crap-a-Chip" will really improve his SUV\'s horrible mileage. Also, Mary Anne\'s air conditioning is cooling her passengers but not herself; Chip is wondering what fried his van\'s exhaust manifold; and Tom and Ray\'s efforts to help Becky deal with a film on her windshield are derailed by the Car Talk Studio Pranks department. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, one listener undertakes a bold, yet reckless experiment to find the correlation between drinking iced tea and needing to take a haircut. Is the real question "if", or "how fast"?  Elsewhere, Robert bought a used truck and thinks its previous owner misnamed it. Can he re-christen it without changing its identity? Also, the only way to get into Paul\'s $200 car is by climbing over the hood, which, to nobody\'s surprise, has fried the battery; Maxine\'s mechanics \'fessed up to putting the wrong fluid in her brake reservoir, but maybe not so much about which fluid; Christine\'s Accord has become home to an ant colony; and Ray shows off his deep understanding of dew dynamics. Or is that "doo doo dynamics"? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, Dana\'s wife\'s Volvo\'s brakes squeak, but only when Dana drives the car. Does his wife have a heavy foot or is Dana driving too much like a geek? Elsewhere, Louise made the mistake of taking her car to a specialist rather than a GP to diagnose a clunk; Sylvia thinks her Rabbit\'s array of problems are due to radiation poisoning from being parked near a uranium mine; and on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Tom and Ray correctly diagnosed why Ralph\'s Suburban was imitating an old TV game show. Also, a date goes awry when a Jaguar is mistaken for something else; and a few of Shakespeare\'s plays not coming to a stage near you. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. | This week on The Best of Car Talk, Marc bought a used Peugeot for $100, and, believe it or not, that wasn\'t his worst mistake. Now he\'s got a car he can\'t drive, and a mechanic who can\'t get the part, but did obtain cash from Marc\'s wallet. Elsewhere, Edward needs a monthly subscription to replace his Altima\'s distributors; Mary\'s husband insists on leaving the car running while he pumps gas because he\'s never seen one blow up, perhaps not realizing that\'s because everyone else turns their cars off; Nigel may be better off not knowing what his mechanic did to get his Mercedes to pass the smog test; and Heather is looking for the perfect practical joke to play on her brother, through his vintage Toyota Supra. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk. | This week on the Best of Car Talk, can an omelet save an engine? A friend suggested that Sasha use eggs in his cracked radiator. Was this advice to actually stop the leak, or just to give Sasha something to snack on while waiting for the tow truck? Elsewhere, John put wooden blocks under the gas pedal to slow down his leadfoot son; but is worried that the speeding tickets savings may need to go towards a new transmission. Also, Debra may need to resort to whacking the steering wheel to start her car; Ron\'s horn sounds when he turns his steering wheel; on Stump the Chumps, we find out if Heidi had to lock her husband in the cellar to keep him from changing her timing belt; and, are Tom and Ray\'s stupid questions really profound existential Philosophy?

During one of these pauses, Margery shared an important family principle: bringing your best self to your home. Being an urban farmer with a flock of chickens, Elizabeth quipped, "Bring your best to the nest!" The outside world shouldn\'t get the smiling happy version of you while your family gets the crabby and exhausted one. On "Best To The Nest," Margery & Elizabeth explore the simple concept of creating strong, comforting, beautiful nests that prepare us to fly.

This was essentially a brand new airplane and there was no reason to\xa0 believe it was not airworthy.\xa0\xa0\xa0 | Episode 2\xa0"That was a brand new airplane. If they had a problem, why didn\'t they go back to Boeing for a brand new part?"\xa0"Many airlines today are outsourcing both line maintenance and their heavy base maintenance functions."\xa0"While the services can be outsourced, the accountability and and responsibility must remain with the operator!"\xa0Flight Safety Detectives John Goglia and Greg Feith discuss the deadly October 2018 Lion Air crash with Captain George H.

Because, often, it\'s a matter of life and death and billions of dollars are at stake.\xa0\xa0In the debut episode, John Goglia and Greg Feith tell you why this podcast series is taking flight, they discuss critical issues facing the aviation industry, and preview what they\'ll discuss in future episodes.

The only way seems to be into the mountain and then underground, so it's time to sneak and hunt down some cracks. | The Ice Five appear to have worn out their welcome in Wexhall as the Barrowsteppes Dragons descend on the town, looking for their prey.

Congrats! | The showdown with the Archmage of Vanzervale continues, and things get pretty brutal. The Ice Five have a lot they want the Archmage to answer for, but he's not a particularly warm and welcoming sort. They'll have to hurry too, as there's supposedly dragons nearby with a bounty on their heads.\xa0 | Many choices have led the Ice Five to this small village wedged between cliffs, fireworks about to go off, a lottery about to begin.

Austin was going to try to join him, but he got spooked by the lack of clarity in Destiny\'s UI. Danielle brings us the horror of the gig economy in Neo Cab. Rob was both spooker and spookee in Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, a game with problematic story, but extremely compelling mechanics. And Patrick regales us with the horrors of ISP data caps!At the end of the podcast, we talk about a few big changes to the Waypoint Radio crew. Danielle is bidding farewell to her time at Vice, and Austin is stepping back from his editorial role. Austin will continue to host Waypoint Radio, but Danielle will be moving on to bigger and better things. We\'ll miss you, Danielle!  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | September is over and that means it’s time to get SPOOKY. The crew checks back in on Untitled Goose Game to ask the hard questions: does revolution ever really end? Rob’s getting into the spirit by playing Ghost Recon: Breakpoint as the Panther, which apparently is the stealth class if you weren’t aware. Austin is getting spooked by the terrors of urban planning in Mini-Motorway, and Patrick is having a surprisingly un-spooky time with the Switch Lite. Stick around after the outro for the weekly NFL check-in.Discussed: Untitled Goose Game, Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, Apple Arcade, What The Golf, Mini Motorway, Switch Lite, Close Combat: The Bloody First, Football  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | As the fall game’s deluge rages on, Rob Zacny’s got his sights set on the beach, and totally not at all on that one player that ruined a perfectly good race in GRID. Austin is exploring new biomes and getting loot in Cube World, a game that most people figured would never come out, but Austin always believed. Patrick’s been running out of gas in the post-apocalyptic Overland, and Cado is just waiting for Shadowkeep to finally drop.Discussed: Cube World, GRID, Overland, The Last of Us Part 2, Destiny 2:Shadowkeep, Link\'s Awakening  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Fall is finally here. The leaves are changing. There\'s a chill in the air. And the games harvest is plentiful. So plentiful, that Austin went back and played ... a racing game from 1990? He\'s got a contract out, can you help him understand the physics in F-Zero? Cado and Patrick then comisserate over the best god damn golf game of all time, Kirby\'s Dreamcourse. After the break, Patrick and Austin talk about the nuanced differences between EDM and pop music. Also Sayonara Wild Hearts. Austin talks about some game that has a goose in it, and Patrick takes us through his journey with Apple Arcade.Discussed: F-Zero, Super Mario Maker 2, Kirby\'s Dreamcourse, Link\'s Awakening, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Untitled Goose Game, Apple Arcade, Destiny 2, Google Play Pass  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Content Warning for discussion of Sexual Assault from approximately 1:52:00 - 2:07:00On this week\'s Waypoints, Austin watched all of Netflix\'s Mindhunter while he was on vacation and couldn\'t wait to talk about it with the rest of the crew. It\'s a look at the FBI during the late 70\'s, before the term "serial killer" existed, and how some of that methodology was invented. Rob brings us Arrival, Denis Villeneuve\'s 2016 movie about aliens landing on earth and language, communication, and trauma. Danielle visited Halloween Horror Nights and brings us the scoop on the design and craft of the various haunted houses. After the break, Austin, Patrick, and Rob discuss last week\'s NFL news, including a segment on Antonio Brown\'s sexual assault allegations.  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Sometimes, despite all your best efforts, you fail. This week, Rob has the misfortune of sharing with us the sad tale of the Krummetses. A humble bread/pastry (breastry? Pastread?) born of misunderstandings and faulty equipment. Luckily, Patrick has had a little more luck with The Legend of Zelda: Link\'s Awakening, one of the weirder 2D Zelda games, finally dropping on Switch this week. Austin and Cado have been playing (surprise surprise) two new roguelike deckbuilders, Meteorfall: Krumit\'s Tale and Sign of the Sojourner, and Rob is still finding new surprises in Control. We regret to inform you: Cado will not be acquiring a destiny shirt this year.Discussed: Link\'s Awakening, Control, Meteorfall: Krumit\'s Tale, Sign of the Sojourner, Borderlands III, Mutazione, Kind Words, Destiny 2  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | It\'s fall, and even if the weather doesn\'t know it, the games industry sure does. Austin takes a quick dip out from his vacation to join us on this episode and talk about mechs, as he\'s spent some of his vacation playing Daemon X Machina. Rob and Patrick have also been playing Greedfall, a game about colonizing an island. Cado has been playing Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, a game about colonizing an island. Then after the break we dive into the latest Pewdiepie scandal, the new Death Stranding trailer, and that wild Nintendo Fit Ring thing. Also Control still slaps.  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | Mild Kingdom Heart III spoilers from two minutes in through to 7 minutes in.We\'ve got some BREAKING NEWS on this pod, there\'s a NEW KINGDOM HEARTS III DLC TRAILER OUT! Listen in as Danielle, Patrick, and Cado react live to the new trailer while Rob pours himself some 15 year old scotch. He then regales us with tales of his new enormous speakers as he gently swirls the drink in his hand, ice lightly clinking against the cold glass. Danielle brings us tales from the woods of Blair Witch, and how great the dog is, while Cado\'s dealing with the cold in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. Patrick is nearing the end of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and realizing how cordoned off the endgame is for the different houses. Then we take a dip in the question bucket, before Rob and Patrick spend 20 minutes talking about sports.Discussed: Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind, Blair Witch, Iceborne, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Control  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | So, Rob somehow got the keys to Nintendo. The Nintendo Direct this week is evidence of that, and we do a pretty extensive overview of all the wild new things this Rob Zacny led Nintendo is getting up to. Patrick and Danielle give us a history of Deadly Premonition and how good/bad it is. Motherboard\'s own Emanuel Maiberg joins us to give us his thoughts on the Star Wars Jedi Knight competitive scene, as well as thoughts on Gears 5. Cado spends probably too much time defending Taco Bell. Discussed: Nintendo Direct, Deadly Premonition, Return of the Obra Dinn, Assassin\'s Creed, Pokemon, Doom 64, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, SNES on Nintendo Switch Online, Gears 5, Blair Witch  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy | It\'s Madden season! Which means it\'s time for Patrick, Rob, and Austin to confront pro football and all its ugly contradictions and compromises. First, they\'re as shocked as anyone by the "in his prime" retirement of star quarterback Andrew Luck. But should they be? What does Luck\'s decision reveal about changing attitudes among football players toward the game they play? There\'s a class element to it as well, but that\'s even more salient with the crass partnership between Jay-Z and the NFL. The gang discuss how Jay-Z has helped the league "move on" from its embarrassing standoff with allegedly blackballed quarterback Colin Kaepernick, and why it\'s a move that makes all the sense in the world for billionaire like Jay-Z. Making somewhat less sense is the long fight Antonio Brown waged on behalf of a beloved helmet. It was an odd hill to die on but on the other hand, how important are helmets really to keeping players safe? Finally, Rob and Patrick spent the summer mesmerized by the Chicago Bears\' unprecedented search for a new place-kicker.

Finding a “soil expert” was kind of tough, but when I met Dr Mark Yelanich on a recent visit to Metrolina Greenhouse, I knew I had found the answers to my prayers. Dr. Mark has been the Director of Research at Metrolina Greenhouses for the past 14 years. Metrolina Greenhouse is the single-site heated greenhouse in the United States at 162 acres under roof. The Metrolina Research department focuses on working with plant breeding companies to find varieties that will delight home gardeners and help them be more successful. The research department also works on finding improved ways of producing our plants to make Metrolina more sustainable and efficient. Before Metrolina Dr. Mark worked for Scotts Miracle Gro (SMG) where he was the Senior Scientist in charge of research on Miracle Gro branded potting and garden soil (and received three patents on soil products). Dr.Mark received his Ph.D., Masters and bachelors from Michigan State University (The Harvard of Horticulture). He is married to Lisa for 26 years and has two daughters Hannah and Emily (sadly neither are going into Horticulture but he is still very proud!) Today he joins me to break down the different components of soil, and why choosing the right soil is so important for the success of our houseplants! If you are interested in seeing Dr Mark and Metrolina Greenhouse, check out the behind the scenes tour Dr Mark gave me when I was in North Carolina! You see the entire process of what it takes to grow a plant in a commercial greenhouse! In this episode we learn:  How Dr Mark became a soil expert Difference between outdoor and indoor soil Why to NEVER use outdoor soil What mixes to use for indoor plants What makes up potting mix: peat moss, perlite, pumice, bark, vermiculite, coco coir, earthworm casings, various “meals”, fertilizer pellets Fertilizing practices (brief overview) Best ratio for indoor potting mixes and what to include (and what not to include) Best way to store soil Is reusing soil ok? What’s up with “baking”soil? How and when to repot your plants When to start fertilizing Pest control Is the white mold on the top of the soil going to kill a plant  \xa0 Mentioned in today\'s episode!

You will remember Leslie from our two part series on Understanding Natural Light and Propagation 101. She has two books, Plant Parenting- a guide to plant propagation and Gardening Under Lights. Today Leslie joins me to discuss everything we need to know about grow lights. Winter is coming plant friends, and many of us might need to take the plunge with additional grow lights to make sure our plants are happy and healthy. Personally, as my plant collection grew, I quickly realized I did not have the amount of light needed for the amount of plants I had collected. That\'s when I started bringing grow lights home to help keep all my plants happy. I also got really into using them as part of the design of our apartments, as my go to grow light companies, Soltech Solutions and Modern Sprout make gorgeous lights that actually enhance your homes aesthetic instead of making you look like you are up to something questionable. This is the second episode we’ve done on grow lights. The first one was Episode 12 with Chris Satch. I wanted to do another one because this science of grow lights, and photosynthesis can be tricky and it’s nice to hear it explained by various people. That’s why we have several episodes on succulents, and other topics. So listen to today’s episode, listen to it again, listen to episode 12, just keep listening and absorbing and learning. \xa0 In this episode we learn:  What Leslie’s personal grow light set up is What photosynthesis is Why light is important for plants What the different colors of light do for plants and why “full spectrum” grow lights are so important Lumens vs PAR vs Kelvin = how to measure light What the best choice of grow lights for indoor houseplants are Defining “bright indirect” for a grow light Patreon Plant Friend and listener Questions !  \xa0 Mentioned in today\'s episode!

This is a community episode in response to it being National Indoor Plant Appreication week and I asked you to call in with a story of you and your plants. We have tales of plant wins, plant heirlooms, crazy plant person moments and even some fails. We we learn from every one of you today, and that fills my heart. What I am more excited is that we are taking plant appreciation to the next level, by diving into what is happening in the Amazon rainforest, and how we can help. Plant friends, these plants that we know and love are mostly all tropical plants, growing in the Amazon. The amazon is home to so many species that are all currentlythreatened by the intentional burning of the rainforests. As plant parents, if we are going to love these plants, we need to respect where they come from, and hopefully participate in the protection of their natural habitats. At the end of the episode I give a brief an overview of what is going on, and we share resources provided by our community which we can educate ourselves and learn about organizations that are fighting the deforestation efforts. \xa0 In this episode we:  Hear stories of plant appreciation from various members of our community Learn about the Amazon Rainforest Fires Learn how we can help from resources supplied by our community  \xa0 \xa0 Thank you to our listeners who called in and shared their stories!

In this conversation I’ve sat down with Rooney Bloom, a home grower of cannabis, and Chudy Azuogu, a commercial grower of cannabis, for a “compare and contrast” conversation on growing Cannabis from seed to harvest. Last week, on Episode 69 we discussed set up, seed starting and the vegetative stage, today we discuss flowering, harvesting and curing. \xa0This conversation is so much more about growing plants, the unbelievable advances in science that allow indoor growers to replicate outdoor growing, and learning about a very trendy industry! I hope you enjoy! In this episode we learn:  How to get the plant to flower in a commercial set up and why growers manipulate grow lights during this process How Cannabis flowers naturally outdoors The process of caring for Cannabis after it flowers day 1, day 7 and day 21 Caring for Cannabis outdoors How to know when to harvest What a trichome is What tool you need to see when it’s time to harvest How to harvest in a commercial grow house How to harvest as a home grower The bud drying process commercially and at home What are terpenes How to “burp” your bud The lifespan of a cannabis plant in a commercial grow house VS outdoors Pest Control How the commercial grower has to comply with the government to grow legally How Chudy feels about being a pioneer in the Cannabis industry Final thoughts on Cannabis from a home grower and a commercial grower  \xa0Check out the behind the scenes tour of Chudy\'s commercial grow facility here!

In that tour, it was incredibly clear to me that I needed to sit down with the founder of The Garden, Chudy Azuogu and Rooney to discuss their different approaches to growing Cannabis, from seed to harvest. Cannabis is obviously a very popular plant these days for indoor growers… for different reasons than our houseplant plant parenthood obsessions, BUT this two part conversation ends up not being about Cannabis, but perspectives from two growers on how they care for a simple plant. What struck me the most is how commercial growers, (of Cannabis or any other plant) use science and technology to manipulate these plants to grow to their best ability and yield. But really, they are trying to mimic what Mother Nature does so easily. I’m so thankful to Rooney and Chudy for being so open to have this conversation and give us so much knowledge! It was an eye opening conversation that I’m so thankful for! Disclaimer: if you plan on growing Cannabis, you absolutely must look up your local laws on growing this plant. This episode is not an endorsement for growing Cannabis, but an exploratory conversation for those who do. Do your own research on the legal side if you intend on growing on your own. Also- you might hear Rooney’s pup walking around and wagging his tail through this conversation, he was a wonderful audience to have in Rooney’s home during this conversation. In this episode we learn:  How Rooney Bloom became the professional plant educator he is How Chudy Azuogu became a commercial grower of Cannabis The difference in growing cannabis from a commercial and home grower perspective What do you need to grow Cannabis Commercially What do you need to grow Cannabis as a home grower How to start seeds from home and in a commercial grow house Why it is important to separate Male and Female Cannabis Plants How to tell Male and Female Cannabis Plants apart How and when to feed cannabis commercially and at home The lighting setup in a Commercial grow house How to care for the plants while they are in their vegetative stage  Tune in next week for Growing Cannabis Part 2: Flowering to Harvest when Rooney and Chudy lead us through how to watch (or force) a plant to flower, how to care for it in it’s flowering stage, how to harvest and dry the bud and overall thoughts on the Cannabis industry. \xa0 Thank you to Highline Wellness for Sponsoring today\'s episode!

This would eventually take the form of Loom, an adventure game far different than anything that would come before or after it. With no inventory, no verbs, and music as your only means of interacting with the world, Loom stands some 30 years later as an interesting evolutionary dead end for the genre. On this episode of Retronauts, join Bob Mackey and Kat Bailey, and Duckfeed.tv's Gary Butterfield as the two explore one of LucasArts' less remembered adventures. | Finishing out our patron request series on roguelike role-playing games, Jeremy Parish, Bob Mackey, Jason Wilson, and John Harris explore latter-day roguelikes and how we got to the weird, wonderful world of Spelunky. | Jeremy Parish, Bob Mackey, Ray Barnholt, and Shane Bettenhausen use the Konami Code to tackle the challenge of recapping the Contra series, just in time for the latest entry in the franchise. | We often talk about the U.S., Japan, and the U.K., but what about the rest of the world? Games journalist and historian Thomas Nickel takes time out of his Tokyo Game Show work to share some insights into the classic gaming experience in Germany. | In the past decade, developer From Software went from making poorly reviewed oddities to being one of the most important developers in our modern era. And it all started with Demon's Souls, a humble, slightly janky game that challenged the new standard of frictionless gameplay in the HD era, and delivered an experience we didn't know we were so hungry for. On this episode of Retronauts, join Bob Mackey, Jeremy's Parish, USgamer's Kat Bailey, and Duckfeed.tv's Gary Butterfield as the crew explores the bleak and endlessly compelling world of Demon's Souls. Listen now, so the world might be mended. So the world might be mended. | Jeremy Parish teams up with the Retronauts East crew to discuss PC classic puzzle-action game Lemmings before jumping into a one-on-one interview with one of the game's designers, Mike Dailly of DMA Designs. | Now that Retronauts has transitioned to deep dives of single titles over the past few years, it's about time to focus on a genre we rarely touch: adventure games. That said, this marks the beginning of a limited series where I (Bob) will be covering the entire LucasArts adventure library—one game per episode—hopefully with new and/or rare guests. Since I'm not covering these games in any particular order, there's no better place to start than The Secret of Monkey Island, the release that would define LucasArts' house style for its remaining decade of adventure game output. And there's no better guest than Monkey Island superfan Nina Matsumoto (of FanGamer and Sparks fame), someone who's loved the series since 1990 and even created the cover art for Ron Gilbert's latest adventure game, Thimbleweed Park! So join us as we enter the world of corrosive grog, rubber chickens with pulleys in the middle, and insult sword fighting and jump back in time nearly 30 years to explore a game that launched a much-beloved series. | Continuing our journey through the Final Fantasy series, Kat Bailey joins Jeremy Parish and Bob Mackey to talk about what makes Final Fantasy VIII such a weird and wonderful chapter in the series—just in time for the remaster! Just mind the spoilers... | Jeremy Parish, Bob Mackey, and Shane Bettenhausen paraglide into Kazakh S.S.R. to profess the glory of a game that remains indelibly cool even 30 years later: Capcom's Strider. | The curse of the podcaster means we usually have so much to say in our limited time that we often don't have space to let you get a word in edgewise. So, every six months, I (Bob) like to collect comments and questions from the last six months' worth of my episodes—from both the main site and Patreon—and respond to them with a guest. So this week, join me and Jeremy as we respond to your thoughts on Spider-Man games, Reggie Fils-Aime, Kingdom Hearts 3, Sonic the Hedgehog's many voice actors, Stardew Valley, Resident Evil 4, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the year 1989, and Nester (another mutant, but not a turtle or a teenager).

The basic idea of the cabinet is an open box that looks like you can look through to the wall. However, it will actually have a false back made of 1/4” MDF painted the same color as the wall to hide all of the wires. For this project I like the clean look of miter joints, but I am worried that it will not be strong enough. The cabinet will be about 48 inches wide, 10 inches tall, and 14 inches deep. Do I need to reinforce the miters somehow or will glueing in the false back strengthening it sufficiently?

What is the best way to go about this? I am assuming some core 4-square stock is the starting point. These are going to be Krenov-type legs, so thinly laminating finished leg seems out of the question. \xa0 Segment: All-Time Favorite Tool\xa0 Mike:\xa0Holdfast   Get a grip on your work  Ben:\xa0CNC used as a pin router  The Pin Router  Anissa:\xa0Her marking gauges   Shopmade Cutting Gauge  Tool Test: Marking Gauges  \xa0 Question 3: From Dave: What machinery can be bought vintage and what should be bought new(er_)? It seems as though this kind of discussion is all but exhausted when it comes to hand tools but I don\'t hear as much about the bigger purchases in the shop. For instance, not much has changed for drill presses, so an old and stout model seems like a chance to save some money. Meanwhile, it\'s clear that table saws have improved dramatically with regards to safety and dust collection, so if a SawStop is attainable, I should budget accordingly. But what are your thoughts about bandsaws, jointers, planers, lathes, and the like? Are some types of shop equipment less vulnerable to the risks of buying used?   Used tools are this woodworker’s best friend  \xa0 Question 4: From Frank: I am making several MDF plinths for an upcoming exhibit. They are 16" square. I mitered the edges so the only visible end gain is at the top. I’m looking for painting suggestions.

I am in my 30s, have been woodworking for ~10 years. I would like to keep woodworking into my 80s, so I can justify a longer term investment.\xa0 I can afford a 1.5 or 2k tool, but could buy something else if I stuck with a cheaper planer.\xa0\xa0   Segemented Cutterheads Change the Game\xa0  \xa0 \xa0Question 2: From Martin: I know Mike likes to have a small offset between the rails and stiles of his frame-and-panel doors.

Obviously things like the blade angle and fence are not very precise but I want to know what sources of error are there to look out for? What are the types of error you\'re concerned about with a cheap table saw?\xa0  Portable Saws  \xa0 Question 4: From Capt. Zachary J. Daniels: I want to buy a block plane from Lie-Nielsen.\xa0 I know Mike is a fan of the adjustable mouth block plane.\xa0 However, I also remember Mike and Matt Kenney having a spirited debate where Matt was extolling the virtues of the rabbeting block plane. I can’t seem to find the original discussion between Matt and Mike.\xa0 Instead of listening to the entire catalog again, (and without Matt around to defend himself) I’m interested to hear Mike’s opinion on why he prefers the adjustable mouth block plane over the rabbeting block plane. Right now, I only want to buy one block plane as I also have my eye on the No. 62 low angle jack.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Thanks for the show and keep up the great work!\xa0 I became an unlimited member after listening to several of the podcasts, so keep the content coming and inspiring others!\xa0 \xa0   Rabbet Planes Are Real Shop Workhorses  The Best Way to Fit Tenons  \xa0\xa0  Every two weeks, a team of Fine Woodworking staffers answers questions from readers on Shop Talk Live, Fine Woodworking‘s biweekly podcast.

Ranging from “a little while” -whatever that is?- to overnight, and everything in between. Do you guys have any good rules of thumb for drying time?   Strategies for Squeeze-out  How to Tame Tricky Glue-Ups  How to Apply Wiping Varnish  Question 2: From the Fine Woodworking forum by forum member NewAndGreen: I’d like to apply a water based topcoat to two white oak chairs I’ve sanded. I was interested in using General Finishes water-based topcoat, but don’t know if I should go with the flat or the satin finish. I have read that GF’s satin is shinier than most. Is that true?\xa0 (I put a coat of Minwax Satin Polycrylic on one and liked the look, but I’m looking for a better product .) I know I don’t want to start mixing. (I’ve already over-complicated the process!) I also know I don’t want a glossy look and not a totally matte look. Ugh. Pictures of two parts of chair attached for reference. Thanks in advance for your advice/thoughts to this new and green refinisher! Question 3: Also from Paul: I\xa0 have not heard Rubio Monocoat or Osmo mentioned on the podcast. Have any of you tried Monocoat? Being in the industry professionally myself, and, seeing what other pros are using, Monocoat and Osmo seem to be the two go-to products that many professionals use as their primary oil finish (they’re like the BMW and Mercedes of woodworking it seems).

My 3rd grade drawings look every bit as good as my current attempts. On STL180, you talked about design for about 30 minutes without mentioning cad as a design medium. \xa0 I know it’s a scary topic but as a resolution at least one of you should try to design a furniture piece down to the jointery on your computer. The learning curve can be steep but I find that designing on the computer allows me to virtually build the piece without creating any sawdust. And from Paul: I don’t know that I’ve ever heard Fusion 360 mentioned on the podcast. I used Sketchup for several years and loved it… however, a few years ago a landed a very complicated project (with cnc work involved), and came to the realization I needed something more sophisticated. Fusion 360 is now such a huge part of my business and can’t imagine ever going back to Sketchup. Having parametric capabilities now seems absolutely necessary. Have any of you ever tried it?

I built them mostly the way Michael Robbins did, however instead of using a domino to construct the top I used pocket screws. I don\'t own a domino, I opted for a hollow chisel mortiser, and\xa0 I thought it would be silly to use a hollow chisel mortise. How do you feel about pocket screws versus slip tenons made with a domino? Both tools make joining pieces of wood much simpler. One uses screws, the other uses wood and glue. One is under $100, and the other is over $1000. They are both faster and easier than traditional joinery. Am I wrong to think if I am not going to use traditional joinery pocket screws and domino slip tenons are interchangeable? I love my hollow-chisel mortiser, and if I\'m gonna cheat on it, I’ll just use screws.\xa0        Biscuit Joinery Tips and Tricks Learn how to harness the full potential of your biscuit joiner in Part I of our two-part series By Asa Christiana           Simple Cabinetry with Pocket Hole Joinery Low-cost jig produces basic cabinetry joinery that\'s easy and strong By Asa Christiana    Question 2: From Chase: I was trying to edge-joint two 10-ft. long boards to make a wide shelf for our closet using a #7 handplane.\xa0 Typically, I clamp the boards together and plane the common glue edge until I get an even shaving across both.\xa0 I think that the length of the two boards meant there was some variation that the #7 didn\'t get.

For a dresser this size–or any deep piece that is dovetailed–is seasonal wood movement a concern? Plain sawn lumber is cheaper than rift or quartersawn. Question 2: From Christian: I’m lucky enough to be expecting my first child, a baby boy, and I’ve always liked the idea of giving him a Lie Nielsen No 1 as a christening present. Recently, someone has suggested it a novelty tool and will be useless to him when he grows up. What alternative premium tools would you suggest as a christening gift? Question 3: From Mike: I’m building up my skills slowly by adding one new skill to each project I take on where I can. \xa0I want to try my hand at dovetails one of these days as that new skill. I have two questions:  There are a ton of ways I see people doing them. Is there a method you recommend people start with? You recommend people learn to sharpen by picking one method, and sticking with it until you\'re good at it. Would the same apply to dovetail methods, or should you try a bunch of ways and then go with what you find out you like doing?

When sanding, the strip cracked along its length and I discovered that I had done a poor job of the clamping. The cracked section, which is about \xa04-5 inches long on one side of the checkerboard strip appears to have “lifted” during clamping and there is now an air space under the crack. Any suggestions that might help to save this? I thought perhaps trying to inject some glue under the crack to fill in the space using a needle??? Question 5: \xa0 From David: I’ve recently had the opportunity to revamp my shop and am planning to build a Matt Kenney’s monster workbench. I’ve bought the plans, and watched the videos, but I don’t see how the top is fastened to the stand? Is there something I’m missing? Is it supposed to just sit on top? Question 6: From Dave: I love books but dislike most book covers - they\'re generally too visually noisy! I feel like my living space is full of loud colorful ad copy, or like I\'m in a chain bookstore. Do you have any recommendations for ways to keep books in the home that would allow you to conceal the visual clutter?

And finally, the show gets about as classy as it will ever get in discussing the practicality of using adult diapers during speed runs.\xa0 And it's about damn time.

Craft a Life You Love by taking a small step toward turning happiness and fulfillment by savoring this season no matter where you are in your life and in the world. | One of the greatest joys in life comes with learning to listen to that inner voice inside your head that is urging you to make a move. That’s exactly what today’s guest, Ali Bonar did when she launched her business, Kween. Ali shares how she’s learned to craft a life that she loves by shutting out the noise. We discuss her struggles with a disordered relationship with food, her journey to self-love and how she came up with the idea for creating granola butter. She shares what it’s like running a business with her boyfriend and using food, a former trigger for her, as the creative element for her business.\xa0 \xa0 What’s in this episode:  How Ali crafts a life she loves by tuning out the noise and listening to her inner voice Becoming obsessed with eating clean\xa0 Starting her self-love journey with her Instagram account, Avokween Her idea for creating granola butter and launching her business Her experience of working with her boyfriend as cofounders Being transparent about her eating disorder and her healing journey Finding the right therapist for you The role that creativity plays in Ali’s business and using food as a creative element Giving herself permission to enjoy former triggers Slowing down in her personal life and taking time for yourself Carving out space in your day to spend time with friends and family  \xa0 About Ali: Hailing from the rough streets of San Diego, Ali Bonar inevitably developed an addiction - to food. In fact, she\'s been eating 3x/day for as long as she can remember. Her deep-rooted passion for nutrition inspired her to study Nutritional Sciences at UC Berkeley and eventually launch @avokween, where she dove crown-first into the Kween lifestyle. Ali wholeheartedly believes that overall wellbeing is often achieved off-the-plate: nutrition is important, but human connection (and pizza with friends at 2 a.m.) are essential.

From this diagnosis, she was faced with the difficult task of reducing stress and work in her life. It was then that she made the difficult decision to let go of the business side of Bella BLVD to focus on the art and design portion she initially fell in love with. Stephanie partnered her business with Doodlebug and continues to work as the Creative Director.\xa0 \xa0 We discuss how her brain tumor changed her mindset and perspective on life, how she fills her life with color, and how she came up with the idea for her event, She Loves Color. We also chat about transitioning to working less, how to reduce stress in your life and the mantra that Stephanie lives by.\xa0 \xa0 What’s in this episode:  What is going on right now in Stephanie’s life Discovering she had a brain tumor How that diagnosis has changed her perspective and mindset Filling her life with color\xa0 What kind of scrapbooking Stephanie enjoys to do What inspired Stephanie to start scrapbooking How She Loves Color came about Creating an environment where women could support each other Showcasing other women in the creative industry How Stephanie crafts a life that she loves Transitioning to working from home and working less What Stephanie recommends to help people reduce stress The process of partnering with Doodlebug The mantra that Stephanie lives by  \xa0 From Stephanie: The truth about me is that I have loved scrapbooking since the very first day I walked into a local store; I met the owner, and was hired the same day! Attending fine arts classes during the day, and teaching scrapbooking workshops at night became part of my daily college routine. After earning an expensive Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphic Design I moved out of state to follow my love for art and design. After two years I returned home to Wisconsin with bigger dreams: Shortly thereafter, Bella Blvd was born (2008). \xa0 Fast forward to January of 2018: Life certainly changed for me when the doctors informed me that I have brain cancer-needless to say, it put a whole lot of things into perspective. The doctors recommend working much less and reducing stress in my life. While Bella Blvd brings me so much joy, it also comes with it\'s fair amount of stress. Therefore, I made a tough decision to choose life and to let go of all the business side of Bella Blvd. As of January 2019 Doodlebug will be maintaining all of the company\'s day-to-day operations. I will continue to be involved on the art and design levels and am so thankful to have found Cynthea and her team to partner with! \xa0 After attending the Inspired Retreat in Nashville in May of 2016, the She Loves Color Event was born. The mission is to inspire, connect and customize. We aim with the event to support each other and allow color to energize us. We\'ve designed the event to allow women to do what they love, meet new friends and offer a manufacture focused event. As the owner of Bella Blvd it\'s important to me the we not only recognize the Educators, but also the companies that are behind the faces.\xa0 \xa0 Connect with Stephanie: Instagram | Bella BLVD Instagram | She Loves Color Instagram | Bella BLVD Website \xa0 Links:  She Loves Color 2019: During online registration in the “other girlfriends in my group” section, mention me: Amy Tangerine and let them know I sent you!

On that note, please know that though there is one spoiler for the way a couple of Twilight Mirage factions end up, there are no spoilers about major Twilight Mirage characters or their arcs anywhere throughout these episodes. The Road to Season 6 started with a desire to try out new game systems before we committed to one for a full season, but after thinking about it for a bit, we realized that we could use a bunch of games to explore the history of the massive, fracturing empire that will be at the center of PARTIZAN. And to do that right, we needed to make sure to start outside of that empire. To that end, we kicked things off with Dialect: A Game About Language and How It Dies by Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalioglu. In this episode, we develop a new culture of nomadic space deer, and watch as they encounter an empire which aims to obliterate time and space themselves. As a quick follow up: This episode (and the rest of the Road to Season 6) all began as episodes in our Live at the Table series, a collection of one shot streams that we do for all $5+ Patrons! That means that you can go watch or listen to every episode of the Road right now if you head to our Patreon! They won’t have the intros (and they’ll all be unedited, with a lot more dead air), but if you’re desperate to know what comes next, you can learn that right now.\xa0 If all this world building isn’t your thing, and you’d rather skip these and rejoin us for the character driven drama and action of season six proper, then please know you can toatlly do that too. While these episodes will help fill in some blank spaces, they are not required listening for our next season! Either way, I hope you enjoy this series of episodes as much as we enjoyed making them. We’ll see you in a couple of months, in the shadow of the giant Girandole, on the holy moon of Partizan...

From beginning...  \xa0 \xa0 ...to end!! \xa0 It\'s been quite a journey and we had a great time capping it off by answering some of your questions! We had such a wonderful outpouring of support and love the past week and it really means the most to us! We love doing this and we love that people enjoy listening to it. Over the next weeks, the friends behind Friends at the Table are going to take a short break before starting our sixth season: PARTIZAN, a story of war, politics, faith, and (yes) giant mechs. You can hear the trailer in this episode or by itself,  right here, and you can check out the game we\'ll be playing in PARTIZAN, Austin Ramsay\'s Beam Saber, right here.\xa0 But before we get there, to keep your podcast feed warm, we\'ll be sharing the Road to Season Six, an anthology of one-shots played in different systems that will bridge the Twilight Mirage and PARTIZAN seasons. The Road to Season Six isn\'t\xa0necessary listening if you want to hop on board PARTIZAN in a couple of months, but it definitely provides some big picture context for the stakes and history that lead us to this new setting! These episodes originated as Live at the Table games, available to watch live for all of our Patreon supporters, and if you want to check them out (unedited, without music) right now, you can actually do that! Just go to\xa0friendsatthetable.cash and become a $5 supporter to get access to all of the Live at the Table games, our bonus campaign, Bluff City, and both Tips at the Table and Drawing Maps, two shows that share our thoughts on playing and prepping games. For just $1, you can get years of "Clapcasts," collections of the all the chatter between us that happens before we get into the game proper.\xa0 (Speaking of Live at the Table, most of the past Live at the Table music is NOW AVAILABLE over on Jack\'s bandcamp.  Go check it out!) If you\'re already a patron, or if you\'re not looking for more podcast to listen to but want to support the show somehow, then guess what: We have TWO new pieces of merchandise to check out. First, we\'ve teamed up with Heart of the Deernicorn (creator of Fall of Magic and BFF!) and the incredible artist Simon Sweetman to make  this Fall of Magic t-shirt, hoody, and print, featuring characters from our very own playthrough of that game! Second, we\'ve opened up our own online store at friendsatthetable.shop, where you can (FINALLY!) buy prints of the incredible Hieron cover art by artist Craig Sheldon! A single print is $15 USD, but you can get the entire set for just $35!\xa0  \xa0 | ...took a new name: the Frost Shepherd. It was in trying to understand this act, its causes, and its consequences, that I first thought this second volume might be necessary.\xa0 Even as it happened, I sensed a moment of diversion, of what an old mentor would have called a potential “rupture” in history. In the old Hieron, when such a thing was still possible, I studied and practiced as a semiotician of the New Archives. Because the Rhizome stretches as it does, and because we were so removed from the histories which precede us, you may not know what that means. In short: We collected the world\xa0so that we might better arrange it. This is how I fell in love with writing and with history. Towards the end of my studies, in some north campus basement, Semiotician Emeritus Uklan Tel delivered a guest lecture for a select group out of some technical obligation to the department.\xa0 “The world unfolds according to systems and rules,” he told us. “History, politics, war, society--they have velocity, they have force, they have momentum. But now and then there is a chance for great change.” Any average evening would be followed by an equally average day, but a rupturous\xa0evening might bring a day like one we’ve never seen.\xa0 But these moments only carried the potential for transformation, he told us. These moments of historical rupture, he said, offered opportunity for the systems and rules by which we organize ourselves to find a new route. But most of the time? That opportunity was wasted. Things returned to the status quo. The moons past over the edge of the world, the sun arose, and we’d be back to normal. I had the impression, as he started to speak, that he was trotting out an old lecture, something reliable, that even dead in his voice would impress on our young, eager psyches. But as he spoke, he found a startling rhythm, like an old workhorse building towards a colt’s gait.\xa0 It was as if something he’d seen, something recent, maybe, had given flesh to words that had only been bone. I could tell that he thought he wasn’t just correct, but that he right. He told us, then, that we might not know it, but that we lived in a moment of rupture.\xa0 And when I stood in that crowd and heard the Frost Shepherd speak, I recognized in my own blood, on my own skin, an echo of Tel’s old confidence in recognizing a moment rupture.\xa0 When Tel warned us about the future, he was, of course right--and only now do we know how ironic this warning was, considering his own role in the events of the years that followed that lecture. Which is excuse enough for me to extend his warning to you: In times like these, the rupture is not one night, it is ongoing, and we are all participants in whatever comes next. Pace yourselves. Recognize the way you touch the world. And travel accordingly. -An Excerpt from the Foreword to The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 5  Hosted by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Featuring Janine Hawkins (@bleatingheart) Andi Clare (@captaintrash), Ali Acampora (@ali_west), Art Martinez-Tebbel (@atebbel), Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal), Keith J Carberry (@keithjcarberry) and Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000) Music by Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal) Text by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Produced by Ali Acampora (@ali_west) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon (@shoddyrobot) | ...understandably caused us to doubt not only our relationship with them (albeit too late), but also with ourselves and our faculties.\xa0 The world was large, larger not only than what we’d known before but larger than anything it had been before. And it was large in new ways. In the old Hieron, a big place was wide or it was tall. But we’d learned that this place was deep. We’d regularly find new creatures and cultures in the branches we already knew well. How could we trust that we had not missed something important in a place like this? For the adventurous sort, those who followed in the footsteps of those who founded the modern University settlement, this was a plus. But for those whose task was to catalog, study, and explain the Rhizome, this was an ache that never dulled. “It’s made setting up our beat desks that much harder,” said Marisol Sweetwater, then editor, now publisher of The New Current.\xa0 “We have to constantly ask ourselves questions that back in Rosemerrow would’ve been given. What does ‘Local News’ mean in a place where a whole civilization can just show up under some giant petal you never flipped over?”\xa0 The Rhizome was not simply vast, it was vasting, endlessly growing. And in the face of that, stability became the chief, communal referent. Even those who prefered the world this way, who were eager to turn leaves over for the rest of their lives, had their own exploits reframed in the popular rhetoric of cataloguing and mastery. One might take to the long branch to explore, but when their stories reached home, it was as proof that the Rhizome could be explored—routed, mapped, finally put to rest. Who knows why the discourse shifted like this. Some suggest it’s because of a generic fear of the unknown. Maybe it was because it was what we already knew. Or, perhaps, it was because deep down we knew that there was only one way left for us to “settle” the world and make it knowable again, and we feared that possibility as much as we desired it. -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes  \xa0 This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 5 \xa0 Hosted by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Featuring Janine Hawkins (@bleatingheart) Andi Clare (@captaintrash), Ali Acampora (@ali_west), Art Martinez-Tebbel (@atebbel), Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal), Keith J Carberry (@keithjcarberry) and Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000) Music by Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal) Text by Austin Walker (@austin_walker)  Produced by\xa0Ali Acampora (@ali_west) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon (@shoddyrobot) | …unexpected means of conveyance, but at that time, what ought have been reasonably expected at all? Perhaps such flippancy isn’t well placed. Now, with the benefit of distance and context, it’s simple to recognize the many ways that the Rhizome should have shaken loose our assumptions along with all that old Hieronic dirt. But by all retrospective accounts--including this historian’s own limited recollection--no single question dominated our collective anxiety as much as this one: What can we expect? In a world of giant insects, endless growth, unearthed histories older than the Weaver King was long, how could we know what tomorrow would bring? Perhaps it was phrased differently, sometimes more specifically or with more sentimentality. But at core, it was this question--this fear--that led many to swear allegiance to the banners of Alcyon, the University, the Grey Duke. The words delivered to us by the Shepherd confirm that it was what motivated those who came to that fateful Understanding. And while this is admittedly conjecture, it is easy to believe that it is what made so many pray to Galenica, whose most authorial power was still grounded in the one bit of old Hieron still left in grand supply: us. Would tomorrow be worse than today? Would the suns ever find consistency, the pollen ever break? Would those who left us return? Would the threads of the world spiral further apart than they already had? Would ‘normalcy’ ever arrive? In the face of these things, how common a response fear is. After all, what more could we expect? -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 4 \xa0 Hosted by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Featuring Janine Hawkins (@bleatingheart) Andi Clare (@captaintrash), Ali Acampora (@ali_west), Art Martinez-Tebbel (@atebbel), Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal), Keith J Carberry (@keithjcarberry) and Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000) Produced by\xa0Ali Acampora (@ali_west) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon (@shoddyrobot) | ..alone would drive many settlements to resign themselves to his vassalage, as the Duke’s medicinal stores separated him from many of the other warlords in that first year, when the pollen was so severe not only due to its density but to our own body’s sluggish adaptation to it. But the University’s leadership was not keen to submit to anyone, least of all a monarch who wouldn’t even show his own face on the frontlines; whatever their differences, Corsica Neue and Lord Ephrim had in common a comfort with danger and a respect for those who would wade into it courageously. In hindsight, though, it has become clear that the Grey Duke’s grand project—his attempt to re-order and organize the world around him and his territory—did not need others to kneel before him. They need only decide that facing him was a necessity to ensure his centrality in the new maps of the world. Which provides some context for the surprising, and not altogether unwelcome, tactics the Duke deployed... -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes  This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 3 \xa0 Hosted by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Featuring Janine Hawkins (@bleatingheart) Andi Clare (@captaintrash), Ali Acampora (@ali_west), Art Martinez-Tebbel (@atebbel), Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal), Keith J Carberry (@keithjcarberry) and Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000) Produced by\xa0Ali Acampora (@ali_west) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon (@shoddyrobot) |  ...good a start as could be imagined, given the circumstances. But there was a confounding question still, which seemed to rent space in everyone’s mind: Yes, the university had survived, but where was it? This was not a philosophical question. It was a simple matter of fact, a concrete concern. “Used to be three weeks, with cart, from Twinbrook,” said one resident of the University, who operated a food cart both before and after the Second Spring. “Sure, [I] haven’t made that trip in eight or nine years, not with everything going on. But [I] could count on it. Three weeks, with cart.” The man tapped his temple three times, as if to emphasize the truth of the matter. While early efforts--DuCarte’s map school, the Spider Silk Gondola to Alcyon, Feritas’ road project--were progressing on schedule, there was the gnawing feeling among some in leadership roles that these moved too slowly. “If even our people, easy-tempered and well-calloused from the old life want to map this tangle out,” wrote Corsica Neue in her journal, “then others, those chronically conditioned by control and ease, must be even more eager mappers than we.” -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 2 \xa0 Hosted by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Featuring Janine Hawkins (@bleatingheart) Andi Clare (@captaintrash), Ali Acampora (@ali_west), Art Martinez-Tebbel (@atebbel), Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal), Keith J Carberry (@keithjcarberry) and Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000) Produced by\xa0Ali Acampora (@ali_west) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon (@shoddyrobot) | …was standing there in the midst of utter chaos, I found strength in words uttered by the immortal warrior Red Jack (who you will become well acquainted with as you read on) only days before he led an assault on the being called the Advocate. “Heroism,” he said, “is not such a unique thing.” He was right. The heroes that day were not only those who faced down men worshipped as gods—or those that despised them. The heroes were the many whose names were not already known, who rallied their neighbors as the world around them crumbled, and ensured that even if the very body of Hieron itself vanished, Hieron, the collection of people, would not. The world, contrary to this book’s title, did not end. All of which is to say that I am grateful that this text is being published in an incomplete state. The truth is that when I first began to write this volume, it wasn’t a volume at all. It was just a book. An encyclopedia, collecting in one place stories from reliable (if not always honest) narrators, who together paint an image of the world as it was when it was still ending. As a writer and as an archivist, of course I knew a book like this could never be complete: Even if every fact I’d scribbled were true, even if I’d eradicated my bias—and I haven’t—how could I be sure that some key detail was not lost in the telling? And so I am twice happy to be writing this foreword. First, because it means that the world and life (which frankly, I am very fond of) continues yet. Second, with our collective end seemingly deferred it gives me an excuse to begin a second volume, less focused on the apocalyptic end of everything, and more interested in all the minor endings we face as we find out what life even is here in the rhizome. For now, though, I hope that you find this volume insightful, and that if you do not, that you at least find it entertaining. A final note to that end: While you can read this text linearly from front to back, I advise simply opening to any page and reading the first full entry there, and following the references and footnotes there listed. If you absolutely must be given a defined starting place, though, I recommend entry A919: The Island of Eventide.

Maybe it seems like a pipe dream. You think your winter food will come solely from what you've preserved and what you can buy at the grocery store.   But it doesn't have to be that way. Even if you have a small indoor space, you can add fresh vegetables and herbs to your table, even in the dead of winter.   In this episode of the Beginner's Garden Podcast and in the article below, Ashley Dempster from the Townhouse Homestead shares her tips to get started growing food indoors.\xa0 \xa0 Show Notes:\xa0journeywithjill.net/104 \xa0 Get Jill’s “In the Garden” Weekly Emails + Free Printable Resources Here:\xa0journeywithjill.net/gardensignup \xa0 Join the Beginner’s Garden Shortcut Facebook Group:\xa0https://facebook.com/groups/beginnersgarden/ \xa0 Connect with Jill on Instagram:\xa0https://instagram.com/thebeginnersgarden/ \xa0 |  The end of the summer gardening season is the perfect time to reflect on the year so far -- specifically, summer garden lessons learned. Whether you're a new gardener or have had many years of experience, we can all learn from each other. This is why I love to share my gardening lessons in real-time with you!   You may have already seen my lessons from this year's spring garden so now it's time for lessons from my summer garden.\xa0 journeywithjill.net/103 \xa0  | What fall garden tasks should you complete as your summer garden comes to a close? Whether you plant a fall garden or want to make sure your garden is ready for a spring planting, these 7 tasks will prepare you for your next gardening season. journeywithjill.net/102 |  When I began exploring medicinal herb gardening, I felt like I had walked into a foreign country. I didn't know where to start or how to navigate this new territory.   But like everything in my garden journey, I took small steps. And while I still consider myself a beginning medicinal herb gardener, I do feel like I've found my footing a bit.   Because growing a medicinal herb garden -- or simply introducing medicinal herbs into our lives -- is something many beginning gardeners explore, I wanted to give you a guide to get started in medicinal herb gardening. journeywithjill.net/101  |  In 2013 I planted my first garden. Looking back, I see mistakes and successes from that first year. All of them served to teach me, and they helped me grow a more successful garden each season.   Because we all can learn from each other, and because many of my mistakes are common among beginning gardeners, I wanted to share seven mistakes and eight successes from my first season. https://journeywithjill.net/100  |  Is it possible to control pests in the garden without using pesticides? Many gardeners determine to use organic practices. But soon they find themselves discouraged when bad insects arrive in their gardens. How do organic gardeners keep bugs from eating their plants?   A healthy, productive, organic home garden goes beyond home remedies for pest control and  organic alternatives to pesticides. Natural pesticides have their place, but I've found that natural pest control goes beyond these stop-gap measures.   Pest control without pesticides looks different than you might think. So how do you do it?   In today's episode of  the Beginner's Garden Podcast, I share six principles to pest control without pesticides for a healthy, organic home garden.\xa0 journeywithjill.net/99 |  If you grow a garden, you know that homegrown vegetables taste better than anything you can purchase in the produce department of your grocery store.   But why do homegrown vegetables and fruit taste better? Is it purely a mental thing -- where we naturally enjoy most what we put our hard work into growing? Or are there also scientific reasons why store-bought tomatoes don't compare to homegrown?   In today's episode of  the Beginner's Garden Podcast and post below, I share with you 4 reasons why the fruits and vegetables you grow yourself taste better. journeywithjill.net/98 |  When I asked the members of my free Facebook group, the Beginner's Garden Shortcut, what questions they had about their fall vegetable garden, I received more feedback than almost any other topic. Clearly, many beginning gardeners are interested in fall gardening. But they recognize it's not as straightforward as the spring or summer garden.   For the beginner, fall gardening isn't as simple to get started. But, it is generally easier than the summer garden. With fewer pests and weeds, we get to enjoy gardening in cooler days and eat crops that don't grow well in the heat of the summer.   Because getting started with planting the fall vegetable garden takes a bit of understanding of this unique garden season, Stacey Murphey of Grow Your Own Vegetables tackles some of the most common fall gardening questions I hear. |  When many beginning gardeners think about fall gardening, they find themselves overwhelmed. After all, they're tired from the effort put into the summer garden, and the thought of more work seems exhausting.   Plus, they don't know when or how to get started.   The truth is, fall gardening can be  the most rewarding time to grow a vegetable garden. It just takes a bit of know-how to get started.   In this week's episode of  the Beginner's Garden Podcast, master gardener and garden teacher Stacey Murphy of Grow Your Own Vegetables talks beginners through how to get started planting and growing their fall gardens. Click below to hear our conversation or keep reading.  |  When is corn ready to pick? It's a tougher answer than you realize. Corn ripens quickly and for only a few days, so the home gardener must watch for the signs that sweet corn is ready to harvest.

AviatorCast bridges the gap between actual flight training and flight simulation to give prospective aviators, current pilots, and even the seasoned flyer new perspectives in aviation. Through studying Human Factors we learn to combat the worst enemy to our flying success; ourselves. How can we become better aviators by interacting with our airplanes more effectively? How can we overcome the shortcomings of our human condition to make better decisions on the flight deck? We believe in learning to a confidence level, not learning to a level required by law. When you get a license, you should be ready to go out and fly in those conditions, with those aircraft, and do so with refined skills. Flight simulators these days are very advanced, and we will discuss how you can sure up your flight training with a home based simulator, giving you limitless hours and practice in IFR with scenario based training. Learn how to fly, become better at your flying craft, mold into a safer pilot, or perfect your professional skills. AviatorCast is an engaging and entertaining podcast that is sure to deliver on the topics you care about.", 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/44/ad/9a/44ad9ae4-939f-ab70-6d07-4c565e4d0878/mza_546728160954611237.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2014-01-17'}}

Interestingly enough, though, it was one of its very last exclusives -- launched in the shadow of PlayStation 4 -- that easily takes the cake as PS3's best game. Naughty Dog's The Last of Us came out in the early summer of 2013, and immediately bowled over millions of gamers around the world with its incredible story, amazing characters, award-winning performances, and fantastic gameplay. It's truly, actually, really, and definitely one of the best games ever made, and we are thrilled to dedicate nearly three hours to talking all about it. So take a knee, craft what you need, and let's get going. Oh... and avoid those spores. | Yes, it's true: There's a lot to love about the 1970s. But the reality is, it was kind of a down decade. Unemployment was high, and inflation was, too. An oil embargo crippled western economies. The peace and love of the '60s rapidly gave way to stagnation, corruption, and agitation. By 1980, people were ready to break free, and they did just that. Buttressed by a technological boom and a rapidly recovering market, the '80s were a time of excess, a time to be loud and bold. The music, movies, games, and television shows each tell a portion of the overall tale -- and we've talked plenty about 'em here on KnockBack -- but it's perhaps that 10 year span's fashion that spoke (and still speaks) loudest. This was an era when sneakers and caps first became an obsession, when accessorizing reached an all-time high, when the colors you wore better be bright (and preferably neon), or else. So grab your Aquanet, tease that hair, and turn on your answering machine. Let's discuss a time when people wore 10 watches at once, when shoulder pads were considered hot for some reason, and when Air Jordans somehow cost more than they do today. | By the early '90s, Disney's much-vaunted animation revival was in full swing. The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast had the company buzzing, yet the decade still had much, much more in store. In late 1992, Aladdin joined the roster, packing a rock-solid cast of voice actors helmed by comedian Robin Williams. Yet, while Williams' ad-libbed performance as Genie is the most celebrated part of the film (and the way Disney treated him perhaps the most notorious), a wonderful crew of animators worked tirelessly to bring the world of Agrabah to life. So let's take a step back and remember a movie from the very thick of the so-called Disney Renaissance, and remember why it was so special to begin with. | Children aren't exactly the most rational creatures on the planet, and naturally, the Moriarty Boys weren't immune to this reality in their younger years. Today's episode of KnockBack is structured around that irrationality, specifically when it comes to the things kids fear. Dagan was afraid of nuclear war, sharks, and aliens. Colin (that's me!) lived in silent fear of a recurring nightmare known as The Tickley Monster, being buried alive, and often wondered if was he was going to die of AIDS (thanks, late-'80s and early-'90s Paranoid America!). All of this is easy to look back and laugh at (and trust us, we do), but it's likewise rooted in the mysticism of youth, when we frankly don't understand very much about the world around us, but think we do. So let's embarrass ourselves just a tad, shall we? | Dinosaurs are a bit of cultural phenomenon, and have been for a century and a half, since the earliest professional paleontologists ventured out to find the fossilized remains of one of Earth's most mysterious and fascinating prior occupants. Yet, perhaps no single piece of fiction has ever played on that human love of dinosaurs quite like Jurassic Park. While Jurassic Park found its origins as a book, released in 1990 and written by the late, great Michael Crichton, it was intended on a movie from pretty much the word go (Crichton even adapted the novel into film form himself for a cool half a million bucks). It's the movie that captured the world's imagination, and it was such a smash hit that it became the highest-grossing film of all-time following its run through theaters in the summer of 1993. Not too shabby! So let's talk about Crichton's classic, Steven Spielberg's directing, John Williams' score, and the performances of Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and many others. (Like Jeff Goldblum. Duh!) Just be sure you say the magic word. | In May of 1999, the very Earth below us shook as Star Wars fully emerged from dormancy. While George Lucas ate around the edges throughout the '90s, re-releasing the classic trilogy multiple times while launching an absurd amount of toys and other merchandise, it all ultimately led to one thing: Episode I. As the first Star Wars film since 1983's Return of the Jedi, Episode I -- subtitled The Phantom Menace -- had immense pressure put on it from the moment it was announced, and for most fans, it simply didn't deliver. But really, there's a lot more here than just (in our opinion) a subpar film. There's a ravenous fandom to discuss, too, one that we were (and kinda still are) a part of. There was the early Internet, forums, leaks, rumors, and more. There's a director who probably shouldn't be directing, a producer who didn't really seem to be producing, and special effects that don't age quite as well as you'd think. What went wrong with E1? What did it do right? And what was it like seeing it in the theater, opening day, opening show, around a lot of very, very, very excited people, about a decade before you could even share the experience on your smartphone? This is the longest episode of KnockBack yet, and you voted for it. (Yes: We're angels.) | What can you really say about The Big Lebowski? Well... a ton, as it turns out. The Coen Brothers' 1998 cult-classic comedy is one of the most quotable films of all-time, with one of the most bizarre cast of amazing characters you'll ever encounter in the genre. Smart, witty, and wonderfully written, The Big Lebowski rings loudly more than two decades after its release not because of '90s nostalgia or hazy retro glasses. It's an authentically hysterical movie, and more than worthy of an episode of KnockBack. So mark it an eight, Dude, and then sit down, do a J, and join us for a fun episode about an enormously influential flick. He asked me to repeat that: Join us for a fun episode about an enormously influential flick. | Even the darkest fiction we watch and read typically has some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. But not Cormac McCarthy's The Road. First published in 2006 (and later turned into a film in 2009), The Road is unlike any father-and-son tale you've ever experienced. Civilization is in ruins, the sun is blotted out by endless smoke, almost everyone is dead, and the world and its few remaining inhabitants are completely unrecognizable. What does it take to survive in such an unimaginably dark situation? And is it even worth surviving at all? Let's delve into this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and ask ourselves a simple question, the question at the very heart of McCarthy's narrative: Is there any limit to what you'd do for love? | No matter where we're from, many of us spend something like 14 years in mandatory school systems that served only to distract us from our toys, video games, and watching cartoons. Yet there we were, imprisoned and desperate to escape. But school wasn't always an agonizing experience, especially when you had the right teacher helming your class. Today's episode of KnockBack is dedicated to them, to the teachers we've taken with us, the ones that inspired us, helped us, cared about us, and -- ultimately -- stuck with us. From an English teacher who instilled the value of literature, to the history teacher who ran a tight ship except for one specific day a year. From an art teacher who insisted on seriousness from the truly talented, to a math teacher who was perhaps a little to easy on us. Let's chat about our very favorite instructors from our youth. And some of yours, too. | When Rosemary's Baby hit theaters in 1968, the horror genre as we know it today didn't really exist yet. The scariest flicks of the era were low budget, poorly lit, and corny beyond belief. But Roman Polanski's film helped define a shift towards the same kind of well written, expertly produced and directed psychological horror that had already found a niche on nascent TV. Written by a bohemian novelist, adapted and spearheaded for the big screen by a highly controversial director, and starring a famous actress who was then known only for her work on a soap opera, Rosemary's Baby is a horror film for the ages. But back in 1968, its religious, witchcraftian premise was utterly offensive to mainstream American sensibilities. That, of course, is part of why it's so great.", 'chan_desc': 'KnockBack is a weekly, retro-and-nostalgia-themed podcast co-hosted by brothers Colin and Dagan Moriarty.

Layden used to be CEO of the American branch of PlayStation, and most recently held the position as Head Honcho of PlayStation\'s fully-owned, first party studios. So let\'s discuss his departure (albeit briefly, because we don\'t have all the answers yet). Beyond all of that, though, is our usual run of show, an episode littered with news. Sony is starting to cut the middleman out of its retail sales, there are lots of fresh details concerning The Last of Us: Part II, Call of Duty is absolutely dominating the historic PS4 sales charts, and Death Stranding is apparently finished and primed for publishing, whether you\'re ready or not. Plus: When will we learn more about Ghost of Tsushima? What\'s the actual definition of "Adventure Game"? What are the best places to buy and sell used hardware and games?

Then: Borderlands 3 sells big (with seven out of ten copies purchased digitally), Sony promises a green PS5 (though not literally), and WB Montreal\'s Twitter account comes out of a long and dark slumber to tease a new Batman game (or so it appears). Listener questions on issues ranging from the lackluster state of the physical games market to the perilous finances of subscription services round out this week\'s offering, including tons of non-TLoU information from Sony\'s State of Play event concerning both PS4 and PSVR .

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | It may be hard to believe, but it\'s been nearly seven years since Borderlands 2 launched, and so with Borderlands 3\'s recent arrival, you may expect fans to be delighted. Some are, no doubt, but many others aren\'t, and such a situation calls much into question: Are there too many loot-based shooters? Can a game like this compete on the modern market? Is Borderlands 3 simply too late? Chris and Colin don\'t see eye-to-eye on this much at all, which makes for an interesting conversation. Then, how \'bout some news?! GameStop keeps tanking, Final Fantasy VII Remake appeals to the old-schoolers, Control\'s sales are soft, and Ubisoft promises massive open-world games galore in its future. Finally, to round things out, we take some listener questions. Are publishers and developers releasing DLC too far after a game\'s launch? What do we think of Katamari Damacy? How do we carve out time to game? If you get a DiGiorno Pizza delivered via Amazon, does it rip a hole in space and time?\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

It seems the Creative Director of Bethesda-owned Tango Gameworks\' Ghostwire: Tokyo has randomly left the studio mere months after introducing and showcasing her game at E3.

Now, the Japanese publisher is teasing a new Resident Evil, but it\'s unclear just what it could be. A mainline entry? Another remake? Or perhaps something else entirely? Let\'s talk about our hopes and dreams for what\'s next for Raccoon City and beyond.

We then round out our weekly offering, as always, with questions, comments, concerns, thoughts, and ideas from the audience. Will game prices really go up next generation? Does Sony have any intention of playing nice with Stadia? Has 2K gone too far with NBA 2K20\'s gambling features? Is a Pizza Roll just an Italian Gusher?

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Every once in a while, a game comes along that you think is one thing, but ends up being something entirely different. (This is especially true for those of us who do our best to avoid preview coverage for titles we\'re excited about.) Sometimes, this is a good thing. Other times, it isn\'t. With Remedy\'s newest game Control -- the dev\'s first adventure on a PlayStation platform in 16 years -- it\'s a little bit of both. Frenetic to play and puzzling to understanding, Control has all the makings of an MGS-like political thriller with a supernatural twist, and there\'s a lot to say about it. Then: We discuss GameStop\'s most recent round of layoffs, Final Fantasy VIII Remaster\'s imminent release date, Persona\'s big sales milestone, and much more, back-loading our fresh-out-of-the-oven episode with listener inquiries. Where\'s Mafia 4? Can Sony make a portable PS4 on the cheap? Could mandatory demos increase game sales? Do Shrek and Han Solo have the same stylist? Turns out, it\'s more complicated than you think. (Not really.)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Today\'s episode was already shaping up to be a sizable one. After all, there\'s THQ Nordic-related news galore to get through, not to mention the conspicuous exit of two prolific producers from BioWare, new NPD sales data, and much more to discuss. But then a meteor struck: Insomniac Games has been purchased by Sony, the first acquisition PlayStation\'s first party has made in more than eight years! This news comes unexpectedly, but also represents a seemingly necessary move, particularly in light of Microsoft\'s recent splashes in the exclusive studio space. So let\'s chat about the biggest news in the PlayStation universe in quite some time, and then wrap things up with delightful listener questions on topics like retro game collecting, couch co-op, loading up on sales, and generation-defining experiences.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | While they share some commonalities, Microsoft and Sony are chasing next-gen victory in fundamentally different ways. Sony\'s doubling-down on everything that made it a resounding winner this go-around -- including a full embrace of its proprietary ecosystem -- while Microsoft seems more eager to lower barriers and spread the love. In a recent interview, the head of Xbox\'s first party studios candidly admitted that Microsoft sees some of its games migrating to other consoles. Such an admission draws a line in the sand and makes a bet on reach as next-gen\'s most valuable currency. So let\'s talk about it. Plus: Quantic Dream jumps head-first into independent waters, Death Stranding\'s PS4 exclusivity causes confusion anew, another game gets whisked away by the digital storefront grim reaper, and Shenmue III and Destroy All Humans Remake up the ante on collector editions. Inquiries from the audience round things out this week, as always. Thanks to you, we chat about our expectations for Remedy\'s Control, Infamous and Infamous 2\'s conspicuous absence from PS4, the persistent high cost of Vita memory cards, and much more. Like Microsoft and Sony of the future, let\'s be friends and have fun together (or die trying).\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | The popular gaming convention PAX West chose to host the first-ever live show in Sacred Symbols\' history. We were excited, and so were many of you. Oh, but wait, never mind! Weeks after confirming our panel, the powers-that-be at PAX uninvited us from the show without explanation and with no recourse for fans. It\'s completely unacceptable, and we dedicate the beginning portion of our show to what went down. And yeah, fine, things happened in the video game world that had nothing to do with this, too. PS4 passed a staggering sales milestone, August\'s free PlayStation Plus games are a step in the right direction, Borderlands 3 is just about ready for primetime, and GameStop inches one step closer to death. Listener inquiries round out our show as always, touching on topics like Ninja\'s lucrative jump to Mixer, the future of game-sharing, the limits of retro appreciation, and the erosion of the console generation. And, of course, there are topics aplenty unmentioned in this meager write-up. So come aboard, friends. We still love you, even if PAX doesn\'t.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Sony-owned Media Molecule is hiring for a most unusual task: The studio is seeking small dev teams to create experiences inside the Early Access version of its PS4 exclusive Dreams. And they\'re willing to pay. The question, of course, is what that says about the state of Sony\'s absurdly long-in-development sandbox, and if we\'re now officially entering Insane Territory. Is there something here we simply cannot see? We discuss. Plus: PS4\'s next firmware update is officially in beta, Dying Light 2 is crossing generations, Remedy\'s Control has gone gold, and Ready at Dawn\'s recent office move suggests some interesting behind-the-scenes happenings. And yes... yes! Of course we let you, the listener, in on the action, with inquiries about the popularity of Mario Maker 2 (and how Sony can replicate its success), Tokyo RPG Factory\'s quiet existence, the possible physical size of the PlayStation 5, and the likelihood of Red Dead Redemption 2 single player DLC.

Not everyone has a pond edge to deal with, but many of us have a spot that stays wet after a rainfall, or just never seems to properly drain. This can mean instant death for many plants that prefer well-drained soils, but not for these perennials and trees that soak up that moisture with gusto. Steve even discusses a plant that most think of as a full-sun plant that prefers well-drained soil but turns out, it thrives in wetter areas. Not everyone has a soggy spot, but almost everyone has a downspout—and now you’ll know the perfect plant to put under it! \xa0 Expert testimony: Kelly Norris\xa0 director of horticulture and education at the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden in Iowa. | The temperatures have started to drop here in New England, so we thought it was the perfect time to highlight some of our favorite fall plants. These are options that you may not be familiar with, or perhaps cultivars of common plants that are new and exciting (and way better than the straight species). For instance, you may like toad lilies—but what if you could get one with shocking yellow foliage? In some cases, we even call attention to a plant that is known has a spring stunner, but puts on an equally impressive show in fall. With plants like these in the mix, there’s no reason for your garden to ever wind down in October. \xa0 Expert testimony: Andy Pulte is a faculty member in the Plant Sciences department at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. | When we sat down to plan out this episode Steve asked, “So what kind of wildlife are we talking about here?” Good question. As it turned out we decided to focus mainly on plants that attract a plethora of birds to your landscape. So rest assured—this isn’t a podcast about how to get more deer and voles to show up.\xa0 We’ll briefly touch on some general principles for attracting feathered friends before launching into descriptions of specific plants that are loved by birds of all sorts.\xa0 Holly Scoggins then shares a hilarious story in expert testimony about her battle (and eventual peace) with birds in her blueberry farm in Virginia. Listen now to be educated—but mostly amused!\xa0 Expert testimony: Holly Scoggins is an associate professor of horticulture at Virginia Tech University. \xa0 | There isn’t much a great ground cover can’t do. It can crowd out weeds, stop erosion, fill in the gaps between larger perennials, and even soften the edges of walls and curbs. However, not all ground covers are created equal. The best ones require little care, look great in multiple seasons, and mass out quickly. Steve and Danielle discuss some of their favorite candidates for this laundry list of objectives in this LAAP episode. Their recommendations include perennials and shrubs that fit the bill. Horticulturist Joann Vieira weighs in with several ground cover options that she has used in the past at botanic gardens and private gardens alike. This episode starts off with Danielle *finally* gifting Steve with a few plants that he’s been wanting for years. Listen now to find out which ones. \xa0 Expert testimony: Joann Vieira, is the director of horticulture for the Trustees of Reservations in Massachusetts.\xa0 \xa0 | For any bonafide plant nerd, visiting Plant Delights Nursery in Raleigh, North Carolina is a bucket list trip. Home to countless unheard of genera and cultivars of common plants that you’d be hard pressed to find anywhere else on the planet, this place is, in a word, unbelievable. So, of course Steve and Danielle had to take the show on the road and record a live episode on the grounds of Plant Delights (and while wandering around their display beds which form Juniper Level Botanic Garden). The duo found a plethora of amazing plants to talk about, and even had owner Tony Avent weigh-in on their personal shopping choices from the greenhouses. In this episode you’re guaranteed to hear about some plants that you never knew you wanted, much less even knew existed. | In a perfect world, every plant we purchase would be well-behaved, pest-free, and a show-stopper 12 months a year. This is not a perfect world.\xa0 Despite our best intentions, sometimes we buy or inherit plants that are mistakes…big mistakes (we’re talking to you miscanthus). In this cathartic episode, Steve and Danielle lament and vent about all the plants that brought them nothing but headaches. Some may look pretty, but aren’t worth the troubles they bring with them. All we can say after listening is, “You’ve been warned.” \xa0 Expert testimony: Jeff Epping, director of horticulture at the Olbrich Botanical Garden in Madison, Wisconsin. | Steve, Danielle, and special guest assistant editor Carol Collins, sit down to discuss plants that really got them fired up from the recent FG Plant Sale. Some are little-known cultivars, some are brand new varieties. There were several interesting shade plants that captured the attention of the podcast hosts including one with such cool texture, it made Danielle squeal.\xa0 Some options were so unique, none of the staff had ever heard of them, let alone seen them in person.\xa0 Find out what plants were worth the FG staff spending an entire paycheck on in this new episode. | Steve and Danielle, as you know, love a trip to the nursery and in this episode we find the dynamic duo at Shakespeare’s Garden in Brookfield, Connecticut. Their mission was to find an array of annuals to fill their various pots and create incredible combinations. They found unusual options for shade including a fuchsia grown for its brilliant foliage—not flowers—and show-stopping selections for sun, too. Spoiler alert: Danielle actually admitted that certain varieties of coleus aren’t that bad after all. Taped on location at a bustling garden center in late spring, this episode is sure to inspire you to get creative this season with your annual purchases.\xa0 \xa0 Expert testimony:\xa0 Jason Reeves, curator of UT Gardens in Jackson, Tennessee .\xa0 | Ahhh, the lovely peony:\xa0 In late spring there truly is no more beautiful flower. They are all stunning, but in this episode we highlight the extraordinary cultivars that make us swoon. From the most fragrant to the largest blossom, our list of must-have peonies is wide ranging. We also highlight a few lesser-known species such as the fernleaf peony and the woodland peony that thrives in full to partial shade.\xa0 We’re happy to give a concise primer on the differences between herbaceous, tree, intersectional, and Itoh peonies, too. Join us for the most gorgeous episode of the year! Expert testimony: Kathleen Gagan, owner of Peony's Envy in Bernardsville, New Jersey. \xa0 | The soundtrack of this episode might have been the classic Queen song, We are the Champions. Not because of its triumphant refrain, but because of the lyric acknowledging all the mistakes made in life. When it comes to their gardens, Steve and Danielle have definitely made mistakes—some bigger than others—yet all lessons that they’ve had to learn the hard way. In a departure from the normal plant heavy content of LAAP, this funny episode has the hosts recounting several blunders they’ve made in their gardens in the hopes of saving listeners some grief of their own. In expert testimony, we’ve got the brilliant horticulture professor Holly Scoggins recounting why perhaps a water garden isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

Happy Flying, Justin "The thoughts and views expressed by Korry Franke on this podcast are his alone, completely independent of any United Airlines affiliation. United Airlines has not contributed or endorsed the content in any way.”\xa0 in 2013, Korry Franke became the youngest captain then flying for United Airlines. Now, the pilot, author, and speaker merges his years of airline leadership experience with the creativity he\'s honed as an accomplished jazz pianist, the discipline he\'s developed as a two-time marathoner, and the real-world business acumen he\'s gained as a Penn State University MBA graduate to lead people and organizations on life-changing journeys toward success and fulfillment. When Korry isn\'t flying or focusing on inspiring others to embrace their own captain\'s mindset, he\'s usually hiking with his wife, reading books to his young daughter, or volunteering with charities such as United We Care, where he serves on the employee relief fund\'s Board of Directors.

She became involved in the reclamation of strip-mine land and mountain tops in part through the establishment of honey bee hives across those lands. \xa0She was appointed State Apriarist in 2014. \xa0She hasn\'t slowed down yet. Tammy joins Jeff and Kim on this show to talk about her background and her latest book, "Flower Power: Establishing Pollinator Habitat" published by one of the episodes sponsors, Wicwas Press.

Spencer Downey and Jason Lucas sit down to talk with our Patrons about what\'s on their minds for the September Patron Q&A!  Episode #350: September Patron Q&A! is ready for Download!  Do we think they are going to cut BFA short? How do we get interviews at BlizzCon and can we choose who we are going to interview? What do we think about guilds being opened up to Cross-Realm, also what do you think about raids being opened up sooner? Since I assume we\'re either going to get WC3 or at least get a date at BlizzCon what is some advice for someone (me!) that never played it before? I main a healer (currently resto shaman) but I’m deciding what to play next expansion. My guild often has tank troubles so what I would like to do is play a class where I can Main Heal and OS tank, I\'m currently thinking of pally but what are your guys\' suggestions for classes that can do this and why? Buddy of mine and myself were arguing why blizzard released classic. My buddy thinks blizzard released classic to revive wow and basically keep it afloat in the event blizzard comes out with another failing expansion (in his opinion) he thinks they will also probably need to re-release a few fan favorite expansions to keep players coming back and subbing to and playing the game. I think he\'s totally wrong, i think they released it for the sole purpose that the community asked long enough and blizzard simply delivered. In my opinion, with or without classic people will sub and play the game if they want to, regardless if there is an earlier expansion like classic that they can also play if they get bored of WoW now. I am curious on your thoughts about that, and also curious a little bit of what you think blizzard will do in regards to rereleasing older expansions or patches and how do you think they\'ll approach that convo if and when more people start asking. (Obviously years later but just an idea) I recently started a new account on a different region and I have noticed what a new player of the game actually needs to get through with their character to get going in the expansion. Stuff that a experienced players just take for granted today can probably cause headaches for a new player to the game. The need to get to friendly of each faction while leveling to get world quests unlocked isn’t communicated before you even start leveling. So if you have not quested in all zones you need to do questing even after reaching max level to unlock wqs. An experienced player knows that flying is a thing but it isn’t really communicated anywhere in game for new players. The difficulty to handle outdoor content with absolutely no gear is a daunting experience. Benthic is a thing but to even survive the outdoor content in Nazjatar to get the pearls is really hard to do with level up gear. What would you guys think blizzard should do in the future to make the experience more accessible for new players. Do we really need to have to go to 3rd party sites to figure out how the game works? Would you rather: New classes OR new class specs? ie; there are "rumors/spoilers" about a new tinker class, but perhaps additional specializations for a few classes. like a RDPS DK, A Warlock Tank spec, or even a rogue healer). I Don\'t think it would be ideal to add a new spec to every class, but the ideology behind theory crafting it can be fun. Spencer it is kind of hard for you to answer this as you play a druid who can do it all as a druid so Jason, if you could have one new specialization for your 15 year main, what would that be like?  \xa0 Have you heard about our Patreon?

Spencer Downey and Jason Lucas sit down to talk with our Patrons about what\'s on their minds for the August Patron Q&A!   Episode #345: August Patron Q&A! is ready for Download!  You both mention you have partners so how do you get away with putting in the hours on Warcraft? Sometimes I get a gentle nudge that I’ve been playing too much after an hour or two. Now that we\'ve been in classic a weekish what\'s your prediction for it going forward? Still think it will stutter after a month or two? Also do you think that getting rid of lfg/lfr would create a more social environment in the retail game? If the classic experience doesn\'t turn out to be as great as many hope for, will possibly retail suffer as well? Considering all the players that was playing retail waiting for classic if they are disappointed or was mainly nostalgic... what if they then bail for other mmos like ffivx rather than return to retail. Possibility? If so, Blizzard hopefully considered this. Might that result in more frequent content patches than we\'ve experienced so far in bfa? What if any head canon do you have for your characters and is their anything about them that you try to always keep consistent through the years? What was the first thing you discovered when playing classic back in the day that just made your jaw drop and you couldn\'t believe how awesome wow was? What\'s your favorite dungeon and zone from classic? I am a female and all the characters I create are female.\xa0 I raid with a group and it seems like all the other females I play with have female characters. Now I am sure there is a psychological reason but I have noticed that all the males seem to create female characters? Being male yourselves, how do you explain this?

Today, I’m gonna tell you the mistakes you’re making with your farm logo design and what you really should be doing, instead. | What can you do if you have a business but you’re not a natural entrepreneur? In this farm podcast, I’m gonna show you how to stop working ON your business rather than being a slave to it so you can avoid burnout and realize your entrepreneurial dreams. And I've got a special, awesome download to help you do just that. | One of the challenges I hear most often expressed from small farmers (really any small business, actually), is how difficult it is to create an email list of potential customers. In this episode, we'll discuss three keys to putting your list-building efforts on autopilot so you can grow your email list. | Is branding important for your farm business?  Let’s start with what I mean by the word “brand” because it’s a word that we hear often, but we may not understand the meaning.\xa0 I mean, what does the word “brand” mean anyway? | So what’s the secret to marketing farm and local food products? Today, I’ll tell you, and set you on a solid foundation for marketing your farm and/or food products. Because, if we produce great food and farm products and there’s no one to buy it, what’s the point? | We all know that\xa0sustainably produced food is more expensive than supermarket food, so how do we explain that when challenged?This week I want to discuss a challenge that many small farmers face.\xa0\xa0It’s one that they seem to all dread and it puts them on the defensive.It’s the whole issue of defending why their products cost so much.\xa0Or, at least seems to cost so much.Now, this is a real issue for many of us, so it’s not one we should run from.\xa0We need to be prepared to face this head on, and the better you get at this, the more it will become a non-issue.Why is that?Because, as your skill improves at conveying value, that skill will permeate all aspects of your marketing.Your blog posts, your social media updates, what you say on your website and in your email marketing.You’ll become proficient at conveying value and focusing on benefits, rather than being defensive.Before we dive in, I want you to understand something.The Dollar Store shopper isn’t your farm's customer. Or at least not for most of you. You’re not running blue light specials.I want you to understand that price objection is a good sign because it’s usually a buying signal. The prospective customer wants to buy but needs to rationalize this objection.And it’s your job to help them do just that.And in this episode, I\xa0explain how to do that.  Validate with empathy.  Normalize the objection.  Paint a farm picture.  Sell value.  So here’s how it works with my director’s commentary, so to speak:The customer says, why is the chicken so expensive?“You’re right. If you’re comparing the price of our chicken to a chicken in a supermarket it seems ours costs more.” (I validated with empathy. But notice I used the word “seems.” It seems ours costs more. That’s to implant a subliminal message that perhaps the cost isn’t more. Now I want to normalize the objection, so I continue.)“And you know, I had two customers on a recent farm tour who were concerned about the price at first, just as you are now.” (now to paint a farm picture)So I walked them to the brood house and let them see the baby chicks. While we were there, they watched me fill their feeders, by hand, and check their water.We then walked out to the pasture and saw the chickens scratching for bugs in their chicken tractors. I explained how my wife and I built those tractors ourselves, and showed how we pulled them forward every day. I let one of the customers try and pull the tractor forward but she wasn’t quite ready for the workout.But it gave her a real sense of two things.The physical effort we put into raising these birds by hand, and the utter enjoyment these birds feel by soaking up sun, scratching earth and chasing insects. (this is me painting a vivid picture. Now I need to sell value).Like you, I couldn’t understand why good food cost more when I first started out. But it all makes sense for me now.\xa0 I mean, a handcrafted knife is more valued and more costly to produce than a mass-produced one, right? Therefore, it costs more. Likewise, our chickens are hand fed, hand watered and hand processed on farm by our family. It’s a handcrafted, ethical product from start to finish. So of course it costs more than a supermarket chicken, but it’s not remotely the same product.\xa0 And I strongly feel that a chicken deserves a chance to be a chicken.Don’t you?And this is where you stay silent.Which, let’s face it…can be really hard.But do it. Stay silent and let the customer respond when you say, “don’t you?”So, here’s the whole conversation again, without any commentary on my part.The customer says, why is the chicken so expensive?“You’re right. If you’re comparing the price of our chicken to a chicken in a supermarket it seems ours cost more.”“And you know, I had two customers on a recent farm tour who were concerned about the price at first, just as you are now.” So I walked them to the brood house and let them see the baby chicks. | An email list is your most important communication asset, and email marketing is a great way to sell your farm products. But how do you build a list in the first place?  In this episode I\xa0walk you through the four not-so-simple steps of email list building for your farm business. | Small businesses routinely fail in every industry segment, but what \xa0 causes small farms to fail? In this episode I\xa0share 7 reasons why small farms fail, so you learn what not to do so that your farm thrives.  I'll walk you through seven reasons why small farms fail. | The phrase hobby farm is cute and all, but what’s the difference between a hobby farm and a farming business? In this episode, I’m going to tell you why you might have a farm hobby that costs you money rather than a thriving farm business that earns you money. | Want to know How to Start a Farm Business?

To begin Daniel, Adam and Terrence chat about hockey and Mattress Mack. We are then joined by Veronica 2.0 aka @Angry_Polak on twitter. She is a poker player and a former commentator on the “Stones Live” poker stream. She came out publicly with concerns that there was some foul play going on in the game, and one guy was winning every night. The story has just snowballed since that day and you’ll have to tune in to get the whole scoop! We also briefly discuss the sale of Stars Group and Pokerstars to the owners of FanDuel. It’s been a busy week!\xa0Leave us a voicemail for a future show at\xa01.775.434.2932 Link To Veronica's Video Of Stones Layout | This Week on DAT Poker Pod:\xa0Daniel, Adam and Terrence begin talking about hockey pools and author Al Alvarez passing away. Al wrote one of the greatest poker books of all time, “The Biggest Game In Town” in 1983 and the guys all share their thoughts on the book. Ronnie Bardah made his appearance on Survivor this week too, and *Spoiler* it was a brief appearance, the gang watched the episode and review his approach. Phil Hellmuth also ate an incredibly spicy chip and hilarity ensued.\xa0 \xa0 In The News: The Rio Las Vegas has been sold and it may effect the WSOP going forwards, Pokerstars and GG Poker set records in their tournament series while PartyPoker also ran a series with some overlays, this leads to a discussion with Daniel who shares some insider information on the handling of the Supernova Elite scandal at Stars, and how their business is doing lately. We also have some tweets on deck, Daniel shares some old school stories about Andy Beal, Doyle Brunson and Chip Reese. Make sure you stick around for probably the greatest Voicemail yet!\xa0 | This Week on DAT Poker Pod:\xa0Daniel, Adam and Terrence begin talking about\xa0Ronnie Bardah appearing on the next instalment of Survivor, and a potential new segment for the show. Cary Katz wins the Super High Roller Bowl in London with his conservative style of play, Dan “Jungleman” Cates and Ilya Trincher have put in a legal objection to the Borgata withholding Phil Ivey’s $125k from the WSOP. Other news topics include the end of the PCA, and the VeGreasetians $150k “Total Prize Pool” tournament, charging 100% rake after the prize limit is reached!

The polls kept on coming from Dnegs since our last show, plus some menu pricing debates. In the news the guys talk about the Borgata filing a lawsuit to garnish Phil Ivey’s WSOP winnings from the $50k Players Championship, the precedent it sets and what Ivey’s future could hold. The other interesting story is Pokerstars limiting the amount of tables a player can multi table at 4. We have some tweets and more mailbag to get to as well. Topics include what hollywood directors the DAT cast would be, would Daniel fight another poker player and keeping poker strategies from your friends! Leave us a voicemail at\xa01.775.434.2932 | We empty out the mailbag on this week’s episode. First off, the guys talk about Daniel’s twitter poll where people choose the better poker commentator.

The guys talk about the final table and the chop heads up, as well as other news surrounding the events. 7th place finisher in the WSOP Main Event Nick Marchington made news this week when his former backers sued him for supposedly unpaid winnings.

Check out his first three articles on 2-7 no-limit lowball, triple draw, and stud eight-or-better on CardPlayer.com.Highlights from this interview include growing up happily indoors, why his grandmother takes credit for his poker career, being unqualified for McDonald\'s, a highschool tournament series, going broke and getting a job, grinding his way back, some realism from his grandfather, a sad and lonely dinner break, winning a marathon heads-up battle for a WSOP bracelet, all of the painful close calls since, a bad beat against George Danzer and Justin Bonomo, the politics of a 12-game mix, being a jack of all trades and master of none, playing with Doyle, being a dad in poker, a 24-hour session, a $5,000 prop bet, a secret need to sing, and the future of driving ranges. | Ali Nejad is one of poker\'s most experienced television personalities, having lent his talents to productions such as the NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship, The Poker Parlor, The Ultimate Poker Challenge, The Pro-Am Equalizer, and Poker After Dark. He has also done commentary for a majority of the major poker tours, including the World Poker Tour, European Poker Tour, World Series of Poker, and most recently, the Triton Millions.The 41-year-old has also done his fair share of work outside of poker, having worked on Road Trip and UNite for ESPN, and The Daily Share for CNN. While attending UC Berkeley, he was tapped to host Total Request Live on MTV before tragedy changed the course of his career. Before stepping in front of poker cameras, the San Francisco native worked as a prop and dealer in local cardrooms, eventually working his way up the cash game ranks. These days you can find Nejad on PokerGo, including coverage of the upcoming British Poker Open and Super High Roller Bowl in London.Highlights from this interview include being confused for the pantyhose rapist, confidence vs. arrogance, landing a TV gig in high school, First Cut, consuming condiment cocktails at Cal, entering the teepee kingdom, getting hired to host TRL on MTV, and why Carson Daly took the job instead, dealing with tragedy, self-destructive escapism into the poker world, befriending Prahlad Friedman and Erick Lindgren, propping his way up to the high-stakes games, a lifeline from SuChin Pak, playing soccer in a literal dump in Guatemala, a game of backgammon with the Ice Princess, a chance meeting with Mori Eskandani on the PartyPoker Million Cruise, subbing in for Daniel Negreanu, NY to Bristol and back, landing a dream gig with ESPN, an infamous call for Justin Bonomo, a death match with Maria Ho, playing football with Kevin Durant, why Don Cheadle gets great service, a crooked 11-handed poker game, a low-limit $800-$1,600 game at Bellagio with Joanna Krupa, and the perspective of a 59-cent taco. | Joao Vieira is only 29 years old and missed the entirety of the poker boom, but that hasn\'t stopped him from climbing to the top of Portugal\'s all-time money list both live and online. The Madeira-native is one of the top five online tournament winners ever, with more than $13 million in cashes. He also has $3.4 million in live tournament earnings, and most recently won his first career World Series of Poker bracelet, pocketing $758,000 in the $5,000 six-max no-limit hold\'em event.But poker is only the second "sport" that Vieira has gone pro in. The Winamax Team Pro spent much of his teens and early twenties playing professional basketball in Portugal, and as a junior, he competed on the national team and even had two 50-point games before he got burned out and transitioned to poker.Highlights from this interview include being bad at days off, growing up on an island, an early knack for basketball, turning pro at age 15, playing like he was 7 feet tall, Iverson vs. Stockton, being a late starter online, how an injury led to better poker, going from $10 to $300 sit-n-go\'s in a month, developing habits, being top five all-time on the online money list, a goal to crush the super high rollers, using a live read to earn a WSOP bracelet, a nice swap with Super Dario, keeping kids alive at summer camp, living in his headphones, and what Europe thinks of American fast food. | Jackie Glazier grew up playing cards with her grandparents, but didn\'t find poker until well after fellow Australian Joe Hachem had won the World Series of Poker main event. The Melbourne-native grew up with a passion for sports and earned her degree in education, but ultimately felt lost as to what she wanted to do for a career. While searching for the answer, she stumbled on poker, and found herself grinding small-stakes at the casino. One good month turned into three good months, and she decided to give poker a shot.The decision paid off quickly, with Glazier finishing second in the opening event of the Melbourne Championship Series in 2012, before winning the main event. She took her newfound bankroll and confidence to Las Vegas, where she finished runner up in a $3,000 no-limit hold\'em event for $458,996. The next year, she was the last woman standing in the main event, cashing for $229,281 in 31st place. Glazier earned her WSOP bracelet in the WSOP Europe ladies event. Last year, she competed on Australian Survivor, spending a month in Fiji for the televised reality game show.Highlights from this interview include flashing her accent to attract American men, not using her degree, crashing the guy\'s poker game, being on the good side of variance early on, learning the ropes with Joe Hachem, a mandatory win in Melbourne, refusing a big chop, crying for three days over a half-million dollar score, being the last woman standing in the WSOP main event, learning to practice gratitude, binking her first ladies event, where she keeps her bracelet, the online poker situation in Australia, playing poker on the London Eye, being married to a golf whisperer, calling the snake catcher, competing on Survivor in Fiji, pretending to be a Rubix cube expert, folding kings preflop and being right, a nice swap with Heidi May, cleaning the sausage roll vats, and the joy of driving in silence. | Steffen Sontheimer recorded his first cash in the summer of 2015, and it wasn\'t until a year later that he started competing regularly in the high roller events. But despite his limited time on the felt, the 28-year-old already has more than $13.5 million in live tournament earnings, which is currently good enough for no. 44 on the all-time money list, and no. 6 in Germany.Sontheimer\'s run really started in 2017 when Fedor Holz went on Twitter on told that world that \'Go0se\' was about to start crushing. Holz\'s prediction came true, and Sontheimer began making regular final table appearances. In September, he made four final tables and won two events at the Poker Masters to earn the purple jacket as overall champion. He also final tabled the six-figure buy-in High Roller For One Drop at the WSOP Europe. He finished the year with $6.8 million in cashes, 16 final tables, three titles, and a ninth-place finish in the Player of the Year race. Just last November, he won the $250,000 buy-in super high roller at the Caribbean Poker Party for $3.685 million.Highlights from this interview include growing up in the Black Forest, treating poker like a video game, making friends the Fedor Holz way, learning how to beat "the people," the spots where live tells actually matter, the Foxen stare, feeling relieved rather than happy after a big win, a buddy calls his shot, the sun run at the Poker Masters, where he keeps his Purple Jacket, getting a shout out from Daniel Negreanu, a $2 million summer downswing, never meeting your backers, the ties between staking and bitcoin, how winner\'s photos reveal who has the action, why the Germans are slightly overrated, cheering on the new WSOP champ, the integrity of the high roller community, betting against Jason Mercier during the wrong summer, a kindergarden connection, getting rid of baseball "matches," and winning a $400k pot on the last hand of the night. | Scott Blumstein had a magical run through the 2017 World Series of Poker main event, topping a field of 7,221 to earn his first gold bracelet and the $8.15 million first-place prize. The win, however, came just a year after the Morristown, New Jersey native considered quitting the game entirely. While the 2016 WSOP main event was playing out in Las Vegas, Blumstein was back home in New Jersey, considering his options. After a conversation with his dad, he ultimately decided to give it one last shot at the Borgata Summer Poker Open. Blumstein won the opening event for just shy of $200,000, and that score kept him in the game. By the time the next summer rolled around, Blumstein was ready for the $10,000 main event. After building up his stack during the bubble, Blumstein rode his chip lead to the final table, which included players such as Ben Lamb, Jack Sinclair, Bryan Piccioli, Antoine Saout, Benjamin Pollak, and the headline-grabbing Englishman John Hesp. Now 27, and two years removed from his life-changing win, Blumstein remains relatively active in the poker world, and has lent his support to various charity causes and events.Highlights from this interview include the quality over quantity strategy, being better in pass protection, TurningStone Casino: an 18-year-old\'s Disneyland, accounting regret, the New Jersey cheat code, getting knocked out by Darvin Moon, why the story gets good at Borgata, a tough conversation with dad, learning the lesson of taxes, finding a backer, streaming on Twitch to 18 people, punishing the money bubble, hiring a mental coach, turning down a world-class player for final table help, helpful tips from Ryan Riess, having the freedom to not know what he wants to do, not relying on poker for happiness, lessons from an actuary, a scandal at Dick\'s Sporting Goods, the sharp side of Utah St., a love for rotisserie chicken, and a message from Mac Miller. | Adam Friedman got his start in poker with a deep run in the 2005 World Series of Poker main event. Just 23 at the time, he has since put together a remarkably consistent career playing both cash games and tournaments. In 2006, he won the Midwest Regional Poker Championships main event. Incredibly, after skipping the tournament in 2007, he won the very same event again in both 2008 and 2009. This would not be the last time that Friedman was able to successfully defend a tournament title. The Gahanna, Ohio native scored his first WSOP bracelet back in 2012, topping a tough final table in the $5,000 stud eight-or-better event that included the likes of Todd Brunson, John Monnette, Bryn Kenney, and Phil Ivey. In 2013, he won the HPT main event in Indiana, and in 2014, he final tabled the L.A. Poker Classic. In 2018, he won his second career bracelet, earning $293,275 in the $10,000 dealer\'s choice event. Amazingly, he returned to Las Vegas this summer and won the very same event again, this time banking a $312,417 payday. In total, the 37-year-old mixed-games specialist has $2.9 million in career live tournament earnings. Highlights from this interview include summer series accommodations, becoming a Hoosier, sleeping through the final four, a love for sports but not sports betting, being too emotional at the table, demanding the safe at the Tropicana, the 2005 WSOP main event, why his dad took away $100k, Ohio living, making sure he booked a win at Commerce, a slow peel vs. Phil Hellmuth, a compliment from Doyle Brunson, the emotional turmoil of downswings, taking ego out of the game, why you need a plan for your money, betting on The Voice with Gavin Smith, back-to-back bracelets, drowning his sorrows in room service, and why we\'re drawing dead on another 1,000 years. | Darren Elias is just 32 years old, but he\'s already established himself as the end boss of the World Poker Tour. The New Jersey resident not only holds the tour record with four titles, but he\'s also the tour leader in cashes with 35, and final tables with 13. His first WPT title came at the 2014 Borgata Poker Open, where he won $843k. His second title came immediately after that at the WPT Carribbean stop. Elias\' third win came in Canada at the 2017 Fallsview Poker Classic, and his latest victory was at Aria in the 2018 Bobby Baldwin Classic.This year, Elias has already won a $25,000 high roller at the Gardens Poker Championship, and he nearly won his fifth WPT title, the LA Poker Classic, ultimately falling just short in third place for just under half a million dollars. In total, Elias has cashed for more than $7.1 million dollars during his live career, along with another $4 million won online.Highlights from this interview include off days in Vegas, living all over with a football coach dad, a love for watersports, winning big in college, the dorm room fan club, the growing pains of live poker, unintentional intimidation, the one time he lost his cool at the table, $200-$400 2-7 games with Billy Baxter, running at expectation, his attitude towards the high rollers, being the top-ranked dad, revisiting a decade-old blog post, a healthy fear of mediocrity, using his internal solver, a scary situation at home, bluffing in six-figure pots, Nick Petrangelo\'s beer tips, online poker on the highway, the only other job he\'s ever had, a whiskey shot prop bet, big picture science, and the grinding ability of David Peters. | Jennifer Tilly is an Academy Award-nominated actress who has starred in films such as Bullets Over Broadway, Bound, Liar Liar, Monsters Inc., St. Ralph, The Fabulous Baker Boys, and the Chucky series. But she also happens to be an avid poker player, and a World Series of Poker bracelet winner. Tilly, who is in a relationship with poker pro Phil Laak, won the ladies event at the 2005 WSOP, picking up the title and the $158,625 first-place prize. She also has a win a the 2010 Bellagio Cup, taking down a $5,000 no-limit hold\'em event for $124,455. Poker fans will recognize Tilly from her many appearances on shows such as the Celebrity Poker Showdown, Poker Royale, Poker Night In America, The National Heads Up Poker Championship, The Poker Superstars Invitational, High Stakes Poker, and Poker After Dark.Highlights from this interview include the brilliant mumblings of Norm MacDonald, what Wikipedia got wrong, Lou Diamond Phillip\'s Monday night poker game, intruding on guy\'s night, playing the teamsters for their per diem, Tilly chili, trying to friend zone Phil Laak, bad driving on a bad first date, Joan Allen\'s bedroom hair, taking $20k to a $1-$2 home game with Ben Affleck, getting \'passed a check,\' being a D-JEN, virtual bracelets and real bracelets, her father\'s hidden poker life, seeing ghosts, using her voice to get rid of telemarketers, comedy math with Dave Foley, winning a $260k home game pot, passing on a piece of Antonio, the poker problems with Molly\'s Game, James Bond\'s terrible betting style, and a joke from Charles Durning.', 'chan_desc': 'Card Player, The Poker Authority, is an industry-leading publication and web portal specializing in poker media, strategy and tournament coverage. \n\nPoker Stories is a long-form audio series that features casual interviews with some of the game’s best players and personalities.

Each collection has come together after months of planning, designing, and knitting. Every time we get a new sample in the office or do a new call for submissions, we get excited about all the possibilities!  To celebrate our new Gansey collection: Form and Function, Stacey and Hannah sit down together in the studio to really dig in to these new patterns and share the details that make each one unique. We've never done a Gansey focused collection and share some of the challenges and considerations that went in to the selection process.

The trees have started to leaf out, the daffodils have bloomed their little hearts out and my knitting queue has taken a turn toward lightweight cotton garments and cheerful spring colors.  My favorite spring landmark is EARTH DAY! Every year we take a moment to celebrate the eco section of our offerings. Alexis and I sit down to chat about our Oekitex and GOT certified yarns. These Cotton, Wool and Alpaca yarns are held to the highest standards and deserve a special place in our line up and our stashes.  Next, Stacey joins me to share our tips and tricks about caring for your most cherished handmades. Spoiler! We dig into the most loved (and most battered) projects—socks. Enjoy!

Here's a brief recap of what's happened so far: A huge hoard of gold dragon coins was hidden in a vault somewhere in the city and every powerful figure in Waterdeep is trying to get it first.

If Jarlaxle is able to escape Waterdeep with the keys, there is no knowing what he could accomplish with them and the massive amount of gold to which they provide access.To find out more about Podcasts of Waterdeep & the Waterdeep: Dragon Heist adventure book available in game stores now & everywhere September 18, head to dnd.wizards.com/powd. | To learn more about Rise of the Demigods, check out demigodsfall.com | Godsfall is an original fantasy story told through the lens of a Dungeons and Dragons game in an original world of lost magic and dead gods know as Khalgun.The episode was written, produced, and edited by Aram Vartian.

First the gang talks about the games they\'ve been playing, like Outer Wilds and Eliza, before getting into Fire Emblem (29:22) and some productivity tips. Finally, they talk about Saga, Once Upon A Time...

She\'s also playing Madden NFL 20. Meanwhile, Kirk beat Death of the Outsider, started up Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Fire Emblem, and tried Burgle Bros with his tabletop group. We then bring in Kotaku senior reporter Cecilia D\'Anastasio (35:06) for discussion about her article, "For Men Who Hate Talking On The Phone, Games Keep Friendships Alive," and also, the importance of gaming etiquette, especially for competitive games.

Though we explained it in a few places, it cannot hurt to do so once more here.Bonfireside Chat Rekindled is a show that's exclusive to our Patreon campaign (http://patreon.com/duckfeedtv). Main episodes come out every other week, and we will begin doing off-week episodes again shortly. For $5 per month you get a lot in addition to Bonfireside Chat, and we encourage you to check out our network's other offerings.So go become a Patron today to hear us talk about Sekiro, other soulslikes, and other FromSoft games! | Sekiro is different. Sekiro is hard. Sekiro is here! Listen in for our nascent opinions on the game, based on the first few hours.This episode is free and available for everyone, and if you want other episodes of Bonfireside Chat Rekindled, and want to hear the rest of the Sekiro season as it releases, please consider backing us on Patreon. (http://patreon.com/duckfeedtv). | Hello, listeners and patrons alike. We come to you with some exciting news: We are changing the Patreon around! (http://patreon.com/duckfeedtv) It feels like we just did this, but the last major change was back toward the beginning of 2017. We’re trying to constantly observe what’s happening with the network and learn what to do better. That means making changes like this from time to time.We’re also aiming to never shake things up in a way that is too disruptive to you, the listener. We want to give more (or at least focus up and give better). So we put a lot of thought and consideration into making sure these changes either solve problems or help us achieve goals.Here’s the summary of what we’re planning, and you can find the details below. In order to grow the network, give patrons more, and cover rising costs, we plan to:Bring back Bonfireside Chat as a Patreon show.Give Patrons a whole episode of Watch Out for Fireballs!Move from theme months to covering big-name games more frequently.Change WOFF! Listener Response episodes to WOFF! Dispatch, make it more interactive, and have broader topic discussions.Make Adaptation Decay a monthly show.We are getting rid of the content store, and making premium episodes available on Patreon in perpetuity.We are phasing out the promise of physical goods, and sending out an “I’m Sorry!” package to people who never got theirs.In general, we are simplifying the Patreon drastically, while offering more at each tier.So without further preamble, let’s get into more detail.We want to grow.We want to grow in both listenership, patronage, and income. We are proud of the work that we do, and never want to stagnate in any of the aforementioned areas. Growth requires change.We want to give patrons more.The best way to keep listeners and members around is to always try to give more (or give better). This is also the best way to bring new people in. We are grateful to our patrons, past and present, and we want to make sure we’re giving them stuff they want.We want to meet rising costs.There are costs associated with doing this at the professional level. Traveling to live shows is expensive. Hosting, web services, applications, and equipment are expensive. Being self-employed is expensive (both Gary and I do this full time and need to cover things like health insurance). And since we’re covering more new games, we’re spending more on games! This is not a hobby for us, we’re committed to doing this full time as our main means of support, and this means keeping up with costs.People want Bonfireside Chat.And we want to give it to them. We also want to play to our strengths as a network whose bread and butter is games club content. We put Bonfireside Chat to bed when it felt like it was the right thing to do. We stuck with our guns for a long time. But with Sekiro on the horizon, and some damn-fine Soulslikes already here, it feels right to take the show out of cold storage.So we are bringing back Bonfireside Chat as a Patreon show, with a slightly different format. Listen to Bonfireside Chat 2.0 Episode 0 on the feed to learn more. Our first game is the Soulslike shooter Immortal Unchained!We want to value WOFF! appropriately.Watch Out for Fireballs! is the network’s flagship show. It also takes a lot of time to produce. We play through the entire game (whether it’s 1 hour or 100), research the games, write outlines that total in the thousands of words, record for hours, and edit. In looking at how to make this tenable in the long run, we have decided to make one episode of WOFF! per month premium.This does two things: It makes the Patreon more valuable for our members, and it incentivizes more membership.But don’t panic! When an episode goes premium, we will include a good portion of it on the public feed (up through the Generalities). So you still get something each week, it’s just that the play-by-play goes to members.NOTE 1: This won’t go into effect for January. We already announced those games, and we don’t want to revoke access to something anyone was excited for.NOTE 2: We will still have multi-part episodes, but we will never put a whole episode (Part 2, 3, or 4) behind a paywall. Only single episodes will get this treatment.WOFF! Theme Months are going away.This was a very fun idea. But it was also hell to plan for, in addition to other WOFF-based pattern incentives. So we feel like it has run its course. We want to exercise more control over the games we pick for WOFF! so we can pace out the year and cover exciting stuff. Anyone who has paid for a WOFF Theme Month will still get their topics covered, but after that hopper is exhausted the theme months will go away.We want the WOFF! Listener Response episodes to be more interesting.Right now, not a lot of folks listen to the letters episodes on WOFF. Additionally, not a lot of people listen to the behind-the-scenes episodes of DuckTRAX, and we don’t get very many prompts/responses. SO! We’re getting rid of DuckTRAX and changing the listener response episodes to WOFF! Dispatch.So the last episode of WOFF! for each month will contain responses about the games from that month, prompts and questions from the Patrons, and a segment that is a longer-form discussion about a particular topic. These will be fun experiments, and we hope you’re down for them.We want to do more Adaptation DecayAdaptation Decay is our premium show about how video games are adapted into other media, and it’s a fun show to do. Right now we have it on a very strange “8 times a year” rhythm. With DuckTRAX going away, we are taking Adaptation Decay monthly!The content store is complicated, and having content time-gated on Patreon is confusing and dissatisfying.So we’re not going to fuck with that anymore. If you back at $10 per month, you’ll get access to the firehose of content. Every premium WOFF, Bonfireside Chat Exquisite Suffering, Adaptation Decay, DuckTRAX, Try This… and whatever other one-off Duckfeed Presents stuff we make for you. We appreciate people who support us, and we want you to get your money’s worth, both in terms of the backlog and future value.We really biffed the physical goods.Under the old scheme, we offered physical goods packs and a DuckZine. We failed to deliver those, because we overestimated our ability to meet that logistical challenge. So the new scheme has no physical rewards.To say sorry for our past neglect of this promise, we will be sending out one large package to everyone who was qualified for those rewards (you should have already received an email about this). We are sorry that we disappointed you on this front, and there’s really no excuse. We hope the I’m Sorry package helps.We’re honoring our previous commitments.People who paid for theme months will get those theme months covered. If you have a WOFF! game demand or Abject Suffering demand in the hopper, that’s still there.The current Patreon scheme is complicated and we want to simplify it.We have a lot of reward tiers and stretch goals. Some of the reward tiers require backing for several months, which is confusing. In general, we let the Patreon grow tangled and weird, and we want to prune it down so it’s easier for you to pick the right tier.So, we’ve got less of everything, but what remains should be even more valuable. We are reducing the number of new shows on the horizon, because we are already stretched pretty thin. But there’s still stuff to aim for, and we hope this makes the Patreon much more valuable and friendly. | This is it.

The first two chapters deal with pursuing the most direct idea as actively as possible and, conversely, when the logic of that idea doesn’t work and how to fix it. The first essential type of thinking concept stressed is related to urgency, and the second thinking concept emphasized relates to your sense of danger (addressed in the chapters Overpressing, Only One Way to Lose and Unlikely Draws). In Part 2: Positional Concepts, a heavy emphasis is on• understanding piece exchanges (with three separate chapters to increase our positional understanding)• sensing the quality of pieces (with chapters on various weak pieces)• grasping and creating weaknesses• appreciating difficult moves we tend to miss or misevaluate• defensive play concepts like tenacity and the queen’s value and role in defense;• maneuvering in closed positions.With this book, players will learn how to analyze with helpful thinking methods and apply them practically in their games, developing their ability to handle common situations with a clear thought process. | Dr. Kenneth Regan is an International Master, an associate professor of Computer Science at the University of Buffalo, and is one of the world’s foremost experts on using predictive analytics to help detect computer-assisted cheating in chess tournaments.

DetailerInnerCircle.com\xa0- Take your detailing business to new levels. | Hey, what\'s up everyone and welcome to this episode of The Auto Detailing Podcast. This is episode 399 this week\'s episode is brought to you by autofiber.com. You could save 20% on microfiber towels and accessories at autofiber.com, autofiber.ca and autofiber.com.au if you use offer code Jimbo. They also have a towel of the month which is rad and you should definitely join. It\'s like peanuts every month to join and you get a fresh towel to kind of sample to see if you would be interested in buying that one.  Anyway, also brought to you by Housecall Pro. If you go to housecallpro.com/adp for Auto Detailing Podcast, you\'re going to get a free demo to see how this CRM or this customer relationship management software works. It\'s interesting. I\'ve had a few other CRM companies reach out to me lately and kind of show me what they have to offer and it just reassured me how robust and easy to use Housecall Pro is from everything, from letting clients know that you\'re on your way in a simple kind of easy to tap button that connects to your GPS and so it gives an accurate ETA to your client, which is cool, all within the app.  What I really like is I also have it automatically. So there\'s a button in Housecall Pro app that I hit finish when I\'m done with the job and it automatically triggers a series of events that happen. So everything from the customer automatically will get a text thanking them for supporting my small business with a link to leave a review, which is incredible, seven days, and you can kind of preset this however you want. Seven days after the service, they get an email, the client gets an email again thanking them for the service, asking for a review and if there\'s anything that we can help them with. Then I have another sequence about three months out reminding them of another detail, six months out and a year out, all that get triggered automatically. They also get a postcard in the mail thanking them. So a lot of what we talk about in the Detailer Inner Circle is that you never know how or what form of marketing is going to work best for your client. So that\'s why HouseCall Pro makes it super easy. I don\'t have to think about any of this because automatically set up for me and I\'ve set it up to do this on purpose. So again, all you have to do is input your client information, which you should be doing anyway in a centralized place, which is HouseCall Pro and then boom, boom, boom, boom. The job, the history, the customer history, you can set tags, all this crazy stuff. There\'s actually too much information to even talk about in an ad roll. So just go to housecallpro.com/adp. You\'ll get a free demo. You\'re going to get half off your first month if you choose to sign up. So yeah, do that.  Anyway, so we\'re all good. All right now, now that we\'ve got the housekeeping under control. This episode I thought would be really fun and it\'s actually something that I want to start and you probably saw by the title, it\'s detailing horror stories, right? As detailers, we have the kind of fortunate or unfortunate position that we\'re usually a lot of things, more than a detailer. We\'re a psychologist, sometimes a doctor, more times than not a marriage counselor. Sometimes you\'re a handyman, you\'re a plumber, you\'re a painter, you\'re a lot of things and a detailer at the same time, and I think that\'s because we\'re so close to most of our clients, at least this happens to me and I\'ve actually been all those things.  Anyways, so I wanted to create a new segment or a new podcast series of detailing horror stories. So today, it\'s from Joe Conley who\'s been on the show and Joe\'s an awesome guy. But I do want to invite you, if you have a detailing horror story to email it to me, jimbo@autodetailingpodcast.com and in the subject line put detailing horror stories and I will read your detailing horror story on a future podcast just like this one. I think it\'ll be fun. I think it\'ll be really interesting to hear what other people, other detailers go through. I know that there\'s a ton of detail in horror stories out there.  So this episode today is going to be Joe Conley\'s horror story. Again, Joe has been on the podcast at least twice before, maybe three times and so I would definitely encourage you to search his name in Auto Detailing Podcast and find his previous episodes. He\'s a teacher full time, details part time and has had tremendous success with things like Google AdWords and all that kind of things. So I would really suggest you check out his episodes because he\'s a cool guy. He\'s a great guy and has a ton of valuable information. But today\'s detailing horror story is by him and this is his email.  He says, "So I\'m minding my own business detailing a fleet of vehicles at a funeral home that I\'ve worked for before. I knock out a few vehicles in the morning. I take a break for lunch. I come back from lunch and there\'s a big metal box in the corner of the double wide, double deep garage that is humming away. It sounds like an industrial size AC unit, but no, it\'s actually a furnace for cremation. Oh by the way, fun fact. I asked how long it takes to cremate a body and the answer is about four hours. So not only am I detailing for the rest of the day next to a body being burned up, one of the funeral directors then comes out about a half hour later and gets .... A half hour later and lets me know he has to shut the garage door for a bit. He closed it, halfway, opened up the door on the furnace and turned the body over. I didn\'t know you need to turn a body mid cremation, but apparently that\'s a thing."  So Joe says, "I challenge your listeners to send in their weird detailing stories. What is the strangest or grossest thing they found under a seat? How many manual cars did they crash by forgetting to reapply the parking brake after cleaning the brake boot? What\'s the funniest thing that happened to them while detailing?" So thanks Joe for writing in that story. That is very interesting and incredibly uncomfortable. Thanks for that little note at the bottom. I did manage to crash a customer\'s car, not because I cleaned the boot so well, and in fact I didn\'t get to clean the car at all. I was trying to reposition the car and at the time didn\'t know how to drive a manual well enough on a steep hill and crushed it right into the brick in slow motion. So thanks for making me relive that, Joe. I appreciate it.  So yes, I want to encourage you, what are your detailing horror stories or weird stories? Have you ever detailed a car next to a body that\'s being cremated? That\'s one that I\'ve never experienced and never heard before and kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies even thinking about. But anyway, I want to hear your detailing horse stories. Again, email them to me, jimbo@autodetailingpodcast.com and in the subject line write detailing horror stories and your detailing horror story will get a chance on the auto detailing podcast. Now I have a slight suspicion that I\'m going to be overwhelmed by this and that\'s why I\'m having you do it very specifically in the subject line so I can go through it.  So if you do write it in, give me some time with it. But I promise that I will share your story on this podcast. So thanks for listening guys. Don\'t forget to check out HouseCall Pro, autofiber.com. Of course we have the Detailer Inner Circle and all the things. I appreciate you for listening and I will catch you guys on the next episode. I cannot wait to hear about your detailing horror stories.
