In this episode, Eva shares her top 3 secrets on (1) what she in the weeks before the election (likely the most important key to her victory); (2) what she did on the day of the election, including some great tips on what she said during her speech and why that was so effective; and (3) what she has done after the election. \xa0 This is a great episode of any young Big Dreamer who hopes to run for student council one day, and there are important lessons for anyone who is interested in being a leader and gaining the support of your peers. For show notes, please visit DreamBigPodcast.com/158 | Eva typically works super hard to secure guests for the podcast.\xa0 We research guests, film personalized invite videos, diligently follow-up -- but every so often we hit the lottery and the opportunity for Eva to interview an amazing guest falls right in our laps. \xa0 In this case, we received an email introduction from Humble The Poet (guest in Episode 146) connecting us with his friend Neil Parishca. In addition to being Humble’s friend, Neil also happens to be the New York Times bestselling author of five books, including The Book of Awesome and The Happiness Equation, which together have spent over 200 weeks on bestseller lists and have sold over 1,000,000 copies. He hosts the Apple 'Best of 2018' award-winning podcast 3 Books with Neil Pasricha, which features live conversations with guests such as Malcolm Gladwell, Judy Blume, David Sedaris, and Chris Anderson of TED. He gives over fifty speeches a year to audiences such as Royal Families in the Middle East, SXSW, and Shopify. Prior to his current work, Neil completed his MBA from Harvard Business School and spent a decade as Director of Leadership at Walmart.\xa0 For our show notes, visit DreamBigPodcast.com/157 | Last December, we were invited by our dear friends Jackie and Chris to spend the weekend at their cabin in Lake Arrowhead.\xa0 The highlight of the weekend for Eva was riding her own go-kart for the very first time. There is a go-kart track in Lake Arrowhead Village, and Eva had just barely made the height requirement and was permitted to ride on her own. \xa0 We were graciously invited again to join Jackie and Chirs this summer, so right away Eva asked if we could ride go-karts again. When we arrived at the track, the cashier told Eva she could not ride because she was not tall enough. Eva was understandably upset -- given that 8 months ago she had been allowed to ride so she had not even entertained the possibility that this would happen.\xa0 In this episode, Eva shares two very important lessons with our Big Dreamers about how she responded to this “NO” -- and how she ultimately was able to get a “YES” and once again make riding go-karts a highlight of the weekend. This is a powerful episode because Eva could have easily let that “NO” ruin her day, and perhaps the entire weekend. For show notes, please visit DreamBigPodcast.com/156 | This is Alex, Eva’s dad, writing.\xa0 Last month, I took Eva on a daddy-daughter date to Dodger stadium. \xa0 Eva had been asking to go to a Dodgers game for some time now -- and I finally got the tickets and put it on the calendar.\xa0 I turned out to be an incredible evening -- filled with memories that she and I will never forget. I always knew that Eva was a powerful young lady -- so I guess it should not have been a surprise that minutes after telling me it would be amazing to come home with a foul ball -- she indeed had a foul ball in her hands.\xa0 \xa0 I have many friends who have been to hundreds of games and have yet to catch a foul ball, and Eva got one at her very first game! As Eva shares in the episode, the whole day and evening was magical, and Eva shares a powerful lesson that I’m sure both kids and adults could hear about how to make your experiences in life magical -- even when it is not your very 1st Dodger game :) \xa0 Enjoy! | In this week’s episode, Eva shares her feelings about the recent passing of Sean Stephensen.\xa0 This is the first time Eva has ever talked about death on the podcast, and as you know, the podcast is typically upbeat.\xa0 But Sean was a guest on the podcast and someone our whole family considered to be a hero. While those who loved Sean were devastated to learn this tragic news, Eva does have an uplifting message about how Sean’s legacy can and will live on. \xa0 She also shares practical advice on how to deal with the loss of someone you admire. For those of you who are not familiar with Sean Stephensen, he was born with a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta -- causing him to have fragile bones that break very easily.\xa0 By the time Sean was 18 years old, he had suffered more than 200 fractures in all parts of his body. The condition also stunted Sean’s growth, and as an adult Sean stood 3 feet tall and lived his life in a wheelchair. Sean became affectionately known as a 3 foot giant, because despite all the medical challenges he has faced over his life, he made the decision to lead an extraordinary life.\xa0 In the process, he inspired millions worldwide, including Sir Richard Branson, President Clinton, Tony Robbins and the Dalai Lama. He was also a great inspiration to our family. Before the Dream Big Podcast had landed big name guests and racked up millions of downloads, Sean agreed to be Eva’s guest. He was so kind and gracious, and shared a powerful story that forever impacted the way our family looks at challenges (Eva shares that story on this podcast, but we encourage you to listen to the original interview).\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 In the title of this episode, we refer to Sean as a hero. He was not a hero with a cape. Far from it -- he was confined to a wheelchair. But the doctors told Sean’s parents at his birth that he would live 24-48 hours. He lived 40 years. The fact that he defied those odds and lived such an extraordinary life for that long is heroic. And he’s a hero, Eva and our whole family will never forget. All our love to his incredible wife Mindie Kniss -- we are thinking of you and will never forget your amazing husband. | A few weeks ago, we took Eva to her first marketing event, put on by ClickFunnels which is the marketing software we use in our businesses. \xa0 During the event, the CEO of ClickFunnels Russell Brunson shared the power of storytelling. Specifically, Russell explained that emotional stories are the key component to drive people to make buying decisions. \xa0 And of course, stories can be persuasive in non-business contexts as well. Students who learn to tell persuasive stories can influence classmates to move in a certain direction in team projects, and will find it easier to make (and keep) great friends.\xa0 \xa0 In this episode, Eva shares the key takeaway on how to tell powerful stories, and provides an example to illustrate the difference between a boring and engaging story. We also suggest you start practicing the art of storytelling at the dinner table. If you are used to getting the one sentence answer to “How was your day at school today?” -- then encouraging your family to tell engaging stories will liven up the dinner conversation.\xa0 Perhaps you can share some stories from your day at work to participate in the exercise as well. We learned about the skill of storytelling at a marketing conference, so this can be a helpful exercise for the adult Big Dreamers as well :) | This episode is being published around the time that most of our younger Big Dreamers are back to school after summer vacation. \xa0 To start the school year off right, Eva thought it would be fun to do a Back To School challenge. Typically, in the first month of school, students tend to gravitate towards the groups of classmates that they will spend the majority of their time with throughout the school year. \xa0 Eva challenges all of the students listening to choose friends with positive attitudes about school and life in general. She also explains WHY choosing to surround yourself with positive people will have an impact on how you perceive the world, and the scientific evidence to back it up! \xa0 By the same token, she highlights the dangers of surrounding yourself with negative peers. This is such an important lesson to teach our kids at a young age, and a good reminder for the adult Big Dreamers listening as well. | The title of this episode is Luck is for Leprechauns and you are not green. \xa0 It’s a famous quote from one of the most motivational people on the planet - Eric Thomas.\xa0 We can say that with confidence because his Youtube videos gets tens of millions of views -- and they are all about how you can find your purpose and then turn your dreams into reality.\xa0 \xa0 As you can probably tell from the quote -- Eric does not believe that you should wait around and hope your dreams come true. Eric is all about being proactive when it comes to your dreams.\xa0 Eva shares why you need to be prepared to put in hard work to be successful, and provides examples of the legendary work ethic of former guests Kobe Bryant and Ruby Rose Turner. We have always told our Big Dreamers that dreaming alone is not enough - you also need to be willing to work and that’s what this episode is all about! \xa0 Thank you Eric Thomas for this powerful quote, which we know will resonate with our young Big Dreamers. For our show notes, visit DreamBigPodcast.com/151 | Today we welcome Felecia Hatcher -- who had literally the coolest job ever -- as “Chief Popsicle” of Feverish Ice Cream - a company she founded. \xa0 For the past decade, Felecia has dedicated her life to inspiring a new generation of leaders and creating diverse tech/startup ecosystems. An author and globally sought after speaker, Felecia has been honored at the White House on two occasions for the impact of her entrepreneurship and the social impact of her work.\xa0 You’ll fall in love with Felecia’s positive energy. We were inspired that she not only became a successful entrepreneur in her own right, but also has been paying forward by helping so many others to become successful entrepreneurs as well. For our show notes, visit DreamBigPodcast.com/150 | Recently, we became familiar with the work of David Goggins, bestselling author of Can’t Hurt Me.\xa0 David had an incredibly tough childhood --and was going down a very dangerous path in life. Ultimately he defied all odds, became an active Navy SEAL and then later a world class ultra athlete and world record holder. \xa0 Now, unfortunately, we can’t recommend the book for our younger Big Dreamers as it certainly not intended for kids -- but for our adult Big Dreamers -- we highly encourage you to check out David’s inspiring work and follow his highly entertaining Instagram. \xa0 While his content is not suitable for kids -- there are many important lessons David shares in his book and videos that younger Big Dreamers can benefit from. In this podcast episode, Eva shares David’s thoughts on the most important conversation you’ll ever have\xa0 -- which of course is the conversation inside your mind. Your self-talk will determine whether you get started and whether you continue or quit when the going gets tough. We love David’s advice on the subject and Eva shares some examples of how she has applied it in her own life in recent months.\xa0 Enjoy this powerful episode!

Doctors have racked their brains for years- looking for patterns, problems, links that somehow explain why certain people get better quickly and others get sick quickly and don’t recover. And perhaps it might surprise you, as you will hear in the next interview—that how we feel is not necessarily about the dosage of medication or the brilliance of the doctor but about something simpler- something much more common and humane but something that isn’t always provided—and it comes down to the science of kindness, connection and human compassion. When we look at our children- and notice that some thrive and some continue to falter, it will be interesting to look through the lens of kindness, compassion and connection to see if this is any area that needs to be bolstered in the lives of the kids we know and love. The lives that are often stressed with go, go, go hours being shuttled from sports practices to music practice to hours of homework, where they spend a great deal of time in school where many might not feel seen and heard, where social media can make us feel more disconnected, envious and perfectionistic than ever-- How could some shifts of the heart, in the time we spend, with who we spend it with--\xa0 make the difference in the wellness of our children and ourselves? For that, we turn to Dr. Kelli Harding.Dr. Kelli Harding is an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. She is a diplomat of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, as well as boarded in the specialty of psychosomatic (mind-body) medicine. Kelli has spent much of her career in the emergency room at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and has appeared on Today, Good Morning America, NPR, The New York Times, Medscape, Oprah.com, and US News & World Report.\xa0 Kelli resides in NYC with her family. She also has a new book that just came out called The Rabbit Effect: Live Longer, Happier and Healthier with Groundbreaking Science of KindnessThe post How to Talk to Kids about the Connection between Kindness and Wellness with Kelli Harding, MD appeared first on drrobynsilverman.com. | Special guest: Dawn Heubner, Ph.D We all want our children to feel safe, secure and engaged in their lives. But when big, bad things happen in the world- from mass shootings to natural disasters to other tragedies detailed on the news and filtered through the adults at the restaurant, the neighbors on the street, the kids on the bus and friends at school- the world can feel a little less safe and secure for many of our children. How can we reserve our kids feelings of optimism, safety, security, strength and that inexplicable feeling that comes with a carefree childhood when scary things happen across the world, across the state or across the street? For this important topic, we turn a second time to past podcast guest, Dr. Dawn Huebner who you’ll remember from our discussion about worry and anxiety and how to help our kids when they worry too much—a great and helpful podcast episode that I urge you to listen to after this one.

Who was on top, who was on bottom and who floated somewhere in the middle of the social hierarchy at school and among peer groups? Who was well-liked by many, who was revered by the masses and who was feared by most- you know, the kids who were popular by default because nobody really wanted to attempt to take on the views and power of that group of kids? Interestingly, popularity in our younger years, according to research, can predict how successful we are in our adulthood—but are we, as parents, supposed to help our children to become more popular, then? Actually, the definition of popularity needs to be fully understood to learn the answer to that- and the strategies and key conversations to help our children will follow. For that, we turn to our guest, Dr. Mitch Prinstein.Mitch Prinstein, Ph.D. is a husband, a father, board certified in clinical child and adolescent psychology, and serves as the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience, and the Director of Clinical Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Mitch’s Peer Relations Lab has been conducting research on popularity and peer relations for almost 20 years—and has produced over 100 scientific works, including a slew of scientific journal articles, book chapters, a set of encyclopedias on adolescent development, and even a textbook on the field of clinical psychology. Mitch is deeply committed to science and training in clinical psychology and his research have been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, National Public Radio, the Los Angeles Times, CNN, U.S. News & World Report, Time magazine, New York magazine, Newsweek, Reuters, Family Circle, Real Simple, and elsewhere.

When people hear the word; “toddler” it often conjures up thoughts of “the terrible twos,” torrential tantrums and tirades that feature the word “NO!” in big capital letters. There are frustrations about toddlers not listening, not eating fruits and vegetables, not sleeping, not listening, not allowing parents to go to go out on a date or go to the bathroom without their company. But what if I told you that by looking at life through a toddler’s eyes and using the methods developed by Dr. Montessori, you can learn the peaceful way of raising a toddler to become a curious, responsible, kind individual? That is exactly what we are going to do today with our next guest.Simone Davies is the author of\xa0“The Montessori Toddler”,\xa0runs parent-child Montessori classes in Amsterdam at her school\xa0Jacaranda Tree Montessori,\xa0and is mother of two young adults. She also has a popular blog, “The Montessori Notebook”.\u2028\u2028Finding Montessori helped her so much when raising her own children and it’s now her passion to help other parents introduce these ideas in their homes too. She\xa0was looking to find a way to be with her kids that wasn’t about bossing them about, threatening them and bribing them. Or giving them free reign either. And she\xa0wanted them to have a positive experience of school, not just to pass tests, but to love learning.The post How to Raise Curious, Responsible Toddlers the Montessori Way with Simone Davies appeared first on drrobynsilverman.com. | Special guest: Phyllis Fagell, LCPC  Middle school is a time of seismic shifts—everything is changing from friendships and relationships to hormones, expectations and not to mention the physical, intellectual, moral, social and emotional growth your child is experiencing in just a short amount of time. Fundamental questions are floating around the heads of adolescents such as “who am I?” “Am I normal?” and “do I fit in?” Middle schoolers are thrust into a changing environment where adult involvement is reduced and their own skills become vital as they figure out exactly what they are going to allow to be their social and personal currency. Skills such as making good friend choices, negotiating conflict, considering other people’s perspectives, cultivating their own passions and recognizing limitations and of course, making responsible, healthy, ethical choices. Yes, there is a lot to this middle school experience that bridges the gap between childhood and teenhood—and thankfully, we don’t need to go it alone.Phyllis L. Fagell,\xa0LCPC, is the author of “Middle School Matters,” the counselor at Sheridan School in Washington, D.C., a psychotherapist at The Chrysalis Group and a frequent contributor to\xa0The Washington Post\xa0and other national publications. She is also a regular columnist for the\xa0Association for Middle Level Education\xa0and\xa0Kappan\xa0magazines, and she consults and speaks throughout the country.

We might be in conflict with our child and think; “he’s not listening to me,” “she’s so spoiled” or “he’s sucking the life out of me.” But what if we turned these statements on their ear to evaluate their truth but also look inward to see what the actual truth might be? We have the greatest of intentions and love our children—but it is often that we live in the moment. The moment of running from here to there, picking up, dropping off, cooking, cleaning, helping, orchestrating, planning—and getting frustrated, angry or upset when life’s little irritating moments get in our way—our children fighting with us, fighting with each other, not going along with what we deem “the flow.” And I get it—as a mother I am there with you and get this frustration deeply. Today, let’s look into self inquiry so that we can learn to prepare for the long haul rather than the fleeting moment, connection rather than disagreement and love rather than fear. I’ll be going on this journey with you as I am hanging out in the same boat, needing to learn and practice the same lessons and gain the same insights from our next guest who is ready to help us.Catherine\xa0Weiss\xa0is the author of a radically different parenting book for mothers, currently 5-stars on Amazon, called,\xa0The Present Mother: How to Deepen Your Connection With the Present Moment, Yourself, and Your Child. The New York Times bestselling author of\xa0The Conscious Parent, Dr. Shefali Tsabary wrote the foreword to\xa0The Present Mother\xa0and in it says,\xa0"Any parent who reads and practices the insights in this book will not only heal their own wounds from childhood, they will change things for their offspring for all generations to come."\xa0Catherine\'s readers call\xa0The Present Mother\xa0THE parenting book and that it\xa0takes Conscious Parenting to the next level.The post How to Be a Present Parent with Catherine Weiss appeared first on drrobynsilverman.com. | Special guest: Kari Kampakis  It’s not easy to be a teenage girl. Dealing with cliques, bullying, rejection, and social media fiascos can be overwhelming and disheartening. So yes, being a parent or a key adult in the lives of teen girls can also be a challenge- how do we best advise the teen girls for whom we only want the best when we don’t always know which way is up! Our teen girls are going through so many important changes—physical, emotional, social, cognitive—they are learning what they like, who they like, who they are and who they want to be. This is big stuff. So if you had the opportunity, what would you truly want the teen girls in your life to know? What would you want them to take in about popularity, friendship, relationships, reputation and belief in themselves? As it turns out, we do have the opportunity to talk to our girls about all of these important areas of development and experience—and if we haven’t yet embarked on these discussions, we can start now. Kari Kampakis is a blogger, author, speaker, and columnist from Birmingham. Her two books for teen and tween girls, 10 Ultimate Truths Girls Should Know and Liked: Whose Approval Are You Living For, have been used widely across the country by small groups to empower girls through faith. She is also in the process of writing another book on mothers and daughters. Kari’s work has been featured on The Huffington Post, The TODAY Show along with other national outlets. She and her husband, Harry, have four daughters and a dog named Lola.

Denmark has been voted as having the happiest people in the world by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) almost every year since 1973. That’s more than 40 years of happiness! It begs the question—is it the parenting? I mean, is there a Danish Way of parenting? It turns out, there is, and while the Danish Way of parenting is not the only reason Danes are the happiest, it does play a very important role—and the success of it all seems to be tied to the ways they educate children far beyond academics—focusing on play, empathy and social skills. It’s important to delve into it, I hope you would agree, since happy kids tend to grow up to be happy adults who raise happy kids—and the seasons go ‘round and round again. And while in the United States and in other areas of the world, we are seeing an increase of anti-depressants, suicides among young people and mental health diagnoses, as well as a great deal of competition between parents and we have a lot to learn from the Danes. Best-selling Author, Journalist, Danish Parenting Expert & Cultural Researcher, Jessica Alexander’s book "The Danish Way of Parenting: What the Happiest People in the World Know about Raising Confident Capable Kids" has been published in over 25 countries. Her work has been featured in TIME, The Wall Street Journal, Salon, Huffington Post, NPR, NY Times, and many more. She regularly does talks and workshops for parents, schools and organizations like Google, The Women\'s Network of the United Nations, The World Parenting Forum and many more. She has also worked as a spokesperson for LEGO on the Power of play.The post How to Parent the Danish Way with Jessica Alexander appeared first on drrobynsilverman.com. | Special guest: Mona Delahooke, PhD.  A kindergartener whose father pinches her on the arm at night- once for every time her teacher wrote the girl’s name on the behavior chart at school that day.A three year old in foster care who was found sitting in a car by the side of the road with his mother, who was passed out at the wheel. His daycare-center teacher sends him to a time out room for challenging behaviors.A ten year old is diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. His teachers say he is chronically disruptive, always seeking attention, His problematic behaviors began after his family relocated to a new state.My next guest says that we are too quick to look at behaviors as attempts to annoy and disrupt—rather than what they truly represent- observable responses to our internal and external experiences. And here’s the problem with that- When we fail to recognize that many behaviors represent the body’s response to stress, not intentional misbehavior, we expend effort on techniques designed to help children logically connect their thoughts, emotions and behaviors and change them—when they simply can’t yet. Instead, we need to see the behavior that is problematic and confusing and NOT ask ourselves how do we get rid of it? But rather, what is this telling us about the child? The answer will then guide us to coming up with the best approach to help that individual child thrive. Mona Delahooke, Ph.D. is a clinical child psychologist with a passion for supporting families and children. She has worked widely with multidisciplinary teams in the areas of trauma, developmental and emotional differences for 25 years.\xa0 She is a senior faculty member of the Profectum Foundation and is a trainer and consultant to schools and agencies including the Los Angeles Department of Mental Health.

Many parenting books offer countless tips for dealing with kids when they misbehave in the eyes of their parents—refusing to go to bed, rejecting the vegetables they’ve been told to eat, talking back, yelling in the restaurant, badgering their sibling or resisting doing the tasks it takes to get to school on time. But the way parents cope with these challenging behaviors might be backfiring even if they work in the short term. My next guest asks many thought-provoking questions in his book, Unconditional Parenting- but two seem to be at the forefront. First; “What are your\xa0long-term\xa0objectives for your children?” and second, given those long term goals, which are likely for your child to be some version of a kind, independent, confident, competent, happy and fulfilled person—are the ways in which you are parenting lending themselves to creating that type of person IN the long run—or not? It’s time to take a hard look at some of the parenting practices that have become so common that they are accepted as the acceptable norm- time outs, positive re-enforcement, consequences, withdrawal of attention, punishment—and start taking a hard look at UNCONDITIONAL parenting- a parenting philosophy and practice in which parental love and attention is not in a push-pull relationship with how our children behave. On top of that, UNCONDITIONAL parenting puts to rest the notion that children are trying to make trouble—and instead, assumesthe best of the child and looks at the child as a whole person not a compilation of good and bad behaviors.Alfie Kohn is the author of 14 books on education, parenting, and human behavior, including\xa0PUNISHED BY REWARDS\xa0(1993),\xa0THE SCHOOLS OUR CHILDREN DESERVE (1999),\xa0UNCONDITIONAL PARENTING\xa0(2005),\xa0THE HOMEWORK MYTH\xa0(2006), and\xa0THE MYTH OF THE SPOILED CHILD\xa0(2014).\xa0\xa0He has appeared twice on “Oprah,” as well as on “The Today Show” and many other TV and radio programs. His articles include: “Five Reasons to Stop Saying ‘Good Job!’”, “How Not to Teach Values,” and “Atrocious Advice from ‘Supernanny.’ ” Kohn works with educators and parents across the country and speaks regularly at national conferences.

Our heads are banging against the wall and our brains are overworked trying to figure out solutions to the obstacles we are facing without any relief in sight. Luckily, our experiences help us recognize these obstacles faster in the future and overtime we figure out a system for working through hard times to find answers. Tune in to hear a 4 part system that continues to work for me to find clarity in my edu-situations.Quotables Sometimes I feel like I can’t help anyone if I’m trying to help everyone. My past experiences told me that when I am in the weeds, if I look at the facts, it becomes clear. Data doesn’t lie. I admire mentors who roll up their sleeves and help someone else do their work.

That is what makes teachers great… they get past the barriers kids put up, and they use that in as a way to convey expectations encouragement and content. Getting clear on what you envision your space to look, feel and sound like well before that first day will help you make it a reality. Boundaries are a way of letting kids know that you are willing to give some rope but they don’t get to be in control of the lasso. [Kids] might not outwardly thank you for setting boundaries but it lets them know you love and care for them bc you are making their learning space safe and their learning opportunities fair and fun. That trust and relationship cannot grow if you do not water it with follow through. You will give them healthy boundaries that allow them to stretch but never to fall.

Cumulative Effect: I needed to hear the same message multiple different ways from many different people before it began to click. We know that educators wear so many hats, you have to be multi faceted. you have to be organized, analytical, understand curriculum framework and alignment, so many things you need. above everything else I think you need to have the right heart. i think you can learn strategies, techniques, so many things when you go into teacher prep programs but the one thing you cant learn is to be empathetic and have a heart for kids and love kids genuinely, authentically and want to be present to help them. Above all, educators who i consider teacher with a purpose are those who are understanding, empathetic, compassionate, resilient..to me they manifest character traits of good decent people opposed to those who we would consider book smart or have a good handle on curriculum and instruction. Teachers want to feel supported and have a sense of encouragement. Always be mindful of the reason why you entered the field of education. You need to approach every day like you\'re on assignment. What\'s not scheduled will not get accomplished. Their success is my success. It\'s the teacher that creates the bridge to help [students] move from disengaged to highly engaged. This pedagogy stuff won\'t work if you don\'t build a relationship with kids.

But the way coaches are leading teachers ends up landing flat because they are either pushing too hard or pulling too far. The secret to great teacher leadership is being a guide on the side- not pushing or pulling too much. Tune in to hear 3 steps to ensure you pass the ownership baton to teachers so that the improvement is long term.Quotables When we make decisions under pressure, on a short time frame, we lack the intention and insight necessary for that decision to ever truly become effective. Great Teachers don’t equal great leaders. We gotta stop panicking and jumping on the latest bandwagon. Because growth pain is ordinary and expected and the pain makes the results that much more worth it. It might be faster to push or pull, but it’s never effective.

To truly amplify our impact in our classroom, school buildings, and community we need to figure out where we excel and make it accessible to others so that they can repeat our success. Follow the four-step proven method shared in this episode to amplify your impact by increasing teacher proficiency and student achievement in the classroom.Quotables: Why do we have to contain our impact? If we are able to find success in the classroom, we should be able to take that success and multiply it in a way so that more students can be positively impacted. No child should be at an advantage or disadvantage depending on what teacher they are assigned. If one teacher is doing great, we must dissect that success and replicate it so all students can benefit. When we better ourselves, we better others. If we want to have an impact, we have to think beyond ourselves. To amplify our impact, we have to act beyond ourselves. Educators have each other’s backs.
