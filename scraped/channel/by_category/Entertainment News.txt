They’re breaking it down scene by scene, highlighting North West’s play date with Jojo Siwa and Khloe’s wild trip to Las Vegas. But, the real star of the episode is Kourtney’s Christmas trip to Finland with her kids, Scott, and his girlfriend Sofia Richie. Emma and Julie dissect the dynamic between the trio as they travel across the world together, and let the cameras in on their intimate family trip. It’s the first real look we’ve gotten into the relationships between the three adults with the kids around, and there’s simply so much to say. | Aaron Carter has been making headlines recently, yet everyone seems to be asking the same question: ‘what the hell is going on?’ So - since there was no new KUWTK this week, Emma and Julie used the bonus show to dissect everything happening with Aaron & his family. First, they gave some context by providing a little bit of Carter family history, bringing us all back to the days of Aaron Carter as a teen sensation. Then, they transitioned into current day and explained every detail of all the chaos. This was a heavy one, and Emma & Julie really attempted to inform, while simultaneously treating this situation with the empathy it deserves. | Emma and Julie are back from their trip to LA to recap a very exciting week of stories in their 100th podcast episode! First, Hailey and Justin\'s beautiful wedding in South Carolina and what we\'ve seen so far on social media. They also break down everything from JLo and Arod\'s engagement party, Ashton Kutcher\'s tweet, Miley\'s cryptic Instagram story, and so so much more. In the award ceremony, John Krasinski and Kate Beckinsale take home the gold for "funniest comment" and "best clapback" of the week. The Kardashian recap kicks off with Malika\'s shocking pregnancy announcement. They also discuss the yet to be released Sunday Service album, how strong North West\'s genes are, and Sofia and Scott on Flip It Like Disick. | On today’s episode, Emma and Julie are joined for the second time by the host of E!’s Daily Pop and ‘Just The Sip,’ Justin Sylvester! If you’re an avid listener, you know these three vibe so hard, hence the episode length. They’re going deeeeep into this week’s topics and of course tell some hilarious stories while doing it. The trio gives an Emmy recap, a look into Demi Moore’s tell-all book, JLo x Versace, what’s up with Miley and Kaitlynn, and so much more. Of course, the Kardashian recap is stacked with news. The episode is a journey, but it’s damn well worth the ride. | Emma and Julie are reporting from their first ever podcast in LA to break down last night\'s intense episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. As usual, they give a scene-by-scene recount of this extra juicy episode. They discuss everything from what\'s going on now with Jordyn Woods, Kylie and Khloe, the storyline of Kourtney and Scott figuring out how to best co-parent, and the serious security at Kimye\'s house. Again, we proclaim: best. season. ever. | On this week’s episode, Emma and Julie are joined by actor/singer Drake Bell to recap the latest news in the world of pop culture. Before diving into the stories with Drake, the girls give a quick solo recap of the week in the Kardashian/Jenner world, and their raw reactions to the Shawn and Camila kissing video that sent shockwaves through the Internet.\xa0 Other topics they touch on include Felicity Huffman’s sentencing, Kylie and Travis’ sexy shoot for Playboy, and Rihanna’s highly anticipated Fenty Show. In honor of Amanda Bynes’ return to Instagram, Drake takes a walk down memory lane and reminisces about his favorite moments behind the scenes at The Amanda Show. He also talks about his singing career and\xa0 gives thoughts on the possibility of a Drake and Josh remake, and the impact the show has left on our generation. | Emma and Julie have proclaimed this the "best season ever" of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and we\'re only on episode 2! They\'re breaking down the juicy episode scene-by-scene, and even play a hypothetical game of \'which sister would you bring to the doctor.\' This week\'s Keeping Up gives us the inside look we were craving into the inner workings of their stylists ("The Danis",) Kourtney\'s gorgeous 40th birthday bash, and the most star-studded Coachella/Easter celebration in Palm Springs. | On today\'s episode, Emma and Julie are joined by host of "The Rundown" and E! News correspondent, Erin Lim! The trio goes through the biggest stories of the week, beginning with an update on Britney Spears and the latest on Tyler Cameron and Gigi Hadid. They go into the details of the college admissions scandal, Nicki Minaj\'s "retirement," Shawn & Camila’s romance, Crazy Rich Asians’ writer pay disparity, Justin Bieber\'s clapback, Demi Lovato\'s epic bikini shot & so much more. In the award ceremony, David Spade and Selma Blair take home the gold for "best clapback" and "funniest comment" of the week. The Kardashian update includes the breaking news of Kylie and Travis\' photoshoot for Playboy, Kim’s Skims launch, Kylie/Kris on Ellen & Kanye’s Wyoming compound. This was a really fun one. | The day Emma and Julie have been waiting for is FINALLY here! Keeping Up with the Kardashians is back and better than ever with Season 17, and Emma and Julie are so excited to recap every second of the premiere. The first episode of the season is jam packed with juicy details, and gives a ton of insight into what was going on behind closed doors with Khloe and Tristan. They recap True\'s first birthday party, Kim\'s health struggles, Kourtney\'s anxiety about getting older, and what the future holds for her and Scott. Of course, they analyze all of the smallest details and gush over the adorable kids. We\'re just so happy to be back. | In their final deep dive before the new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres, Emma and Julie take a deeper look into the life of Travis Scott. They go through his childhood, amazing career trajectory, and of course examine his relationship with Kylie Jenner and their daughter Stormi. They also incorporate some of the best moments from his Netflix documentary "Look Mom I Can Fly," and all of the things they learned from watching.', 'chan_desc': "From the viral Instagram account @commentsbycelebs comes the much awaited Comments By Celebs Podcast.

We were away for nine months, gestating this thirst baby, and now we have returned… and named it Dan Levy! The co-creator and showrunner of the Emmy-nominated comedy Schitt’s Creek is our Thirst Object, and we have lots to talk about: his forever-coiffed hair, his intense eyebrows (inherited from his equally lushly-follicled father Eugene), his smirk, that makes us want to share secrets with him… We talk about how he actively creates a world in which homophobia is acknowledged but not made central to identity, and how kindness is the greatest aphrodisiac on earth. Yes, even greater than Keanu’s hair flop.We also did a quick rundown of what we missed during our hiatus: America’s Ass™, the eyebrows, and cheekbones of Crazy Rich Asians, and what the heck sweater-wearing Hulk would be allowed to get away with, were he to ask… This show is sponsored by Cloud10Click here to Download: Work in Progress with Sophia Bush | Thirst Aid Kit is back in your ears on September 26th, with a new home on Slate Podcasts. | Dear Thirst Buckets, Thirst Aid Kit’s time at BuzzFeed has come to an end.

What a delightful, funny, thoughtful man he is. We could barely maintain our professionalism. We talk about everything from his spoken word beginnings to his chronic shirtlessness.

Half German, half Ghanaian, and all American, Mr K is a tall drink of water we have been quietly thirsting after for more than a decade, bless him. Boris Kodjoe has the longevity and (thirst) range.

This bumper episode starts with John Krasinski, who has been steadily building his thirst-worthiness (and those pecs) since he was (Slim) Jim in The Office. What is it about that beard that flicked a switch? Then we moved onto Will Smith, who transitioned from the Fresh Prince into an internet uncle, but also sometimes has the facial hair of... a zaddy? Finally, we visited Kensington Palace to ponder the allure of Prince Harry's ginger beard, and how it thoroughly seduced us into overlooking some past fuckery. THE POWER OF BEARDS, MAN.

We were ably aided by two fabulously thirsty guests: TK Matunda and Kyrell Grant, who shared with us their knowledge and appreciation for thirst objects as varied as Jemaine Clement, Richard Ayoade, Donald Glover, Ezra Miller, and Stanley ‘The Tooch’ Tucci. There were gasps of delight and impromptu dancing on stage, plus we played live Thirst Sommelier with our lovely audience, live drabble writing and reading in Fanfic Wars (with a twist), and of course, all the dirty auntie chuckles you could ever want.

Known for his parts on TV shows like The 4400 and House of Cards and in movies like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and the Hunger Games films, Ali went from steadily working actor to legitimate star with his 2016 role in Moonlight. He’s only in the film’s first half-hour, playing Juan, a drug dealer who can tell that a sensitive young boy needs a space to just be himself, but he’s magnetic and warm, caring and thoughtful, in a role Hollywood rarely allows to have much care and thought. Ali won an Oscar for Supporting Actor, and from there, he’s charted an eclectic, fascinating past couple of years. He’s getting Oscar buzz again for his Golden Globe-nominated role in Green Book, and he voices a pivotal character in the highly acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Then in January, he’ll be playing the lead character in the long-awaited third season of True Detective. The role, originally written for a white actor, spoke to Ali, and he convinced showrunner Nic Pizzolatto to reconceive the part so he could play it. Ali joined Todd to chat about his remarkable rise to stardom, taking the role in True Detective, and what he thinks art can do to help heal society in the 2010s. And stick around after Todd and Ali’s conversation for some of our favorite I Think You’re Interesting moments from over the years!\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Michael Schur is one of the most adept minds in TV comedy. From his early days producing the Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon-era Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live, to his work as one of the key writers on The Office, he charted a career that touched some of the best TV comedy of the 2000s. But in the 2010s, he’s become perhaps the principal figure in network TV comedy, with his shows Parks and Recreation and The Good Place. (He’s also co-creator of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, though his fellow co-creator Dan Goor is the showrunner on that series.) Parks was a tribute to the idea of a kinder, more loving America, just barely holding off a dark and horrifying one, while The Good Place is the only show in TV archives that balances advanced lessons in ethics and philosophy with elaborate jokes about shrimp. That’s what made Todd want to talk with Schur not just about his shows, but about his overall philosophy of comedy. They delve into questions of what makes a good comedic premise, what makes a good character relationship to build a comedy around, and what the best comedic actors have in common. And maybe they’ll even answer that age-old question: Why is it so much easier to set a successful sitcom in a bar than it is to set one in a restaurant?

And, sure, he enjoys the stuff that gets overplayed year after year, but he gets why you're sick of it. Finding good music often means going a little off the beaten path. That's why Todd talked to PJ Morton, a musician who's recorded with Stevie Wonder and was a member of Maroon 5, and who has his own successful, Grammy-nominated solo career. He asked Morton both about his new Christmas album (Christmas with PJ Morton) and to pick his five favorite Christmas albums of all time. Morton's choices are great, not so hyper-obscure as to be impossible to find but also not overplayed to death (save for Mariah Carey, but you gotta have Mariah Carey on a list like this). And along the way, he and Todd chat about why these songs endure, what it means to put your own spins on them, and what it's like to sing songs about snowy white Christmases when you grew up in New Orleans.

It made the trip from New York public access TV to more traditional networks. And then earlier this year, it ended, as its network, TruTV, and comedian Gethard opted not to continue with it. It ended up being the most weirdly appropriate promotion for Gethard’s new book imaginable. Lose Well, published in October, is a self-help book with a twist, a tome that is meant to help people figure out not how to avoid losing but how to lean into it, how to learn from it, how to change thanks to it. It compiles the stories Gethard has collected over a long career peppered with high-profile failures (and, yes, some high-profile successes), mixed with his signature blend of earnest, sincere humor. And here’s the paragraph where we’d put some of the stuff Gethard and Todd talk about in this episode, but honestly, it’s one of Todd’s favorite interviews he’s ever done, and he couldn’t narrow it down. So just listen to it already.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | This episode originally ran in November of 2017. It’s almost Thanksgiving, which means home chefs all around the United States (Todd among them) are trying to find a way to hew to tradition without turning their plates into a giant pile of indistinguishable starches. In this Thanksgiving Spectacular, we’ve invited Samin Nosrat to join us and offer her hints and tips for a successful Thanksgiving meal. Samin’s book, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, is one of the best cookbooks Todd’s ever read, and the information it provides about how the four elements in the title interact to make delicious food will help any chef — no matter how experienced — cook even better food. But it can also help brighten up that Thanksgiving plate, and Samin offered Todd advice on making tastier turkey, zingier mashed potatoes, and sharper Thanksgiving salads. She also stuck around to talk about writing a cookbook, devouring delicious food she didn’t cook, and enjoying the perfect vegan holiday season.

Each week, Longworth dives into a story from the film industry’s past, revealing the truth behind legends, the hidden stories that weren’t reported at the time, and the often corrupt systems Hollywood has always been built upon. Long a terrific film critic, Longworth turned what was initially an extreme DIY operation into one of the top film podcasts. Now Longworth has brought her fascination with old Hollywood to her brand new book, Seduction. It's simultaneously the story of producer, aviator, and tycoon Howard Hughes and the many women he slept with (and often ruined the careers of). The book subverts Hughes’s playboy image, questioning just what the effect of his cruelty could be on the women he strung along — and often kept imprisoned later in his life. Longworth joins Todd this week to talk about the legacy of Hughes in Hollywood, what draws her to the stories of old Hollywood, and why it’s important to talk about how the film industry has always treated women to understand how that can be changed today.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

Since Juno, she's written numerous movies, including the cult favorite horror flick Jennifer's Body, the moody comedy Young Adult (one of Todd's favorite movies of the decade), and this year's twisty comedy Tully, which stars Charlize Theron as a mother of three who hires a night nanny to just get some sleep already, only to find there's more to the picture. Cody is one of our most incisive writers when it comes to gender and class, and the ways those two things intersect and diverge, especially when you're a woman who can't quite seem to make ends meet. She's also prolific in the world of television (she created the Showtime series The United States of Tara). And her very first musical, an adaptation of the Alanis Morissette album Jagged Little Pill, debuted over the summer and will soon be making its way to Broadway. Cody joins Todd to talk about the inspiration for Tully, just how many hits were on Jagged Little Pill, and what reality shows she's watching on Netflix.\xa0Learn more about your ad choices.

How might you try to kickstart that process with all these hominids you keep meeting? And how would you avoid rebuilding civilization with all of the flaws of our current world?That question is the basis of Ryan North's new book How to Invent Everything, a hugely enjoyable book that really does come close to achieving what's promised in the title. (You'll even learn how to invent a computer using a river!)North is probably best known to this point as the writer of comics like Adventure Time and The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, as well as the creator and writer of Dinosaur Comics, a webcomic that has run since 2003 using the exact same clip art (of dinosaurs, of course) in all six panels for 15 years. Todd and North talk about the foundations of society, what you learn writing a comic whose art doesn't change from day to day, and why the best meals are sometimes those you can never have again.Then: Todd is joined by astronauts Mae Jemison and Leland Melvin to talk about leaving behind Earth's orbit — and how we just might find humanity's future on our next-door neighbor Mars.

Sometimes, the scariest thing is what you don’t see onscreen. It’s a lesson taken to heart by the folks behind two of the best horror projects of the first half of 2018 — the AMC miniseries\xa0The Terror\xa0and the gigantic hit movie\xa0A Quiet Place.In this special horror showcase episode, Todd talks to Soo Hugh and David Kajganich, the showrunners and head writers of\xa0The Terror; and then with Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn, the sound designers of\xa0A Quiet Place. All four talk about how to build horror unconventionally —\xa0The Terror\xa0by starting from a real, historical event that didn’t actually involve supernatural interference (though the TV show adds a fearsome creature to chow down on stranded sailors) and\xa0A Quiet Place\xa0by stripping out almost all spoken dialogue.It’s a great time for horror, and Soo, David, Erik, and Ethan bring unique perspectives to what’s made the genre boom so much and where it might be headed.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices | Yeardley Smith is one of the most famous women on Earth — though you might not know it if you just bumped into her somewhere, at least until she said something. See, Smith is the voice of Lisa Simpson, the precocious 8-year-old middle child of the Simpson family and the center of some of the show’s very best episodes. (“Lisa’s Substitute”! Sob!)But Smith is more than the famous kid she’s played for more than 30 years now. She’s starred in numerous films and other TV shows, including the infamous Herman’s Head (sadly, she wasn't one of the people inside Herman’s head) and the Oscar-winning film As Good as It Gets. She’s even made shoes.But it’s her most recent project that might seem most outside her wheelhouse. It’s a true crime podcast that examines crimes from the point-of-view of the people who solved them, then sends Smith and her co-host Zibby Allen to cover around the country looking into these crimes. It’s an engaging and thoughtful look at how crimes can rock tiny little towns where everybody knows everybody.Smith joins Todd this week to talk about the national fascination with true crime, her wide-ranging slate of interests, and, yes, Lisa Simpson.

If Meghan was one of your girlfriends, what would you tell her she’s doing right and what, if anything, would you advise her differently? 2. What piqued your interest in the duchess and when?\xa0 3. Duchess’s situation is the epitome of a situation where you’re butting up against people with unearned privilege who you outperform regularly. What lessons do you take from how she is handling her situation? And how can we apply those lessons in our daily lives\xa0 4. What do you think about the royal family’s seeming complicity or laissez-faire attitude about the press abuse? 5. More girlfriend questions, how would you advise her to protect her sanity in the face of the madness?\xa0 6. What has Meghan done that you are most proud of or can most relate to? Something where you said to yourself, “Now if I was in her position, that’s exactly what I would’ve done?” 7. What do you think is the difference between a political and humanitarian issue? How would you define each?

WE STAND WITH THE SUSSEXES\xa0 Here are snippets of what he said .... \xa0 " There comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn’t acceptable, at any level. We won’t and can’t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this. \xa0 Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one. Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces. \xa0 We thank you, the public, for your continued support. It is hugely appreciated.

Aunque, es bastante común que las vacaciones acaben resultando más estresantes que el propio trabajo.De acuerdo con los psicólogos, las vacaciones nos pueden estresar desde mucho antes de irnos: ¿playa o montaña? ¿hotel o apartamento? En las vacaciones hay tres partes:Los meses previos donde hay que planear todoEl tiempo de vacaciones donde debemos disfrutarEl después, que nos llena de recuerdos y melancolíaPor ello, existe un manual para disfrutar totalmente de las vacaciones. Te lo cuenta Sopitas en este episodio. ¡Dale al play! | ¿Es la música únicamente obra del ser humano? ¿Podrán las máquinas algún día componer melodías? El proyecto magenta, con la ayuda de una plataforma de inteligencia artificial, logra procesar cientos de algoritmos para convertirlos en música y muchas otras piezas de arte.\xa0Las canciones que crea este ordenador los hace a través de una red neural artificial, un paradigma de procesamiento y aprendizaje automático basado en el modo en el que funciona el sistema nervioso humano. Pero, ¿de dónde aprende esta máquina? Le enseñaron miles de canciones de las que \xa0fue identificando patrones y, a partir de ahí, empezó a reproducir notas en secuencias que producen melodías.¿Quieres escuchar el resultado? No te puedes perder este episodio de Sopitas. | Un grupo de científicos, incluyendo el ganador de un Premio Nobel, afirma que la tierra ha entrado en una nueva era geológica: la era antropocena. Para entender lo que esto significa debemos partir de que una era geológica es el periodo de tiempo que normalmente comprende miles de millones de años, en el que se divide la escala temporal, con el fin de facilitar la comprensión de la evolución del mundo y los seres que lo componen.La primera era geológica, es la precámbrica, que duró más de cuatro mil millones de años. Durante este periodo se formó la hidrosfera, la litosfera, los océanos y la atmósfera, que hicieron posible la existencia de vida en el planeta.De las eras geológicas y las nuevas afirmaciones científicas nos habla Sopitas en este podcast. | Despiertas, se te hace tarde, sales corriendo de casa, te enfrentas al infernal tráfico para llegar a tu oficina a tiempo y, de repente, esos tacos que cenaste anoche comienzan a \xa0juguetear dentro de tu estómago (ya sabes...). Ahora, la prisa por llegar a tu oficina es mayor. Finalmente, consigues aparcar, las tripas están a punto de traicionarte, llegas al ascensor y aprietas con fuerza el botón de cerrar las puertas con la esperanza de que esos tacos no se escapen de tus cavidades antes de tiempo. Sin embargo, hay un pequeño detalle que ignoras: el botón para cerrar las puertas de los elevadores ¡no sirven de nada!Entonces, ¿por qué está ahí? ¿Por qué siguen existiendo? Una ley de 1990 lo explica y Sopitas nos lo cuenta. Una historia llena de curiosidades que no te puedes perder. | ¿Hay vida más allá de este planeta? Es una de las preguntas más recurrentes de la historia. Los astronautas, pilotos de aviones y algún que otro astrónomo estarán acostumbrados a que les pregunten por la existencia de ovnis o extraterrestres. \xa0De hecho, una gran parte de las consultas que diariamente recibe la NASA por parte de los ciudadanos está relacionada con este tema.

Su historia se remonta a 1887 y, pese al paso del tiempo, ha logrado mantenerse fiel a sus tradiciones: es el único grand slam que aún se disputa en una cancha de \xa0pasto natural y que obliga a todos los jugadores a que su vestimenta sea totalmente blanca. Estas normas son tan rígidas que la tenista canadiense Eugenie Bouchard fue multada por llevar un sujetador negro bajo la camiseta blanca. Curiosamente, fue la misma Bouchard la que puso el dedo sobre la yaga al tuitear un mensaje donde se leía:\xa0"Wimbledon tiene estrictas reglas sobre la ropa blanca pero todas las toallas tienen los colores más locos"\xa0Sobre las toallas de colores imposibles y su robo masivo por parte de los jugadores nos habla Sopitas en este podcast, ¿qué rayos tienen las toallas del campeonato de tenis de Wimbledon que todos las quieren? | Todos sabemos que el desayuno es la comida más importante del día: nos ayuda a activar el metabolismo, nos da energía, hace que no comamos a deshoras y nos mantiene en forma. De hecho, algunos científicos han señalado que saltarse el desayuno es un hábito común entre las personas con obesidad y sobrepeso.\xa0Es tan importante que Sopitas se ha preguntado ¿qué desayunaban aquellas personalidades que ayudaron a cambiar la historia de la humanidad? Repasamos los despertares culinarios de Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, la Reina Isabel I de Inglaterra, Mozart o Mahatma Gandhi. ¿Sabes cuál de ellos empezaba la mañana con un lingotazo de whisky o que otro mezclaba la miel con los huevos y las setas?\xa0Sea para coger ideas o solo por curiosidad, no te pierdas este podcast de Sopitas. | India es el segundo país más poblado del mundo, en él viven más de 1200 millones de personas y la selección prenatal, el infanticidio, los asesinatos por dote, las quemaduras con ácido, los matrimonios forzosos y las agresiones sexuales son solo algunas de las formas más frecuentes que reflejan la violencia de género en este país. Según la ONU, en la India, cuatro mujeres son agredidas sexualmente cada hora. Pero, no fue hasta 2012, cuando el gobierno empezó a tomar medidas para frenar esta lacra, tras la brutal violación a una estudiante de fisioterapia por seis hombres que provocó movilizaciones en todo el país. Estas medidas siguen creciendo y, a partir del 1 de enero de 2017, se pone en marcha un plan que también afecta a los fabricantes de móviles: el botón del pánico.Sobre en qué va a consistir y cómo funcionará \xa0lo explica Sopitas en este podcast. | No sólo comer nos hace subir de peso, hay un elemento en nuestras vidas que nos afecta mucho más a la dieta: el trabajo.Un estudio presentado por la Sociedad Americana del Corazón reveló cuáles son las profesiones más dañinas para nuestro corazón. Muchos de nosotros tendemos a comer mal, deprisa y, en muchas ocasiones, en la propia mesa de trabajo frente al ordenador. En este estudio, los que salen mejor parados son los freelance pues tienen tiempo de administrar su tiempo. \xa0Mientras que algunos de los más afectados son los trabajadores de los restaurantes.¿Saben cuál es el mejor y el peor trabajo para la salud? ¡Denle al play! | Decía Mark Twain "dejar de fumar es de la cosa más fácil del mundo, lo sé porque lo he hecho mil veces".Según el Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, hay más de 11 millones de fumadores activos en México de los cuales cerca del 30% ha intentado dejar el vicio.

Each Superstar scored near falls during the free-for-all, but Shirai appeared to have the match in hand as she prepared to hit LeRae with the Moonsault. The sinister “Joshi Judas” was denied takeoff, however, when the crafty Mia Yim swooped in and pushed Shirai to the floor. The now-recovered LeRae quickly capitalized, striking Yim with a poison hurricanrana and a Quebrada to claim the deciding fall, dealing a tough blow to three other pillars of the Women’s division.Afterward, the ruthless Queen of Spades entered the arena to get a closer look at her next challenger, and in stark contrast to so many Superstars who’ve come eye-to-eye with Baszler in the past, Tenacious C showed no fear.Cameron Grimes is done messing around. Hellbent on making up for his loss in last month’s crucial NXT Breakout Tournament Final, The Technical Savage made an example of Sean Maluta, decimating the former Cruiserweight Classic competitor in the blink of an eye. Maluta sped at Grimes as soon as the bell rang, but Grimes immediately spiked him with a leaping foot stomp to score the decisive win in less time than it took you to read this recap.Prophecy fulfilled.Subscribe to my Podcast Platformshttps://goo.gl/RRshWR | YouTube Channelhttps://goo.gl/tsaB1G | \xa0Stitcherhttps://goo.gl/5wWkP2 | \xa0Anchor.FMI’m also on Apple Podcast just search Dray Jaymes and it’ll pop up!Support me on a personal level, become my Patreon!’https://www.patreon.com/drayJaymesLinks to my social media platformsFacebook: https://goo.gl/EEK6UVIG: \xa0https://goo.gl/T3t4DGTwitter: https://goo.gl/g4QQoG--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/XP-podcast1/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/XP-podcast1/support | Here\'s another episode of the podcast, here I talk about the PS5 Launch title, what nZo thinks of Vince McMahon and some other stuff, these topics are highly expendable with potential1 lol enjoy folks!Subscribe to my Podcast Platformshttps://goo.gl/RRshWR | YouTube Channelhttps://goo.gl/tsaB1G | \xa0Stitcherhttps://goo.gl/5wWkP2 | \xa0Anchor.FMI’m also on Apple Podcast just search Dray Jaymes and it’ll pop up!Support me on a personal level, become my Patreon!’https://www.patreon.com/drayJaymesLinks to my social media platformsFacebook: https://goo.gl/EEK6UVIG: \xa0https://goo.gl/T3t4DGTwitter: https://goo.gl/g4QQoG--- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/XP-podcast1/messageSupport this podcast: https://anchor.fm/XP-podcast1/support | Before the review on the movie "IT" Chapter Two, I discussed on my Dave Chappelle\'s segment of his most recent Netflix spacial, "Sticks and Stones" and I also talk about the most downloaded PS4 games on the PlayStation Network!
