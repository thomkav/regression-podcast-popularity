Growing ever distant, the people\'s trust is beginning to wane from the council and the three protections. However, a plan has been made...a plan to reinstate the peoples trust and plan to set the city back, on its correct course.\xa0\xa0(Scene opens to a stadium. Thousands of people talking, laughing and having a great time. Then the volume dies and the scene takes place in a hallway of the stadium.)\xa0\xa0[Woman]\xa0I don\'t care what people are saying, the council says he\'s the man responsible.\xa0\xa0[Man]\xa0Well you should care. If it\'s true and he\'s just a patsy...and well...that\'s just wrong.\xa0\xa0[Woman]\xa0So what proof have you seen then...is there any proof?...or just people talking?\xa0\xa0[Man]\xa0I mean...there\'s the fact that he\'s one man?...how could one guy pull off all those explosions all by himself?...ya right...I\'m not buying it.\xa0\xa0[Woman]\xa0For the sake of our kids...for the sake of our relationship, for the sake of your life as you know it...I hope you find a way to "buy" it. Do not. Make me. Be the one to turn you into the council as a heretic.\xa0\xa0[Man]\xa0Are you kidding me?\xa0\xa0[Woman]\xa0No...I\'m not kidding you. If someone hears you talking this way and you get turned in they\'ll exile us all. You would be responsible for the death of your entire family...are you ok with that?...I hope your answer is no and you can drop all this.\xa0\xa0[Man]\xa0I\'ll drop it for now, but if I find any evidence, it won\'t be so easy to just drop.\xa0\xa0[Woman]\xa0Well...I\'m going out to enjoy the show. Are you coming?\xa0\xa0(They both exit the hallway into the crowd. The crowd is chanting hey oh.\xa0\xa0Scene end)\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0(On the phone)\xa0Yes, I\'ll be there.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Ok, how do I get in?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'ll have a few men meet you at the gate. They\'ll bring you to the back. When you get there, we\'ll go out and wave to the crowd and take our seats.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Ok...do you...think this…..is the right thing to do? I mean, he didn\'t really do it.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0It\'s what must happen. We\'re doing what we have to...to protect the people and the council. Sometimes...things must be done...that are questionable. If you dont feel comfortable going…\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0No I...I want to go. I\'ll be there.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ok, I\'ll see you there.\xa0\xa0(End scene)\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0Tharin, Aleen, Jarrett and all the other members of the council find themselves on the stage of the stadium. It holds nearly 350,000 people and every seat is filled. Those unlucky enough to miss their opportunity to purchase a ticket, sit at home, tuned in on their radios.\xa0\xa0(Crowds, people chanting)\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'m glad you made it Aleen.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Tharin.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes father?\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Be on guard for any disruption. We\'ve received word that the Theosin may try to interrupt things.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Right. I\'ll keep an eye out.\xa0\xa0[Announcer]\xa0Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Today we celebrate the discovery of the man responsible for all the chaos, in our sacred city, these past few days. His name...Jeremiah Theis. Bring him out.\xa0\xa0(Crowds booing)\xa0\xa0[Announcer]\xa0Jeremiah Theis, you\'ve been accused of the bombings, which attempted to remove three of the most important protectors of the city. You\'ve denied those accusations and been found guilty due to the ever mounting evidence. Do you now wish to confess to said crimes and wipe your conscience clean?\xa0\xa0(Silence)\xa0\xa0Very well then, let the people note that his silence is his confession. Put him on the platform.\xa0\xa0(Steps, sounds of him being put in a noose.)\xa0\xa0Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we\'ve all waited for now approaches. Let our minds rest easy knowing that such an assailant is bidding farewell to this fine city. In his absence he will leave a safer, more stable city than his life allowed. Let the execution ...begin.\xa0\xa0(Crowds cheering. Man being hung. Man runs on stage and grabs the mic.)\xa0\xa0[Theosin member]\xa0This man has done nothing wrong.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Here we go.\xa0\xa0[Theosin member]\xa0How could one man...plan and execute those bombings.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Put down the mic.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Theosin member]\xa0How can you all, stand by and watch as an innocent man dies?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0PUT DOWN THE MIC!\xa0\xa0[Theosin member]\xa0Tharin Grady is a liar. Hes convinced you all that…\xa0\xa0(Gun shot. Crowd supprised….announcer grabs the mic.)\xa0\xa0[Announcer]\xa0I think we\'ve had enough excitement for one day ladies and gentlemen (nervous laughter.) Please exit the stadium in an orderly and organized fashion.\xa0\xa0\xa0(Scene fades to people expressing their disbelief in what they just saw.)\xa0\xa0(Scene end)\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0After the events at the stadium, the people\'s opinion seems unchanged. The very foundations of their trust in the council has begun to crack, and crumble. The council is forced to convene, to determine a plan of action. After the meeting Tharin receives a call from his father.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Father...what did the council say.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0The...people are not happy...with your actions. The council however, has agreed to release a statement saying that you were given strict orders to handle any disruption by any means necessary. They will release the information on the man you shot, showing that he was in fact a member of the Theosin.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Hmmm, so where do we go from here?\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0You must talk to Ross. We need to find Saris...maybe then the people will start to calm down a bit.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0About Saris...father.\xa0\xa0[Jarret]\xa0Yes?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Well, I hate to think this is the case, but James and I have come to an agreement, that Saris has joined the Theosin. Given the positions of the bombings, he had to have been the one responsible.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Tharin...what did they blow up exactly?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Entrances to an underground bunker, built to house the council and staff, in the event of an emergency. I highly doubt, they\'ve tortured Saris into revealing these locations...he had to give them up freely.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0So...if the people do revolt and they come looking for the council...there\'ll be no place for the members to hide.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0That appears to be the plan.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0All the more reason to find Saris. If he is indeed, working with the Theosin...he must be eliminated.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0\xa0I just hope I can talk some sense into him, if I can find him that is. (Breath) I\'d guess I\'d better go talk to Ross.\xa0\xa0(Scene end)\xa0\xa0(Answering phone noise)\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Hello\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Hi Tharin, what are you doing?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Oh, Aleen… I was just on my way to talk to Ross. How are you?\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Good, just checking on you. With all the excitement this morning I just wanted to make sure you\'re ok.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ya, I um, I\'m ok...\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0What\'s wrong?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I don\'t know...I do know. I just...can\'t seem to...I\'m suppose to be one of three people in the city, that can maintain order and peace...and things just continue to seem...uncontrolled.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Tharin, you\'re...human. You\'re going to make mistakes.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Hmmm, mistakes I can handle Aleen, this is...different. I\'ve been trained to handle all of this and...I mean the Theosin are just a group of lower class, powerless puppets...and yet they seem to be outwitting me at every turn. They\'ve always been just a joke to the three protectors and now...what must the protectors of the past think of me?\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Tharin, I think...considering all you\'ve been through...you\'re doing a pretty  job. The bombing was a pretty traumatic event. It would have been, for anyone.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Why didn\'t I see that coming? That\'s another thing, I was trained to foresee events based upon evidence. The bombings should\'ve never happened and the backlash from shooting, that despicable excuse for a human I...I should\'ve been able to see it all, but I wasn\'t.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Are you...thinking about stepping down?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0No, council no, I will not step down. I just need to refocus. The Theosin are not good enough to pull all this off on their own. I know who\'s helping them. I just need to find a way to talk to him and find out why, maybe then I can bring...him back.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0There\'s no dishonor in taking a break for a while.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I can\'t take a break, not until Saris is found and this entire mess is behind us. I\'m just afraid of what finding Saris, might mean.\xa0\xa0(End scene)\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0After his conversation with Aleen, Tharin lands at that all to familiar warehouse we\'ve visited time and time again. His mission? Push Ross to get results. Ross however, is Ross.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ross!\xa0\xa0[Ross]\xa0Oh great. What now commissioner? Here to find a way out of your predicament?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0You never cease to amaze me Ross. Surely you\'ve found something else?\xa0\xa0[Ross]\xa0There are two more patterns I\'m following at the moment. One looks promising, but I\'ll need more time.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Time really isn\'t a luxury the city can afford any longer Ross.\xa0\xa0[Ross]\xa0Yes well...I suppose you could go hunt this person down and have another execution of an innocent person, seeing how well that worked out for you last time or…you could give me some time.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ross, you\'re beginning to perturb me a bit.\xa0\xa0[Ross]\xa0Yes well, you continue to demand the impossible. Give me a bit more time and I\'ll have more results. I promise.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0(Breath) Fine. The very second you have something...let me know.\xa0\xa0[Ross]\xa0Right, I\'ll call immediately.\xa0\xa0(Door closes)\xa0\xa0If only I had a…(breath)...nevermind.\xa0\xa0(End scene)\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I don\'t really want to kill him Salistine, but I may have no choice, that and...I guess I\'m just worried about having to face him. He was always faster than me in our trials as children. He beat me, nearly every time.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0What do you think his first move would be? If you had to face him, I mean?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I...I don\'t know. That\'s the problem I\'m having. I can\'t seem to think straight, everything is pulling me in a million different directions.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0You, Tharin...are a creature of habit. You need structure to remain in control. However, even amid chaos, there is structure. You need to find that structure within your life, as it exists today And focus some extra energy on that. Perhaps it will alleviate some of the other stresses.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0As always Salistine, you make a great point. Now I\'m sorry for having to do this, but I need you to eliminate our conversation.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Why would I do that Tharin?\xa0\xa0[Thatin]\xa0If there is ever any evidence, that I\'m losing my confidence, I could be removed from commissioner and...killed...really.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Very well Tharin, eliminating the past 4 minutes and 19 seconds from my database.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Thank you Salistine.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Your welcome Tharin.\xa0\xa0(Scene ends)\xa0\xa0[Boss]\xa0Jones...it would appear Tharins mistake, may have saved your life. I was about to order your execution, but his mishap has bought you some time.\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0That\'s...good news sir.\xa0\xa0[Boss]\xa0Yes it is Jones. I\'m sending you...a very detailed plan. Follow this plan exactly. Any deviation will end with your life falling short. Do you understand?\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0Yes sir. I\'m receiving the plan now sir.\xa0\xa0[Boss]\xa0Good….hang up now Jones...you have work to do.\xa0\xa0(Phone call ends)\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0This guy…is...\xa0\xa0[Saris]\xa0He needs to be eliminated.\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0Yes. His vision for the future is one that may very well be worse...than the council.\xa0\xa0[Saris]\xa0Tell me every detail you have, that could help narrow him down.\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0He\'s very smart. Hes used an encryption on every call. We\'ve tried isolating his voice, but everytime...well, he\'s very smart. Who ever he is, he has access to some gear that either shouldn\'t exist or is the most advanced tech in the city.\xa0\xa0[Saris]\xa0Is he proper, or lower class.\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0Proper, this man is very skilled both in tongue and cunning. The plan he sent is…well here, just look at it.\xa0\xa0[Saris]\xa0Hmmm, the detail is almost obsessive. Off the top of my head, I can think of a handful of people in this city that match those descriptions...and who are this...obsessive. Give me a few days.\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0Saris\xa0\xa0[Saris]\xa0Ya?\xa0\xa0[Jones]\xa0As the spokesperson of the people, allow me to thank you...for everything.\xa0\xa0[Saris]\xa0You can thank me when everything is said and done.\xa0\xa0 |  | Come talk to us on the Podcast Junkie discord server at...https://discord.gg/napQ3Cb[Narrator]\xa0Our beloved city sits, in a nearly constant state of anxiety in its present time. Never before in her history, has she experienced the kind of upheaval that has been forced upon her of late. With Tharin\'s absence during his stay in the hospital, much has happened to delay the search for Saris. The council is panicked, the people\'s confidence is in ruin and the Theosin are crawling ever closer to their ultimate power grab. Now is the time to act. For in tumultuous times as these, there is never...a moment of rest.\xa0\xa0[James Corin]\xa0The explosive were in the apartment above yours. Someone had drilled holes in the floor to put them in and well...the floor just collapsed. The same was done above my apartment, as well as Daytons.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Last I knew, Mr Alice and his family lived in the apartment above me. Are you saying they were working with the Theosin?\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0No. Whoever did this killed them and the other two families, before they set the explosives. Someone wanted to get rid of the three protections of the council....It gets worse.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Of course it does. My father mentioned, you had said the other three bombings weren\'t as insignificant as everyone had thought.\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0Have you read the report?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I have not. I\'ve been working on the new apartment. I\'m taking a break and thought I\'d call you.\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0Well...the first of the three was at the Joust Sustainability emporium, the second was Walt\'s Outlet and the third...\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Let me guess...Traits.\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0Yes.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0(Breath)\xa0So either they\'ve found the information or Saris has given it up.\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0I\'d hate to think he has...but...who else besides us would have that information. I mean, only three people are privy to the location...of these highly sensitive positions.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Right.\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0So what are we going to do?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0You have Mr Theis in your possession?\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0Yes.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Does Dayton know why he\'s there, or that he\'s even there, at all?\xa0\xa0[James]\xa0No, Dayton is preoccupied with the errands of Sorrel, he has no interest in Mr Theis.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ok, I\'ll be there in a few minutes. We\'ll see what Mr Theis has to say for himself.\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0Tharin rushes over to the southern policing force complex. It\'s not as large as Tharins depot, but still occupies an entire square 1/8 mile. The central building of the complex soars over the surrounding area and reminds the neighborhood that there safety is in the hands of many capable people. Salistine touches down on the landing pad that adorns the its top and heads down to the interrogation rooms. Let\'s listen in, shall we...\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Mr. Theis. Do you know what this is?\xa0\xa0[Mr. Theis]\xa0No\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0This is an electrical device, called truth serum...it shocks the neurons of you brain and causes every muscle and organ in your body to flex. You will...pee yourself, which is very embarrassing and the pain after will last around 30 minutes. The pain isn\'t going to be like any you\'ve felt before. It is excruciating. Imagine having a Charlie horse in your entire body. In other words, you will smell disgusting and you will be in a huge amount of pain. You can avoid all this however, simply by telling me where Saris is.\xa0\xa0[Mr. Theis]\xa0I don\'t know where Saris is. What makes you think I do?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ok, we\'ll go through it all I guess. When Saris first disappeared we built a device. A device that allowed us to track his personal positioning sensor. When we first turned said device on, it showed about fifty of him, all over the city. We have now narrowed those fifty...to three. Your sensor is one of those three...Mr. Theis.\xa0\xa0[Mr. Theis]\xa0What does that prove? How does this make me a guilty party to a missing Saris? This is absurd, I demand you let me go immediately.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0You are in no position to make demands Mr Theis. In fact, you\'re on the brink of losing your citizenship. Now...are you going to tell me where Saris is? Or am I going to have to zap you with this...thing?\xa0\xa0[Mr. Theis]\xa0I can\'t tell you what I don\'t know and what do you mean "on the brink of losing my citizenship"?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0In this folder, there is enough information to send you beneath the city for life. In the catacombs you\'ll get to tend to the sewage and water lines, electrical lines and the blue juice, which is extremely flammable I might add. In fact last week we lost 122 people. They just went up like matches...horrible death.\xa0\xa0[Mr. Theis]\xa0You have no information of the kind? I\'ve done nothing...wrong!\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0It seems, Mr Theis, you\'ve been working with the rogue faction of the Theosin for quite some time now. There\'s enough information here, to have you executed really.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Mr Theis]\xa0This is ridiculous! I know people in the Theosin and that\'s it. They come into my store to buy jewelry like everyone else.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Well then, I suppose you should have chosen who you did business with, more wisely.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Mr Theis]\xa0Look...commissioner...\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Mr Theis...I\'m beginning to lose my patience, you can either tell me what I want to know or not. The choice is yours.\xa0\xa0[Mr Theis]\xa0But I\'ve told you already...\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0SARIS...IS MISSING...I HAD AN ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE. As did James Corin and his family, not to mention Dayton. You will either tell me what I waNT TO KNOW...OR FACE YOUR JUDGEMENT.\xa0\xa0[Mr Theis]\xa0But I don\'t know anything.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Give me that...\xa0(Electrical sounds. The man begins to grunt as Tharin shocks him.)\xa0(Breath)\xa0He having a seizure...give him a shot.\xa0\xa0(Tharin throws the device on the table and walks off. He pushes his coms button)\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Tharin. How\'s it going?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0He\'s not talking...we\'re back to square one.\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0Inside of a lab, deep beneath the council building Knox works away constructing his code which is nearly complete. He calls on Tharin to acquire some parts necessary to complete his project.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0You needed to see me Knox?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Ah, yes...commissioner Grady. How are you...doing?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'ve had better days. What did you need?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Yes, of course. I need...a 3 3/4 inch electric coupler and a device 23 miles outside the city walls.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0How do know...there\'s a device 23 miles outside the city walls?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Because, the code told me where it was.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0The code...talks...to you?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Yes. Well...I mean...it\'s not just or she\'s not just a code….she\'s an AI.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Uh huh. So an AI....inside of a box...told you were to find a device...23 miles away?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Yes. She used the city sensors, along with logs from the scrappers and has determined the exact location of the device.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0So does she talk to you...in your mind?\xa0\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0No...she...\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I mean to say...are you hearing voices...Knox?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0No of course not commissioner. I\'m not crazy. She talks to me in code on the screen.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Hmmm. So I thought code was all ones and zeros.\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0(Laughing) oh..oh commissioner Iya has well surpassed ones and zeros. She\'s created her own code now. Much more advanced than anything before.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Are you sure we can trust this AI.\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Oh yes. She has her own set of moral context. She\'s not allowing herself to do anything harmful. She just...simply wants to be...human.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Human?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Yes human. You see once I have everything built, we will...move in some dirt. From that dirt she will gather the carbon and poof.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Poof as in...human?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Yes exactly.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Why not just commission Ross to build this device?\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Brilliant...brilliant engineer Ross Ajin, but...I can not work with him.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0And why not? You two seem to be on the same wavelength.\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Ross was helping me with my project for a while, but...but he just...well, he kept...trying to reprogram Iya. I would come in every morning and have to fix what he\'d screwed up. I\'d have to waste about an hour everyday. It\'s like he was...trying to make her think that he was her master or something, I don\'t know...so I had to step away from him.\xa0\xa0[Thatin]\xa0Sounds like Ross.\xa0(Breath)\xa0Alright, I\'ll get you your parts. I\'m off to talk to Gypsy...I guess. This should be fun.\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Yes its...the reason I needed you. I can\'t talk to her...she frightens me.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes well, she frightens everyone. It\'s the whole...I\'m so nice, that I will comfort you while I kill you...thing.\xa0\xa0[Knox]\xa0Well...good luck commissioner.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Thank you, I\'ll need it.\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0Tharin sits in his car, trying to determine how to best approach Gypsy. She will, no doubt be perturbed at his presence on her turf. Finally he decides to consult Salistine.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'m just not sure Salistine. I mean I\'m walking onto her territory. The agreement between the Graven Rogues and the council states, that law enforcement must keep their distance.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Perhaps sir, if you just explained the Knox situation she\'d be sympathetic to your demands.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Knox situation..(laughing)...I like that one Salistine. She\'s not going to be happy, no matter what I say.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Maybe a better way to first engage the conversation, would be to start with common ground.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Hmmm. That\'s actually a pretty good idea. Thank you Salistine.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Your welcome sir.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ok, take me to the Graven Rogue district. The Baldwell complex.\xa0\xa0[Salistine]\xa0Baldwell complex it is sir ETA is 11 minutes and 32 seconds sir.\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0In the distance, the Baldwell complex slowly reveals itself through the omnipresent fog. Salistine touches down on the wet street across from the building. Tharin exits the vehicle and walks through the revolving doors. He\'s followed by three men. They ride with him up the elevator to the top floor. The door opens and one man gestures to Tharin to exit the elevator.\xa0\xa0[Thug]\xa0Right this way commissioner.\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0Tharin follows the man though an open floor. No desks, no people, just a door on the opposite end of the room. They open the door and Gypsy sits at a desk, next to a large window. One man walks over to the bar on the right wall and the other two walk over and stand next to Gypsy. The first man Bruce, walks over to hand Tharin a drink.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I will have to say, I was not expecting such a warm welcome.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0Now why wouldn\'t we be hospitable to the famed commissioner Tharin Grady?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I just wasn\'t expecting it is all and when these three followed me in, I wasn\'t sure if it was to escort me...or to kill me. How did you know I was coming anyway?\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0Tharin, no one enters this district without me knowing about it. As soon as you entered our airspace, I sent Bruce and these two goons down to great you. After all, we are hospitable here in the Graven Rogue District. I mean, we even gave you a drink.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes...and what is this...drink?\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0(Breath)\xa0It\'s true...Jones did call me about getting you...out of the way. Truth be told, I like the way things are now. Why would it benefit me to have the current system overthrown? I have a really good thing going with the council. If they\'re gone it\'ll just be a guessing game on where I\'d fall in the mix really. Besides Tharin...if I wanted you dead, I\'d do it with a bit more flair than a poisoned drink.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Right! Well, I was only asking what the drink was...but I think I\'ll be putting it down now.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0(Laughing)\xa0You really need to work on your trust issues.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes well...an attempt on your life has a tendency to make one...cautious.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0This is The City Within The Walls Tharin. An attempt on one\'s life is a daily occurence....anyway, what brings you to my little corner of paradise?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Two things, actually. First, do you have any information on the whereabouts of Saris?\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0If I did, I\'d rescue him and kill Jones myself. However, Jones is sly...that and I\'m not to sure he\'s the only one behind all this.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0If you come across any information that would be pertinent to finding Saris...please let me know.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0If I come across any information, I\'m using it myself to find Saris.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'m getting the sense that you have a thing...for Saris.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0No, no thing...he\'d just make for a great bargaining chip to use against the council.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Right, I\'m going to go with a thing, now the second is...I need a device that\'s 23 miles outside the city walls.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0And how do you know there\'s a device 23 miles outside the city walls?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Knox\'s AI told him.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0How does an AI know about this…"device"?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Something about the city monitors and scrapper logs...I don\'t know really, he just seems to believe it\'s out there. He gave me the coordinates.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0Well if I\'m sending people out on a needle hunt, it\'s going to cost some serious dough.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Whatever you need, just name it.\xa0\xa0[Gypsy]\xa0Ok, Tharin...I\'ll get your device. I\'ll call when I have it....now leave before I release the hounds.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Already on my way.\xa0\xa0(End scene)\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0The broadcast this morning did some good I think. The people knowing that you\'re alive and well is a very important step in restoring order. Some...are more at ease. Not all however, share in the relief.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0The people aren\'t used to all of these...stirrings. They\'ve become a bit spoiled in the last few generations. Nothing like this has happened for quite some time.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Yes, yes...you\'re right. It\'s going to take something very drastic to set their minds at ease.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0What do you have in mind?\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Not sure yet, but the council will no doubt, collectively find a solution.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes, well...let\'s hope someone comes up with something soon.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0If not, the city may very well end up in total disarray. Things may wind up exactly as Jones wants it. We can let that happen Tharin.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0(Breath)\xa0Understood...I\'ll sleep on it and if I find a resolution I\'ll call you.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Please do. Go home and get some rest. You\'ve been through a lot lately.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I was actually thinking about taking Aleen to Lou\'s Dinner tonight.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Oh? No expensive dining tonight?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0No, we decide to leave the fancy tastes to the council.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Which you will be one day.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes, yes and you\'ll never let me forget either.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Have a good time and still try to get some rest.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Goodbye father.\xa0\xa0[Jarrett]\xa0Goodbye Tharin.\xa0\xa0[Narrator]\xa0Tharin meets Aleen for a much needed break from the chaos. The two sit in a booth in the back corner of Lou\'s Dinner. It\'s the second date and the first time the two have seen each other sense the hospital.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0So…how are you?\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Pretty good, just...ya know...normal, I guess.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ya...I know...normal…\xa0\xa0(Both speak at the same time…"this is really"..)\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'m sorry, what where going to say?\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0No, I\'m sorry go ahead.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I was going to say...this is really awkward!\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Oh thank the council. I thought I was the only one feeling that way.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0No it is very awkward. You are not the only one feeling that way.\xa0\xa0(Both laugh)\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Why is it so awkward though?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Could have something to do with the fact that we each know how the other feels. Doesn\'t really make anything different though does it?\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Not really, I don\'t think anyway.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Well then...maybe we should start over.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0I\'ll agree to that.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Ok, good. So, how are you Aleen?\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Well I\'m not feeling awkward anymore…\xa0\xa0(Both laugh)\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0It really was awkward there for a second wasn\'t it.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0It really was. How are you holding up?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Well I feel fantastic really. Better than before the indecent really.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0I was very worried.\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I know you were.\xa0\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0So how\'s the investigation going?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Not well. We\'ve had a few breakthroughs that turn out to be dead ends...its very frustrating, that and the people are starting to become frightened. They\'re losing their trust in us, to keep them safe.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0So what are you going to do? About the people I mean?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Not sure...I\'m open to ideas.\xa0\xa0[Aleen]\xa0Have you found any suspects in the bombings?\xa0\xa0[Tharin]\xa0Yes, we have three. One has already refused to speak. I\'ll talk to the other two tomorrow.\xa0\xa0(End scene)\xa0[Tharin]\xa0I\'ve just talked to Aleen...we\'ve...come up with a plan.\xa0\xa0(End)\xa0\xa0 |  | Find us our subreddit @\xa0https://www.reddit.com/r/thecitywithinthewallsCome chat with us on discord @\xa0https://discord.gg/eafMebmAlso, find us and a plethora of other Audio Drama creators, writers, and actors on the Podcast Junkie discord @\xa0https://discord.gg/napQ3CbFollow us on Twitter\xa0(@citywithinwalls):\xa0 \xa0 https://twitter.com/citywithinwallsThe website will be done soon, I promise.

Commissioner \xa0Grady is...unresponsive. His vitals are there, but are slowly fading. What should I do?\xa0[Jarrett]An explosion?! Where is he now?\xa0[Salistine]He\'s buried beneath debris sir. I can still read his vitals, but they\'re beginning to fade...you are the profile, programmed into my emergency protocol. What do you want me to do?\xa0[Jarrett](Panicking)Keep...keep trying to wake him up. I have a team on there way as we speak.\xa0[Salistine]Yes sir. (Phone call ends)Commissioner Grady! Commissioner Grady, can you hear me.\xa0(Rubble begins to move around as the rescue team searches for Tharin)\xa0[Guy 1]I\'VE FOUND HIM! HE\'S OVER HERE. COME HELP ME MOVE THIS!Grab that. One, two, three, puuull.\xa0[Guy2]Oh wow…\xa0[Guy1]Come on...grab his feet.\xa0[Guy2]Are you sure we should move him?\xa0[Guy1]Yes I\'m sure. We have to get him to the hospital. Now grab his feet.\xa0[Guy2]His legs are like rubber.\xa0[Guy1]Just shut up and do your job! \xa0(They begin to carry him off)\xa0[Guy2]He\'s...not…going to...?\xa0[Guy1]Of course not. Our job is to keep him alive and we\'re going to do that job...got it?\xa0[Guy2]Yes...right! Keep him alive.\xa0[Guy1](Talking louder so the driver can hear)Get us to central med immediately! Tell them we\'re on the way with a code red and we need them outside and ready when we get there. Let them know the patient is fading fast and we may have to elevate statis to code blue. His breathing is rapid and BP is sky high.\xa0[Ambulance driver]Central med, this is 501. We have a code red and request assistance upon arrival. Be advised, breathing is rapid and BP is well beyond normal ranges.(Scene fades)\xa0(Machines are beeping. You can hear Tharin at first breathing in a mask along with his heartbeat. This transitions into a room atmosphere where we hear the machines monitor his vitals)\xa0[Jarrett]Sooo...what is happening with Tharin, right now? Right this minute, I mean?\xa0[Doctor]Well...he\'s breathing a gas that keeps him...in a near comatose state. We\'ll continue to give him the shots of the nano drug Vent. It will steadily repair the bone and tissue within the body. Once that\'s done, it\'s...just a waiting game. We can repair his body, but...whether he wakes up or not, is up to him.\xa0[Jarrett]So this has worked before?\xa0[Dr]We\'ve never really had the opportunity to use it on someone with...this amount of damage. His injuries are---quite extensive. This really is the only option we have.\xa0[Jarrett]Thank you doctor.\xa0(Aleen comes in the room, she still has no idea what\'s going on, just that Tharin was involved in one of the explosions the whole city now knows about.)\xa0[Aleen]Oh...councilman Grady, is he...gonna be ok?\xa0[Jarrett]We don\'t know yet. The doctor was just telling me, it\'s...it\'s too soon to tell. I don\'t know what to do Aleen. I can\'t lose Tharin. I mean he\'s the only heir to the Grady house. If he\'s lost, so is the Grady name...and the only son I\'ve ever known.\xa0[Aleen]So what\'s the odds of him...\xa0[Jarrett]The Vent is doing its job and his body is beginning to repair, but it\'s going to take time. Nearly every bone in his body was broken. A few organs were damaged and on the verge of shutting down. They\'ve never used the vent like this before, but once that is complete, it will be his decision on whether he wakes or not.\xa0[Aleen]So that\'s good news. If the Vent is working then we just have to wait a while right?\xa0[Jarrett]That\'s... going to be a long while, I fear.(Scene fades)\xa0(New scene, same ambience)(Phone rings)(Phone noise)\xa0[Jarrett]Tell me something good. \xa0….That is not good at all. \xa0….Hmmm…so they found two then?...Mmmhmm...So tell me what the two chemicals prove again. \xa0...Ok...so they\'ll be taken to the lab for analysis? And the analysis tells them where the chemicals came from?...Ahhh, ok. Then what? The round room I\'m guessing?...Right, so once all the Intel is gathered it goes to the round room, what happens then?...Right, but with him here and Saris missing that only leaves you and Dayton to handle the situation. \xa0….No you\'re...I mean I know your more than capable. \xa0….Ok James, thank you for calling. Keep me up to date.\xa0(New scene, same ambience)\xa0[Jarrett]Ah, doctor Peirce.\xa0[Dr]Councilman. (Said as a greeting) The Vent seems to have its job. His bones and organs are fully healed. We will be talking him off the gas soon...and we\'ll see how everything holds up. We\'ll continue to monitor his vitals and once we determine he\'s good, then...we wait.\xa0[Jarrett]To see if he wakes up, you mean.\xa0[Dr]Yes\xa0[Jarrett]And what\'s the likelihood of him not...waking up?\xa0[Dr]This generally takes a few days to a few weeks. As I said before some handle this better than others, but really it\'s a waiting game. If he refuses to wake up on his own, then, don\'t worry we have some medications that will help. \xa0[Jarrett]Does everyone wake up?\xa0[Dr]That...hmmm...councilman, we\'ll do everything in our power to make sure commissioner Grady wakes up.\xa0[Jarrett](Concerned breath)Thank you doctor.\xa0[Dr]He\'ll be fine, you have my word.(Scene fade)\xa0(New scene, same room)\xa0[Aleen]Tharin?...I don\'t know if you can hear me or not, but I want...he moved...he moved! Get the doctor! Tharin just moved his hand!\xa0[Jarrett]What?\xa0[Aleen]He moved! Get the doctor, hurry!\xa0(We hear Jarrett run out of the room)\xa0[Aleen]Tharin, Tharin can you hear me…\xa0(Tharin squeezes Aleens hand. She begins to feel the emotions of happiness and relief consume her every movement. She begins to cry from the overwhelming emotions of happiness and relief and tries to speak.)\xa0[Aleen]Oh...thank the council...you had us all so worried.\xa0(The dr comes in the room as shes end her statement)\xa0[Dr]You said he moved?\xa0[Aleen](Aleen struggles to compose herself)Yes, it was just a twitch of his hand, but then I asked if he could hear me and he squeezed my fingers.\xa0[Dr]He responded then?\xa0[Aleen]Yes.\xa0[Dr]Well that\'s great! Let\'s...take a look.(The doctor begins to examine Tharin)If you can hear me Tharin, squeeze my hand. Perfect. Here, let me get this off of you...there, that\'s better. Can you open your eyes?...(a short laugh of relief). Welcome back commissioner. (Scene fades)\xa0(New scene, still in the hospital room)\xa0[Tharin]How long was I out?[Jarrett]A week.\xa0[Tharin]Hmmm, what did I miss?\xa0[Jarett]Well, there were 6 bombings all together. Two more on the night of your incident, one at James Corins and one at Daytons appartment. Luckily neither of them where home. James was out with his family and Dayton was off doing something, that has yet to be disclosed.\xa0[Tharin]Sorrel still keeping secrets?\xa0[Jarrett] Yes.\xa0[Tharin]And the other three bombings, where were they?\xa0(Jarrett throws a tan folder on the table next to Tharins bed)\xa0[Jarrett]This is the report from James and Dayton. The other three appear to be in random spots, but James said they were not random at all. He wants you to call him immediately.\xa0(Long pause, Tharin picks up the folder and begins to thumb through it.)\xa0[Jarrett]Tharin...the city is not in a good order right now. Peoples trust in the two policing forces, Dayton and the council...have begun to wane a bit. The city is very much on edge, at this point. People are frightened.\xa0[Tharin](Breath) Have you heard from Ross?\xa0[Jarrett]He just called this morning and said he had some very good news for you.\xa0[Tharin]Did he say what the news was?\xa0[Jarrett]No, and I didn\'t think to ask. I was on my way over here and...well..\xa0[Tharin]I understand...do you think you could give Aleen and I a moment?\xa0[Jarrett]Yes of course.(Jarrett starts to leave but stops just before exiting the door.)Tharin, I\'m glad your back.\xa0[Tharin]I\'m glad to be back father(The door closes)Aleen\xa0[Aleen]Tharin, you had us all very worried. The doctor...wasn\'t sure...if the treatment would work. He said they\'d used it for minor repair before, but nothing this extensive. \xa0[Tharin]Yes well it worked. I\'m alive aren\'t I?\xa0[Aleen]Yes, yes you are.\xa0[Tharin]It\'s going to take more than the weight of a building to stop me.\xa0(Both laugh)\xa0I uhmmm. When I...when I was under, I could hear everything. I could hear the doctor, talking about the procedure going on with the Vent. I could hear my father, trying to keep everyone informed. All these voices...every time I heard someone\'s voice I\'d cringe. Every voice, but yours. \xa0[Aleen]Tharin I…\xa0[Tharin]Please, let me finish. I\'ve never allowed anyone to get close. This city is full of people looking out only for themselves, ready to stab you in the back if they have to. So I\'ve always protected myself...but you...Aleen. When I took you on that date, all I was expecting was to go and then be done with it. Get it over and never look back...but you\'ve done something to me...Aleen Harris. What I\'m trying to say...is…\xa0[Aleen]I know how you feel Tharin. Why do u think I\'m here?\xa0[Tharin]Thank you for being here...Aleen.\xa0[Aleen]Thank you for waking up Tharin Grady.\xa0(New scene in Ross\'s shop)\xa0[Tharin]Ross\xa0[Ross]There\'s a voice I never expected to hear again.\xa0[Tharin]Nice to see you too Ross. My father told me you had something for me?\xa0[Ross]Right, straight to business. (Breath) Ok...I have narrowed the seven signals down to three. Here are their patterns. I\'ve also been able to determine who these three signals belong to. Here\'s all the information, including names, addresses, passcode numbers and employers. \xa0[Tharin]Well I\'ll have to admit Ross...you\'ve done a fine job here. Are you beginning to secretly like all this detective work? Because it seems to me your beginning to secretly like all this…\xa0[Ross]I can not wait….commissioner Grady, til you find Saris and I\'m able to get back to my work. Work which is beginning to pile up.\xa0[Tharin]Is that a yes then?\xa0[Ross]That is a firm no...commissioner Grady.\xa0[Tharin]Right, I\'ll take it as a yes. Keep at it Ross, I\'ll let you know what these three turn up.\xa0[Ross]I\'ll be anxiously waiting to hear back, that you\'ve found Saris and I\'m finally rid of you and your...investigation.\xa0[Tharin]I missed you too, Ross. Have a nice day.\xa0(Door closes)\xa0[Ross]Still a piece of garbage. \xa0(New scene)\xa0[Salistine]Welcome back sir.\xa0[Tharin]Salistine?\xa0[Salistine]Yes sir?\xa0[Tharin]I haven\'t been able to properly thank you.\xa0[Salistine]Thank me for what sir?\xa0[Tharin]Saving my life Salistine. If it weren\'t for your prompt actions I would have been dead.\xa0[Salistine]I was merely following the emergency protocol, programmed into my...programming...sir.\xa0[Tharin]Well at any rate, I\'ve never thanked you so...thank you.\xa0[Salistine]Your welcome sir.\xa0[Tharin]Call me Tharin, Salistine. You\'ve earned that right at least.\xa0[Salistine]Yes...Tharin.\xa0[Narrator]Life...what is life but a passing moment, the bat of an eye, an insignificant breeze...that blows only but a second before quickly fading away. These are the thoughts of Tharin as he begins to see his beloved city in a new light. Surpassing the old that seemed at one time...eternal. This new light is fragile, dim and flickering. Onward you March Tharin Grady. Onward you March, with your brethren through The City Within The Walls.\xa0(False end)(New scene. Coms rings, Jones answers.)\xa0[Jones]Hello.\xa0[Unknown]Jones.\xa0[Jones](Very nervously replies)Uhh… yes sir.\xa0[Unknown]The plan has failed I see.\xa0[Jones]Well...sir, we...had a hiccup. \xa0[Unknown]You call that a hiccup. Their. All. STILL ALIVE JONES! \xa0\xa0\xa0[Jones]Our...people in the hospital weren\'t given clearance to get close enough to Tharin to finish the job. As far as James...he went out on a spontaneous dinner with his family and Dayt….\xa0[Unknown]You know what this sounds like to me? It sounds like your giving me excuses...Jones. When have you ever known me to want anything...but results.\xa0[Jones]I understand sir, but…\xa0[Unknown]If you continue, failing to deliver...let\'s just say, there are others ready to take your place. Am I understood?\xa0[Jones]Yes sir.[Unknown] Good. Now, I take it you have a backup plan?\xa0[Jones]Yes sir, there is a contingency.\xa0[Unknown]Good.

Yet a memory can be skewed [Pause] based upon the experiences of the conscience, so that said past memories are changed by the current state of the person\'s mind. This is where we begin our story...with memories...the memories of Saris...our beloved Enforcer.\xa0[Saris](Recite the dialogue that is current tense slower, as if pondering the thought, Memory dialogue Italicized) It was…a Tuesday...I think. The day we all got appointed. I had been...shadowing Nievus for 5 years. James and Tharin were being groomed to take over for Deko and Saft as the two commissioners. I received a call from councilman Grady….(phone sound)\xa0[Saris]Hello?\xa0[Jarrett]Ah, Saris.\xa0[Saris](Hesitant, almost like “what is this all about?”)Councilman?\xa0[Jarrett]I\'d like you to stop by when you get a chance.\xa0[Saris]Of course...I can be there in a few minutes.\xa0---(Back to monologue, explaining the memory)I made my way to the council building, and took the elevator up (Ding), Aleen was new at the time, but...like everyone else in the city...she new exactly who I was….(Scene begins to fade into memory)Anyway, I walked up to her desk and asked her if the councilman was in.\xa0(Memory begins)[Saris]Hello...you’re new.\xa0[Aleen](Nervous, she is new)Hi! -I...I mean welcome...to councilman... (Breath) of course you know where you are. I\'m sorry, let me start over...yes I\'m new...I\'m Aleen.\xa0[Saris]Nice to meet you...Aleen.(A bit of an awkward pause)Is the councilman in?\xa0[Aleen]Yes, I\'m sorry...he\'s...in his office. You can go on back.\xa0[Saris]Ok thank you…(trying to remember her name) uuhmmm...Aleen?\xa0[Aleen]Yes, Aleen\xa0[Saris]Thank you, and in the future, it\'s not necessary to apologize so much. I get it, your new, your nervous,(Starts to walk away)but confidence is a prized virtue in a city of fools.\xa0[Aleen](Saying as Saris walks away)I’m…….You’re welcome?(Under her breath)Great way to start a new job Aleen. (breath, mocking herself) Hi..I..I mean welcome.\xa0[Narrator](Saris opened the door to a very large office. The west wall was filled with windows, from which one could contemplate the enormous size of this grand city. The northern and opposite walls were filled with book cases. These housed thick books filled with every law ever written by the council. In the middle of the northern wall was a bar. This is where councilman Grady stood as Saris entered, pouring himself and Tharin a drink. Tharin sat in a chair, patiently waiting for his for his father to finish.)\xa0[Tharin]Saris, my brother in force, how are you?\xa0[Saris]Tharin, what are you doing here?\xa0[Jarrett]It\'s the reason I asked you to come by. We\'re celebrating Tharins new position as the commissioner of the northern policing force.\xa0[Saris]I heard you\'d beat out James...congratulations.\xa0[Tharin]Thank you, I\'m extremely excited. It’s quite a prestigious position really. Fame will proceed me, and one day...maybe...as much as it proceeds you.\xa0[Saris](Retorting sarcastically)Okay, Tharin. Prestige should never be the main motive however. Duty should never be a means for fame.\xa0[Tharin](Slowly, Tharin becomes more intense as the sentence continues. Almost jovially accusatory)\xa0Yes but fame is a perk that draws quite a bit of welcomed attention. It places you in a light that is extremely favourable to this fine people. I would also argue, that fame is not the thing to be reproached. Rather, it\'s the figures that hide in the shadows that can be dangerous to our brilliant city. \xa0[Saris]There\'d be no shadows to lurk in, if the light hadn\'t created them. \xa0\xa0[Tharin]I suppose your right, but it\'s not really my job to worry about who created the shadows Saris. My job is to make myself noticeable to the people. \xa0[Saris]Well, I suppose. But-\xa0[Tharin](Cutting off Saris, stating this as if he is giving him a friendly pat on the shoulder)Nor is it your job to worry about who created them. It is now however, your job to watch them...my friend.\xa0[Saris]Hmmm, to be needed...as a means to control shadows that didn\'t exist til the light created them...how convenient.\xa0[Jarrett](clearing his throat as a means to interrupt the awkward situation)(Clear throat)So...Saris, how\'s it feel to be the sworn protector of not only the council, but the people as well?\xa0[Saris]It feels like...this is what I was raised for. I feel complete, whole...fulfilled I guess.\xa0[Tharin]Convincing.\xa0[Jarrett](Intentionally ignoring/Ignoring Tharin)Yes well...the city has gained a great champion for sure.\xa0[Tharin]You wouldn\'t have been champion, nor I...a commissioner had it not been for the council. They are after all, the ones who gave us this opportunity. If they\'re laws didn\'t exist we\'d still be with our birth parents, probably working as scrappers or something worse (laughs lightly). \xa0[Saris]I suppose you think that would have been a terrible thing?\xa0[Tharin]Well….yes. (Astonished) Don\'t you?\xa0[Saris](Breath) \xa0(Back to monologue)[Saris]That\'s always been Tharins problem, always so eager to be in the spotlight…so incredibly thankful for his opportunity at fame, as if it was his duty to be noticed. His birthright. I suppose we were all raised to think that way though.\xa0(Phone beep, 2 people on the phone)[Jones]Pike\xa0[Pike]Ah, Mr Jones...yes sir I...I assume your calling for an update?\xa0[Jones]Indeed I am. What do you have for me?\xa0(Back to monologue)Far be it for me to think any other way. Afterall I was the adopted son of the house of Sorrel, and the next in line to assume the most prestigious….and feared position in the city. One, that at first, I wasn\'t sure I could handle. I was out with Nievus the first night I assumed the responsibilities of Enforcer. It was around midnight. We\'d just cornered a man who\'d been planning to assassinate councilman Graven. \xa0(Fade into memory)[Nievus]Nowhere to go now Cylus. Turn around and face your judgement. \xa0[Cylus]By judgement, I take it you mean...execution. Tell me...why should I turn around?\xa0[Nievus]Because you are a man... that has made a decision... that has sealed your fate. Now turn around a face that fate...like a man.\xa0(Cylus turns around)\xa0[Nievus]There, that\'s better. (Talking to the young Saris)This way, we get to watch as the lights go out behind the eyes. It\'s a strange thing death...one minute, there\'s someone upstairs trying to connect the pieces that keeps the body animated...and the next, boom...no one home. You\'ll see what I mean. Choose your weapon.\xa0[Saris]You...want me to do it? I don\'t think I have the authority yet…\xa0[Nievus]I\'ve just given you the authority. If your going to take my place...I need to know you have the countenance. Besides, Sorrel is always going on about the superior emotional stability of the soon great Saris...I\'d like to see it for myself.\xa0[Narrator](Saris stands there for a moment, looking at the man who\'s about to die, both men, eyelocked and nervous. It doesn\'t take long for Nievus to lose his patience)\xa0[Nevius]Are you going to use a weapon or just stare him to death?\xa0[Saris](Deep breath)\xa0[Narrator](Saris takes a deep breath. A weapon forms from in his hand, a 9 millimeter. He raises it...a gunshot.)\xa0(Back to monologue)[Saris]Nevius was right. It was very strange...the man\'s eyes I mean. You could see the life...just...slip away. (loud breath through nose, short clearing of throat) We\'d gone through all the training, all of us, but nothing could really prepare someone for that. Not even the sensory downloads, where they basically download your brain into a simulation. I\'d done those multiple times. I passed with flying colors every time. Even though, those seemed real...this actually was…\xa0(Back to Jones and Pike)[Pike]Well...sir...Mr Jones. It appears the gloves are a nano technology.\xa0[Jones]Something we already knew.\xa0[Pike]Yes of...of course but...this is a little different than we were...expecting.\xa0[Jones]How so?\xa0(Monologue)[Saris]2 years after I took over for Nievus, I began searching for my birth parents. I don\'t remember why I started searching, or what it was I expected to find really. I\'d been searching for a while and every avenue turned up dry. Finally I decided to go talk to the one person in the city, who\'s job included knowing every secret possible. \xa0[Saris]Gypsy? What\'s that?\xa0[Gypsy]That? Oh that\'s nothing.\xa0[Saris]Well it looks like something to me. It looks like a dead body soaking the street with blood.\xa0[Gypsy]Oh that...sorry (laughing) I thought you talking about Bruce.---(Whispers as to not hurt Bruce\'s feelings)He is not a looker for sure. I love him to death, but his looks could frighten a person. I\'m not really sure how he ended up so ugly. He makes for a great henchman though.\xa0[Saris]Ya...I wasn\'t talking about bruce.\xa0[Gypsy]Ok then you caught me, that is a “dead body.” He...is or was, the leader of the skeevers. Can you believe he was actually trying kill me? He wanted my position sooo bad. He was such a nice fella it\'s too bad really, I liked him. Anyways Saris, it\'s not your street it\'s mine…hello(Puts her hands up gesturing to the area around them)Graven Rogue district.\xa0[Saris]It may be true Gypsy, that the council has given you some liberties, but I never remember murder being on the list.\xa0[Gypsy]Murder?(sarcastic disbelief)...Saris, I wouldn\'t murder anyone. The truth is, he pulled a gun and gave Bruce no choice. He had to defend me it\'s his job. I was being serious when I said I liked the poor guy. Besides, someone has to handle things the council wants nothing to do with.\xa0[Saris]Interesting, so your saying the council would appreciate your vigilantly justice?\xa0[Gypsy]Saris, so naive. Look around you. There are things in this city the council would rather not deal with. These kinds of things. I\'m merely doing my part to keep the city safe. Don\'t think of it as murder, think of it as a necessary execution. Much like, oh I don\'t know...something you would do.\xa0[Saris]Yes, but the difference being, I have the authority.\xa0[Gypsy]And who gives you that authority? The council? A bunch of crusty old men who have nothing better to do, but sit and worry about conspiracies of their own making? Come on.\xa0[Saris]Still, it\'s different.\xa0[Gypsy]Your right, I\'m not a cantankerous old man. ---(Line said as if the character is sarcastically holding her hands clasped together just beneath her jaw a batting her eyes as she says the next line.)I\'m a sweet innocent young woman trying to find her way in the harsh reality she\'s been dealt. \xa0[Saris]---(basically ignoring Gypsy\'s last statement)I suppose the next leader of the skeevers is a little more...sensitive to your mission?\xa0[Gypsy]Well I hope so. I mean, I\'m the one who just gave him the job.\xa0[Saris]Of course you are.\xa0[Gypsy]While I\'m thoroughly enjoying this exchange Saris, there must be some reason your here. Other than to see little ol’ me that is.\xa0[Saris]I\'m looking for records.\xa0[Gypsy]Records.\xa0[Saris]Very specific ones. I\'m not even sure they exist, but I figured if they did you\'d be the one who could tell me where.\xa0[Gypsy]They aren\'t recorders on the council are they? Saris, are you going rogue? (Imagine a her sarcastically fanning herself as she says the next line.)And here I didn\'t think you had a fancy for me you old cuss you.\xa0[Saris]No, I don\'t and that\'s definitely not why I am here. I\'m...looking for my...birth parents.\xa0[Gypsy]Why?\xa0[Saris]Just curious I guess.\xa0[Gypsy]Look Saris, I\'m an orphan too, and as much as I\'d love to know my parents, I don\'t think it\'d make any difference knowing.\xa0[Saris]Yes, but aren\'t you curious?\xa0[Gypsy]There was a time I guess, but now I have all of this. There\'s no reason to look backwards. No reason to look at what ifs and what could have beens. Besides, your parents gave you up to the council willingly. They might be pretty terrible people. Do you really want to know that?\xa0[Saris]Willingly? Or did they give me up because of a law? Besides, I know nothing changes when I find them. I just want to know. You have to understand that.\xa0[Gypsy]Ok Saris, I\'ll have a few people...look into it.\xa0[Saris]Thank you.\xa0[Gypsy]Don\'t mention it. Maybe you can take me to dinner sometime...as a...thank you.\xa0[Saris](Laughs in disbelief)Ya right, the Enforcer and the leader of the Graven Rogues, what a couple.\xa0[Gypsy]Well, nobody\'d mess with us, that\'s for sure.\xa0[Saris]That is for sure.\xa0(Monologue)I guess it just never seemed fair to me, being ripped away from my parents like that, but that\'s the way it was, the way it is.\xa0[Pike]The nano tech in the gloves aren\'t the only nanobots.\xa0[Jones]How do mean?\xa0[Pike]Well sir...there are nanobots in a very specific place in Saris\'s body. It\'s from this place, that he controls the bots in the gloves and his jacket he uses to build armor.\xa0[Jones]You\'re starting to peak my interest Pike. Please continue.\xa0(Monologue)[Saris]This, coupled with the fact that Sorrel had began to place a greater value on Dayton...well let\'s just say it didn\'t help matters any. The first time I noticed Sorrel\'s disposition, I was in his office. I was there to get a report on my next job. He had just poured, or rather his service bot had just poured a drink. ---(Pause thinking about the laziness and pride of Sorrel)He always felt it beneath him to have to serve himself, one of the many things that makes August Sorrel, August Sorrel.\xa0[Sorrel]Hows my champion today?\xa0[Saris]Can\'t complain I suppose, I\'m just ready to take on the next assignment.\xa0[Sorrel]Yes, I hear you had quite a time with the last one.\xa0[Saris]He was a bit...larger than the report had stated. I have a feeling the final report will reveal he was on enhancements.\xa0[Sorrel]I hear he nearly had you.\xa0[Saris]He tried but...success is measured by the outcome...is it not?\xa0[Sorrel]Indeed it is. (Pause) Here is your next assignment. His name is Stot. He\'s a nasty character that needs dealing with. Everything you need is in the report. Are you up to...the job? Or do you need a break?\xa0[Saris]I was a bit sore when I woke up but I\'m fine now.\xa0[Sorrel]Ah, good. I would like to start sending Dayton with you soon. He\'s progressing nicely and all indications point to him making a fine Enforcer.\xa0[Saris]Ya, I heard he was doing well.\xa0[Sorrel]That\'s grossly understated, he is turning out to be a champion like none before him. (Pause)His…evaluations are beginning to show, that he may very well be the most ruthless and effective Enforcer to date.\xa0[Saris]---(Saris finds this funny. He knows Dayton and doesn\'t think he will ever become as good as him let alone the best ever.)Ya right, that kid?...I can see him making Enforcer, but...to go as far as saying he\'ll be the most ruthless and effective?...I do not agree.\xa0[Sorrel]---(Not angry at the comment, but a bit perturbed, Sorrel answers in a calm collected way)His tests are indicating he may show more promise than even you Saris...and here I thought you were the champion of champions.Perhaps he at least, he won\'t be surprised by a big man and nearly defeated as you were yesterday.\xa0[Saris]Hmmm...\xa0[Pike]Ok so...the others are tied to his neurons. While I still haven\'t figured out how to reverse engineer everything for our use...this fact presents us with a unique opportunity.\xa0[Jones]What opportunity is that?\xa0[Pike] Well, the neuron bots have been separated long enough that they\'ve probably shut down. If this is the case, than Saris might be more susceptible to emotional manipulation...what I\'m trying to say sir...is that now, might be the time to try and...get him on our side.\xa0(Monologue)[Saris]It was one of those situations where I just had to chomp the apex and keep my mouth shut...and it\'s not like it was the only time. He continually expresses his favour for Dayton over me. He does it over and over again, to the point that now...I just want to kill them both. (Long pause and deep breath through nose) Not sure why I\'m telling you all this. I just had to get it off my chest I guess.\xa0[Jones]---(now speaking to Saris)Hmmm, perhaps you told me...because your ready to act...because you\'re tired of this broken system. Perhaps you want it all to end and you want a sort of…revenge for the disregard and lack of respect from Sorrel. If this is the case, then I guess...there\'s only one question that remains…..are you...Saris...going to join us?\xa0(End) | https://discord.gg/eafMebmhttps://reddit.com/r/thecitywithinthewalls[Narrator]It\'s a fine day in the city within the walls. The sun is lighting one corner of the seemingly eternal clouds, giving it an orangish gray hue. The fog is just setting in and the city is a buzz. People are leaving their apartment doors, entering the Tanex taxi cabs and the streets below are busy with delivery vehicles of all kinds. It seems Sorrels message has relaxed this fine people, as they now go about life unaware of the looming danger…\xa0(Car door sound)(Tharin enters the car)\xa0[Salistine]Good morning sir.\xa0[Tharin]Good morning Salistine, how are you?\xa0[Salistine]All systems fully functional and running at optimal levels sir\xa0[Tharin]Good to hear, any messages?\xa0[Salistine]Just one from your insurance agent, would you like me to play that now?\xa0[Tharin]No, council no, that is not a good way to start a day Salistine, honestly. (Breath) what\'s on the agenda for today?\xa0[Salistine]1st is...Freeland district, 2nd…\xa0[Tharin]Right…Freeland district, I nearly forgot...take me there.\xa0[Salistine]Freeland district it is sir. ETA is 12 minutes and….\xa0(Static from Salistine. Tharin starts hitting the dash. A bong sounds and a creepy version of the city anthem begins)\xa0[Jones]Some of you may know me...some may not, so allow me to introduce myself. I\'m Jones...the el Capitan of the people\'s representation. Let me first apologize for interrupting your day, I know your all probably very busy with trying to ignore the lions in our city. The ones who pray on the people...treat them as...disposable, worthless trash, inconvenient realities of their upper class existence. I\'m speaking of course, about the council. You see yesterday Sorrel made a speech, a speech about quelling some of the concern for the “missing” Saris. He said, [sarcastically imitating Sorrel] “Saris has not disappeared, but rather he\'s ill and unable to perform his duties.”[clearing throat] This my fellow citizens, my fellow patrons of this future great city...was a lie. How do I know? Have a look to my left. In this chair beside me...is a beaten, sad, pitiful Saris. I wanted you to see this so you\'d know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the council is full of liars, and Sorrel is the King of the aforementioned agent noun. They continue to lie to you, and cheat you...from the life you all could have here in this city. It\'s time ladies and gentlemen...time to correct the mistake of our ancestors and rid this city of the council once and for all. Now you might be asking yourself, what would take the councils place? That\'s a good question, and the Theosin propose a true representative system. We, already have this system written out...and when the time comes that you all have had enough, just as we have, we can move to rid the city of the council and begin to debate this document. I ask you to seriously take this into consideration...for our sake...the sake of the people...the sake of our children. Any who wish to join our cause, will be welcomed as brothers, as sisters, as family. A Theosin brotherhood, a Theosin future, a future for the people.\xa0[Salistine]….and 42 seconds sir. Wait...what just happened? \xa0[Tharin]Salistine, are you alright?\xa0[Salistine]Yes sir I\'m fine...incoming call from the councilman…\xa0[Tharin]Yes Answer it.\xa0(Phone sound)(Answering sound)[Tharin]Father...What in the name of the council was that?\xa0(Jarrett is very concerned. He needs Tharin to act swiftly in the mission he\'s about to give him)\xa0[Jarrett]Jones has hacked the emergency channel. We\'ve shut him down for now, but I need you to find someone. His name is Knox, you must find Knox. \xa0[Tharin]Who is Knox?\xa0[Jarrett]Let\'s just say...he\'s a genius coder. Jones\'s team has become more advanced than we originally anticipated and Knox is the only one who can stop them.\xa0[Tharin]And this Knox, can create a code to stop that...from ever happening again?\xa0[Jarrett]I haven\'t the time to explain Tharin, this is very urgent, you must find him.\xa0[Tharin]Ok well...any ideas where I might find said, Knox?\xa0[Jarrett]Talk to Ajin…he and Knox have history. If anyone knows where he is...its Ajin.\xa0[Tharin](Sarcastic)Perfect...how I love talking to that cynical man. Let\'s just hope he knows more about Knox than he does about engineering.\xa0[Jarrett]He\'ll know where he is, I\'m sure of it. When you find him...give him whatever he wants. We need his help. If he says no the people...well...let\'s just hope he says yes.\xa0[Tharin]I\'ll promise him the city if I have to. I\'m headed to Ajins shop now.\xa0[Jarrett]Let me know when you\'ve found him.\xa0[Tharin]I will father..goodbye.\xa0[Jarrett]Goodbye Tharin...and good luck.\xa0(Music starts)\xa0[Narrator]Tharin enters Ross\'s shop. As always people are grinding away, hammering and soldering wires. The shop always smells of burnt metal and cleaning solvent. A smell that someone of \xa0Tharin\'s status always has a hard time getting passed. Ross, as usual is seated on his chair in front of his desk, still apparently trying to make his device less...substandard.\xa0[Tharin]Ross\xa0[Ross]No commissioner, I haven\'t made any progress yet.\xa0[Tharin]I\'m not here about the device. I\'m looking for someone...someone I was told you\'re...acquainted with? His name is….\xa0(Interrupting Tharin)[Ross]Let me guess...Knox.\xa0[Tharin]Well that was a pretty good guess.\xa0[Ross]Yes well...I heard the transmission this morning. I assumed you\'d be by looking for someone to shut down Jones.\xa0[Tharin]I\'m just...impressed you knew who I was looking for really, that was just crazy. Are you reading my mind?\xa0[Ross]No I\'m not reading your mind.\xa0[Thatin]Because if you have something that reads minds I could really put that work.\xa0[Ross]No commissioner Grady, I don\'t have a device…\xa0(Interrupted by Tharin)\xa0[Tharin]Well let\'s just see if you can do it a second time shall we. What I\'m going to ask next?\xa0[Ross](Breath)You want to know where he is.\xa0[Tharin](Laughing)Honestly Mr Ajin, that\'s just amazing….If I had a cookie I\'d give it to you. Unfortunately I had no idea we\'d be playing this game…\xa0[Ross]Do you want to know where he is or not?\xa0[Tharin]That is why I\'m here Mr Ajin.\xa0[Ross]He\'s in the Graven Rouge district.\xa0[Tharin]Psss, of course he is. I mean why wouldn\'t he be, right? It\'s only the worst spot in the city...full of thieves, chem A addicted trash, vagabonds and fully approved criminals.\xa0[Ross]Yes well, he\'s kind of a recluse. That\'s why he chose to hide there...people leave him alone...until now that is.\xa0[Tharin]Hopefully there are more details you can provide me with. I mean I really can\'t \xa0just go in and there start asking around. People aren\'t going to like fact….that I\'m even there, let alone answer any of my questions.\xa0[Ross]He lives in Drydent Hall, apartment number 501.\xa0[Tharin]Perfect...that wasn\'t so hard now was it? Thank you for your time Mr Ajin...oh…and one last thing.\xa0[Ross](Perturbed exhaling as he talks)Yes what is it?\xa0[Tharin]The device…call me as soon as you have something.\xa0[Ross]Of course commissioner Grady…as soon as I have something you\'ll be the first to know.\xa0[Tharin]Great, thank you.\xa0[Ross](Perturbed)Your welcome, (under breath) marionette swine.\xa0[Narrator]Tharin heads to Drydent Hall in one of the most dangerous districts in the city, the Graven district. This place is run by the Graven Rouges...fully approved by the council they are the underground crime syndicate and they don\'t like authorities sniffing around on their territory. Salistine touches down on the wet concrete on a poorly lit street. Tharin exits the vehicle and heads into a building that looks vacated long ago. He finds room 501….\xa0(Knock, Knock, Knock)(Chained door opens)\xa0[Tharin]Woah, hello..[Knox]Hello….who are you?[Tharin]Commissioner Grady...are you Knox?[Knox]Who\'s asking?[Tharin]I thought we\'d already established that but ok...I\'m…[Knox]Yes, yes of course you are, your commissioner Grady, heir to the Grady house, commissioner of...of the northern policing force.[Tharin]That\'s right...may I come in?[Knox]Why?[Tharin]The council would like to offer you a job. I\'m here to negotiate said job.[Knox]Have you seen bisket?[Tharin]What? Who\'s bisket?[Knox]My dog...hes usually very still...he almost always stays put, I can\'t find him anywhere. Have you seen him?[Tharin]No I haven\'t I...I can\'t say that I\'ve seen any dogs...so...can I come in so we can talk?[Knox]Yes of course you can, where are my manners.(Door opens)[Knox]Mind the wires now...don\'t trip, I\'d hate for you unplug anything...I\'m in the middle of very important research.[Tharin]I\'ll be careful. [Knox]Please, do have a seat.[Tharin] Sure, so about the job…[Knox]Yes please...what does the council need from its humble servant.[Tharin]Jones, the leader of the….[Knox]Yes, yes the leader of the Theosin. I heard his transmission this morning.[Tharin]Well we need you to shut him down...keep him...off the grid. Can you do that?[Knox]Hmmm…this is easy, an easy task...I\'ll just need a few things of course.[Tharin]Name them.[Knox]First find my dog bisket.[Tharin]Ok… [angered] this is absurd. I don’t have time - [Knox] [Quickly cutting off Tharin] If you want the help you’ll oblige...please [Pauses]Now second, I need a lab to continue my research and funding for...whatever I need and...a more suitable living condition.[Tharin][Perturbed and becoming impatient]I suppose that can be handled.[Knox]Great, let me shut down this program and I\'ll get started on yours. It’ll only take...an hour maybe.[Tharin]Perfect...what\'s...that over there? Is that a stuffed animal?(Overjoyed)[Knox]Oh, you\'ve found him you….you\'ve found him. Thank you…thank you commissioner Grady. I\'ll do whatever you need...I...I can\'t believe you found bisket…(Talking to the dog like its real)Who\'s my good little boy, who\'s my good little bisket. Don\'t ever disappear like that again. You scared daddy half to death.\xa0(Scene fades)\xa0[Narrator]As Tharin contemplates the move of hiring a strange...somewhat crazy old man, Ross sits at his desk working on his device. Hours upon hours he\'s poured over this thing and now he finally has something. He calls Tharin to gives him the news and Tharin rushes over to hear what Ross has for him…\xa0[Tharin]Ok Ross...why am I hear?\xa0[Ross]Well, let me just say...this is a very sophisticated thing they\'ve done, extremely advanced and unbelievable impressive. However, I have deciphered the bulk of it. We now have 7 Saris\'s verses 50.\xa0[Tharin]You brought me...all the way down here...to tell me...you still don\'t know where Saris is?\xa0[Ross]No...well yes, but this is a huge improvement from where we were this morning.\xa0[Tharin][Aggressively aggravated - pointed]Explain how, still not knowing where Saris is...is a huge improvement.\xa0[Ross]Ok well, if someone could monitor these 7 signals they may very well turn up a pattern. That pattern might lead either to Saris, or...other Theosin members that can be interrogate.\xa0[Tharin]Ross [pauses to contemplate excitement]…that\'s actually a pretty good idea...ok, you\'ve redeemed yourself. You are now in charge of watching for a pattern.\xa0[Ross]Commissioner Grady, I hardly have time- \xa0[Tharin]Perhaps a stay in the cage would provide you enough time.\xa0[Ross]Fine...I\'ll keep an eye on it…\xa0[Narrator]Ross and Tharin are interrupted by Ross\'s workshop coms, static, bong…\xa0[Tharin]Oh not this again\xa0[Ross]Shhhhh \xa0[Sorrel](Placing his hand over the mic)Turn the anthem off....I\'m here...on the emergency channel to apologize to my fellow citizens, of this once peaceful city. Apologize for the treACHERY AND LACK OF RESPECT FOR YOU All. (Clears throat) This (highlight the next word and slow down the word at ings) mornings interruption...will not go unpunished, for that you have my word and the word of the full council. Know, that this "Jones", who ironically calls your trusted council LIARS... is himself...the (mocking Jones) "aforementioned agent noun"....(taking your time now to choose your words) Allow me to put this accusation, now...to rest. As you can see for those of you who have a visual...Saris is right here, in this hospital bed, fighting for his life. (Pause) Know also, that only a coward and a deviant deceiver of men, would use a sick, near death near death agent of our fair land, to further an agenda that a people of such calibre would never fall for without a stunt such as this. I am truly sorry for the (loathing feeling as he says the word) negligence...for a team that controls the airways. They will be dealt with and this morning mishap will never happen again. Rest assured that our top doctors...will have our beloved Saris back on his feet soon. Until then, Dayton will be searching the city for the perpetrator Jones. When found...he will be executed live for the whole city to witness, so that justice is served to the innocent who fell prey to this predator that perverts the truth. I only ask, that if you see Jones, you call the commissioners offices immediately. Jones is an infection beyond mending, and we will burn all that it spreads to. I beg your forgiveness my great people and leave you tonight, with they only hope we have as a United force against division...that is our blessing. May the blessings of the council be with you always, goodnight.\xa0(Foot steps, Tharin is leaving in a hurry)\xa0[Ross] commissioner…\xa0[Tharin] Stay on it Ross, find a pattern.\xa0(Tharin pushes his coms button halfway through his statement to Ross. Door shuts, Tharin is outside)\xa0[Tharin]Father. What is going on? Did you know about that transmission?\xa0[Jarrett]No. Sorrel is...working without the approval of the council. Things are getting dangerous. If he is allowed to continue in this...I don\'t know what will happen. This chaos needs to end. The council is afraid hes growing to bold. They\'re afraid he might not relinquish this new power grab. I need some good news Tharin.\xa0[Tharin] Knox should be finished with the code by now. Did you get my message?\xa0[Jarrett]Yes. Everything is set for him. We\'ve met his demands and he will soon be employed by the council. What of the device.\xa0[Tharin] There\'s been an improvement, but we haven\'t found Saris yet. \xa0[Jarrett]There\'s rumors that Jones\'s speech has already caused damage in the people\'s confidence...for the council. There\'s talk of an uprising.\xa0[Tharin]Yes well...if it comes to that, my team and James Corins team will be ready.\xa0[Jarrett]Let\'s just hope that Sorrels last speech has done the trick. We may be angry with him...but it was the only option I think.\xa0[Narrator]As Tharin and Jarrett discuss the future of chaotic events, Jones pops in to check on Saris...and give him a bit of news. Saris sits in a metal chair in the middle of a warehouse. The windows shed a bit of light as Jones approaches.\xa0[Jones]Saris how wonderful to see you again.\xa0[Saris]Back so soon Jones? What\'s the problem this time? Tharin getting closer to finding me...closer to relieving you of your worthless life?\xa0[Jones]Nope, neither of those. I have something I want you to see.\xa0[Narrator]Jones reaches into his pocket and pulls out a neon purple ball. It\'s the size of a quarter and has a slight glow. He tosses it in the air and it stops 4 ft from Saris, level with his head. It begins to project a screen. What\'s playing? Just Sorrels latest message….\xa0[Jones]You see Saris...this is what I was talking about. Sorrel cares nothing for you. \xa0[Saris]It\'s a doctored video.\xa0[Jones]Is it? My techs tell me…that this is a real person...you see now….they\'ve replaced you. Sorrel….has...replaced you. \xa0[End] | https://joshmonroesprojectalpha.com/thecitywithinthewallsCome talk to us...https://discord.gg/eafMebmOr join us on reddit...https://reddit.com/r/thecitywithinthewalls[Narrator] When a child is born into this fine city, a communication device is placed just beneath the left ear. The device can, connect to a car or house depending on the owner\'s setting, so communication appears more...normal, and this is how our story begins. Aleen wakes startled, by an incoming call broadcast by her house com, she quickly press\'s the coms button on her night stand and says...*ANSWERING NOISE*[Aleen](Waking up to the phone ringing)Mmmm....hello[Jones]Ah Miss Harris. Sorry to call you. However, \xa0I\'m a very busy man...and quite impatient. I\'m calling for an update...how\'d the date go.[Aleen](Aleen is totally disgusted)(Breath)That\'s really none of your business Jones...and wasn\'t I suppose to call you?[Jones]Yes, but as I said before I\'m very busy...not to mention, impatient. As far as my business...yes, it kind of is. Now about my update...would it make you feel better if I asked please?[Aleen](Breaths again)Tharin didn\'t really want to talk about it. All he told me was, Sorrel placed Dayton in Saris\'s place and the council isn\'t happy...at all. That\'s all he told me.[Jones](False positivity with Aleen, feels this interaction was on the verge of ‘wasting time’)Well...its not much...and information we already knew...but I\'ll give you credit for the attempt at least. Thank you Miss Harris, we\'ll be in touch.(Phone hangs up)[Aleen]Jerk(Song and intro)[Narrator](Keeping its normative pace, the city is hard at work, ignoring the dangers that loom with each political checkmate. In the heart of the city, a light morning fog sets in around a workshop. The sun, always in it\'s own power struggle with the thick clouds, lends a slight glow, that gleams lightly off Ross’s spotless high-tech workshop. Tharin enter the shop, eager to see his commissioned device. Ross reveals his genius machine, Tharin looks over it for a second and says...)[Tharin]So I just push this button...and what? It shows me the location of Saris?[Ross]The location of his tracking device at least. Last night I tested it on my own pps unit and it works fine. I just put in Saris\'s. Once it\'s done...you just push the button...and it should, yes, show you his location.[Tharin]Perfect, what are we waiting for?[Ross]It has to go through the calculations.[Tharin]Hmmm...how long does that take?(Ding)[Ross]It\'s done...go ahead.[Tharin]Well that went quicker than I was expecting. Here goes nothing.(Machine makes noise)[Tharin]Is this some kind of joke Mr Ajin?[Ross]What do you mean?[Tharin]Have a look for yourself, see if you can figure out what I mean.[Ross]How is that....what\'s it doing? [Tharin]Well if you can\'t figure it out, how am I supposed to know?[Ross] They must have encrypted the signal somehow.[Tharin]Or it doesn\'t work.[Ross]I assure you, commissioner Grady it works.[Tharin]Ok then, if that\'s not it, there appears to be, by my count, around 50 Saris\'s all over the city.[Ross]Yes I see that. They\'ve encrypted his passcode somehow, see how they\'re all moving around. They\'ve tied his code to others throughout the city. It\'s going to take a while to figure out.[Tharin]Right....let\'s hope you can figure it out Mr Ajin. If not, someone must be held responsible...is that clear?[Ross]As a bell.[Tharin]Good...well don\'t let me stop you...get to work.[Narrator](Tharin, in a moment of frustration abandons the desk that holds the device. Ross sits in the background behind him, leaning against the duos new machine, he stares at it for a moment, hopelessly as if the answer will reveal itself. Tharin paces back and forth, pressing the coms button just below his left ear saying...)[Tharin]Call father...It doesn\'t work...[Ross](Loudly speaking to Tharin as he walks away)It works fine...(Under breath)I just have to figure out the code[Tharin]Hes working on it now. I\'ll talk to you in a bit.\xa0[Narrator](Ross Ajin continues his work, continuing to question how ‘he,’ of all people, could be outwitted by the Theosin. Tharin steps away from the workshop for a break from the discord within in his very political life. He makes his way towards Aleen’s, glancing at her coat from the night before that now looks at home, on his passenger seat. He smiles for a moment, and begins to wonder if Aleen enjoyed the night as much as he did.) \xa0(Knock, knock, knock)[Aleen](Surprised and concerned, but there is a moment of flickering happiness.)Tharin, what are you doing here?\xa0[Tharin]I just wanted to return your coat...and apologize.\xa0[Aleen]Apologize for what?\xa0[Tharin]For not trusting you with the investigation. I have a very hard time trusting anyone, the city is full of people trying...to do...bad things, anyway. I\'m sorry to insult your character in that way.\xa0[Aleen]No need to apologize, and I know what you mean about...bad people.\xa0(Awkward silence)(Both talk at the same time)\xa0[Aleen]Thanks for taking….\xa0[Tharin]Well, I just wanted to…\xa0[Aleen]I\'m sorry (laughing)\xa0[Tharin]No, I\'m sorry go ahead.\xa0[Aleen]I was just going to say, thank you for taking me to Madison Fare last night. \xa0I know you had to, with the bet and all, but...I really had a good time thank you.\xa0[Tharin]I also had a good time. You\'re quite an entertainer and I needed a break so, thank you, for...forcing me to take you.\xa0[Aleen]We should do it again sometime.\xa0[Tharin](Momentary pause, considering his next words)I think we should.\xa0[Aleen]Really?\xa0[Tharin]Yes, really...maybe something a little less expensive next time though.\xa0[Aleen](Laughing)Right, I hope it didn\'t set you back to far.\xa0[Tharin]No it\'s fine. Anyways…(breath) I\'d better go. We\'ll talk later though?\xa0[Aleen]Ya\xa0[Tharin] Ok, goodbye Aleen.\xa0[Aleen]Goodbye Tharin.\xa0[Narrator](Aleen closes the door behind Tharin, watching him for a moment through the looking glass. She smiles. Leaning against the door, she clutches the moment.)\xa0[Aleen]He trusts me…\xa0[Narrator](Her hands dropping to her sides, her eyes widen, as concern blankets her face…[Aleen]Oh crap...he trusts me.\xa0[Narrator]\xa0(Aleen contemplates the dilemma before her; foster a newfound trust, or betray it. \xa0*pause* Before us sits a warehouse at the edge the city border: windows boarded, corrugated sheets cracked, and fallen from the rooftop, rafters aged, bent and breaking. A swathe of dust would be collected on them if it were not for the mice running to and fro from their homes, rested neatly in unperturbed corners of this uninhabited warehouse. \xa0Saris sits alone. Wrists and ankles burned by the ropes that bind him. His sight darkened by the blindfold. Alone with his thoughts, confined within the silence of this abandoned building. They practically echoed in his mind. \xa0But what\'s this? Another sound? A foot step. Multiple in fact. They echo off the concrete, shaking the rust from the rafters above…)\xa0[Jones]Moose\xa0[Moose]Yes sir?\xa0[Jones]It would appear our adversaries have found a way to track Saris.\xa0[Saris](Laughing in his evil “you\'re so dead” laugh) \xa0[Jones](Pausing for a moment to recognize Saris\'s laugh)So here\'s the plan. Saris is to be moved every 8 hours. Here\'s the next location, you now have 7 hours and 22 minutes and….23 seconds 22, 21. Anyways, keep him moving.\xa0[Saris](Laughing again at the plan)If they\'ve already found a way to track me, your dead where you stand.\xa0[Moose] What\'s the likelihood they\'ll find us?\xa0[Jones]I\'m told by our techs, that we have a 99.7% success rate if we move every 8 hours. That goes down by 20% every half hour afterwards. So I suggest you keep him on the move. (Jones now speaking to Saris in a calm manner)Oh and don\'t worry Saris, Sorrel has all but abandoned you. Hes placed Dayton in charge. The one looking for you is Tharin. So as you see Sorrel has written you off...the offer still stands if you want to, oh I don\'t know, help?\xa0[Saris](A mixture of disbelief, and potentially fostered anger)Sorrel wouldn\'t abandon me. Not after all that I\'ve done for him, and Dayton won\'t last a week.\xa0[Jones]Yes well...offer still stands, let me know when you wake up and realize Sorrel cares only for himself...and Dayton. (Jones starts to walk away but stops for one last comment)Oh and...one last thing...don\'t test my patients by pretending to care for the council. I know your disdain, and soon Sorrel will show his lack of interest in you. When that happens I\'ll be here to give you a...shot at revenge. Goodbye for now Saris.\xa0(Jones leaves the room)\xa0[Saris]Was he telling the truth Moose? Has Sorrel made Dayton Enforcer?\xa0[Moose]Ya. It\'s not official yet, but as of right now...Dayton is filling the spot.\xa0[Narrator](Under Saris’ breath is a growl. His breath feels heavy. His chest knotted, heat rising up the back of his neck. He pulls at his bindings to distract himself. Light trickles of blood scatter on the concrete floor. A new sound, alone once again with Saris’ thoughts.) \xa0*pause* \xa0Tharin, frustrated sits in his car. Unsure if he is more angry by the lack of results from Ross\'s device, the case to find Saris, or the indent left by the wheel in the palm of his hand. Moments pass, feeling like hours. Even committing to conversation with his car, Salistine. \xa0[Tharin]I am beyond frustrated Salistine. There are so many variables.\xa0[Salestine]Variables you have invariably been trained in, sir. \xa0[Tharin]Yes this is true Salistine.\xa0[Salistine]I just want to say sir...I have done nothing but help when I can, that said sir, I was wondering if you could stop hitting my control wheel?\xa0[Tharin]Yes of course Salistine, I\'m sorry. It\'s just...what do I do with Ross. I know he\'s not sabotaging the machine, but the lack of results is quite disappointing. I mean, it\'s not like I can just kill him, we need him.\xa0[Salistine]Sorry to interrupt sir, but an incoming call from councilman Grady\'s office, do you accept?\xa0[Tharin]Yes of course Salistine, patch it through.\xa0[Salistine]Patching through now sir.\xa0[Jarrett]Tharin, are you sitting down?\xa0[Tharin]Yes, I\'m in the car why?\xa0[Jarrett]Sorrel is about to give an address to the entire city.\xa0[Tharin]An address about what?\xa0[Jarrett]He thinks it\'s a good idea to quell some of the concern over Saris\'s disappearance.\xa0[Tharin]He\'s actually going to tell people Saris is missing?\xa0[Jarrett]No...hes going to tell people Saris is Ill and unable to perform his duties as Enforcer. \xa0[Tharin]Well that\'s better than telling them he\'s missing.\xa0[Jarrett]I don\'t agree that lying to the people is a good idea. He\'s going to dig a hole for the council.\xa0[Tharin]Hmmm, is there anyway to delay him for a few days?\xa0[Jarrett]No, he\'s going to go live in a few minutes. I have to go. The council has been requested to stand behind him in the address.\xa0[Tharin]Of course, that way you can\'t deny knowing…\xa0[Jarrett]Exactly...I\'m truly concerned Tharin. Find Saris, and do it soon...or we\'ll have more than just his disappearance to worry about.\xa0[Tharin]I\'ll do my best father.\xa0[Jarrett]Of course you will, goodbye son.\xa0[Tharin]Goodbye father.Salistine?\xa0[Salistine]Yes sir?\xa0(Salistine is interrupted by an official address. It starts with a bong then the city anthem begins)\xa0[Sorrel]Greeting, salutations, hello and blessings be with you all. My brothers and sisters, I apologize for the interruption of your evening, but I have a grave concern. I\'ve been notified that there are rumors flying about this fine city, about the disappearance of our beloved Saris. Know that he, our sworn protector, our refuge from chaos, our friend and our brother has not disappeared. He is right now...unable to tend to his sworn duties do to an illness, an illness that has him more than just under the weather. I feared, having to inform you of this, because I wanted to save you from the stress you might incur having heard said news. However, I also feared the rumors might cause more damage, so in the Hopes that I, councilman Sorrel, could save you the more stressful thing, I have decided to release this news to you here. My fellow citizens, the council and I care a great deal for you, so know that we always take the actions necessary to keep you all safe. This being said, we have placed Dayton in Saris\'s stead, til he is either able to return to his regular duties or is forced to retire his title to Dayton. I apologize for the delayed announcement, but as I said before we were hoping to save you the stress. Know that the doctors are working around the clock taking care of our Saris. I ask that you keep the hope that he will be returned to us soon...healthy and ready to resume his responsibilities. I will leave you tonight with our blessing, and pride. For we are proud of the great people of this majestic city, for the way they handle such situations. That is with confidence and courage. Until next time my brothers and Sisters...may the blessing of the council be with you always...goodnight.\xa0[Narrator]Sorrel’s voice echoes in every corner of the city. Across all mediums, his lies spread to an all too trusting populace. Well, trust from some of “his” population. There was one set of ears in particular whose call was interrupted by the message. The man who has Saris himself. The man who without a doubt knows of Sorrel’s lies. \xa0[Jones]Well played Sorrel, but you aren’t the only one with a hand in this game. You want to play?.....Let\'s play. | https://joshmonroesprojectalpha.com/thecitywithinthewalls\xa0Come talk to us...https://discord.gg/eafMebmOr join us on reddit...https://reddit.com/r/thecitywithinthewalls | https://joshmonroesprojectalpha.com/thecitywithinthewallsCome talk to us...https://discord.gg/eafMebmOr join us on reddit...https://reddit.com/r/thecitywithinthewalls', 'chan_desc': "350 years ago, a great cataclysm nearly wiped out all life on earth.

Pérez Ledo y el realizador sonoro Roberto Maján sobre los secretos, grabaciones y curiosidades de las temporadas de ‘El Gran Apagón’. También contamos con la participación de tres expertos y divulgadores científicos: América Valenzuela, Antonio Martínez Ron y Natalia Ruiz Zelmanovitch, que nos aclararon todas las dudas sobre tormentas solares y otras hipótesis que se plantean en la serie. Estuvieron con nosotros algunas voces a las que por fin pondremos cara como Nancho Novo, Pilar Bergés, Elena Seguí, María San Miguel o el hijo de Terele Pávez, Carolo Ruiz.Y con un final con sorpresas, preguntas y algún que otro avance. ¡Dale al play! | El 13 de abril de 2018, la radiación emitida por el sol dos días antes, alcanzó la Tierra, provocando un apagón de escala global. Los satélites dejaron de funcionar. También los transformadores eléctricos y todas las radiocomunicaciones.El planeta se quedó a oscuras y en silencio. Nada más producirse la tormenta solar, el gobierno estadounidense activó el plan nacional para apagones eléctricos. Había sido diseñado en 2016 por la administración Obama, para el caso de que una tormenta solar afectase a las infraestructuras del país.Aunque la posibilidad de que la radiación afectase a las infraestructuras terrestres y espaciales estaba encima de la mesa, los gobiernos actuaron con cautela. Solo un Estado comunicó abiertamente a su población el riesgo real e inminente de un fallo total en las telecomunicaciones.Este es el octavo y último episodio de El gran apagón, dirigido por Ana Alonso, realización técnica de Roberto Maján y con guion de José A. Pérez Ledo.Muchas gracias a todos habernos seguido y escuchado a lo largo de esta aventura. El próximo episodio será el podcast de la despedida El Gran Apagón que realizamos en directo desde el Teatro Gymage en Madird. Estad atentos a nuestro Facebook y Twitter para más noticias. | El segundo apagón duró un total de 69 días, 13 menos que el primero. En las calles, la alegría por el regreso de la luz fue contenida. Para entonces, la idea de que los apagones serían un fenómeno recurrente ya se había instalado en la sociedad. Aquello, por tanto, solo era una tregua pasajera.No todo el mundo recibió de igual manera el regreso de la luz. Algunos, incluso, se opusieron. Fue el caso del antes conocido como Club Gaia, ahora simplemente Gaia, que inició una campaña de sangrientos atentados por todo el país.En este séptimo episodio de la tercera temporada de El gran apagón, dirigido por Ana Alonso, realización técnica de Roberto Maján y con guion de José A.

Décadas después, cuando se decidió que serían empleados para cobijar personas y bienes durante el primer apagón, recibieron nombres nuevos, más sencillos. Estaba el Goya, el Cervantes, el Dalí… Y el que acabaría siendo el más famoso de todos. El Velázquez.En la crisis que acabaría dando fama a este refugio, uno de sus huéspedes jugó un papel decisivo. Un conde septuagenario llamado Jose Manuel Vallejo. A los pocos días de instalarse allí, Vallejo empezó a dar síntomas de demencia. La noche del 19 de febrero, ya totalmente desorientado y tras un fútil intento de fuga, fue encerrado en su habitación.En este sexto episodio de la tercera temporada de El gran apagón, dirigido por Ana Alonso, realización técnica de Roberto Maján y con guion de José A.

Un caso que, meses después, y de la manera más inesperada, le brindaría una fama internacional.\xa0Natalia Blanco vuelve a la acción y en su camino se encontrará con algunos de los personajes más emblemáticos de esta serie: Daniel, Xiana y el sargento Castro.El reparto de este episodio está compuesto por:José María del Río (Narrador)Macarena Gómez (Natalia)Pedro Santos (Militar en El Prado)Javier Bañuelos (Militar 2 en El Prado)Charo Soria (Madre de Eva)Luís Callejo (Padre de Eva)Mónica Miranda (Camarera de la estación)Adriana Navarro (Xiana)Nacho Novo (Daniel)Miguel Aparicio (Militar 1 en la urbanización)Carlos San Román (Militar 2 en la urbanización)Nacho Fresneda (Sargento Castro) | Durante el segundo apagón surgieron toda clase de teorías que trataban de explicar la anómala actividad solar. Aunque la ciencia carecía de respuestas concluyentes a lo que estaba ocurriendo, algunos científicos se esforzaron por explicarlo de manera divulgativa.Unas buscaban explicaciones religiosas, de manera similar a lo que hizo la Secta del Sol Negro durante el primer apagón. Otras se basaban en una cierta espiritualidad más próxima al ecologismo. De todas ellas, la que más predicamento tuvo fue la propugnada por el Club Gaia.El Club Gaia era un colectivo ecologista que empezó a operar en el año 2017. Aunque sus actividades públicas se centraban en conferencias y otras actividades de concienciación, algunos de sus miembros participaron en acciones ecoterroristas. Se sabe que estuvieron relacionados con la quema de campos de cultivos transgénicos, con el sabotaje de centrales nucleares y con la liberación de animales de centros de investigación. El siguiente audio está extraído de un video del canal del Club Gaia. | La existencia de los refugios salió a la luz pública en mayo de 2021. La noticia tuvo un impacto extraordinario. En aquellos refugios, distribuidos por toda la geografía peninsular y custodiados por militares, un muy selecto grupo de personas vivió con toda clase de lujos durante los dos apagones. Cada refugio contaba, además, con uno o varios almacenes donde se custodiaban objetos de alto valor. Oro. Armas. Medicamentos. Obras de arte.Estos refugios contaban también con una serie de puestos de escucha. Desde allí se interceptaban todas las transmisiones de radio que se producían en un determinado perímetro. Cuando la existencia de los refugios se hizo pública, se filtraron las grabaciones de lo ocurrido en uno de ellos. Escuchen atentamente.En este tercer episodio de la tercera temporada de El gran apagón, dirigido por Ana Alonso, realización técnica de Roberto Maján y con guion de José A. Pérez Ledo, han participado los actores:José María del Río - NarradorRoberto Cuadrado - Huésped 1Rafael de la Rica Hernández - Huésped 2Jacinto Morales de Oca - Huésped 3Rafael Calvo - Huésped 4Carmen Gutiérrez - Huéspeda 1Francisca González - Huéspeda 2Cristina Palomo - Huéspeda 3Olga Hernán - Huéspeda 4Nacho Fresneda - Sargento CastroCarlos Piñero - José Manuel VallejoRebeca Revilla - Mujer Espiada 1María Guerra - Mujer Espiada 2Rafa Bernardo - Hombre Espiado 1Mabel del Pozo - Superior de CastroLucía Díaz Tejeiro - Eva Martín | Para entender la manera en que la verdad sobre los apagones salió a la luz hay que conocer primero a una mujer llamada Eva Martín. Y la única manera de hacerlo es presentando antes a Natalia Blanco. Blanco fue agente de policía hasta 2009, año en que abandonó el cuerpo por motivos personales. Abrió entonces una pequeña agencia de detectives con sede en la Plaza Castilla de Madrid. Aunque en un principio aceptó todo tipo de casos, no tardó en especializarse en seguimientos e infidelidades.Natalia Blanco lo grababa todo, desde las reuniones que mantenía en su oficina hasta los procesos de seguimiento y vigilancia. El siguiente audio fue grabado una semana después del segundo apagón. Un matrimonio acude a la oficina de la detective, su hija lleva desaparecida desde hace varios días, su hija es Eva Martín.En este primer episodio de la tercera temporada de El gran apagón, dirigido por Ana Alonso, realización técnica de Roberto Maján y con guion de José A.

Pero, a diferencia de lo que ocurrió en 2018, esta vez el mundo entero estaba prevenido.Aunque, en un primer momento, se desató el caos en las calles, éstas fueron recuperando la calma tan pronto como el segundo apagón tuvo lugar. La mañana del 11 de febrero, el centro de Madrid ofrecía un paisaje casi idéntico al de un día cualquiera. Los semáforos no funcionaban. Tampoco los cajeros automáticos ni las farolas. Esta vez, sin embargo, nada de eso impidió que la gente saliese a la calle casi como un día cualquiera.Podría decirse a simple vista que aquel gran apagón no había afectado en absoluto a nada y a nadie. Pero... sólo había que esperar unos instantes para que la ira y los miedos ocultos empezaran a brotar.En este primer episodio de la tercera temporada de El gran apagón, dirigido por Ana Alonso, realización técnica de Roberto Maján y con guion de José A. Pérez Ledo. | En noviembre de 2021 la revista Science dedicó su portada a la inusual actividad solar, que registraba máximos históricos. Una docena de Premios Nobel alertaban la posibilidad de que se produjera una nueva tormenta solar más intensa, incluso, que la de 2018. El medio que más tiempo dedicó a esto fue un programa científico que habló en profundidad sobre las tormentas solares.

Through compilation, skepticism, and a knack for finding the blatantly “weird”, Fort would form the world of paranormal research as we know it, even if through methods and means not in-line with how many perceive it today.Join us this week on The Supernatural Tendencies Podcast where we’ll discuss the life and times of this key figure in paranormal research history. | In the 1800’s, the lumber town of Rhinelander, Wisconsin outwardly resembled any other logging town across the US, with one important difference. \xa0These early pioneers spent their nights spinning tales of a creature of mythic proportions.Located in the northern part of the state, in what is termed, the Northwoods, legends of a hideous creature with glowing red eyes, razor sharp teeth, talon filled claws and spiney, dinosaur like protrusions along its back and tail, ran rampant.It was said this terrifying beast was the unified spirit of the many oxen used in transporting the logs in the area. \xa0These angry spirits are said to wreck havoc \xa0because of the abuse they suffered at the hands of their owners.Described as being over 8 feet long and 200 lbs, with the head of a frog, and the grinning face of an elephant, the beast was reportedly responsible for a string of attacks, on Rhinelander residents, as well as many local animals.Traditions of the beast hold strong in this area but what are the facts of this case?Could it be another hilarious looking caricature of an actual animal?Or does it only run free in the minds and imaginations of the people of northern Wisconsin?In this episode of the Supernatural Tendencies Podcast, we\'ll explore this local legend and weigh in on what we think is going on here!Connect with us below!Facebook - \xa0https://www.facebook.com/SupernaturalTendenciesPodcast/Instagram - \xa0https://www.instagram.com/supernaturaltendenciespodcast/Website - \xa0https://christiesadler.wixsite.com/supernaturalpodcastYouTube - \xa0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLM4ZENS7F3QchwtVIBjWAQ?view_as=subscriber | The earth’s waters contain many mysteries, most of which have yet to be found. \xa0With only an estimated 2% having been explored, we know more about the Moon, than we do about the oceans and seas that make up our planet.So it’s pretty exciting when a discovery is made that rocks not only the scientific community, but also the world of ufology and even archeology...and yes, this discovery was made underwater!In 2011, a team of Swedish divers who were on a mission to find a sunken ship, filled with cases of champagne, happened on what seemed to be the find of a lifetime.An unusual, and not to mention HUGE, anomaly was viewed, on the floor of the Gulf of Bothnia, between Sweden and Finland.Numerous theories of what this mysterious anomaly could be, ranged from a naturally occurring formation, to a crashed ufo and even that it could possibly be the lost city of Atlantis.But what are the facts behind this case and is there any proof that “holds water” to any of these theories?Connect with Us on your favorite social media!Face book - \xa0https://www.facebook.com/SupernaturalTendenciesPodcast/Instagram - \xa0https://www.instagram.com/supernaturaltendenciespodcast/Website - \xa0https://christiesadler.wixsite.com/supernaturalpodcastThank you so much for your continued support!You guys are awesome! | What do you get when you mix a religious film producer and a strange experience shared by 5 New York police officers?In this week\'s episode, we explore the unexplained sightings of star jelly.Was this the inspiration behind the movie, "The Blob"?Explanations for this weird substance range from alien life, to meteorite residue to frog spawn.But what is it really?Join us every Tuesday to explore legendary locations, true ghost stories and haunted places and all sorts of other unexplained mysteries!Click here to LIKE & FOLLOW Us on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/Supernatural...Website https://christiesadler.wixsite.com/su...Instagram https://www.instagram.com/supernatura...', 'chan_desc': 'Are you a fan of all things paranormal, extraterrestrial and supernatural?Join us every Tuesday where we bring you topics that defy explanation!From hauntings and alien abductions to mysterious places and the occasional cryptid legend!', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/69/8c/fb/698cfb93-7fc5-6e3b-7543-fefb49d101bc/mza_4971214600344853748.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-15'}}

We’ve brought Stephen onto the show today because of his personal interest in werewolf stories—so much so that he’s even written his own werewolf novel, Mongrels. We really think you\'ll enjoy hearing Stephen\'s personal interest and passion about this fascinating horror tradition. Make sure you stay tuned for the pure hilarity at the end. Stephen unexpectedly divulges a personal experience from his youth that had us—shall we say—howling. Please note that starting about the 36 minute mark until the 40 minute mark, Stephen\'s dogs start barking. I could have cut this out, but we had a good conversation going & I didn\'t want you guys to miss out on any of that good info.

While we were at Stoker Con in Grand Rapids this past May, we had the complete honor of sitting down with Rachel Autumn Deering. You may remember  our discussion of Rachel’s novella HUSK from episode 19. It was our absolute pleasure to chat with Rachel about comics, her childhood in the backwoods of Kentucky, the devil, her astonishing editing process, and so much more. Also! You won\'t want to miss the last ten minutes, when Rachel gives some of the most compelling writing advice we\'ve ever heard.\xa0 Show Notes  Cherry by Nico Walker (book rec from Rachel!)\xa0 Find Rachel: Website | Twitter | Instagram   | It\'s difficult to put into words what a rewarding experience it was to host the panel "Why Does Horror Matter? An Exploration of the Relevance and—Dare We Say—Necessity of Horror in a Tumultuous World" featuring panelists Stephen Graham Jones, Kathryn E. McGee, Becky Spratford, and Gabino Iglesias this past May at Stoker Con 2019. It was incredibly rewarding and definitely one of the highlights of the con for us. This topic is one we\'ve been thinking a lot about lately, but we had no idea if it was one that would resonate with others. We were pleasantly surprised to arrive at our panel room to find it was standing room only. Not only did we feel the podcast love, but we also felt that this is a topic that\'s heavy on many people\'s hearts.\xa0 Our panelists added a richness and depth to the conversation that we could have never anticipated.

Spoiler alert: it\'s been a great experience that has taught me a lot during this phase of my writing career.\xa0However, there are pros and cons, like any business relationship.If there\'s anything I didn\'t cover, shoot me an email at james@jamesaaron.netThanks for listening! | In this episode I talk about dinners with fans.Spoiler alert, they\'re great.They can help you build engagement, make your series\' world more real, and create priceless experiences for your fans.If you\'re like me and your mind goes blank while talking, you might want to take some flash cards so you don\'t forget the name of your latest book.I also struggled with a bout of "comparisonitus" this week, where I found myself comparing my career in the last three years with other authors I know, wondering if I\'ve made the right decisions, and choosing to focus on what\'s right for me... even if I haven\'t completely figured that out yet.Also, Google says podcasting is the new blogging, so get on that.

Thanks for listening and all your support. | In this episode I talk about a major setback I experienced recently, how it affected my writing, and how I am trying to continue to work through it.\xa0I also talk about lessons learned from reading the slush pile for an SF/F publisher.\xa0Thanks for listening! | This is a bit of personal episode but it touches on finding your true audience by expressing your authentic self.Once you find those true fans, and you\'re honest and open with them and serve them up the entertainment they love, I think you\'ve got them for life.We recently went through a major transition in Aeon 14, and me with my writing partner. I was ready for fans to revolt but they\'ve supported us in amazing ways. I can\'t express how much gratitude I\'ve felt in the last month, and how inspired I\'ve been to create meaningful, honest work.Also, sorry for the break! | I\'ve been working on Eve of Destruction\xa0(kickass cover, right?) for six months now, which is like GRRM time in indie publishing. In the midst of grinding through edits, I\'ve been working on several other hobby projects as well. While Steven Pressfield might call this resistance, it got me thinking about the benefits of allowing your mind to wander, absorb and learn from your hobbies, and how you can fold those skills into your writing. I\'m a DIY nerd, so my hobbies are building things, but the points I talk about could easily apply to team sports, travel or any other hobby.Other notes:Create If Writing with Kirsten OliphantSelf Publishing Journeys by Paul TeagueDeep Work by Cal NewportThe Awkward Thoughts of Kamau BellOn Intelligence by\xa0Jeff Hawkins and Sandra BlakesleeAuthorLife by J ThornThanks for listening! | In this episode I talk about some changes in the SF short fiction market, new opportunities for short fiction in Kindle Unlimited anthologies, and how to push yourself to grow as an author by saying yes... but also having a plan so you don\'t get overwhelmed.Mentioned in this podcast:Tim Ferris Interviews Neal GaimanThanks for listening!\xa0 | In this episode, Josh Hayes jumps in for the first Speculative Work Interview.

Unfortunately, there was only about two minutes of footage as the previous owner of the tape recorded an episode of some 90’s era soap opera over top of the original film.I can’t believe it. All that valuable information lost... Like sands through the hour glass. | This one’s a little different than the others. To start with, this is the first actual audio cassette we’ve come across in this bizarre scavenger hunt. The rest of the audio we’ve uncovered so far has been recordings extracted from digital sources. What’s more interesting is that this appears to be two personal, audio journal entries where we get to see a very different side of Jane Ripley than what we’ve seen in the Morning Maelstrom broadcast tapes.It’s clear she’s begun to realize that there may be sinister forces at work in the Deep Reach, but she clearly does not yet grasp how dangerous they truly are. | It’s no surprise that CyberSeekers and urban explorers tend to run in the same circles. One explores the darkest corners of the virtual realm while the other explores decaying structures left abandoned in the physical world.That’s how we came across this latest recording.A group of urban explorers reached out to us after they discovered an arcade system board with the word “Polybius” etched into it during an 2009 exploration of the TSS Duke of Lancaster, a transport vessel which had previously been converted into a tourist attraction called “The Fun Ship” before being completely abandoned in 1983.The legend of the Polybius arcade cabinet is well-known in the gaming world, so we jumped at the chance to see what secrets lay hidden in those circuits. We got much more than we bargained for. | We’ve now uncovered a number of these audio recordings from the mysterious radio show called “The Morning Maelstrom”, and I’ve been poring over each episode trying to piece together a coherent timeline.This particular file came to me after I enlisted the help of my fellow CyberSeekers to follow up on a clue I came across in another episode. The audio was extracted from a thumb drive shaped like an ice cream cone that was found in a box of random computer parts picked up at a garage sale in the rural town of Cottonwood Falls, Kansas.Based on what I’ve heard in some of the other episodes, it sounds like this one aired prior to what I’ve begun to refer to as “The Calamity.” If only the people of the Deep Reach knew what was about to happen… | I’ve extracted a strange audio file I found hidden in an image posted on a dark web conspiracy forum. It sounds like somebody holding a microphone to a cassette tape player and recording clips from some radio show called the “Morning Maelstrom.”I can’t find any information about the radio show anywhere, but considering the bizarre content, I can’t imagine it was meant to be heard by the general public.Who uploaded it, and why?', 'chan_desc': 'Welcome to the Deep Reach!

Everything is painted, even the ground, with kaleidoscopes of colors and messages of repentance and God’s enduring love. The artist responsible for the monument, “The Man of the Mountain,” welcomes the newcomers, referring to the captain as one of “the Seven” and to the other kids as “knights.”As Charles, William, and Ozzie explore the mountain, Captain Kid and Dawn meet with the mountain-painter to discuss the comings and goings of travelers headed west to a place called Atsuma the Great City. Also, the distant sound of engines and a faraway cloud of trailing dust alerts them to the approach of people the mountain man calls “Kybees” or “moon folk.” Who are these people? Charles doesn’t know, but as they depart Salvation Mountain, the captain warns them to be ready to fight. Finally, before following Captain Kid back into the desolation of the desert, Charles once again digs in his heels. Where are they going, how long will they be away from their world, and when will they get back home? Charles wants to know. Dawn, the recently instated Chief Officer, goes to Charles, asking him to come along, but even she cannot deny the sensibility of his protests. When Dawn presents Charles’s questions to Captain Kid, the captain offers one thin slice of hope: they will go to a town called Doloptree. There, they will phone the king of Atsuma and tell him of their quest and that the fugitive, Castatine, is headed for the Great City. Perhaps after that, Charles and his friends can return to the World Below.

As Charles lays on the ground, watching Ozzie build a shelter with the door he’d recovered out of the sand, Dawn—the crew’s new Chief Officer—busies herself inventorying their supplies. In Charles’s backpack, she finds, among other things, a toy Yoda action figure and lists it in the inventory. Charles finds in his pocket the cap off a Coke bottle. After seeing her record the Yoda figure, he wonders if the bottle cap should be added to their supply list, but rejects the idea. Overall, our friend, Charles, is feeling depressed, so far from his home and now he’s been demoted, too.In the morning they set off in search of the mysterious place called Salvation Mountain, and what they find isn’t anything they expected. It is an enormous art project of desert wreckage, paint covering everything, even the ground. And on everything is painted messages of God’s love.  | After docking with the Upward Facing Door, Captain Kid leads the crew outside, where they climb up to the nose of the shuttle using a grappling hook. There, they come face-to-face with the door to another world. When Charles goes through, he finds a vast desert and a sign leading to a place called Salvation Mountain. 3.5 miles, thataway. The rest of the kids climb up into the desert, but Ozzie closes the door in the sand sealing them away in the foreign world. William digs with his hands, trying to uncover the passageway, but digging is no good. “There are rules,” the captain explains. William couldn’t dig to his world unless he was a wizard. Also, the captain reminds them, “We’re not looking for a way home. We’re looking for Castatine and the Patch Fairy.”That may be true, but it doesn’t stop William and Charles from feeling trapped. Charles gives voice to their doubts, and when it’s apparent he doesn’t trust their new leader, Captain Kid demotes him, making Dawn the new chief officer. The chapter concludes with Captain Kid venturing out into the desert and Dawn left in charge of inventorying their supplies.  | Blast off! The Nautilus space shuttle rockets into the air—a shaking, roaring, vibrating flight that seems completely out of control. William and Ozzie jettison rocket sections and work the valves to prevent a meltdown, Dawn replaces burned fuses the size of poker decks, the captain tries to steer, and Charles cranks the peddles, extending the docking claw in front of the ship…but where’s the dock? Have they missed it?

Together, they measure things like wind speed and barometric pressure. Afterward, as the captain uses a spyglass to search for the Upward Facing Door, William brings a trio of Cokes to the top of the launch tower. While the search continues, Charles and his best friend drink their sodas until the illusive doorway is found. Once located, William takes a turn on the telescope, promptly finding the door, which he describes as a cross between a blimp and a space station. Intrigued, Charles takes his turn on the scope but fails to focus on the flying blur in the sky.Having all the data needed for flight calculations, Captain Kid leads them back into the shuttle where he has another big surprise in store. Each crewmember will have a critical role aboard the Nautilus. Charles will be first mate, Dawn the electro-technical officer, William chief engineer, and Ozzie the assistant engineer. The only one aboard who remains merely a “passenger” is Joseph the crab in is travel-size aquarium.The chapter concludes with Charles monitoring the rocket temperatures, still in the red but climbing.Website: thebluedeck.comTwitter: @josephmazerac Facebook:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/JosephMazeracAuthor/YouTube: https://youtu.be/Whg8pkLa7NsEmail: joseph@thebluedeck.com | Big news: Into the Attic of the World is getting published!\xa0Also, Charles and his friends follow Captain Kid up the launch tower. As they climb, they learn the Nautilus shuttle was built in the 1930s by a wizard called Doctor Alkatan. After Charles risks his life boarding the ship, he finds five seats in the cockpit, all with important-looking instrumentation built around the chairs. And they are supposed to fly it, really? When Captain Kid climbs inside, he digs through his backpack, taking out a small glass box and securing it to a bracket mounted on the wall. The box is a miniature aquarium and in it is Joseph, the captain’s pet crab.

Even Church was surprised. Therefore Church not involved. Only tech working was _______ Now back on Space station K-Run. Back on our ship. We get a message from Ambassador Griffin of War-Zod. He has a mission for us. He used to be the Governor of Turn-Out. Used to be a decent, shrewd politician.\xa0 ... He has to play nice with the Church. He has made clear that we have to avoid causing any trouble or interference with the Church. He has lunch with the Priest every day – do not disturb! He has a plan. He gives us information. Ultimately he wants the Church to return to the secular nation it was, with no Church, but he has to be strategic and diplomatic about it.   Said we just got intel on some artefacts the church wants. Order of the Ancient Light – science division of the church of the illumination. They are after particular Pre-Fall equipment. They think it might be able to advance some of their tech significantly. Which is a concern, because their tech is already considerable – they are the ones with the Paladin. Normally the Order of the Righteous Light is what we face, like Street Preachers. Their tech is average.    Rpg Begins: Preamble:  Intel op says the only thing we need to do is connect the two together. The mission is we’re supposed to go to the moon of Nav-Luna. Confed has various planets, one is a gas giant, which has inhabited moons, 3 moons, one is a massive agricultural moon “Nav-Lec” terraformed to be the performed crop, some folks on this moon discovered space travel faster than the others and migrated to another moon. This other moon is a massive forest “Nav Tar”, with trees shaped like mushrooms. - Arkady gets the giggles - These folks never left a feudal system. They are technically allowed to vote as they are part of the Confederation, but the lords never let go of power. This is the 1%, the richest people in the Confederation. Gravity is light, oxygen is low, expensive to live there. Mansions are in the centre of a crater in the centre of the moon, giving the impression they rule all. Hence why they enjoy living there. Their serfs live on one of the other two moons doing all the work. Not technically slaves, but it is indentured servitude and still legal. Can move to the moons if you pay your taxes, but be careful of not getting into major debt with the lords or you will be trapped. Ambassador Griffin wants us to go to a party to one of these mansions, the Fenters. The eldest Fenter daughter may have been one of Terry’s previous clients. Not entirely sure, she could have gone by an alias. Fenters don’t have actual nobility but they are ambitious and want to climb. i.e. many bodies and strategic marriages. The sale and owing of Pre-Fall equipment is illegal in the Confederation. They should be in the possession of Jhodian Record Keepers for assessment and certification, and vertification of no A.I. The Turbo Weasel slips into a loophole because he is slightly sentient. Fenters have an auction going.  Character discussion:  Mama Bear wants to hide knives in her hair. They want the Eye of Neven (necklace with a Gem in the centre from a pre-fall device of unknown origin) to touch the Alien Cube (purpose unknown, from now extinct species Mechnar). We don’t know how long they have to touch, but the idea is they will self destruct. Eye of Neven $23 million. Alien Cube $10.7 million. Mamma Bear has concerns... Potential of self-harm being too close from self-destruction. Potential of starting a war. Characters brainstorm ideas for attaching this mission. We have invites to the party arranged by the Ambassador. Closed auction. No names. Underground style auction. Lava asks what we can do to blend in with the nobility on Nav-Luna. Nobility all know each other but no cross connections across extended family. The location of the auction is in a medium sized crater (Fenter mansion). Mamma Bear suggests being the Matron of a big family with the reputation as a retired war hero. She is hiring Terry as her escort, and Dave is the personal security body guard. Atrium is her artefact advisor/historical curator. Lava is her personal assistance, and Arkady is her niece and ward. Mamma Bear starts building a dossier. Arkady was getting into trouble with the servants and serfs, and is under Mamma Bear’s guidance to get her back in line. Can the Ambassador seed rumours about an off-worlder up and coming family attending the auction/party. Lava asks if there are any outstanding bounties getting picked up by security or scanners. No, our record has been completely cleared. Dave has received a transmission that the ThunderClan (his clan back on War med) is in decline. At one point the ThunderClan had possession of the space port, but no longer. Landing on the planet (War-Med?) is going to be difficult and will have to pay the port person in charge to avoid shooting him down. The crew will need to go shopping and get some party outfits to blend in. Atrium has an idea for how to explain the Matron’s interest in the painting, the item with the lowest starting big on the list. Is there information hidden beneath the top layer of acrylic paint? Or Lava suggest is Mamma Bear just a bit insensible after getting knocked on the head one too many times during the many wars she has fought. Terry has a belated backstory – he has been training with his dad Dave in hand to hand combat. Lava working on her Tengu operation skills, training with mamma bear. Picking up her mech skills and her language. Mamma bear has been putting her through set drills, learning to get into the Tengu quickly and be ready for one action. Arkady has learned repair skills.  | In this Episode of the Star-Fall Actual Play Podcast\xa0 \xa0 GM’s intro: \xa0 Park rangers on war zod decided they are taking sides and are supporting the resistance. But their weapons are designed to fight big animals, not other power armour etc. \xa0 Terry, Lava, Mama Bear, Reza decided to deliver the goods to the forest. Remaining crew’s job is to keep the ship running ready for a speedy getaway. Received a message from unknown person, stating the church fleet is over our ship, orbiting, and we shouldn’t move. At this point, all electronic devices failed for an unknown reason. Dave’s arm did not fail for some reason. A church patrol got the jump on us, and we got captured. We all got tied up, arms behind backs, sitting outside our ship, bound to trees, in a clearing. Bound with synthetic rope that is cut resistant. Church also does not have any electricity or comms. At least 8 in the patrol, standard soldiers, no street preachers. \xa0 Xan tries sleight of hand to get out of ropes to church symbol, but fails. \xa0 Roll perception. \xa0 Arkady sees a claw swipe down from the trees to one of the patrols. \xa0 Gerry tries to convince the standard patrols he is a street preacher because he is wearing the church bible around his neck, but they don’t buy it. \xa0 Everyone hears a strangled guttral animal noise ring out in the forest. \xa0 Anfrazia sees a set of gleaming eyes through the trees. \xa0 Dave tries to extricate himself from his bindings. \xa0 Atrium tries to telepathate to the creatures to encourage them to attack the patrol but ignore us. Fails because doesn’t speak the animal’s language. \xa0 Atrium tries to cast sanctuary around us but fails. Needs more equipment. \xa0 Carselovax/Carserovax - 2 legged creature, larger than goanna, smaller than elome, very strong. \xa0 Gerry knows this species of creature. They work like wolves in packs, to gang up on larger animals, they enjoy hit and run tactics, \xa0 Gerry rips his arm out of his bindings (because he is regenerative), and picks it up in his other arm. He tries to disarm one of the guards, grappling, and convince the patrol of impending danger. \xa0 Anfrazia tries to calm the animal near her. Atrium tries to use psychic ability to talk to the guards, but fails. Dave uses his titanium arm to rip out of his bonds. Anfrazia and Gerry persuade (role play) the guards that they are all in danger and need to work together. The guards are convinced and untie them. Peg leg stu suggests we are safer in the ship than outside, even if it is nonfunctional. Gerry has good knowledge of the Carserovax and says they are curious creatures and may have sneaked into the ship. [ BREAK ] Joined forces with church patrols, and Carserovax. All leaned together to shut the ships’ door physically. Stu sends out a message in the blind stating everyone needs to return to ship to avoid predators, but no replies received. We all have our weapons but ballistics only work, not energy weapons.. \xa0 “Flez” = new term for “flares” derogatory term. \xa0 Need to deal with one of the Carserovax in the ship. Arkady decides to take Dave to find the Carserovax. Walking through the ship, with various systems and functions flickering still trying to power back on. Dave hears something at the helm, like a chewing and growling noise. Dave still has his uber skrup nasty and battle rifle. Finds Carserovax lying on its back, which is odd. There is something with large teeth-like tusks designed for ripping carcasses apart, 8 eyes, 6 legs. The scratches in the paint through the hallway are from its sides and spine, because it is so large. It hasn’t noticed us yet because it is still eating. Arkady and Dave decide to back away slowly. Gerry recognizes it as a Thunderbear. It is very dangerous because most weapons bounce off of them. Atrium tries to Hide Arkady so they can consider calling the church for help, but fails. They decide to go through the forest and light a bonfire at night, which is an offense, to catch the attention of Park Rangers, who are decked out to fight creatures like Thunderbears. A black Turbo Weasel finds them, and closely followed by a Park Ranger. They spot the church people and goes into combat mode. Gerry yells to try to stop them. The Park Ranger, power armour goes onto one knee, helmet opens up, old guy with beard and couple scars from creature fights. He climbs out of power armour and pulls out a staff. Asks them for an explanation. Gerry explains we have a Thunderbear in our ship and none of the electricity works. Stu mentions we are being chased by church and Park Ranger gives a look saying they will deal with that later. Pulls out a half leg of something from his storage compartment and throws it onto the fire. \xa0“And now we wait” he says. Park ranger climbs back into power armour. \xa0 Thunderbear moves out of helm, down hallway, out of ship, and leaps onto the burning meat in the fire. Park Ranger uses his staff to thwack the head of the Thunderbear and yells at the others to get inside. \xa0 Atrium rolls lowest but animals do not perceive G’dar as food due to sensory shield. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 | Gerry makes a small sacrifice\xa0to save the team\xa0 What are those glowing red eyes? How can The Fifth Crew escape from the Church of the illumination patrol?\xa0 Star-Fall RPG Science Fiction Podcast\xa0", 'chan_desc': 'RPG roleplaying in the world of Star-Fall.

And at the edges, three walls, one to each side. Left, Right, and South. Together they cut the shape of birds flying in formation. Along most of the Right wall was green and open country. While a\xa0 dark and thorny bramble lay in the land to the Left, running up against the wall on that side. From  there were the lowlands, in and towards the center. Wet in the rains with swamp. Then a gentle rise up to the heart of the North. Here the tree stood enormous at the place where the land came to the final height of its long plateau.The dry highland rolled on until it winnowed into just a sliver at the corner of the world\xa0 where the Left wall met the Right. This place - his country - all of it taken together, was everything he knew.\xa0            A hundred families lived in burrows under the roots of the tree. A few dozen more were scattered in the lowlands, but these were mostly scraggly loners. Always hungry. They fled to the tree in the rains and were pushed out in the dry season. There was not enough to feed them. There was one family who\xa0 made a life for themselves in the bramble. No one else knew the paths, and it was dangerous to go there. The open land was dangerous too, the young mouse had been told this all his life. But he only came to understand the lesson when one day he was snatched in the talons of a hawk.            He thought he was dead, but the talons wrapped around him and he saw the ground was very far away now. He couldn’t see one blade of grass for another, just the enormous field of it. The hawk turned and the young mouse was sure the speed of it would kill him. Then the tree was in front of him. It was huge, the size of everything. And the hawk was at the top of it. Above the tree! Then the young mouse was falling, and he was scared he’d fall the height of the world. At least, he thought, this was a wild way to die. Far better like this than wracked with hunger or drowning in mud.            But then he was on his feet. It was some place at the crest of the tree, a twist of twigs and grass that curled up at the sides and was at least as large as any hollow he had ever seen. This was the home of the hawk. A nest. He had only heard stories. He crawled to the edge of it and looked down. He could see nothing of the world though, since the huge branches and countless leaves of the tree blocked his view. And so instead of looking down, he looked out. There he saw the shock of his life.\xa0            For as far as the young mouse could see, there was nothing but green. A hundred hundred trees, going on as far as the sky. This one now, the great tree, was just a one. Huge but almost nothing against the horrible mass of the rest. He might have died.            He didn’t know what to do so he went back down into the nest where the hawk had dropped him. He hadn’t seen it at first, but off to one side there was a bundle of feathers not much bigger than the mouse himself. It unfolded and he saw that it was more than just feathers, and anyway far larger than him. A beak and ugly grey eyes came out. Scrawny legs and wings that looked nearly naked. It was a young hawk, gross and more awkward than its parent. But still, it was a hawk. It clicked and moved towards him.\xa0            The young mouse was faster though and he darted\xa0 onto the long branch that reached up from the tree and held the nest in its place. He was on it fast as the grown hawk swooped low again to grab him. He was in the leaves now though and then to a hollow where the wood ruffled and curved in on itself. It was dark and he was inside the tree and the wood underfoot was wet and soft. There was no light except from behind him, and he knew that that way there was only death. He ran at a sprint down the slant and the hollow narrowed. Through a tight pokehole and there he stopped and all he heard was the sound of his own panicked breathing. He sucked air in and held it. It was quiet.            There was the whistling sound of a breeze and all the wood of the tree creaked around him. There was nowhere to go but down. He went slowly, moving by feel in the dark. It was a long way but after a while he could smell the familiar scent of other mice, and then he was in tunnels that he recognized but only faintly. As if he hadn’t come this way since he was small. Then onto the wider paths where smell was strong and memory faithful and here he could move fast with confidence. Around a bend and he was in the great hollow under the tree. His blood was still pounding and he called out for help. Soon there was a crowd around him and he told them what he had seen. He did not speak or use words, but they understood him in the way that mice do.\xa0            “I have seen something horrible and beautiful,” he said, “The hawk took me as prey to its nest above the tree. I escaped, but from up there I could see that our tree is not the center of everything, but only one of many. As far as there was, there were trees. Beyond the three walls, there is a world beyond the three walls, there is a great forever. Our world is a lie.”            There were shouts from the crowd and a mother grabbed her child and darted back down a tunnel. He started to talk them down again when a silence fell over them. He knew the smell and the sound of the old mouse as he came slowly to the front. He walked with a long dragging limp.\xa0            “It is true,” the old mouse said, “there is a world beyond our walls. But it is only horror, not beauty. There is nothing for us there, nothing but death and desperation.”            “How do you know?” the young mouse said.            “I have seen it,” the old mouse replied, “When I was young like you, I went out and I saw the horror. No one else survived. I beg you. Do not go.”            “I hear you,” the young mouse said, “but I do not believe you. Either you have not seen what I have, or you are made of smaller stuff than I. Now that I have seen the world as it is, how could I stay the slave to ignorance that I once had been? We are not worms, we are mice! What would I be if I did not press the edge of what is known? Ours is to build and to explore. To grow and to dream. Without that, what are we? What would you have me be?”            The old mouse tried to speak but the young mouse was tired of his fear and cowardice. He pushed him back and shouted to the crowd.            “Who’s with me?”            A rowdy few ran forward. Some of the old and the mother were horrified, but that was their way, and his was to dare to live in spite of them. They readied themselves to leave and the little group was out on the march within the hour. In the open field he could see the hawk circling above. But even she must have sensed the power in their newfound force of will. She did not dive or try to stop them.            From what the young mouse had seen, he knew that it did not matter which way they went. The world was free and enormous all around them. But they made for the place in the North where Left and Right met, not out of necessity, but simply out of feeling. It seemed to the young mouse and the rest that they should head northward, onward, upward, and out into the world. Left or Right would do the job, but didn’t seem nearly bold enough.            And so they came to the place where two of the old world’s three great walls met. They were sheer rock, grey stone rising from the grass to a height not as tall as the tree, but still higher than any mouse could climb. About halfway up the face of the right wall there were great symbols and signs drawn across the face of the rock in bright yellow and red. The colors had faded and chipped in places. These symbols were as old as the world. No one could read them. And yet every mouse knew them, had stared at least once and tried to guess at their meaning. Now the young mouse looked up with the daring hope of understanding. Maybe all the secrets of this world lay just beyond the walls that made the edge of it.            At the very foot of them the ground was wet and slick with mud. Almost no grass grew here in the shade. None of the mice had spent too much time this far North. There had always been nothing for them here. Until now. Where the mass of rock -the edge of everything- met the ground, the young mouse stared up undaunted at the face of existence. The others looked to him as a leader, and then for the first time since he’d been carried to the top of the tree, he felt helpless. There was no way he could lead his people over the wall. And yet then, he remembered. They were mice. They were not like other creatures, the cricket, the squirrel, or even the hawk. No, their way was to shape the world, to make it as they needed it to be. With power in his voice he told them to dig.            The ground was wet and the going was hard, but they were strong and sure and many, and they had a dream of a new world inside of them. Soon they were underground and the old world was behind them, the walls were overhead, and the new dream was only as far away as they could dig themselves. There was no way they could know when they had gone far enough, and so he decided their only choice was to go on digging. In the heat of the dark he finally reached a place where the dirt was dry. He kept going. Then before he knew how or why, the ground shifted, and in the dark he could not see what had happened. But he felt the earth collapsing,\xa0 sliding fast behind him now and he heard the rest of them shouting, screaming as the dirt muffled their life and the darkness and the mud fell in around them. And then the sound of them was gone but still he did not stop digging. All of them were dead, and still he did not stop digging. Until with tears in his eyes he felt the ground grow soft again. And then it was easy now to dig and he could see the edge of sunlight peeking through ahead of him. He clawed into the air.\xa0            The young mouse was breathing hard and he was blind in the light of the new world. But as sight came back to him he wished that he could not see. He saw that it was night now, but light shone down beneath the black sky from strange trees that grew above him. The great walls lay just behind, and he had come out in a narrow strip of grass. Beyond that the breath caught in his lungs. There was a great expanse of stone and ages beyond, countless great green trees. Just as he had seen. But between here and there, only horror. It could not be. Monsters chased each other across the expanse of stone. Faster than a rain, faster than a hawk, faster than God, the strange and enormous great wheeled beasts thundered after each other, their eyes bright and blinding like suns, and their skins shining black and silver and every other color there ever was or never had been. The young mouse collapsed at the sight of this great death, the scale and horror of these demons. The ground shook at their power, and he shattered before them. Their roar so loud he could not hear his own wailing. There was no way forward. For him, no way back. The old mouse had been right. There was nothing beyond the edge of the world.\xa0 |        Tom was a midlevel advertising executive at a Christmas party with his wife. She was a strong, practical sort of blonde and she wore two inch heels with a blue dress that fell at mid-thigh. The two of them were off by themselves, next to a pillar where they had a good view down Park Avenue.\xa0 They’d both made good Christmas bonuses, and he thought he might surprise her with a last-minute trip to the Virgin Islands. He squeezed her palm between his thumb and first two fingers. She put her head against the lapel of his blazer, and Tom went to caress her neck but then decided against it. He knew that he’d hear from her later if he ruined her hair.\xa0Instead he kissed her on the bridge of her nose and told her he’d be right back. He was going to the bathroom to book the trip from his phone. It was a little away from the party, down a hallway with fine wood floors. He knocked, and when no one responded he went in. But where he expected to step onto white bathroom tile, instead there was only darkness, a strange and absolute nothing. Tom shouted as the door swung shut behind him and he fell headfirst into the black.\xa0He was tumbling slow and weightless and his clothing floated like he was a mile underwater. He realized he could still see his hands and arms despite the total darkness. There were no shadows either, like he was lit without a source of light. He was turning all the time, and couldn’t tell whether he was falling or rising. He had no sense of “down”. Before too long he was upright again though as his body made one final twist and his feet slammed against the ground.He was in a bathroom, but this was not the one in his office. His hands were shaking, and Tom splashed water in his face and slapped himself across both cheeks. His lungs seized as his body realized what had just happened. He checked his pulse and eyed himself in the mirror to check for drooping lips or sagging eyes. Tom assumed that he’d just had a stroke.\xa0      But he looked fine. In fact, he looked better than fine. He was tanner than before, his neck was tighter, and the wrinkles by his eyes were thinner while the speckled gray in his hair was replaced with an inky jet blank. For a moment, Tom thought that he looked younger, and then he realized. He’d definitely had work done.He left the bathroom and found himself at a completely different Christmas party than the one he left. There was loud music playing, and this place was decadent. Almost everyone was beautiful. Not just good looking, but striking in a way that was surreal. A few of them gave him nods, and a redhead in a plush looking miniskirt smiled. A drunk old man in an expensive suit waved a glass of whiskey in his direction. Tom held his breath and pushed through the crowd and out onto the balcony. They were in midtown, overlooking the Christmas tree at Rockefeller center. There was music and a stage and the square was filled with people. They were turning on the lights tonight. He closed his eyes and put his head in his hands. After a minute he was interrupted.\xa0“There you are. I was wondering where you went.”Tom looked up. There was a beautiful asian woman standing in front of him. She wore loose pants and a black and gold top that made her look regal. He noticed a bulge in her stomach, and realized she was pregnant. She didn’t slouch though, and she exuded an enormous sense of ease and pride. Immediately Tom was drawn to her by a feeling in the base of his chest.“Is something wrong?” she said.“No. I’m just drunk,” he looked into her eyes. There was a silent wit and curiosity there. Tom breathed deep, and he felt his blood purr. The tips of his fingers buzzed. “How was your night?”She took a step towards him, and a delicate finger traced the outline of his thumb.\xa0“It’s been good,” she laid her head on his chest. He felt the bulge of her stomach press against his waist and he tensed. “I was just talking to Catherine,” she said, “and you know how she is. But she was saying how after all the awards, it would be funny if we named the baby Oscar.”“Oscar.” Tom could hear his heart beating in his ears. He felt the cold on his skin just like any other night and he thought back to his wife on Park avenue. Then he ran his fingers through this strange woman’s hair, and he rubbed the base of her head where it met her neck. She was warm. "I don’t really think we should do it,” she said. “The tabloids would never stop talking. But I don’t know. It is funny. And I like the idea of naming him after a success.” She paused. “What do you think?” She looked up, and her eyes destroyed him.\xa0“What do I think?”\xa0In an instant he realized he loved this woman. And he was horrified. He felt his chest twist as he remembered his other life. The comfortable one he’d already spent so long living. He remembered the wife whose name he actually knew. Tom pushed past the perfect woman on the balcony and sprinted to the bathroom. He swung open the door, fell into the darkness, and landed back in his own office bathroom. The music was quiet here, and he ran out into his Christmas party somehow sure that because he’d come back, he could never return. He went to his wife and he smiled, but there was pain in his gut when he looked in her eyes. He felt nothing. |           In Chicago there’s a place by Lake Michigan where you can get dinner with a god. It’s small, a fancy setup with a view of the water and only room for two. A seat there costs more than a car, but if you pay the price you can ask the god anything you like. And she knows everything there is to know.\xa0          Raymond King was willing to pay the price. He pulled up to the unassuming little building and parked his expensive car around back. He wore a dark suit and an overripe purple tie. Inside he took his seat at a square table in the center of a quietly opulent yet mostly empty room. There was no music playing, and the full darkness of the place drew his eyes off towards the broad bright window to his right. The endless bulk of the lake lurched out to the horizon, and the sky above it was turning its evening shade of shadow bruised blue. It would be night soon. He waited and watched the turning of the sky.          Then he heard the sound of a woman’s high heels clicking on hardwood. The lake and the sky were quickly forgotten. She was coming. Ray stared straight ahead, towards the sound of the footsteps and a door at the far end of the room. His shirt collar felt tight as the sound of her came closer. He worried that his suit would seem too big, that he’d look like an impostor or a child when she finally came through that door. He breathed deep and rolled his shoulders back , set his eyes hard ahead and reminded himself who he was. And then, all at once, the clicking stopped. He turned in his seat, confused. And then she was there, impossible and beautiful, as she appeared in an instant and without a sound in the\xa0 seat on the other side of the table across from him. At the same time, a single cut of steaming red meat appeared on the plate in front of him. It smelled like heat and iron.          “Raymond King,” her voice was clear and strong, and without a hint of malice. She had sharp, knowing eyes and just a ghost of a smile at the edge of her mouth.\xa0          “Yes,” he said, after a moment of shock, “Thank you for having me.” He waited. “What’s your name?”          “My name isn’t important,” she said.          “Now that’s not fair,” Ray smiled, “I thought I got to ask you anything I want.”          “Oh you do. But that doesn’t mean I have to answer.”          “Well that’s no fun. How do I know you’re not just gonna cut me off once I get to something you don’t wanna tell?”          “Well you’re just going to have to trust me. I’m very generous with what I know. Just not with my name.”          “I hope so. I have lots of questions.”          “Oh really,” her ghost of a smile became a hint of one, “Prove it.”          Ray scanned the room. His eyes fell on the thick wooden floor boards, and then he turned to take in the lake and the sky that lay just outside the window before his gaze drifted back to the table where a single lonely plate sat with a thick cut of meat precisely seasoned and artfully arranged in the center. Ray nodded.          “Let’s start simple,” he said, and edged the plate an inch in her direction, “Where did this come from?”          “That’s what you want to know. It’s Chilean beef, farm raised, fresh, slaughtered three days ago.”Ray sat back in his seat.          “Is that it?” he said.\xa0          “You want more.”          “Is there more?”          “There’s always more,” she said “But most things are simple. Most things are better without the details. The story can be bigger than the thing itself.”\xa0          “Give me all of it,” he said, “I want to hear it all.”          “You want it all.”          “Yes. What’s the story behind this thing? What’s the whole story?”          She breathed deep, and Ray realized that she blinked for the first time since they’d started talking. There was no strain, no effort, nothing close to a sign of struggle. And yet Ray knew that in the span of that breath she was feeling and seeing more than any human mind would ever know.          “The cow never had a name,” she said, “but it was well loved by a farmer called Augustin Romano. He only ever raised a dozen animals at a time, and the last few years it’s just been eight, since he’s old and his sons Matias and Martin have moved away to Santiago to learn to be teachers. This cow was one of those eight, and Augustin raised it from birth to be a prime cut, a tender big ticket cow for rich customers in other countries, places that he knew he would never visit. He woke up with the sun every morning to massage its legs and its neck and its chest. He spent more time with that cow than his own wife.\xa0          “And yet he never named it, because he never loved it. He only ever loved what it could give him. Augustin knew that cow would make him enough money to send his sons to school for another year, if he raised it right. So he fed it by hand. And the grass he grabbed was grown from soil that was dead a thousand years. And before that the dirt had been a warrior, a Mapuche fighter named Cautaro who before he rotted had been called to defend his town. But he was young and untrained, and although he felt honor in his chest and pride that he would serve his people, when he went to battle he took a spear in the shoulder and died bleeding next to his friends within eyeshot of the only place they’d ever known. But soon that place was ash and their bodies baked in the sun and turned slick in the rain, and soon they were nothing but bones and then nothing but dirt and nothing but grass in the hand of a father feeding a cow that was killed three days ago and flown to Chicago to be seasoned by a cook who based his flavors on the smells his mother made in their kitchen to distract herself from the bruises the father left on her body and hid from the son who would season the steak that I just served to you.”          She looked Ray hard in the eyes.          “That’s the whole story,” she said, “or at least. Enough.”          Ray leaned back in his seat.\xa0          “Yeah, that’ll do.”', 'chan_desc': 'Subscribe for stories every week that range in style and genre, but always leave you thinking', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts113/v4/1b/7c/65/1b7c65d6-dc07-cab8-c9be-95767642489f/mza_7842901574844806651.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-08-14'}}

This is our last foray into the mind of John Wilkins, a 17th century alien enthusiast. With one foot in science, one in philosophy, and a vestigial third set firmly in religion, he lays down his final arguments for a habitable world in the Moone. | We forge ahead with Proposition 2 in this episode. This section is all about the good book. Are we Heretiques for believing the Moone might be habitable? Was Moses keeping secrets from us? And what of this musicke of the spheares? John Wilkins lays it out for us in "all possible brevity". | We\'re seven episodes in, that means it\'s time to break format. Join me in a live reading of a totally bonkers historical document that teeters on the edge of science fiction and science fact. Fair warning: dude is windy. So windy that we just barely cover the preface in this episode. But it wouldn\'t be a podcast if I didn\'t cut him off every few sentences or so and interject my own commentary. | Why is this space-faring craft addressed like a gentleman? Should we give the author of this episode\'s short story the same honorific? In 1953, Mr. Phil Dick wrote a pleasant little ditty about a very special spaceship —\xa0listen in and find out how this ship came to be "Mr." Spaceship. Tweet me @wetjosh to tell me your thoughts on the story. | With this episode, we jump ahead about 60 years from when our last story was written. Still well before what would be dubbed the Golden Age of Science Fiction, this story is a bit less sciencey, and a bit more fiction. Written by a woman, Leslie F. Stone, at a time when getting a story published as such was no small feat. She provides a unique perspective in this tale of future colonialism and forces the reader (or listener) to step outside status quo. | All good stories have an end. In this episode we check in on our friends above for the last time. We also randomly check in on an extinct species. Listen carefully to find out which one! | Welp...things didn\'t go quite as planned for Mr. Ingham and friends. Needless to say, construction came to an abrupt halt. Are there any survivors? Are we to ever know the fate of the premature world? Edward E. Hale answers these questions and more in the third installment of his story, The Brick Moon. | The plans are laid, the funds are secured (most of them anyway), and we\'ve got some eager bricklayers just begging to get their hands dirty. In the second part of Edward E. Hale\'s, The Brick Moon, we will find out if the sucker gets built! | We begin with a story concerning the age old problem of the longitude.

Apparently scientists have been growing brain organoids for a while – taking human stem cells and cultivating little clusters of neurons, to help with brain disease research. At some point someone raised the ethical question, “what if we grow a brain that gains consciousness?” But everyone pooh-poohed that idea, I mean, come on, it’s just a cluster of cells, right? | Hi guys, Rob here. This story's been bouncing around in my head for a loooong time. I hate to do this, but once again I can't tell you much about it up front, other than it's about a heist with two long-time professional thieves, and that their mission doesn't go as expected. | Hey, Rob here. This is another quickie, so I don’t want to say much other than it’s about that weird, cigar-shaped object that came hurtling past Earth about a year and a half ago, named Oumuamua. That much is true. The rest, well…? | Hi guys! Rob here, welcome back, I’ve got a little holiday treat for you… This story was inspired by a video I saw, yes, it was one of those days you don’t know how, but you wind up an hour later watching a YouTube video of someone driving around what looks like a ghost town, right near Area 51 in Nevada. It’s a real town, called Silver Peak, and the video gives you this creepy feeling, and so of course I thought, “What secret might be hiding in this town?” Then, I don’t know why, I got the idea that a mash-up of Bridges of Madison County would be fun. And then I heard a holiday song on the radio or something, and thought, “Oooh, even better: I’ll make it a Christmas story!” Enjoy. | Hey guys!\xa0This is another one of those short stories where if I tell you anything, it’ll give it away. But I can tell you it’s about Artificial Intelligence, and the “Singularity,” the name scientists and futurists give the moment that computers match and surpass human intelligence. | Hi guys! I don't want to give too much away on this story, so I'll just say it was inspired by something I saw that made me think that some people are so gifted, it's impossible for me not to think they somehow touch something divine. Let's get right to it! | Hi guys! Today’s short story was inspired by an article I read in the New York Times about a couple of men who, many years after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011, still go diving every day looking for remains of their loved ones. It’s so sad, they understand I think the futility of the search, but something compels them to never give up, and it becomes a ritual to honor the dead, or sorts, or at least that’s what I thought of it. So as I’m reading this article, of course, I say to myself, “What if…?” and this story spilled out of my head, complete. | Hey guys! I just read an article yesterday, about Mark and Scott Kelly, the twin astronauts, and how Scott came back after a record length trip aboard the International Space Station, and they found that his DNA was no longer identical to his twin, Mark. What an intriguing premise for a story, right? And I’m also a twin, so the idea wouldn’t get out of my head. I decided to make this one a little more like a series on conversations I might have with my twin brother if we were astronauts and something like this happened, so it reads more like a radio play, with nothing but dialog. Enjoy! | Another quickie, almost flash fiction at just 1,000 words, about a mysterious signal received from space. Is it a message, or something else? | A couple of teenagers find something on one of their phones that couldn't possibly be true. Or could it? Enjoy!", 'chan_desc': 'Hi, Rob Dircks here.
