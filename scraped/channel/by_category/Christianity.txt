We have been created to need other people. Deeply. However, our need for others can make us feel weak or “too needy.” How are we to navigate this? | In a previous episode, we looked at how we can make agreements with evil that bind us. Today I talk about how to break those agreements. I also share some thoughts about how to resist evil by addressing evil spirits that may be assaulting you. Jesus has given us the weaponry to be successful in warfare. Your words and your will are your weapons. | In Warfare Part 5, we look at how to wage war against the kingdom of darkness. Warfare move #1 is to pay attention to your life and question the voices, particularly the voices of accusation that you hear throughout your day. The first tactic in waging war is paying attention to what you are hearing and then determining the source of that voice. You can discern the source of the voice with a simple question: what is its tone and tenor?\xa0 | When it comes to resisting the assaults of evil against your heart, the starting place is stepping into the authority that is yours. Jesus Christ has set you up to succeed in warfare with evil. However, it’s essential to get clear about the authority that Jesus has delegated to you. This entire podcast began with the claim that “you have a story and that story matters.” The corollary today is “you have authority and that authority matters.” Are you aware of your authority? | We are in the middle of a series of episodes on warfare. Last time we talked about making agreements with evil… and how those agreements bind us. Today we are going to take a break from the series to hear Susan’s story. Part of my interview with Susan includes a discussion about an agreement she made. I wanted to make the previous episode practical by sharing a specific example of someone who made an agreement in a moment of heartache. | We live in a world in which the kingdom of darkness wars against our hearts. Today we look at the second main tactic of evil—namely, to deceive you to make agreements with it. But what are “agreements with evil” and how are they made? We’ll explore both of those questions in depth.\xa0 | In Warfare Part 1, we looked at the fact that The Place We Find Ourselves is living in the midst of a world at war. Today, in Part 2, we look at how, specifically, the kingdom of darkness wages war against your heart. What are evil’s goals, strategies, tactics? The kingdom of darkness primarily uses two simple tactics: deception and accusation. Today we focus on accusation.\xa0 | We live in a world at war. It’s a war between light and darkness, between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Evil. This is the place we find ourselves. In the episodes to follow we’ll look at how evil operates and how to fight back to win the war for your heart and the hearts of those you love. | Today’s episode focuses on how attachment styles play out in close relationships. I am joined by Rachel Blackston, who is a therapist in Orlando, Florida. Rachel begins today’s conversation by reading an essay about love and war in her marriage. It’s a beautiful and vulnerable piece that gives you a window into how insecure attachment plays out in a real-life marriage. I’m deeply grateful to Rachel for her willingness to dive head first into this very difficult and important arena. You can read more about Rachel at rachelblackston.com. | I am joined today by Scott Gibson who is a therapist in the Chicago area. Scott graciously shares a story about himself as an 11 year old boy. It’s a story about desire, about devastation, and especially about attachment. If you resonate with Scott’s words today, you might want to go back and listen to Episode 14 in which Scott talks more about his own story, particularly with regard to engaging the harm of sexual abuse.', 'chan_desc': 'The Place We Find Ourselves podcast features private practice therapist Adam Young (LCSW, MDiv) and interview guests as they discuss all things related to story, trauma, attachment, and interpersonal neurobiology.

If you’ve had a powerful moment with Jesus in the Eucharist, briefly share that with your group. How can I/do I enter more fully into the mystery of the Eucharist and liturgy? What are some tangible ways you can make the Eucharist the source and summit in your life and the life of your family?  \xa0 Journal Questions:  In what ways have I become “too familiar” with sacred things, sacred spaces, and the Eucharist? How can I further prepare my heart to receive Jesus in the Eucharist? In what places of your heart do you need God to open your eyes to see who He is? What does the “spousal language” we used in the podcast, stir in your heart? Are there any parts that you need to ask Jesus to heal?  \xa0 Quote to Ponder - “I would like to rekindle this Eucharistic “amazement”- Saint John Paul II  Scripture for Lectio Divina - \xa0John 6:35-36 “Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.” | How to Accompany Someone Through A Hard Season In this episode we talk about how to journey with each other through hardships and offer the powerful gift of presence. Walking through suffering with each other is sacred ground, so we need to learn how to become a compassionate presence and honor the vulnerability in others, while also being vulnerable ourselves. We talk about how to discern what we are able to offer to others and how we need to ask the Holy Spirit how to respond instead of falling into codependency or taking on the problems of others. \xa0 Sister Miriam’s one thing - Surrender Prayer\xa0 God, my Father, I thank you for all that you are, and all that you do for me through your son Jesus Christ. I praise you for my life, for your mercy and for your Eucharist.\xa0 \xa0In Jesus’ name, Father, I place myself entirely in your Heart. I surrender to you my whole self, my heart, my mind, my memory, my imagination, my will, my emotions, my passions, my desires, my body, my sexuality, my desire for human approval, my weaknesses, my sins. \xa0I surrender every person in my life to you. I surrender every situation in my life to you. I surrender every relationship I am in to you. I surrender every concern I have to you. I surrender every fear I have to you. I surrender every doubt I have to you. I surrender all confusion I have to you. I surrender all sadness I am experiencing in my heart to you. I surrender all my wounds to you. I surrender all anxiety and worry I have to you. I surrender all that deceives me in my heart to you. I trust you to care for me and others in a perfectly loving way. As I have emptied myself, and surrendered everything to you, I ask you now, Father, to fill me with your Holy Spirit and all the gifts and fruits of your Spirit. Holy Spirit you are the source of love, hope, joy, peace, patience, goodness, gentleness, tenderness, faithfulness, humility, and self-control. Purify my desires. Help me to open my heart to you. Help me to become perfectly receptive as a pure child. Help me to believe in your love for me. Help me to hope in your love. Help me to receive from the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus all grace and virtues necessary for me to become the person you created me to be. I ask this in the Name of Jesus Christ, Your son, God Almighty Father. O Most Holy Immaculate Virgin Mary. I entrust this prayer to your Heart, and ask you to press it to your sorrowful and immaculate heart and intercede for me to your Son Jesus.

What does it look like to make space for each other? What is the difference between loving someone well and becoming codependent? Why is the gift of presence so healing and powerful?  \xa0 Journal Questions:  Is there someone in your life that needs your heart and presence right now? What is a hard place in your own life that you need the presence of someone close to you? How can you ask them for that? Are there relationships where you are trying to be the savior instead of letting Jesus be Savior.  \xa0 Quote to Ponder - “I am struck by how sharing our weakness and difficulties is more nourishing to others than sharing our qualities and successes.” - Jean Vanier  Scripture for Lectio Divina - \xa02 Corinthians 9-10 “but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.” | I Choose You In this episode we talk about the beautiful words of Jesus in John 15:16 where he tells us that He has chosen us and that his desire is that we bear fruit that will last. It’s the deepest desires of every heart to be known, to be chosen, and to belong, but often we don’t believe the truth of our belovedness in the core of our being. We chat about the difference between fruit that lasts and success and how being rooted deeply in Jesus is essential for good fruit in our life.

How do you feel when you imagine God saying to you “ I choose you”. What is one wound that you need Jesus to speak into. To speak His words of healing that you belong? Discuss the difference between fruit that lasts and success? Where do you hope to see good fruit in your life?  \xa0 Journal Questions:  Do you know deep in your gut that you belong to God? Why or why not? Where are you striving to find your identity outside of God? Do you love to be loved or do you love because you’ve first received it?  \xa0 Quote to Ponder - “Let\'s remind one another that what brings true and healing joy is not successfulness, but fruitfulness" - Henri Nouwen  Scripture for Lectio Divina - John 15:16 “You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last” | Words Have Power In this episode we talk about how words have incredible power to either bless or curse, to build up or tear down. We talk about how social media can be a place of connection, but also a place where we quickly forget to treat people with dignity. The truth that our words have power to restore, heal, be prophetic is something that can challenge us to be more discerning about how we speak and take the lead by being people who bless others.

When have you witnessed the desire to be right as more important than caring for and respecting another person? Is this something you have struggled with?   What would it look like if we all started intentionally offering life giving words to those around us instead of criticism, negative humor, and harshness?   How might God be calling you to speak goodness and blessing to someone in your life?   \xa0 Journal Questions:   What type of patterns have you gotten into with not using your words to bring life?   Is the Holy Spirit asking you to go back and ask forgiveness from someone who you have hurt with your words?   Take time to reflect on how you speak to others, your tone and your words. How do you think other people feel when you speak to them?   \xa0 Quote to Ponder: “Do not accept anything as truth that lacks love and do not accept anything as love that lacks truth.\xa0 One without the other is a destructive lie” - St Teresa Benedicta of the Cross \xa0 Scripture for Lectio Divina - Proverbs 16:24 “Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.” | Welcome to Season 6! To kick off our new season, we dive in deep and talk about how we are all called to live a life of holiness. We discuss that in the midst of difficulty all around us, we are called to pursue a disciplined spiritual life and live radical holiness. We also talk about the tension between accepting our weakness, but not justifying our sin. The truth is that we have to be willing to go down to the depths, so that God can truly raise us from the dead to new life. Sister Miriam’s one thing -  Fr. Jacques Phillipe’s book/guided retreat “The Way of Trust and Love”\xa0 Michelle’s one thing - Maverick City Music “Real Thing” Heather’s one thing - Bishop Robert Barron’s book “Letter to a Suffering Church”\xa0 Discussion questions:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  What decisions do you need to make in this season to grow in holiness? How does our Catholic theology move from understanding to becoming an everyday reality for you and your family? What is one area that you need to grow in discipline and self control that will lead to a good fruit in your life? What is holding you back from going “all the way down” to the depths of your own heart, where we need to experience the power of the Holy Spirit and His freedom? What would be your theme song right now in this season of life?  Journal Questions:  Try to journal out a spiritual plan for this year. What are the main areas that you want to focus on? What places of laziness, hardness of heart, discipline, do you want to grow in? What is one relationship you are struggling with that you need to ask yourself, “how can I respond in love to this person”? What is one sin that you try to justify in your life? How can you surrender this to God and the power of His grace today? What are some survival techniques that have helped you to get through previous seasons, but are not going to work for you in this new season?  \xa0 Quote to Ponder: “instead of viewing your poverty as a handicap, and obstacle, accept it and welcome it as a grace” - Jesus to St. Thérèse (from The Way of Trust and Love)  Scripture for Lectio Divina - 2 Corinthians 12:9 “but he said to me “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.” | This is our final episode of season 5! We revisit some of our favorite episodes and talk about the beautiful moments we have experienced with our community of listeners and Facebook discussion group.

Chesterton Scripture for Lectio Divina - 2 Corinthians 4:15 “Yes, everything is for your sake, so that grace, as it extends to more and more people, may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.” | In this episode of the Abiding Together Podcast, we discuss the power of living a forgiving life, especially when it comes to parenting children, and how unforgiveness in our life can keep us in bondage, and stems from a wound that needs healing. We talk about how sometimes forgiveness feels like we are letting people off the hook, instead of it being a willingness to release our grasp and open ourselves up to God\'s grace. One Thing We Love this Week  Sister Miriam’s one thing - Seeking Healing Through Forgiveness SEEK Talk with Fr. John Burns Michelle’s one thing - Endow - Discovering the Doctors Michelle’s other one thing - Story of forgiveness Heather’s one thing - Blessed is She daily devotional for children ages 8-12 called Rise Up  Discussion Questions  What is one area where you are finding it hard to offer forgiveness?

How can you model a life of forgiveness? If you have children, how can you teach your children about forgiveness? How have you experienced the mercy of God in your life?  Journal Questions  Who in your life do you need to offer forgiveness to? What is holding you back from this?

What does a rebirth or renaissance of the family look like in our world today? Journal Questions Sit with the words, as if said from God the Father, “I am proud of you”. What stirs in your heart? Who in your life has revealed the heart of God the Father to you? In what areas do you need to experience restoration in your relationship with your earthly father and with God the Father? Quote to Ponder “I know I can trust God the Father as my dad” - Fr. Mike Schmitz Scripture for Lectio Divina - 1 John 3:1 “See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are.” | As we approach Pentecost this week, we thought it would be awesome to re-release our conversation from last year about the Holy Spirit with our dear friend, Fr. Dave Pivonka TOR. Fr. Dave created the popular series on the Holy Spirit called “The Wild Goose” with 4PM Media and he was just named the new President of Franciscan University. We had the pleasure of hearing Fr. Dave’s story and chatted with him about how to have a relationship with the Holy Spirit and practical ways to open up to a new Pentecost in our own hearts. We were moved and inspired by this conversation and hope that you will be too. You can check out the free Wild Goose Series here.

Discussion Questions  Have you ever pondered the idea that the Holy Spirit never leaves us? Discuss how this truth could change the experience of how you go through daily life? Scripture says, “where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom”. What area do you need the Holy Spirit to bring freedom to in your life right now? How are you going to prepare for a deeper encounter with the Holy Spirit as we approach Pentecost this Sunday?  Journal Questions  How could you open your heart to the Holy Spirit in a deeper way this Pentecost? Fire illuminates what we cannot see.

How would your life look differently if you truly lived in freedom?  Quote to Ponder “The Holy Spirit brings people into divine life as children of God where they can live, as true children, in a relationship of intimacy, freedom, and faith in the love and mercy of God.” – Pope Francis Scripture for Lectio Divina - 2 Corinthians 3:17 “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” | Today on the Abiding Together Podcast, Sr. Miriam, Michelle, and Heather discuss how to have fruitful and authentic small group discussions that provide safety and opportunities for deep connection with others. We give insights into how to talk in a vulnerable way, how to sit at one another’s feet and listen, and what the ingredients are for meaningful conversations. We hope this offers some helpful insights for going deeper in your friendships and small faith groups with other women.

Quote to Ponder “We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.” - Brene Brown Scripture for lectio divina - Sirach 14-16 “Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth.
