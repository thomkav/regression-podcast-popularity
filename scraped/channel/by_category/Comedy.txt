They were, collectively, convicted of seventeen. But they definitely didn\'t kill some of the people they were convicted of killing. They would confess to over 600. And they for sure didn\'t kill all of them. But they may have killed others they never confessed too. They were definitely murderers and they were definitely liars and they seemed to enjoy lying more than murdering. And unlike most criminals, they loved to lie about crimes they definitely didn\'t commit. They were terrible men who wanted to be known as pure evil men.

Uff da! Uff da! Tiddly winks teh dingy thingy. Don\'t worry - not all of today\'s show is in Norwegian (and neither is that gibberish). Talking about Norway\'s infamous export, serial killer Belle Gunness, today on the Suck. It seems as if she had begun to operate a "murder farm" in Laporte Indiana at the dawn of the twentieth century. We\'ll never know exactly how many people Belle killed, but we do know a lot about her story. Motivated by money, she sacrificed both strangers and family to accomplish her goal of becoming wealthy and lured an unknown number of men to Indiana under the false pretense of buying into her farm... and then they disappeared forever.

Whether it’s because you came of age with One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest or watched Taxi every week or accepted his version of The Penguin as definitive or followed his antics with The Gang for 14 years on It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Danny is probably someone you feel like you know. Marc takes the time to know more about Danny, finding out about his Jersey Shore childhood, his days as a gardener and hairdresser, and his life behind the camera, directing favorites like Throw Momma from the Train and producing movies like Pulp Fiction.\xa0This episode is sponsored by Squarespace and SimpliSafe.\xa0 | Marilu Henner will not forget what was said in this conversation. That’s mostly because she has a rare condition that allows her to remember virtually everything that ever happened to her. But it’s also because she and Marc go deep into her life and multifaceted career. They discuss the eccentric environment she was raised in, the tragedy that befell her family, the acting break that got her started in show business, the health challenges in her life that led to a career as an author, and her varied relationships with costars like John Travolta, Andy Kaufman, Burt Reynolds and Donald Trump.\xa0This episode is sponsored by SweeTango, Zoro.com, and Stamps.com. | Jeannie Gaffigan had a lot on her plate. She was raising five kids, writing comedy with her husband Jim, and producing a television sitcom. She was so busy taking care of others that she forgot to take care of herself. Jeannie tells Marc how that self-neglect led to the inadvertent discovery of a brain tumor the size of a pear, a ten-hour surgery to remove it, and the complications that threatened her life. Now, on the road to a full recovery, Jeannie is learning how to let go of some of the control she used to rely on and embrace the messiness of life.\xa0This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp and EverlyWell. | How did Byron Allen go from teenage stand-up to highly successful media mogul and entrepreneur? Byron thinks it has everything to do with growing up in Detroit, watching his dad working at Ford and internalizing that factory worker mentality. Of course, his mom was a big help too, working as a tour guide at NBC Studios so young Byron could watch and learn from Johnny Carson, Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor and many others. Byron tells Marc how he found The Comedy Store, how he put in the hard work to get his own show on television, and how he came to own a media empire that includes The Weather Channel.\xa0This episode is sponsored by South Park and Crank Yankers on Comedy Central, the Hella Mega Tour, and BetterHelp. | Chaunté Wayans has a last name that adds a lot of pressure to a comedy career. She also happens to be the niece and cousin of many famous comedians with that last name. That’s one reason she stayed away from comedy when she was younger, choosing instead to get into film and television production. When Chaunté was working as an editor, she started struggling with anxiety, which led to alcoholism, which led to multiple arrests. Chaunté talks with Marc about rebounding, embracing her own comedic identity on stage, and launching her stand-up career with encouragement from people like Tiffany Haddish and her uncle Damon.\xa0This episode is sponsored by Between Two Ferns: The Movie on Netflix, Spotify, The Righteous Gemstones on HBO, and the Hella Mega Tour. | June Diane Raphael knows people are likely to mispronounce her last name (it’s RAY-feel) but she’s ok with it. She has other things on her mind right now, like being a working mom in Hollywood, getting more women encouraged to run for office, and the simple things like aging, the meaning of life, and the acceptance of death. June and Marc talk about all of that, as well as her improv background, her marriage to How Did This Get Made? co-host Paul Scheer, and what she learns from working with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.\xa0This episode is sponsored by Squarespace, SweeTango Apples, and BetterHelp. | Danny Huston felt somewhat doomed when it came to show business. His father John and grandfather Walter were legendary Hollywood figures and his half-sister Anjelica seemed like the coolest person in the world to him. To Danny, getting into the business seemed daunting. But after helping to shoot the opening credit sequence on one of his dad’s films, Danny was hooked. His father was his friend and collaborator but his death left Danny rudderless. And that’s when he started acting. Danny talks with Marc about his many roles, from small independent films to blockbusters like X-Men and Wonder Woman to his new film which he directed, The Last Photograph.\xa0This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp and Pepsi.\xa0 | When Bruce Dern showed up at The Actors Studio, Lee Strasberg told him he was going to be their Frankenstein Monster and Elia Kazan told him “you’re not into acting, you’re just into being.” But they also told Bruce he would never be a leading man and no one would know who he is until his 60s. It was the start of a career that spanned hundreds of movies, TV shows and plays, and shows no signs of letting up. Bruce goes through all of it with Marc, including his experiences working with legends, shooting John Wayne in the back, being friends with Jack Nicholson, and finally becoming that leading man with a breakthrough performance at age 79. This episode is sponsored by Vital Farms and Stamps.com. | When Marc first saw Edi Patterson on Vice Principals, he knew she was the kind of performer who can’t possibly stifle who she is. It turns out her raw, comedic intensity was born in Texas oil-refining country, where she was an anxious, sensitive kid who was in a full-blown existential crisis in fourth grade. Edi tells Marc how she figured out how to fake confidence, how she owes a lot of her growth to an actor from Hogan’s Heroes, and how she wound up collaborating with Danny McBride on shows and movies, including their latest series together, The Righteous Gemstones.\xa0This episode is sponsored by Spotify, SimpliSafe and BetterHelp. | Unlike Marc, Dale Beran was immersed in internet culture for most of his life. He considered himself an artistic, creative person with aspirations to become a writer. But what Dale discovered in the online communities he frequented was a disconnected, nihilistic disposition that evolved from meme creation to activism to alt-right and white supremacist ideologies. Dale thoroughly documents the online worlds that created a culture of toxic trolling in his book It Came From Something Awful, which provides a major piece of the puzzle to understand what happened in the 2016 election and what is happening to youth culture in America.\xa0This episode is sponsored by The Comedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin, Squarespace, and Bombas.', 'chan_desc': "Marc Maron welcomes comedians, actors, directors, writers, authors, musicians and folks from all walks of life to his home for amazingly revealing conversations.

The effects have been felt far and wide among fans and listeners, but how does it affect those who are there to see them day in and day out? This podcast, hosted by Christina P. and LeeAnn Kreischer is a glimpse into how The #SoberOctober journey directly affects the lives of the men\'s spouses and families. On Episode 1 of this mini-series Christina and LeeAnn discuss the past years and how much they dread the month of October. They get into what it\'s been like leading up to 2019\'s "Sober October" and how they\'ve better mentally prepared. Plus, in the lead up, Ari dosed Bert for an episode of "The Bertcast" so we hear LeeAnn\'s reaction in full. | "I now pronounce you, high and tight. You may kiss the jeans." Today\'s episode starts with a very sentimental Mommy wedding. SOO WOO! We have a bit of a "home here now" situation with everyone\'s favorite REAL Blood. Tom had a very great, surreal weekend and Christina learned new sayings. Plus, have you ever given the Piledriver? There\'s one woman on 90 Day Fiance who might be looking for your services. Ian Edwards is a stand-up comedian who has a new special out on Comedy Central, "Bill Burr Presents: IanTalk - Ideas Not Worth Spreading." Ian comes from an international background which excites The Master of Accents. Christina\'s heater becomes a topic of discussion as her an Ian share a love of warmth. Ian also tells some stories about comics like Tony Woods and more. Plus we show Ian some real cool guys and gals, and we get to hear a joke Ian has forgotten, but the Mommies have not. | The Mommies are starting things off with an interesting way for a man to make $20. How much money would it take you to complete this "task?" Tom and Christina also wonder who is purchasing adult movies in hotel rooms? They recall the times they\'ve made such purchases. Christina has developed a fascination of Josh Potter\'s ability to get laid and inquires about that. Plus, Cool Guy Tony makes his triumphant return from Jail. Big Jay Oakerson is a stand-up comic who you can hear on one of his many podcasts, including The SDR Show, Legion of Skanks and on SiriusXM\'s The Bonfire. Jay also recently acted in a film with Jennifer Lopez called "Hustlers." Jay and Tom talk about meeting during the Oddball tour, and what went wrong with it. The topic of NYC\'s new found "woke-ness" is brought up as Jay had an incident at The Comedy Cellar. Big Jay and Dan Soder often watch clips on their show The Bonfire, including Good Morning Julia, so the Mommies get his insight into it and let him in on what they\'ve found. Big Jay and Dan also reviewed Charro\'s video, so we relive that with him as well. Robert Paul Champagne is brought to Jay\'s attention and Jay recounts a story from back in the day when Josh Potter was driving him around for a weekend. Big Jay also tells The Mommies about Skankfest and the Louis CK appearance, and the murder of his manager and owner of The Stand Comedy Club in NYC, Dave Kimowitz. | Jeans Up! The Main Mommies are back in Studio Jeans and we may have found our favorite new cool guy who has a problem with authority... Ta-ta! Christina is back from a weekend of doing a couple shows and got the chance to ride on a choo-choo train! How good can trains actually get? And what was Tom up to when he was alone for the weekend? Loving being alone! We got opinions on eye contact from Uber drivers and a Would You Rather too! Then we have our amazing guest Steve-O, who you know from all the Jackass shows and movies! He tells us about how he got started with that crew, what it was like growing up in his family, and all the crazy stuff he used to do! We hear amazing stories about him painting himself and doing stunts like "Skyjacking." Catch his Bucket List Tour! | Donnell Rawlings is a stand-up comedian and actor who is a killer on stage and on screen with The Chappelle Show and The Wire. Today, he is not happy that he had to drive himself to Studio Jeans. The Great Chicken Sandwich Wars of 2019 are discussed and did you know there was a TV show that Donnell was on before The Chappelle Show? Christina shows Donnell some TikToks and we get to hear what it was like touring with Bill Burr on the Rich Bitch tour. Check out The Donnell Rawlings\' podcast on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXf59H6e99fQpWYM5uvEQw?sub_confirmation=1 Next guest in Studio Jeans is Author, Motivational Speaker and Real Estate mogul, Grant Cardone. Grant has come to studio jeans to make us rich. He gets right into the gems of wisdom while discussing his successes vs his failures and his motivations. Finally, Tom finds out the nitty gritty details on Private Jet ownership. Can Grant convince Christina? What does Grant think of Dan Pena? All this, plus a how to on dealing with "haters." \xa0 | Hello and Welcome, Mommies. Today we begin with a video that Christina definitely isn\'t going to like. WHEW now that we got that out of the way, let\'s see what\'s been going on in the local news! Tom and Christina were fascinated by an ugly man at the pool. What are the craziest tattoos? Josh Potter has an update on his new career and, OH BOY - we have "Acupuncture" remixes and they are unbelievable. He\'s everybody\'s favorite Doctor who resides, after dark, right here in Studio Jeans. He is the host of Dr. Drew After Dark, which is found right here on our channel. Dr. Drew starts out of the gate weighing in on some of the coolest guys we\'ve ever seen, including Cool Guy Tony. Christina also has Dr. Drew assess some of her TikTok discoveries and The Main Mommies inquire about some of the most pressing Yellow and Brown questions. | If you were about to get out of jail, what meal would you fantasize about? Who is Randy? These questions are all answered, and more, right off the bat! The Mommies are back from vacation, they are wondering why they took their children. Good thing they could put on "The Perfect Smile." Do you pee in the pool? Are you racist in parking lots? The fattest comedian working today just put out a dancing video, some people loved it - one person did not. We also get an update about Josh Potter\'s new business and, of course, TikToks. Jo Koy is a great stand-up comedian, who is known all over the world. He discusses his recent successes in Hawaii and elsewhere, performing in arenas. He also tells the Mommies about HIS Mommy not believing in him. Bidets, Japanese accents and Horrible or Hilarious are all discussed, plus TikToks... More TikToks. | Forget "Old Town Road" or Billie Ellish, we\'ve discovered the hit of the summer! It\'s been a minute since the Mommies were in the YMH studios, Tom tells us of his travels the last two weeks, including meeting one of Christina\'s TikTok stars! Josh Potter has begun a new career on Cameo and we get some wild updates from the other staff members at studio jeans. Plus, the Mommies were looking at new homes and discovered a specific criticism of one of the houses. Anthony Jeselnik is one of the most popular and hilarious stand up comics of our day, his latest special "Fire In The Maternity Ward" is currently on Netflix and is becoming everyone\'s favorite. Tom and Anthony compare parents, Anthony tells us about how writing for late night wasn\'t what he expected, roasting Trump, and Christina and Tom compete to see which of their favorite clips make Anthony laugh: TikTok or Horrible Or Hilarious? | A new battle HEATS up as temperature gate comes to the Studio Jeans thermostat. Perhaps things can be settled in a round of "TIK FOR TOK?" 30 Seconds To Mars has entered into "Intro Wars" Plus YMH has discovered a lane of cooking that is right up our ally and another original prank call gem from the great Fart Simpson. Alyssa Milano arrives at studio jeans, but we are one pant leg short. It\'s just Tom and Alyssa. How much can Tom confess before Christina arrives?? Alyssa talks about her show biz life, her long history of activism and then she gives her opinion on some of our favorite cool guys. Soon, Christina arrives and we get to the bottom of lots more including the hit jam sensation "Teen Steam." | The Master Of Accents starts the show. Deadass, would you go into a burning Burger King for your change? Maybe, if you\'re a TikTok. Christina has a whole new batch of TikToks today plus we get an understanding of how hairy Josh Potter is REALLY. Ryan Sickler is a comedian and writer who hosts a podcast right out of Studio Jeans known as The HoneyDew. Get on our channel where you find this show and make sure you check out all the great episodes. Christina tells us all how she hates helmets. Remember when seat belts were cool? Christina also shows Ryan some choice TikToks and Sickler weighs in on INTRO WARS. Next up is Steven Randolph. He\'s a stand-up comic who knows his way around certain "parties." Steven has brought in his own multi-media (which we can show portions of) in order to explain the type of "party" we are discussing here. Every wanted to upset a whole theater of epople?

The greatest thing about Dan is he just loves shooting the shit and letting it rip and that\'s what this podcast is all about. If you\'re not familiar with Dan Cummins, he\'s an incredibly talented standup comedian who\'s appeared on Comedy Central, Conan, The Tonight Show and The Late Late Show. He\'s best known for his hit podcast "Timesuck" where Dan dives deep into serial killers, cults, conspiracies, history, and the paranormal in a way that\'s both educational and hysterical. He also just launched a new podcast called "Scared to Death" where Dan terrifies his wife with alleged-to-be-true horror stories about Demonic possession, poltergeists, shadow people and more. See why we love him? | The boys had a lot to talk\xa0about today. Digs got The Pat McAfee Show in trouble for saying “shitty” on the radio, Ty is learning how to live without sleep, Pat is getting used to having so many different hats to wear now (Sports Radio Talk Show Host, WWE personality, College Football Analyst, ESPN panelist for Get Up and every other show when they need him and of course, small business owner.) Its quite a conversation. Enjoy. | Fresh off his third place finish in this season’s America’s Got Talent, comedian Ryan Niemiller paid the boys a visit. They talked about the overall journey, how it has changed his life and what the future holds. | The boys hit it hard today with a litany of topics including, but not limited to; grocery shopping, survival skills, paranormal investigations, bounty hunters, beastiality and more. Enjoy. | Todd, Digs, Nick, Gump and Bailey held this one down while everyone else was out of town. They talked about Todd\'s girlfriend getting her appendix removed, which grew into a discussion about other useless parts of our bodies. Digs finally found his White Claw flavor, Gump talks about how bad Canada is at selling weed and Nick sets everyone straight on Alienstock. Enjoy. | This was a pretty loose one. The boys talk about their thoughts on the new radio show, Todd\'s dogs have driven him over the edge, and we change history. If you have questions for the crew, send them to @HeartlandRadio on Twitter, and be sure to tune into the radio show from 10 am-12 am EST on over 30 stations nation wide.

The boys covered a wide gammet of topics including breakfast cereal, brunch drinks, the new apple credit card, witchcraft, fake chicken and white claw vs truly. They closed the episode with I Wanna Know, Fact or Fiction and answered some listener questions. | The boys are back to celebrate the 100th episode. They talked about their respective vacations and what\'s being going on the last two weeks while they were off. You\'ll also learn a little bit more about CFO Phil and why the boys think he should fight MMA. | \xa0If you don\'t watch Heartland Radio 2.0 on YouTube, you might want to at least give this episode a peek because the boys are in a new studio with a brand new look. It\'s not The Pat McAfee Studio but it is the new Heartland Radio studio and we dig it. Today the boys talked about their favorite bite-size oven snacks, their favorite bands from high school and detail plans for the future as far as this podcast is concerned.

I’m the guy that you probably don’t know by name, but when you see my face you might say “oh, that guy from that thing.” I’ve befriended some of the most talented people in the business, but it wasn’t until I started inviting them into my home that I realized, I didn’t really know these people. What started as me having some fun, quickly evolved into something I’ve fallen in love with. What I’ve discovered is that all these people aren’t that different from you and me. They have the same insecurities and flaws that we all deal with every day. In a dark, yet enlightening way...I find a lot of comfort in that. I invite you all to join me while I get inside each of these fascinating people.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/98/c6/29/98c62931-a6bc-8aa3-b54c-9235aef7b952/mza_6290351473803302408.jpg/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2018-05-18'}}

Armstrong (dooce.com) was in, by far, the deepest depression she had ever experienced and nothing was working to lift it. That\'s when her psychiatrist told her about a study using powerful doses of the anesthetic Propofol. Heather had ten appointments where she was placed in a brief medically-induced coma. The idea is similar to electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) but without the electricity and, hopefully, without side effects like memory loss. She shares the story of what led her to try the treatment and how it went.  You can pre-order John\'s book at bit.ly/HilariousWorldBook. | While it was easy for audiences to enjoy Mara Wilson as a perky child performer in movies like Matilda and Mrs. Doubtfire, the young actress had mental health issues that weren’t enjoyable at all. Mara had been dealing with severe anxiety for as long as she could remember. Her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer just before Matilda started shooting and Mara developed symptoms of OCD. Then came depression, and eventually body dysmorphia, too. Mara Wilson is 32 years old now and has relegated acting to the sidelines. She has a good grip on how her mind works and feels great about her new focus as a writer, but she knows that managing her conditions will be a lifelong job.You can pre-order John\'s book at bit.ly/HilariousWorldBook. | Whitney Cummings has had a lot of success in Hollywood as a comedian, actress, writer and director, and now she\'s finally having success in figuring herself out. She\'s been making connections between the addiction and mental illnesses in her house growing up, the eating disorders she developed, the depression that has persisted, and the codependency that emerged. Turns out when you are able to take a good hard look at things, you can get a pretty good view.  You can pre-order John\'s book at bit.ly/HilariousWorldBook. | You might know Pete Holmes from his many standup specials, his talk show, or Crashing, the HBO series he created and starred in. You might not know the long and varied spiritual path he\'s traveled in his life. Pete was an incredibly devout Christian, living by the Bible and obsessed with avoiding eternal damnation. Following traumatic life events, he arrived first at atheism and finally at a consciousness-based worldview influenced by thinkers like Ram Dass and Joseph Campbell. Sticking around for all parts of that journey: a love of comedy and some rather aggressive anxiety and depression.   You can pre-order John\'s book at bit.ly/HilariousWorldBook. | We asked our listeners for books they\'ve read that give an accurate depiction of the reality of depression. Happily, we got enough great suggestions to weigh down a shopping cart at the bookstore or leave a library card smoldering. A name that came up a lot was author Jenny Lawson, who happens to be a friend of the show. On this episode, we talk with Jenny and get audio suggestions from a lot of THWoD-balls. Be sure to visit hilariousworld.org for a complete list of titles. | Taking a trip somewhere new can be wonderful: the new experiences, the exciting culture, the unusual foods. For people who deal with depression or anxiety, travel can also introduce a variety of problems. It necessarily involves getting out of the familiar and that can leave one feeling isolated, worried about negative possibilities, and unprotected in a world that sometimes doesn\'t work out all that great as it is. In this summer mini-sode, we hear from Jeremy Pelletier, a non-profit director and geographer who recently wrote about the pitfalls and triumphs he\'s experienced traveling. We also check in with Dr. Karriem Salaam from Drexel University\'s College of Medicine for valuable tips on what to do and not to do.

Depression is a heavy topic and stories about it are often packed with bummers. So in this special episode, we rounded up some of the funniest moments from our three seasons and packed them all together for a hilarity highlight reel. The laughs tend to come from unexpected places and within the context of the chat so you can be sure that none of it is corny and there are no jokes you\'ve heard before outside the show.

His family is Ethiopian but he was born in a refugee camp in Sudan. The family traveled to St Louis, then on to Fresno, where he was bullied so much in 2nd grade that he threatened suicide in the middle of class. Then there were many years in Seattle where he says his parents were abusive and had no tolerance for Solomon\'s homosexuality. A disastrous runaway trip to Los Angeles ended up in a return to Seattle where he embraced comedy and relocated himself, again and much more successfully to Southern California. His depression isn\'t a thing of the past but he\'s definitely in a good place.  Support the show at HilariousWorld.org/donate.

Jonny Sun has degrees in both, and he\'s a dissertation away from a doctorate in urban studies and planning from MIT. But a phenomenally humane, funny, and popular Twitter account has placed him in an unexpected comedy career. Meanwhile, he realized that this dark sad feeling he\'s had forever has a name. | "There\'s a lot to unpack, John," says comedian, actor, and writer Naomi Ekperigin during the course of this interview and indeed there is. The New York native, now uneasily dwelling in Los Angeles, has dealt with anxiety, depression, a very complicated relationship with her father, as well as problems with alcohol and cutting. Comedy has been in there too both as a respite from mental turmoil and sometimes a source of neurosis. With the help of her fiance\' (who is also a rich source of her comedy material), sobriety, and a lot of self-awareness, she\'s on the rise in the comedy world.', 'chan_desc': 'A show about clinical depression...with laughs?

But that all unraveled, and it ended up with some nasty charges involving a machete, some gasoline, a little paint thinner & a lighter.  These charges would land him in Venezuelan prison with his good name ruined.  He also indiscriminately fires hand guns from car windows & is not above a bar brawl.

From there, he learned how to fight in the ring, and became one of MMA\'s most feared punchers.  Problem is, he likes to punch things, out of the ring, as well.  Like fellow airline passengers, or random bar patrons.  He is also proficient in sexual assault, having feuds with his own family members, and saying some really dumb things.

One of the greatest of all time.  One of the most prolific punch throwers... and crack smokers in history! He fought his way out of a childhood, where sleeping outside was preferable to being home, to become a true legend.  Then he discovered crack, glorious crack.  This led to fights with everyone, including his mother, crazy crack house confrontations, getting shot by his "wife", lies, restarts, rehabs, jail, more arrests, panhandling, a ton more crack, and eventually Jesus.

"\n\nCallie and Jeff Dauler have been practicing daily gratitude since the early days of their relationship, leaving morning notes for each other on index cards that each started with those five words.  Neither of them describe themselves as naturally positive, but they attribute this exercise with reprogramming their brain to allow them to instinctively look for the upside in any challenging situation.\n\nCallie is a talent assistant who is insightful, sensitive, and kind. Jeff is a radio personality and comedian who loves to make people laugh and usually says what everyone else is thinking. They\'ve been married since 2016 (Callie’s first, Jeff’s second) and are working on their first human baby. (They’re already parents to two rescue dogs, Sadie and Lily.) \n\nYou\'re going to hear real talk about real life, and you\'re going to laugh ... a LOT.  The ups and downs of life. The exciting and the mundane and the embarrassing.  Pop culture and news and whatever else comes to mind. All on the table for this show ... and all with one theme:  LIVE FOR THE UPSIDE.\n\nCallie and Jeff know that sometimes, no matter how positively you want to process things, life hits you so hard that it seems impossible. That will be addressed as well, but never in a preachy, \'they\'ve got all the answers\' way.\n\n"Everyone\'s journey is different. We\'re not going to tell you how to take yours. But we want to share some things we know that might make it easier for you," is how Jeff describes their show.\n\nFor more:  follow @calliedauler & @jeffdauler on Instagram.', 'cover_img_url': 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Podcasts123/v4/e7/35/01/e73501d8-9ca3-2f10-d4ac-752a1e79b2c9/mza_7405018061817798385.png/400x400bb.jpg', 'first_release': '2019-07-21'}}

Then we go behind the scenes with DJ Donwill and producer Christian Banda as they tackle some of the toughest Adulting questions of the season. Plus, Jordan reveals the one question that he wants to ask his parents (and it’s gross).\xa0 | While Michelle visits the Delta Sky Club, another family crashes Jordan’s family reunion and eats all the gumbo.

Yes, that Vanessa Williams - and she gives some adulting advice that will change your life forever. Plus, Comedy Knockout’s Damien Lemon finds out he’s married, Michelle gets high on mushrooms and sees Jesus, and Jordan goes on a nightmarish New York adventure. And advice on how to go on a coffee date without having to drop a deuce. | This week, take a walk down memory lane to a time when Michelle sold zoot suits and Jordan used Civil War trivia as a pick-up line. Comedian Gina Yashere channels her inner James Bond. And Liza Treyger may just be the Lindsay Lohan of comedy. Plus, Michelle and Jordan tackle that age-old question: are you ever too old to Seamless a bagel when you’re hungover? | Being a true adult means being a good community member. This week, while Jordan saves some trees, Michelle shares her one and only experience with communal living: a roommate who loved olive oil and left a mess. Comedian Kerry Coddett tries to end her dating dry spell. And talk show host Michelle Collins auditions for her dream role as Javert in Les Mis.\xa0 | Part of being an adult is knowing how to negotiate. This week, Jordan drives a hard bargain with his new roof guy, while Michelle talks her husband into a mani-pedi. Black Thought from The Roots interrupts date night with his wife to share his s*** list. And comedian Seth Herzog and Michelle compare notes on having twins (yes, he does have a favorite). | Tensions run high as Jordan calls out Michelle for being bougie AF.
