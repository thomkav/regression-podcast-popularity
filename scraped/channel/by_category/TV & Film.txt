Neglected by the world and beaten down everywhere he turns, Fleck does what any discouraged clown would do: he becomes a menace. | The Netflix series Unbelievable brings together a group of actresses including Kaitlyn Dever, Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, Dale Dickey and Danielle MacDonald. It's based on a true story about a young woman named Marie who was sexually assaulted and pressured by the police into recanting her story. Based on reporting from ProPublica and the Marshall Project, the series follows Marie, but also the two detectives who, much later, gave her case a chance to be solved. | In our fall movie preview, we will cover the ones we're excited about, the ones you'll be hearing more about, and the ones that might be picking up awards in a few months.

Not only does it star popular women like Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu, with drop-ins from Cardi B and Lizzo, but it got very good reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival. What's not to like? Hustlers is based on the true story of a group of women who danced at a strip club together and later drugged and scammed some of their wealthy Wall Street customers. Directed by Lorene Scafaria, the film is already generating awards buzz for Jennifer Lopez. | Donna Tartt's 2013 book The Goldfinch won a Pulitzer Prize for its story of a boy whose mother dies in a bombing.

Adapting the Stephen King novel of the same name, it tells the story of seven misfit kids in the late 1980s, and a supernatural being that preys on children in a small town in Maine. The sequel revisits the kids 27 years later — they're now played by the likes of Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader. | Just about every week, we talk about what we're watching or reading or listening to right now.

In Hollywood Babylon, Anger focuses only on Novarro’s grisly murder in 1968 -- which outed Novarro to a public that had largely forgotten him--and needlessly embellishes a crime scene that was already pretty horrible. Today, in our final episode of Fact-Checking Hollywood Babylon, we will explore the life which Anger left out of Hollywood Babylon, and correct that book’s version of Novarro’s death. | In part two of our two-parter on the demise of the biggest and most pernicious tabloid of the 1950s, we’ll explore what happened after the magazine’s claim that redheaded star Maureen O’Hara was caught having sex at Grauman’s Chinese Theater. O’Hara positioned herself the “Joan of Arc” of Hollywood, single-handedly defending a cowardly industry against the existential threat posed by Confidential. As we’ll see, this is one story where the Kenneth Anger version is more credible than the version related by one of the subjects.\xa0 | Over two episodes, we will explore Hollywood Babylon’s coverage of Confidential Magazine and the two celebrities who testified against the scandal rag in the 1957 trial that helped end what Anger rightfully refers to as its “reign of terror.” We’ll begin with Dorothy Dandridge, the first black actress to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Dandridge’s testimony against Confidential reveals the publication’s racist agenda, as well as the double standards that governed her real private and public lives.\xa0 | Jewish gangster Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel is frequently credited with corrupting Hollywood’s unions and “inventing” Las Vegas. Siegel did have movie star friends, but the true story of his involvement with the Flamingo casino is also the story of a much bigger movieland player: Hollywood Reporter founder/publisher/columnist Billy Wilkerson.\xa0 | The bisexuality of Marlene Dietrich was not exactly a secret in 1930s Hollywood -- in fact, her ambiguous sexuality was part of her on-screen brand. But there is some debate as to who Dietrich counted among her lovers, and which of her fellow stars participated in what has been called the “sewing circle” of female intimacy. Anger alleges that Dietrich had a “passionate affair” with Claudette Colbert, an Oscar-winning actress with an extremely heteronormative persona. We’ll explore what was going on in Dietrich’s life and career around the time when this affair could have taken place, and then delve into Colbert’s image as a very different kind of on-screen sex symbol, and her complicated off-screen personal life.\xa0 | Mexican actress Lupe Velez was the victim of one of Anger’s cruelest invented stories. His fabrication of her manner of death lays bare a vicious racism in addition to Hollywood Babylon’s usual sexism. Today we will sort out the fact of Velez’s life from Anger’s fiction and consider the star of the Mexican Spitfire series as a comedienne ahead of her time. | In 1936, actress Mary Astor (who had not yet made her most famous film, The Maltese Falcon) and her husband went to court to fight for custody of their four year-old daughter. The trail made international news thanks to both sides’ use of Astor’s diary, in which she had recorded details of her affair with playwright George S. Kaufman. How much did Astor truly reveal in her diary, and what role did the scandal play in her life and career? | Mae West was the biggest new star in Hollywood in 1933, thanks to two hit films she co-wrote and starred in as a sexually implicit, wisecracking broad who romanced a young Cary Grant. In Hollywood Babylon, Anger credits West’s abrupt decline in movies to a coordinated conspiracy organized by William Randolph Hearst and carried out by the Hays Office. Today we’ll explore West’s background, her history of pushing the censors past the limits of legality, and the truth of her lightning-fast rise in Hollywood and somewhat slower descent back to earth.\xa0 | This Italian pin-up, along with Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot, was emblematic of a brand of post-war European sexuality that America happily imported.

Brandi’s Instagram is currently being taken over by pictures of her new brown-eyed Husky whose name means ‘Stars’ since Brandi’s obsessed with space right now. Wells is also trying to turn Carl into an Instagram star now that Wells has his fancy YouTube camera, and also because that dog needs to pay his way! The hosts debate the benefits of GPS tracking dog collars and why they don’t make them for humans yet (Wells needs one ASAP), the best ways to shoot flies straight out of the air, and Wells’ potential profession of voicing movie trailers. Brandi and Wells have plenty of favorites this week and no least faves, so the show is staying true to its name. Also, find out which Dancing with the Stars couple Wells thinks is going to start doing the Horizontal Mambo on their time off.Thanks to our awesome sponsors.

Wells flew home from iHeart Fest in what he thought would be a private jet but what turned out to be a propeller plane where passengers included none other than James Van Der Beek. It’s really too bad it wasn’t an actual private jet and Sarah wasn’t there because he could’ve gotten a BJ on the PJ. Miley insisted on going on a Cyrus girls\' trip and, just like Wells, didn’t get the transportation she was expecting because Tish the Dish went behind her back and booked a Tahoe in place of Miley’s Cruise America dream RV. Wells and Brandi debate the pros and cons of Southwest, general airport etiquette, and why not to buckle your backpack across your chest (because.... fashion).

But first, Brandi has been home in Nashville “doing horses” for the past couple of weeks, while Wells and Sarah attended the Dancing with the Stars live taping and got to witness Dawson (aka James Van Der Beek) still dancing on that creek. Wells breaks down the stiff competition this season and reveals who looked like a pirate going to a rave who didn\'t know how to dance. The two hosts discuss the Bachelor in Paradise reunion which Wells wasn’t able to watch because he was hiding in a cake, and debate which scenario is worse: hot food that burns your mouth or toasted bread that absolutely shreds it. Newly engaged couple Hannah and Dylan (Ding! Ding! Ding!) join Wells and Brandi virtually, which is probably for the best since Dylan is having a horrible hair day. Dylan and Hannah share potential Halloween costumes, the current status of their relationship, and what went down in the Boom Boom Room.Thanks to our awesome sponsors.

Brandi went to a Sheryl Crow concert where she was the youngest person by decades, and to celebrate, Wells performs a beautiful rendition of The First Cut Is the Deepest. Blake and Wells buried the hatchet in Denver after a rough season of Bachelor in Paradise, and the residents of Denver asked a wasted Wells for all types of advice due to his outstanding guidance on the beach. Brandi isn’t quite grasping the podcast’s concept this week and discusses some of her least favorite things including lack of awareness about wild horses and how This Is Us is failing to make her cry. The hosts have a heated debate over which bottled water is the best and read their favorite all-time podcast review which involves Wells’ grandmother.Thanks to our awesome sponsors.

Though Brandi is sad because of Michiel’s departure, she was able to get some good DD before he left, and they had an amazing time glamping in Yellowstone and Jackson Hole, especially seeing the Large Tits (direct translation for "Grand Tetons"). Wells is basically now the Bonus Bonus Jonas after spending time in New York with the Jo Bros, while also sweating profusely while meeting Jay-Z, and learning how to make marriage last from the one-and-only  Dr. Phil. Wells and Brandi debate the grossness (yet perfection) of American cheese, what’s up with the big-toe heel fashion trend, the many actual reasons behind why horses have hairstyles, and the crazy story behind Wells\' new love of donkeys and their balls.

The two hosts ask important questions, including: Why can’t airplanes get it together with Bluetooth and WiFi? Why do horses have hairstyles on top of their already full bodies of hair? And most importantly, why has Wells’ drunk purchase of knives off of Instagram yet to ship from China four months after the fact? Derek renames YFTers to “Thingers,” which may or may not stick, and Wells and Derek share their favorite voices and impressions, including a grandmother bit which is sure to impress you. Wells and Derek are not thrilled with this year’s Bachelor in Paradise introductions and identify possible alternative introductions, including Cam walking sadly down the beach, and how Wells found out from inside sources that Derek’s intro is actually the most desirable.Thanks to our awesome sponsors.

Wells admires the video stream displaying Brandi’s boyfriend shirtless and in full cleaning action. The hosts discuss how the Cyrus family is warming up to Brandi’s new man, why the hell GPS uses directions like “north,” and their favorite YFT reviews of the week. Wells and Brandi talk behind-the-scenes of Paradise and why they are officially endorsing Derek for The Bachelor. This week, Brandi is getting ready to fly to Salt Lake City and then drive out to the Grand Tetons. (Which, by the way, who named those things??) After their road trip and glamping adventures, Brandi and MH will be heading to LA to knock on Wells’ door, so stay tuned to see if Wells gives his stamp of approval.Thanks to our awesome sponsors.

Wells and Brandi debate their favorite car features, from headlight windshield wipers to heated seats that make Wells have to go number two. Wells’ two podcasts collide as Brandi’s recent vacay hits the news, involving a member of The Hills. And, of course, it’s time to talk Paradise, specifically some controversial character named Blake.

Like any good friend would, Wells reminds her that everyone listening will hate her for privilege, and she admits “I hate me” too.  But speaking of paradise.... Bachelor in Paradise is here!! Brandi splurged $2.99 on iTunes to get caught up on the show before recording, so first reactions from episode 1 are discussed, including Brandi’s discomfort seeing how her friend Blake is being portrayed, Wells’ pep talks with Dylan about pursuing a girl out of his league (hi Sarah, hi Hannah), and about how Wells is three years older than the ‘grandpa’ of the Paradise crew (hi Chris B).  We also have lots of new music recommendations, show must-sees, and tips to travel like a 79-year-old that actually will make your life amazing. Enjoy!Thanks to our awesome sponsors.

Wells admits he was very impressed with Brandi and Kaitlynn\'s poo talk last week, and Brandi admits it is nice to have him back. The pair discuss alien invasions, doomsday escape plans, Wells & Sarah\'s brush with the infamous Denver Airport creepiness, repeat voicemails from old people, and the equally frightening northwest trend of utilikilts. On a less scary note, the hosts count down the top Tom Hanks movies, chat Bachelorette rumors and predictions, and we hear the story of Brandi\'s photo shoot with her dad, a blown up unicorn, and (probably) lots of marijuana.

Here is a sneak peek at our new Patreon series! \xa0 Join us on https://www.patreon.com/resolvedmysteriespodcast\xa0 to get access to three different series releasing bi-weekly. \xa0 This is first episode of our new series--the Forgotten Few! In this series we’ll be covering the cases that were not included in the FilmRise re-edit of Unsolved Mysteries that we currently watch on Amazon and other platforms. \xa0 In our first Forgotten Few episode, Karlin covers the story of the Freedom II. When Bob Dozier and John Russell washed up on the shores of Stinson Beach, CA in November of 1981, they said that their boat, the Freedom II had been hit by a freighter and destroyed. Tragically, the men reported that John’s wife, Suzanne Russell, and their friend Kristin Tomlin had been lost at sea after the boat went down. Strangely, the men left town shortly after this with their female companions still missing. This left authorities a bit suspicious. Later, the men called authorities to let them know that there was actually one more woman on the boat with them, Sherry (or Cheri) Ann Dozier. The tale of the Freedom II began to grow more and more strange as time went on and it became clear that there was much more to the story than a boat lost at sea. \xa0 Oooooh get that sweeeeeeeet RM merch, honeys! https://resolvedmysteriespodcast.com/productshttps://resolvedmysteriespod.threadless.com/ Follow us!

Kenny Baker - the man inside R2D2 - dies, but not before meeting the son he never knew. After great emotional struggle, George Lucas sells Star Wars to Disney. After a lifetime of total control, now he has to say “goodbye.” Carrie Fisher boards a plane at Heathrow Airport in London in 2016 and stops breathing before reaching Los Angeles. The world says goodbye to Princess Leia. Lucas acknowledges the fact that Star Wars used to be his, and now it’s ours. He used to live only for movies - and then he had children.

Lucas has to “crack the whip” at ILM, which is way behind on FX shots. Lucas discovers the perfect voice for Darth Vader. The John Williams score is finished and Lucas is moved to tears. He screens the film for his movie friends and the reception is ugly. The FOX sales team loves the movie, but the studio board is convinced they’re wrong - Star Wars will be an enormous bomb, they believe. So they move the release date early and dump it into a small number of theaters before it’s forgotten forever. And then, Star Wars premieres and is a phenomenon. Lines around the block everywhere. Lucas vacations with Spielberg and tosses out an idea for another movie, one led by a character named “Indiana Smith.” Lucas negotiates the sequels, then takes a long vacation from Star Wars until a new series of prequels.

Star Wars begins shooting. Carrie is smitten by her handsome co-star, Harrison Ford. Greedo nearly suffocates during the Cantina sequence. George Lucas breaks the news to Alec Guinness that his character will be killed off - without a satisfying death scene, and Guinness is furious. Luke and Leia swing across a dangerous chasm, but first someone has to tape down Carrie Fisher’s breasts. Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin is a horror legend - where does he go on his bicycle every day during the shooting of Star Wars? Shooting nears its end and George Lucas falls into depression and despair. Strife with the studio continues, and now Lucas is suffering chest pains.

Carrie Fisher wins a role, runs into the rain, and shouts to the heavens: “I am Princess Leia!” George Lucas doesn’t want Harrison Ford in the cast, but it just so happens Harrison's building a door all week and is in the right place at the right time. Mark Hamill awakens on Robert Englund’s couch just in time to find out about “the perfect role” for him - with dialogue that is absolutely befuddling. The men inside R2D2 and C3PO come to terms with the extraordinary discomfort of their costumes - and their dislike for each other. Alec Guinness hates science fiction “fairy-tale rubbish” and considers Lucas to be “a touch boring.” Meanwhile Lucas is plowing his own money into Star Wars and still has no green light from Fox.

United Artists agrees to pick up the project along with one other idea, something vague about wars in space. But the deal falls apart in part because “nobody knows what American Graffiti means.” Universal comes to the rescue but retains final cut. The screenings are great, but Universal is convinced it will be a disaster, so they cut the film - because they can. A resentful and hungry Lucas scribbles a two-page treatment for something called “The Star Wars.” Everyone in town rejects the project, except for Fox exec Alan Ladd Jr, who buys the idea for a paltry sum and offers a thin vote of confidence for George Lucas. Then, American Graffiti is released and becomes a hit. Lucas renegotiates not for more money but for sequel and merchandising rights, both worthless at the time. Now he spends every day for the next three years writing the script. Grueling days. Bleeding on the page. Pulling teeth would be easier and more pleasant. We meet Lucas’s dog, an Alaskan malamute named “Indiana” who inspires a certain Wookiee named “Chewbacca.” We discover the inspiration for “R2D2.” Meanwhile, it’s clear that Fox is dragging their feet - that many at the studio wish Star Wars would simply…go away.\xa0Support us by supporting our sponsors!Wix\xa0- That’s\xa0Wix.com, code YODA for 10% off any premium plan! | A young Carrie Fisher meets the paparazzi in the arms of her celebrity mother, Debbie Reynolds. It doesn’t take Carrie long to decide that acting’s not for her. So naturally, an actor is exactly what she becomes. Carrie models tops for Warren Beatty - with and without a bra. Meanwhile, George Lucas has decided to study film. Even though no film school graduate had ever gotten a job in the industry. He quickly becomes a star at USC, determined to make his movies his way, no matter what the rules are. He works day and night on a diet of coffee and chocolate bars. He graduates just as movie attendance is cratering and Hollywood is shutting down. He meets another young cinematic firebrand, Francis Coppola, and they join forces on his first movie, THX1138. Warner Brothers hates the movie and takes it back to cut it themselves. It limps into theaters where one young film buff is left awestruck. His name is Steven Spielberg.

More speeding tickets than baseball cards. Fights at home with his father over work and school and career. “I’m gonna be a millionaire before I’m 30,” he shouts at his dad. But he’s failing classes and his best hopes are for a life as an auto mechanic. Then, one fateful day he’s in his tiny Fiat turning left across traffic.

Twenty years later, it\'s maybe still a little distracting, but it\'s easier to see the pair\'s performances in the greater contexts of their respective careers – and, in particular, how effective the casting of the cocky, entitled Cruise is as Dr. Bill Harford, a man who sees his confidence reduced to rubble by the end of the film.

The FOX sales team loves the movie, but the studio board is convinced they’re wrong - Star Wars will be an enormous bomb, they believe. So they move the release date early and dump it into a small number of theaters before it’s forgotten forever. And then, Star Wars premieres and is a phenomenon. Lines around the block everywhere.

United Artists agrees to pick up the project along with one other idea, something vague about wars in space. But the deal falls apart in part because “nobody knows what American Graffiti means.” Universal comes to the rescue but retains final cut. The screenings are great, but Universal is convinced it will be a disaster, so they cut the film - because they can. A resentful and hungry Lucas scribbles a two-page treatment for something called “The Star Wars.” Everyone in town rejects the project, except for Fox exec Alan Ladd Jr, who buys the idea for a paltry sum and offers a thin vote of confidence for George Lucas. Then, American Graffiti is released and becomes a hit. Lucas renegotiates not for more money but for sequel and merchandising rights, both worthless at the time. Now he spends every day for the next three years writing the script. Grueling days. Bleeding on the page. Pulling teeth would be easier and more pleasant. We meet Lucas’s dog, an Alaskan malamute named “Indiana” who inspires a certain Wookiee named “Chewbacca.” We discover the inspiration for “R2D2.” Meanwhile, it’s clear that Fox is dragging their feet - that many at the studio wish Star Wars would simply…go away.\xa0Support us by supporting our sponsors!Wix\xa0- That’s\xa0Wix.com, code YODA for 10% off any premium plan! | A young Carrie Fisher meets the paparazzi in the arms of her celebrity mother, Debbie Reynolds.

Meanwhile, George Lucas has decided to study film. Even though no film school graduate had ever gotten a job in the industry. He quickly becomes a star at USC, determined to make his movies his way, no matter what the rules are. He works day and night on a diet of coffee and chocolate bars. He graduates just as movie attendance is cratering and Hollywood is shutting down. He meets another young cinematic firebrand, Francis Coppola, and they join forces on his first movie, THX1138. Warner Brothers hates the movie and takes it back to cut it themselves. It limps into theaters where one young film buff is left awestruck. His name is Steven Spielberg.

More speeding tickets than baseball cards. Fights at home with his father over work and school and career. “I’m gonna be a millionaire before I’m 30,” he shouts at his dad. But he’s failing classes and his best hopes are for a life as an auto mechanic. Then, one fateful day he’s in his tiny Fiat turning left across traffic.

We discuss what it’s like to chase down the details of a living legend who has contributed so much to modern pop culture. And Brian reveals the one question he would most like to ask Lucas today: “Are you happy?”It’s a fascinating conversation about the man at the center of Star Wars.Brian Jay Jones also wrote a wonderful biography of Muppet creator Jim Henson, and his current best-seller is this great book: “Becoming Dr. Seuss - Theodor Geisel and the Making of an American Imagination.”Support us by supporting our sponsors!Buffy - For $20 off your Buffy comforter, visit Buffy.co and enter code YODA.

Kenny Baker - the man inside R2D2 - dies, but not before meeting the son he never knew. After great emotional struggle, George Lucas sells Star Wars to Disney. After a lifetime of total control, now he has to say “goodbye.” Carrie Fisher boards a plane at Heathrow Airport in London in 2016 and stops breathing before reaching Los Angeles. The world says goodbye to Princess Leia. Lucas acknowledges the fact that Star Wars used to be his, and now it’s ours. He used to live only for movies - and then he had children.

Lucas has to “crack the whip” at ILM, which is way behind on FX shots. Lucas discovers the perfect voice for Darth Vader. The John Williams score is finished and Lucas is moved to tears. He screens the film for his movie friends and the reception is ugly. The FOX sales team loves the movie, but the studio board is convinced they’re wrong - Star Wars will be an enormous bomb, they believe. So they move the release date early and dump it into a small number of theaters before it’s forgotten forever. And then, Star Wars premieres and is a phenomenon. Lines around the block everywhere. Lucas vacations with Spielberg and tosses out an idea for another movie, one led by a character named “Indiana Smith.” Lucas negotiates the sequels, then takes a long vacation from Star Wars until a new series of prequels. And that’s when the backlash begins.\xa0Support us by supporting our sponsors!Casper - You can get $100 toward select mattresses by visiting Casper.com/YODA and using code YODA at checkout.Wix - Go to Wix.com and use the coupon code YODA to get 10% off any premium plan.  | Carrie Fisher auditions hairstyles and the “Buns of Navarone” are born. Star Wars begins shooting. Carrie is smitten by her handsome co-star, Harrison Ford. Greedo nearly suffocates during the Cantina sequence. George Lucas breaks the news to Alec Guinness that his character will be killed off - without a satisfying death scene, and Guinness is furious. Luke and Leia swing across a dangerous chasm, but first someone has to tape down Carrie Fisher’s breasts. Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin is a horror legend - where does he go on his bicycle every day during the shooting of Star Wars?

Carrie Fisher wins a role, runs into the rain, and shouts to the heavens: “I am Princess Leia!” George Lucas doesn’t want Harrison Ford in the cast, but it just so happens Harrison's building a door all week and is in the right place at the right time. Mark Hamill awakens on Robert Englund’s couch just in time to find out about “the perfect role” for him - with dialogue that is absolutely befuddling. The men inside R2D2 and C3PO come to terms with the extraordinary discomfort of their costumes - and their dislike for each other. Alec Guinness hates science fiction “fairy-tale rubbish” and considers Lucas to be “a touch boring.” Meanwhile Lucas is plowing his own money into Star Wars and still has no green light from Fox. That’s when he faces a choice: Either make the movie for half of what he needs or Star Wars will be shut down.Support us by supporting our sponsors!

United Artists agrees to pick up the project along with one other idea, something vague about wars in space. But the deal falls apart in part because “nobody knows what American Graffiti means.” Universal comes to the rescue but retains final cut. The screenings are great, but Universal is convinced it will be a disaster, so they cut the film - because they can. A resentful and hungry Lucas scribbles a two-page treatment for something called “The Star Wars.” Everyone in town rejects the project, except for Fox exec Alan Ladd Jr, who buys the idea for a paltry sum and offers a thin vote of confidence for George Lucas. Then, American Graffiti is released and becomes a hit. Lucas renegotiates not for more money but for sequel and merchandising rights, both worthless at the time. Now he spends every day for the next three years writing the script. Grueling days. Bleeding on the page. Pulling teeth would be easier and more pleasant. We meet Lucas’s dog, an Alaskan malamute named “Indiana” who inspires a certain Wookiee named “Chewbacca.” We discover the inspiration for “R2D2.” Meanwhile, it’s clear that Fox is dragging their feet - that many at the studio wish Star Wars would simply…go away. \xa0Support us by supporting our sponsors!

It doesn’t take Carrie long to decide that acting’s not for her. So naturally, an actor is exactly what she becomes. Carrie models tops for Warren Beatty - with and without a bra. Meanwhile, George Lucas has decided to study film. Even though no film school graduate had ever gotten a job in the industry. He quickly becomes a star at USC, determined to make his movies his way, no matter what the rules are. He works day and night on a diet of coffee and chocolate bars. He graduates just as movie attendance is cratering and Hollywood is shutting down. He meets another young cinematic firebrand, Francis Coppola, and they join forces on his first movie, THX1138. Warner Brothers hates the movie and takes it back to cut it themselves. It limps into theaters where one young film buff is left awestruck. His name is Steven Spielberg. Meanwhile Lucas dreams of a movie with heroes and villains, ray guns and spaceships, thrills and adventure beyond the stars.Support us by supporting our sponsors!Wix - Go to Wix.com and enter code YODA for 10% off any premium plan! | A torturous first day of shooting Star Wars in the Tunisian desert.

Cut to: A young George Lucas captivated and thrilled by a new gadget called “television” and the thrilling, swashbuckling serials of Flash Gordon. Later, Lucas falls for fast cars. More speeding tickets than baseball cards. Fights at home with his father over work and school and career. “I’m gonna be a millionaire before I’m 30,” he shouts at his dad. But he’s failing classes and his best hopes are for a life as an auto mechanic. Then, one fateful day he’s in his tiny Fiat turning left across traffic. That’s when a car smashes into him - an accident that nearly kills him. And an experience that will change his life forever. Support us by supporting our sponsors!
